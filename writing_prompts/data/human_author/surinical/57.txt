Crimson bursts swam behind Commander Holland’s eyes. The ship slowed, feeling more like coming out of a spin than forward acceleration.

“Johnson, what do you see?” he asked, raising from the safety pod as soon as the locks clicked. He rubbed his eyes, idly wondering on the long-term effects of this bleeding-edge tech.

“We are indeed at the site of the anomaly, 36 light years from our starting point.” The navigation officer shifted in his seat. The map showed on his screen, a short thick line followed by a long dotted one.

Holland breathed a sigh of relief, even though this drive and the ship around it had possibly been checked over more times than any other creation in human history.

“Launch the scout probes,” Holland said, standing and walking towards the captain’s chair. They were on the cusp of discovering what phenomenon produced the heat of a star but no light at all. The entire world would be waiting for their report.

“Launching bays one through six,” the head of the front gunmen called. Holland hated the military terminology and the politics behind them even more. He was before all else a scientist, honorary naval rank or no.

“Sir, scout one is unresponsive, three also, and…” the gunman said. All three of the crew in the bay scrambled around each other to hurry to their seats. “Four is picking up a massive heat signature, wait. Also, down. All scouts are down. It seems like something hit them.”

“Well, I’d rather the scouts be faulty then the life support.” Holland stood again, back complaining at all the movement. “Prepare six EVA suits. We’ll check this out the old fashion way.”

“Sir, that may be unnecessary,” the comms officer, Jacobs, said, pulling up a wavelength readout on the main bridge display. “The anomaly is directing a signal aimed right at us.” She began typing quickly.

Holland watched as the wave on the screen spiked, croaking and whispering coming through the ship speakers. It changed drastically every few seconds.

“For English, press four two nine Blue Rose,” a voice said clear as day from the speakers, followed by what sounded like cricket song.

The bridge went quiet save for the prattling transmission. Holland realized everyone was staring at him. Was this first contact? Focusing on the magnitude of a situation only weakens your ability to respond to it. Who had said that?

“Send back traditional radio comms matching the frequency,” Holland cleared his throat. “Four two nine blue rose. This is Commander Holland of the SFS Rideya. Can anyone read me?”

“It’s through, sir,” Jacobs said, voice shaking.

The rhythmic noises stopped, followed by a few sharp, rough ones and what sounded like flipping through pages.

“Human?” came from the transmission, a voice of indeterminate gender. Jacobs pointed back to Holland with a thumbs up.

He nodded. “Yes, we are humans. You are not?”

“Irrelevant,” the voice said. “To expedite the docking procedure, please refrain from responding except to answer questions. What is the planet of origin of your vessel?”

“Earth,” Holland said. “It was constructed in Quebec, Canada two years ago.”

A grunt with the inflection of a sigh came through. “The Qui share the human love of nonsensical farce. The Roshaiya do not. Your ship is not in any known registry. I will need dimensional schematics, atmospheric contents, and load bearing analysis through each ship exterior edge.”

“We can send you this information,” Holland said. “But to what end?”

“Excuse me,” the voice said. “The nature of this conversation has grown too offensive to me. Hold on.”

“I apologize for any-” Holland began.

“Yo!” a new male voice came from the speakers, including amazingly, video footage of a young pale dark haired man. “Sorry about that guy. Really hates any of the stock races. Just be glad you don’t have to look at him.” The man gestured dismissively at something offscreen.

“This is Commander Holland of the SFS Rideya. Am I correct in assuming you are a human inside the anomaly?”

“Whoa, the anomaly, that’s a sick name. Yeah, yeah,” the man said. “Man, we mostly know Earth from radio and TV stuff and can I just say, you look just like the Hogan Heroes guy. I never saw anybody that old. Did you guys really build that ship, like sci-fi style?”

“Yes,” Holland said. “You said we, are there many humans there with you?”

“Oh yeah, it varies depending on the season but they keep up at 10,000 or so.” Behind the man, Holland could make out several other humans walking in neat rows towards a pond of bluish green water. “The holiday for the Empers they have every few years is coming up so they aim for a lot to be 25 to cap out around now, yours truly included.” He nodded and smiled, touching a hand to his chest. His fingernails were strangely long.

“I’m having trouble with the terminology,” Holland said, sitting back down. “Cap out? Empers? Is that the species we were talking to earlier?”

The man laughed, scratching his long hair, “No way, Drif? He’s just a roshi AKA stick firmly up the keister. Embers are the big bosses that built the Blue Rose, the anomaly I guess. Loads of different species come and go. Cap out is when a person gets too old and is sent off to be put down.”

“So,” Holland said carefully, glancing around the bridge. “You’re telling me when people reach 25 years old, they are killed here?”

“Yep,” the man said cheerfully, typing on a screen. “Well, just humans. It’s different by stock species. Makes sense they don’t do that on Earth. Who would eat them, right? What’s it like growing old? Seems kind of gross.”

Holland stared at the young man bopping his head along to some unheard song, trying to think how to respond.

“Docking procedure initiated,” an automated voice said. The ship lurched forward, drifting to the anomaly.

The young man gave a thumbs up and the feed cut. "See you in a minute, friends."
