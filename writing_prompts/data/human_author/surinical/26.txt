The golf pencil rolled across the premium pine flooring, followed by the pamphlet map, scribbled to oblivion, swaying in the nowhere breeze carrying just a hint of meat.

“We aren’t getting out of this, are we?” Marcus leaned over the half fence separating them from yet another floor, somehow. “This will be what? The seventh set of stairs we found?”

“Maybe we accidentally went up a few floors and we’re going in circles. Up and down,” Susan offered, walking toward the unmanned cafeteria.

“How could we have accidentally gone up stairs? We would remember.” Marcus ran fingers through his hair, taking several strands with them.

“I dunno,” she said casually as she began spooning meatballs into her backpack. “We walked fifteen miles yesterday, maybe it's like a ramp, just the inclines too low for us to notice.”

“That still doesn’t explain how we walked fifteen MILES through an IKEA!”

“Oh, I’m sorry,” Susan said, flicking the sauce off her metal spoon as she pointed it. “I didn’t realize you expected me to solve this whole mystery. What happened to one problem at a time, huh? Or does that only apply when it's your problems that need priority?”

“Yeah, sure. You would say that. You know I’m probably fired, right? Phones don’t work in here and now I’ve missed the big pitch.” Marcus sighed and stepped over to the drink machine and began pouring a soda.

“Wow, even in some kind of twilight zone anomaly, you still can’t talk about anything but work. That is so much you, Marcus, and you should get water, not that sugary crap.”

“You my doctor, too? Well, guess what, babe? I don’t think my A1C is very relevant just now. The caffeine helps me think anyway. I hate water, you know that.”

“I do actually,” she said as she snapped off a flag pole, testing it as a walking stick. “And I should have seen that for the red flag it was on our first date. If I had just listened to my mother-”

“Oh, don’t bring your mother into this.” Marcus turned back the way they came.

“And where do you think you’re going?” She yelled behind him.

“I’m retracing our steps. We clearly missed something. You're the one always saying I'm bad with directions. Going deeper into this maze won’t help.”

“We decided-” she started.

“Well, change of plans! I don’t care where you go. I’m retracing my steps.”

“Marcus, don’t leave me like this,” she said, anger hardly left in her voice. “Please.”

Marcus turned and walked back to her, two day old makeup smeared on her face. She had fashioned a sweatband out of towels. “I’m sorry. You’re right. We’ll stick together and get through this.”

They embraced and kissed. An air horn blared all around them followed by a dinging bell.

Marcus pulled away, clutching her by the shoulders as confetti rained down on them.

“Whooooooooa!” a young man in a suit yodeled before appearing from behind the kitchen. He tied his hair back in a man bun as he danced out to them, followed by several cameramen.

“It was looking so close to failure at the end there folks! But I knew the dream team had it in ‘em! Yahoo!” The man playfully punched Marcus and Susan’s sides.

“What the hell is going on?” Susan yelled, craning her neck all around. “Is this some kind of game show?”

“Some kind of game show?” the man said befuddled. “This is ‘CAN YOUR MARRIAGE SURVIVE IKEA?! SURVIVAL EDITION!”

A studio audience appeared from behind furniture and plastic plants on the level below, chanting along with him.

“And we won?” Marcus asked, eyes darting between the cameras.

“Yessir! Yessir!” the man said, holding out a novelty-sized gift card as big as him. “A ten thousand dollar IKEA spending spree!”

“Oh,” Marcus said, seeing Susan matching his lackluster expression.

A woman behind the camera in a black suit gestured for both of them to smile big. “Anomaly breach resolution in progress,” she said into an earpiece. “Amnestics likely not required.”
