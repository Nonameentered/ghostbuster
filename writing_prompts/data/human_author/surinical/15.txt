Part 2:

"Disgraced disciple," the chimera purred, clutching a fleshy armrest. "I pegged you for an arrogant one, but to come back empty handed once againâ€¦ Arrogant, I can stomach. Arrogant and useless, much less so."

"I found him," Dagis said without expression, flexing his sword church behind him to fend off the pulsing vines inching toward him in this sickly organic place. "A child, he-"

"A child!? Yet he bested you, sent you scampering back? Pathetic." The goat head reached up and licked at the brownish dew gathered under a sagging section of the ceiling. Dagis managed to not gag.

"He had help," he said through a wince.

"The Sabaoth? You wouldn't be alive, little monk."

"Nothing so direct, some woman of the same plane. She taught him to make bombs."

The chimera stood with wet smacks. The strands of trailing slime from the throne reminded Dagis of pulled cheese. He did gag a little when the smell hit him, earthy and damp.

"After our last victory, only one more," the lion mouth said as the beast dragged a claw along a membranous wall, "and the scales will be tipped. We cannot risk plain fleshed fools foiling us. Take your pick of the supplicants, and do not return empty handed again."

Dagis looked at the room revealed and its rows of chambers. His sword church sped its dance. "Now we're talking."

"He's gone, I think," Gabe said, holding another banana high at the ready. 

"Now we just need to figure out where to meet that lady before he comes back." Tina dusted herself off. "Sorry about your house."

"Eh, I'll buy Mom a new one," Gabe said, picking up the ticket off the road. He looked at the maple tree looming over what was left of the quaint home.

"That's your magic face," Tina said. "What are you gonna do?"

"Forest of one tree, I think I get it. Slight variations and this tree, its acorn, could have landed anywhere. It's a potential forest that is all this one tree." He walked over and touched the bark.

"And how do we go to-" Tina started. There was no transition, one moment she was in Gabe's neighborhood and the next a forest, made up of the same tree, over and over again. The way the trunks continued on into the distance in clean ordered lines reminded her of the veterans' cemetery.

"Hello, you two," a woman in a sharp suit said, leaning on one of the trees and nibbling on half of a coconut. "How's your day going? Agent Paradise, pleased to meet you."
