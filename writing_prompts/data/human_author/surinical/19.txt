Hey! Thanks friend! BONC has 7 parts on my subreddit /r/surinical and ~a hundred others prompt responses. Another recent one there with 11 parts is Land of Fathers. 

I actually just published a book of short stories that includes longer versions of both of those, two other stories that take place in the universe of BONC and TLO, and an overstory connecting the stories relating to the TLO as well. The link is pinned in my subreddit.
