As Jose lay dying, darkness slowly crept in from the edges of his vision. He welcomed it. Jose's son started shouting for the nurse, squeezing his father's bony hand tighter. But there was no point. This was what Jose wanted. Faintly, he heard the machines by his bedside start to screech and beep. *Good*, he thought. *I'll all be over soon*.

When Jose took his final, ragged breath, blinding light burned away the darkness and illuminated the shabby little room he'd spent the last few weeks of his long, haggard life. The woman that descended from the light was an oil painting. Her armor glittered, as if dappled with sunshine. And her horse was pure titanium white, even its wings. She was divine. And, somehow, Jose knew she'd come for him.

The woman cradled Jose in her arms, and her smile split the clouds, revealing the dawn.

\*\*\*

When Jose awoke, he was laying in a field. He rolled over and pushed himself up and stopped. There was no pain. No fatigue. His hands weren't wasted and skeletal. He held them up to his face. They were dark and strong and … young.

"Good," rumbled a voice like rocks tumbling. "You're awake."

Jose turned and found a man standing in the field with him. His beard came down to his chest and was gray and braided in places. He leaned on a gnarled wooden staff and wore a cracked leather patch over one of his eyes.

"Who are you? Where am I?" Jose asked. Towers rose in the distance, nothing like the New York City skyline. These towers were gilded and spiraled and, even from this distance, hummed.

"I go by many names," said the old man. "Spearman, Lord of the Undead, The Wanderer, The One Who is Many, God of the Hanged, The One Eyed Raven God, Terrible One, The All-Father, Wednesday … but you may call me Odin."

"Oh," said Jose. "I see. I thought I'd have my life flash before my eyes, but this seems better."

"You are not dying, Jose Shadowbane. You stand outside the Halls of Valhalla."

Jose barked a laugh. "First of all, I'm no Viking. My last name's Ortiz. And second, I'm -- was Catholic. I'm supposed to be in purgatory."

Odin stumped forward. "Viking is not a race, Shadowbane. It is an identity. And not to worry. Lamb's Blood is here as well. All who fall in battle are welcome, as my children."

"Battle? Alright, I think I've heard enough. Which way is purgatory? You know what -- never mind."

Jose turned to walk away but the old man, Odin, appeared there before him. Jose turned again, and there he was.

"You are welcome here, son," said Odin. "But I will not force you. There are no slaves in Valhalla."

"Enough with the Viking stuff!" Jose shouted. "I'm not a warrior. I've never swung a sword in my life. Only paint brushes." He looked down. "And bottles."

"Not every battlefield is a literal one--" Odin stroked his beard. "--some are a great deal more … nebulous."

"Oh fuck off. I'm not doing riddles."

Odin smiled sadly. "Your battle happened every day, Shadowbane, here--" He pointed to his heart. "--and here--" He pointed to his head. "Not even the Thunderer could hope to vanquish such a foe easily. Do you understand?"

"You--you're talking about my depression?" Anger shook him clear to his marrow. "How *dare* you make light of my suffering. My pain! You know nothing! Every day I woke up and clawed my way through a calcified wall of shame and guilt and regret. Some days I couldn't eat. Couldn't move. Couldn't tell my son I loved him. I drank myself into a hole for years. I--" He was crying now. "I'm not a warrior. I'm done."

Odin nodded knowingly. "But you fought, Shadowbane. You fought a battle that could not be won, for there was no foe to slay. You fought a battle that could only be survived. There is great honor in such a feat."

Jose laughed bitterly. "Survived? I asked my son to pull the plug. I made my boy put his father down like a lame horse and I was glad. And not because of the cancer, but because I couldn't finally, finally stop fighting. I gave up. Where's the honor in that, *Odin*?"

Odin stumped closer and placed a hand on Jose's shoulder. He flinched, and Odin pulled his hand back. "Yes, you chose death. But you spared your boy the pain of watching his father waste away. You chose mercy. I do not know if I could have done the same, Shadowbane."

Jose looked up and stared into Odin's face. His one eye glittered, tearing up. Jose's shoulders slumped, and he said, "I didn't win."

"But you fought. You fought. And so, I welcome you, my son."

Jose and Odin walked through the lush grass toward the towering doors of the Shining Hall. Outside, warriors trained, sparring with sword and shield. Inside, they drank and ate at long tables stretching impossibly long. Odin told him it was time to get dressed. Jose expected chainmail or something *Lord of the Ringsy*. Instead, he was given a simple tunic and comfortable shoes. Then they walked down a corridor and stopped in front of a door.

"What's in there?" Jose asked.

"Your battleground," Odin said, and opened the door.

Inside was a circle of wooden chairs. And in each chair sat a warrior. They were of all ages, races, faces. In one of the chairs, sat a massive man with fiery red hair. He had a look in his eyes that Jose had seen in the mirror far too many times. A hollow, haggard dejection.

One of the warriors, a dark-skinned man with the warmest smile Jose had ever seen, nodded to Odin and ushered Jose inside. Jose sat in an empty chair and watched. The warriors took turns introducing themselves and speaking not about battle or glory, but about things Jose understood. The darkness. The pain. The guilt. Even Thor. After a while, the room seemed to brighten, if only a bit. It was enough.

And when it was his turn, he spoke. "Hello. My name is Jose … Shadowbane."
