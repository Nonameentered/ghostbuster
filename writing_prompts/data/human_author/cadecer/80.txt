Part 2 -- The Boy and The Liar

I arrived to the capital with my bolts of iron spider silk and my plan in mind. Enostan was the most beautiful latrine I'd ever seen. Dirt-stained marble buildings lined the uneven roads leading into and out of the heart of the empire. On said roads, sat beggars shaking their wooden bowls and corpses that'd probably starved holding out for crumbs. Rotsmiths stalked the streets, in their bird-faced masks, hauling the bodies onto their carts and off to whatever it is they do with them. They certainly don't bury them, from what I've heard.

Someone bumped into my side. Without looking, I snatched them by their collar. It was a boy, no older than a ten-year, with my coin purse in his dirty little hands. The boy stopped struggling, smiled, and said, "A thousand apologies, m'lord. I see you're new in town. Welcome to the capital."

I held out my hand, and, once the boy returned my purse, I let him go. "You're too slow," I said, helpfully. "Work on your speed."

The boy grinned. "I'll take that to heart. For a dulling I'll show you around town. The strongest wines. The darkest alleys. What d'ya say?"

I kept walking.

The boy fell in pace with me, silent, but looking up at me every few steps. He reminded me of myself at his age -- what a shame. Eventually, he said, "You here for the challenge?"

"I'm a weaver," I replied flatly.

"And my da's the minister of baths. Get off it, old man. I know a killer when I see one."

I chuckled. "Weavers can kill."

"Sure," he said, chuckling. "Well, if I was a weaver -- I'd take the throne for myself."

"And what would you do, your highness?"

The boy stopped, looked me dead in the eyes, and said, "I'd make it so me and mine would never go to bed hungry, ever again."

I asked the boy for his name and he said it was Cryer. I told him that was a fine name, thanked him for showing me around, and gave him two dullings. I thought I saw him bite on them as he ran off down the way we came.

It was still early when I finished setting up my stand in the square. The whole thing was a slap-dash affair, hammered together with pieces of rotted or half-burnt wood from collapsed storefronts, but it didn't need to last longer than a few hours. I unfurled my silks and set to stabbing them.

Emperor Enorak's armor was not forged in the fires of Pandemonium, like the taletellers would have you believe. The ink black plate was hammered together by a smith, enchanted by a sorcerer, and found a hundred years later by a soldier named Gorin. Enorak was a fellow soldier and murdered Gorin before he could put on the armor, taking it for himself.

The armor is not his source of invulnerability. It's the enchantment. The enchantment is fueled by belief. So long as the emperor believed himself invincible, the armor would not bend, would not break, would not shatter. And considering he's never lost a battle since putting on the dreadplate, convincing him otherwise was a hard sell.

But if there were another armor like it? And not just that, but one that was light, fluid, and just as tough? Rumor was that the emperor never took off his armor. Certainly had to make it hard for a man to shit. Perhaps rumor of a more flexible enchanted armor would catch his ear? But the emperor was a shrewd, calculating -- for as bloodthirsty as he was. Fortunately, I had some help.

In the square, people gathered around my little stand. Some sooty faced, others wrapped in tunics embroidered with sigils of whichever failing house they served. They all cheered and gasped as I stabbed my chest. The knife did not pierce the red silk shirt I'd put on for the demonstration. Then the crowd split and two soldiers marched up flanking a magistrate in a ragged robe and with a face as thin as a rockhound.

"Are you the weaver claiming to sell indestructible silk?" he asked, pretending not to know me.

I gave a little bow.

"Come with me. The emperor would like to see you."
