I joined Telegrammar after splitting up with Rachel. 

My therapist said I should avoid "burying myself with work." That grieving was a part of the process. What's there to grieve? He suggested I learn a new skill, maybe join a club. It was stupid, but the man had been right about everything up to this point. So, I said I would try.

Bird watching was out — my outdoor allergies would murder me in cold blood. And I do not do sports. So I Googled "Adult social clubs," and after skipping past a bunch of swinger sites, I found these online groups where people practice Morse code by sending each other messages, sort of like pen pals.

I signed up. There was no point learning alone. 

.----.

It's amazing what strangers are willing share about themselves. Maybe it's because there's not a lot of room for fluff in a telegram. Or maybe it's because they know there's someone on the other end of the wire, waiting to hear what they have to say. Whatever the reason, Telegrammar is the Live Journal of the Morse code community. 

That sort of honesty is contagious.

I never felt like Rachel believed me when I told her I loved her no matter how many times I said it. It was terrifying. So I started doing stuff for her. Making dinner and doing the dishes. Taking massage classes. Learning about her favorite reality shows. It all became too much. I'd never told anyone that before.

Then I started exchanging messages with DropMeALine13. I couldn't not tell them the truth. They were so honest with me about everything. They had broken up with someone recently too. It would have been rude not to reciprocate.

...

Researches say when you learn a new language you start hearing it more often. Thank you, Professor R. Dundant. It makes sense that what used to be background noise would turn into intelligible words if you understand what those words mean.

What I didn't know was that included Morse code.

Sometimes I'll sit on a park bench, close my eyes, and listen. Birds tweeting. Squirrels chirping. Twigs breaking. People chatting. Cars honking. There's code in the noise, dashes and dots scattered forming letters or sometimes words. 

It's like the universe is talking to me.

Two month after joining Telegrammar, I heard the first warning.

I was at work, huddled over my terminal scrambling to finish my bug reports before the rest of the QA team cut out early for Summer Friday. It was doable, it just sucked being sleep deprived. 

When I leaned back in my chair, I heard tapping on the window behind me. It was a crow. A mangy, half-molted thing with one eye scarred shut and missing a chunk of beak.

It started pecking at the glass again. Dot, dot. Dash. Dot, dash, dash, dash, dot. Dot, dot, dot. 

"It's..." I mouthed, staring at the bird. It was pecking out in Morse code!

As it continued pecking, I set my phone next to the glass and started an audio recording.

"Com—ing. Coming." I leaned back in my chair. "It's coming?" 

The crow tapped out the message two more times before flying off. 

"What the fuck?"

\---

*Animals can tell when natural disasters are coming*, I sent DropMeALine13. According to the tests on Telegrammar, I was now fluent in Morse code. *The Earth's magnetic field gets all wonky before a disaster and birds can tell*.

There was no way I made it up. She heard the audio file.

*Sure. But can birds even learn MC?*

There it is. You activated my Trap Card.

*A researcher at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology discovered that crows talk in their own form of MC. He successfully trained one to use human MC. So, yes. They can.*

She still didn't believe me.

\--

I sent the audio file to my therapist along with my research on crows. He never said he didn't believe me. That would have been the fastest way to lose his hourly rate. What he did say was, "Why is it so important I believe you?"

Because it happened! I wasn't crazy. I recorded it and everything. No, I wasn't in some bad horror movie where the hero gets gaslit until it's too late to stop the monster. I had proof!

What I said was, "Because it's true."

That wasn't good enough for him. So screw the head games, you know? There's something coming and people are too up their own asses to see the truth right in front of them. 

Not me.

..

According to the prophet Shah AlGohar Shahi, the world will end in 2023 when a great evil will awake on Earth. That's only a couple of months away. And of course, as we all know, AlGohar claimed to have learned his divine knowledge from a bird under a full moon. A night bird. And what is a crow if not a night bird?

I took a sabbatical from work to search for AlGohar in Manchester, his last known location. 

DropMeALine13 knew I was going. She didn't think it was a good idea, but she'd keep in touch during my trip. What else could she do? She didn't believe me, but supported me anyway. If only more people were like her.

I'd find out the truth, for the both of us.

\-.

I'd booked a couple of extra days on my Air BnB so I could check out Manchester proper. Lots of old buildings and cafes. It sort of looked like D.C. but more ... British? Then the day arrived. AlGohar's lived in a simple red-bricked apartment building in the south side of town. I'd called ahead, got the okay from AlGohar's assistant, and showed up five minutes early.

Someone buzzed me up, but there was no one inside the apartment. I waited in the living room for half an hour. No one came for me. 

I didn't come all this way for nothing, I thought. I had to know.

There were several closets, empty, a bathroom, and two bedrooms. The first bedroom was also empty. Nothing but walls and floor and a window overlooking the street. The second room wasn't empty.

It was full of cages. In each cage was a crow. They didn't make a peep. They just stared with those cold black eyes. 

On the floor was a book. Black feathers coated the cover completely and seemed to rustle in my grip.

Tapping. The crows started pecking at their cages in unison. *It's coming. It's coming. It's coming.*

"What's coming!" I shouted at them. "What is it!"

"Gary?"

\--.

Rachel sipped her tea as she flipped through the Necrownomicon (that's what I called the feathery book) while we sat at an outdoor cafe. I couldn't talk. I still thought of her as DropMeALine13 and she understood. She hadn't expected to follow me out to Manchester either, but when a crow tapped on her window sill in Morse code, she bought a ticket right away.

*An ancient crow god is coming?* Rachel tapped on the table. *Are you buying this?*

I started spooning more sugar to my black coffee. Rachel arched an eyebrow and I stopped before a third spoonful. I don't know why. It wasn't like we were dating.

*Yes.* I tapped back with my spoon. *I bought it. I am an owner. Signed the papers and everything.*

She smiled. *What do we do, owner man?*

*We tell the world.*

*They won't believe us.*

*You did.*
