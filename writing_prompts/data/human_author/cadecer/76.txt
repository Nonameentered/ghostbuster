"But what *is* a cult?" Brother Shrek asked his confused roommate.

"This!" Michael waived his arms around at Brother Shrek's worship chamber. Picking up one of his sacred idols from its stone pedestal (a collectible Shrek plushie), he continued, "Look at your bedroom, James!"

Brother Shrek's fellow followers crowded behind him gasped. A minor offense. He raised a hand and settled his brethren.

"My name is Shrek," Brother Shrek corrected gently. "Not James."

"You know," Michael said, "I thought interventions were just for people hooked on drugs or whatever. But this obsession is clearly destroying your life. Please know that we're doing this because we care about you."

"We?"

"Okay, come in--"

The chamber door opened and in walked Brother Shrek's parents and his ... ex-girlfriend.

"Fiona," Brother Shrek whispered.

"Angie! My name is Angie!" his ex shouted. "God! Take off that stupid hood and look me in the face, James!"

"It's okay, Angie," Michael said. "We'll reach him."

Good. Having them all here would make the conversion easier. Brother Shrek lingered on his sweet Fiona. Her fiery red hair was tied back into a tail, not braided. And she wore no dress. Merely slacks and a faded band tee. Nirvana? Bah. Brother Shrek knew the true way to salvation, to Truth. If only his beloved would listen.

Of course, he did owe them all gratitude. For without them, Brother Shrek would have remained lost. Blind. Trapped beneath layer after layer in an onion of delusion. But no longer.

Each of them took turns reading letters, begging Brother Shrek to leave his order. Each except Fiona. She stood back, silent, watching.

Finally, it was his turn to speak. "I don't understand why you're all so angry. You're the ones that told me to devote my life to a higher power."

His parents and Michael looked at each other.

"You started a cult!" shouted Fiona.

"And?"

Michael reached for Fiona, but she shrugged him away. She snatched another sacred relic from an alter and pulled the drawstring. *I'm making waffles!* said the relic.

"Waffles to feed the body," said Brother Shrek, genuflecting. "To feed the soul."

Fiona hurled the idol at him. The brethren shouted their protest, their offense. Brother Shrek caught the idol of High Disciple Donkey, careful not to drop it to the ground. A tremendous sacrilege!

"You cross a line," Brother Shrek growled. He rose, looked each of them in the eye, then said, "You come to me with 'tough love,' with your 'hard truths.'" He spread his arms. "Then let me speak *our* truth. The truth that has led me and my brethren from the darkness and into the light."

"Who are you talking about?" asked Michael.

"Us. We, the Order of Shrek."

Brother Shrek's mother started crying and his father held her, muttering comfort to her.

Fiona pointed a finger at him and shouted, "Your alone, James! There's no one here but you and your dolls."

Brother Shrek turned. There stood his brethren, hooded, whispering their sacred Truths. He stepped past Fiona and gingerly returned the idol of Donkey back on its pedestal. Then looked up to Michael and said,

"You were always in love with her. You thought I didn't know, but I did. I always did."

Next, Brother Shrek turned to his parents.

"Father, you thought I was a child of infidelity. And even though the paternity tests proved otherwise, you never could accept me, love me as your own. And you, Mother -- you thought pushing me to succeed academically would save me from ending up like you and Father. That success was the best shield. Even if it meant breaking me in the process."

Finally, Brother Shrek took his place before his beloved.

"You only started dating me because I reminded you of your first boyfriend. But I'm not him, Fiona. He is dead and I am alive."

The air was sucked out of the room. No one spoke. No one breathed.

They were ready.

Brother Shrek removed his hood and revealed his gift.

"Oh my god, what is that?" Michael asked. "What's wrong with your face?"

Brother Shrek gestured to his antennae, the mark of a true follower of the path. A chosen of the Goddess of Ogres.

"When I saw her face," said Brother Shrek. "I was lost. Like you. All of you. But now, I am a believer. It is time. Go, my brethren."

One of the hooded brothers stepped forward, invisible to uninitiated eyes, and faded into Michael's body. He cried, twisting and jerking as he dropped to the floor. Brother Shrek's parents went to him. Fiona started shouting at Brother Shrek, demanding to know what was happening.

Two more brothers stepped forward and flew into Brother Shrek's parents. They too cried as their initiation took hold.

Fiona was crying now. Brother Shrek could not bear it. He stepped toward her, hand outstretched. She did not move.

"We saw her face," he said.

"We saw her face," said Brother Shrek, rising.

"We saw her face," said Brother Shrek and Brother Shrek, rising in tandem.

"I--I believe you," stuttered Fiona. "Please. I believe you."

Brother Shrek shook his head solemnly. "Not yet. You have not seen her."

Then she did.
