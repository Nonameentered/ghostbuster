To the Head of the Radiant Fortune Adventuring Guild,

I suppose you're looking for an explanation. Well … it wasn't me that laid a dragon egg -- it was Lita, one of my hens.

But you try explaining that, that a hen laid a dragon egg, and people look at you all funny. Like they just sniffed a fresh cow pie. And it ain't help that dragons are supposed to have been dead for centuries. Wiped from the face of the Obsidian Isles by dragon hunters. Guess they should have added chickens to their list. Maybe not. Can't have bacon and eggs without eggs.

So, one day Lita lays this one black egg amongst her batch and I think it's rotten. Maybe she was sick? But when I reached for it to toss it out, Lita dang near pecked my fingers off. She clucked and puffed up big and settled herself down on top of the egg. I trusted her to know her eggs better than me, so I left her be.

A couple of weeks later, wasn't no chick breaking out of its shell. It was a little baby dragon.

I'm thinking, *Zolvun, you've lost it, you big galoot.* I run and tell my wife what's what and she don't believe me. So I drag her out there to the coop and we see the dragonling wreathed around its mother, just cozy as cozy can be.

"Is it safe?" asked my wife.

"Dunno," I said, honestly. And I didn't. A less experienced farmer may have thought it one ugly looking chick. But I've worked my lands since I was a boy, lands owned by my father, and his father before him. The Cheghairth homestead was no home to tenderfoots. I knew it was a dragon and I knew that Lita would fight beak and claw to protect its young.

I said to my wife, "Best leave em' be."

Now, I learned my letters, as you can probably tell by reading this missive. But I've never read a bestiary or books on draconic studies or anything of the sort. I'm a farmer, you understand? So I used my best judgment when caring for little Cheghairth. I named her after the farm, as it only seemed proper considering this was where she was born -- her home.

Let me be the first to say, I did not expect Cheghairth to grow so large, so fast. Yes, we fed her her fair share of meat. But we couldn't afford a cow per month for her feeding alone, so we trained her to hunt for her own food out beyond the homestead. I assumed dragons ended up fearsome things, big enough to eat an ox in a single bite if the stories held any water. But after only three months, Cheghairth filled the barn with its bulk. That's also where she slept, along with Lita.

Every day, she flew around, patrolling the property as I worked the fields with my boys. We didn't have to worry about foxes or wolves or cougars anymore. Of course, it was quite the task keeping Cheghairth from snatching up any riders or merchants that came up our way. But with a little time and patience, I managed to come up with some command words that Cheghairth understood -- the most important of them being *Heel!*

And she obeyed … most of the time.

Now, I'd like to address the obvious issue here. Your man, Kugfir, trespassed on my land. And if he was indeed on official "guild business" then he should have come and spoken with me first. But no. He sneaks onto my property alone looking to slaughter Cheghairth. I can't be held responsible for my guard dragon doing what it's trained to do. Can't blame the rain for falling. Just don't make no sense.

I understand that the adventuring guild offers some sort of bloodgold payment for the family of deceased members. Seeing as I'm a fair man, and despite your member ignoring the *clearly* posted signs warning against trespassers, I'm willing to donate ten silver pieces toward Kugfir's bloodgold. Attached to this missive you will find said silver. And, please do pass along my sincerest condolences to his family.

Regarding the Cult of Thun. I would like to be absolutely clear on the matter. I am not -- I repeat -- I AM NOT the reincarnation of the Demon Lord Rakash Thun. I don't care what those boys in robes are chanting in the cities. City talk ain't got nothing to do with me. It's not like they're welcome on my property either, mind you. They keep running over here, ignoring the signs, and getting gobbled up by Cheghairth. They don't even flinch. It's like they're running right for her mouth. I will say, Cheghairth has never been more well fed. But she is starting to grow again, and soon I'm gonna have to expand the barn.

The point is, I've got nothing to do with them folks, so instead of sending your so-called "Heroes" to murder me, why not have them go after the Cult? They're the ones screaming their heads off about bringing the end times -- skies of ash and rivers of blood and all that. I can't water my fields with blood. So, again, I request you keep your assassins away from me and mine. I'll do my part to quash the rumors of Thun's return, but really -- this is the guild's job. I grow wheat. You all stop demon worshiping gangs of fanatics.

I hope that we can find a peaceful resolution to our present impasse. And, if not, trespass at your own risk. The signs are clear. Beyond my fence, there be a dragon. You've been warned.

I Remain,

Zolvun Cheghairth, Farmer and Lord of One Dragon
