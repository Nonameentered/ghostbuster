"So ... what you in for, slick?"

Their cell was small enough that Andy's cellmate loomed over him even while laying down on the bottom bunk. From the top bunk, Andy stared up at the white concrete ceiling, praying for silence.

But Elmo Cooper did not give up. Not when the cops had the old crook surrounded after botching his final bank robbery, and he did not give up when his tight-lipped cellmate refused to give up the ghost. 

No. There was no point in sharing that particular lie. No point helping *them*. 

Before Elmo prodded further, Andy said, "Same as you, I suppose." Why had he said that? Andy rolled over and faced the wall. Someone had scratched tally marks into the concrete, scraping away paint and stone. Thirty seven scratches. Was each one a month? A year? Did he stop because he was released or because he stopped counting? Andy ran his fingers over the scratches, time pressing down on him like an iron blanket. 

"Oh ho. You a bandit too?" Elmo spat brown spittle into a paper cup. He didn't smoke but he did chew. "Pleasure to meet a proper villain."

Andy winced. He wasn't a villain. No mater what those ... those *ghouls* at the agency had arranged. Seven years. He'd worked as a traffic officer for seven years, doing his part, keeping the streets safe and orderly. Sure, it wasn't like he'd done much with his life before that. But he'd made something of himself. Not a loser. And, more than anything, Lara was proof of that. But he hadn't seen her since getting arrested. He'd probably never see her again. Who would want to marry an apparent mass murderer?

"No," Andy said. "Not a bandit or a villain. Just ... proven guilty is all."

Elmo started bouncing a rubber ball. "Proven guilty. Yeah, I hear ya, slick. Proven guilty indeed. But what are you guilty of?"

Andy swung his feet over the side of his bed and dropped down harder than he'd intended, the shock shooting up from his ankles to his shoulders. He crouched to face the old man and let him have it good. Andy knew the type. He'd grown up with two uncles like him, not to mention every gray-hair that thought himself king of the block. They were children. You had to be stern with children to get what you want.

"This is not happening," Andy said, trying to keep his voice cool and confident. "I don't care how long you've been here or what rules you think apply to everyone here, but this—" He pointed back and forth between them. "—is not happening. No more questions. No more stories about your golden days. No talking. I'm not here to make friends with some crook, okay?"

Elmo's face was like a sheet of dry, cracked leather. His cotton-white eyebrows climbed up his wrinkled forehead and he somehow managed to look down at Andy from his back. 

"Then what are you here for?" Elmo asked once more.

Andy screamed. There was no way about it. Either he answered the old man's question or he'd have to smother him with a pillow. Nothing else would shut him up. But Andy wasn't going to smother anyone with a pillow. No. He wasn't a criminal! He wasn't.

Andy sat against the wall and stared down at this prison-issued slippers.

"You heard about the murders in Red Hook?"

"Sure," Elmo replied. "Terrible thing that. Some lunatic goes on a killing spree with nothing but a pair of garden shears. Creature like that should be put down, I say."

Andy nodded, more to himself than his audience. "Well, they didn't. I was working the street where it happened. I was a traffic officer before Red Hook. It was a little after noon and I was just wrapping up my morning beat when someone started screaming. I looked up from the windshield of a Honda I was ticketing and couldn't believe what I was seeing."

"What you see?" Elmo was sitting up now, sleepy eyes focused on me. 

"A monster. An honest-to-god, straight-out-of-a-nightmare monster. It was like a cat, shaved clean, and the size of a horse. It didn't have eyes, just patches of skin where they should have been. But it had claws as long as kitchen knives. When I looked up it was ... it was eating a woman. People started freaking out. How could they not? I ran into my patrol car and started the engine. I should have helped that woman. That's what I tell myself now, after the fact. I shouldn't have been such a goddamned coward and I should have helped her. But how? Should I have bludgeoned that beast to death with a parking ticket printer?"

Elmo said nothing. I continued.

"I started my car, put into drive, and floored it. I didn't get far. Something smashed into the hood and I slammed on the brakes. I hit my head on the steering wheel and was out of it for a couple of minutes. When my eyes stopped blurring, I wished they hadn't. There were bodies everywhere. Torn, shredded, bleeding bodies laid out on the street. The creature was gone."

"What happened then?" Elmo asked, squeezing on his rubber ball with bony fingers.

"*They* showed up. The people in the black vans. The 'Agency.' Two agents in black biohazard suits ripped open the driver's side door and yanked me out of the car. They hurled me into the back of their van and threw a sack over my head. When they pulled it off, I was in an interrogation room handcuffed to a metal desk. They made it clear what was going to happen. I was getting pinned with the deaths of those people. No, there was nothing I could do to fight it. Yes, they controlled the news, the courts, the government itself. No, no one would believe. I wouldn't get the needle, they'd assured me. My job was to spend the rest of my life here, in prison, telling *their* version of the story."

No one spoke. Andy didn't want to look up from the floor. Didn't want to see what sort of expression was looking back at him. The Agency had warned Andy that people would think he was insane. That telling their version of the story was the best he could do for everyone involved, for himself. But Andy didn't kill those people. He didn't.

"Andy. Oh, Andy," Elmo said, like a parent disappointed in their unruly child. "That's not what we rehearsed."

Andy shot up to his feet. Elmo started bouncing his ball again, shaking his head solemnly. 

"N-no," Andy stuttered. "Here? You ... you people followed me ... *here*?"

"I didn't follow you, Andy. You came to my cell. And in *my* cell we play by one rule ... do as you're told. Now, why don't you tell me why you're *really* here, huh? Like a proper villain."

Andy slumped to the floor and told a story. Not his story, but *a* story. A story that belonged to him. He was not a criminal. He wasn't. Was he?
