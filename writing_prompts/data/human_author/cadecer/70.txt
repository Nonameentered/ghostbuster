Things were a bit tense in the apartment.

"Die, vampyr!" I leveled my crossbow at my roommate's chest.

"You don't have the balls!" Mel shouted back, fangs bared. Her eyes were black orbs, and her My Little Pony bathrobe hung open, revealing a ratty gray tee and New York Knicks basketball shorts. She was so -- human. But not. Mel was a vampire.

But I didn't squeeze the lever. 

My name is Carlos Del Montes, and I am a vampire hunter. My father was a vampire hunter. His father was a vampire hunter. And his father was ... a farmer, but his wife was a vampire hunter. I come from a long line of hunters, and -- like them -- I was one too.

But what they never tell you about hunting vampires, or goblins, or any monster, was that getting paid was nigh impossible. 

As the real Dr. Van Helsing once said, *The strength of the vampire is that no one will believe in him*. And he was right about that. Because in my experience, no one wanted to pay for the extermination of something they don't believe existed. Unless we're talking about reiki or energy workers, cleansing "bad vibes" for hundreds of dollars a pop. What a racket!

But that doesn't change the fact that vampires are real. And someone's gotta hunt them. So, I made due.

My mentor (dad) assigned me to New York for my final test, where I would hunt solo for one year. One year without the aid of the clan's resources, without their money. 

I had saved up some coin over the years -- birthday checks, paper routes, cleaning used stakes for the hunters back home. My nest egg was quite sizable, and based on my calculations, I could cover my rent for the entire year with a modest sum left over for food, transport, and resupplies. 

Boy, was I wrong.

"Six month's rent?" I'd asked the apartment broker, staring daggers at him. "As a deposit?"

"And first month's," he said, scrolling through his phone, looking impossibly bored. "So that's seven in total."

"This is robbery!"

He glanced up. "Listen, buddy. You've got no credit. This is how it works. So you're taking it or no?"

I took it.

The apartment was a spacious two bedroom on the border of Brooklyn and Queens, a little Polish neighborhood called Ridgewood. But what remained of the aging Polish population had been pushed out by droves of young professionals transplanted from the middle of the country. People like me. 

The apartment building looked like it was built during WWII, but the inside was all sleek cabinets, white walls, and central air. It also came with a roommate.

Mel mostly kept to herself. I'd met her the first night I moved in when she stumbled out of her room as I was on my way to brush my teeth. She grunted a greeting, said she worked nights doing over the phone customer service from her room, and that she slept during the day. 

I too worked nights, I wanted to say but didn't have the chance. 

She shuffled past me to grab what looked like a beet smoothie from the fridge and shuffled back into her room. And that was that.

My first hunts went well. Most of the vamps were freshly turned, too hungry to keep a low profile, too green to ward off my attacks. Sure, I'd come back home covered in blood sometimes, but we had a laundry room in the basement of the building. So I could wash my gore-covered clothes without having to risk stares from people at a laundromat. 

One night, I got home an hour or so before sunrise and plopped on the couch to decompress with a bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwich from the twenty-four hour Brooklyn corner stores they called bodegas. I shouldn't have been spending money on outside food, but the greasy, salty sandwiches were worth every penny.

Mel trudged out in her blue and pink bathrobe, grunted, and stopped in front of the fridge. She sniffed the air and asked, "Are you bleeding?"

*Shit!* I hadn't changed out of my work clothes. There wasn't that much blood on my shirt, just a splash from a vamp job down in Bedstuy earlier that night. Though, how could she smell it? Was her nose that strong?

"Uh, not mine," I said, and took another bite of my sandwich.

She lurched forward, leading with her nose. "I know. What did you say you do for work?"

"I didn't," I said around a mouthful of cheesy eggs.

She took another step toward me, her camouflage crocs rubbing against the fake hardwood. 

"It smells like ... vampire blood."

I froze. But instincts took over, and slid my right hand -- which was out of view to her -- down to my thigh cargo pocket, reaching for my garlic bombs.

"I don't know what you're talking about," I said, calmly. "Vampires aren't real."

Maybe that was the wrong thing to say to her. Or the right, because all pretenses were done. Mel's eyes went pitch black, she snarled, baring her fangs, and leapt at me. I rolled forward, came back up to my feet, and flung the garlic bomb at her. The little rubber pouch burst; she and the couch were dusted with concentrated garlic power. Her scream threatened to burst my ear drums, but all I could think of was how much it was going to cost me to make a new one.

While she wiped away the powder with her bathrobe, I made for my duffel bag of gear which was still by the door. As I turned, crossbow at the ready, Mel was already coming at me. But at the sight of the silver tipped crossbow, she stopped.

"Die, vampyr!" I shouted.

"You don't have the balls," she replied.

My fingers rested over the lever. One squeeze and this vampire was done. Dead. Gone. And I was on the lease with her. Which meant if she died, I was responsible for the rent until a new roommate could take her place. No. I'd make due. I'd have to find a job of some sort to help cover the rent. I'd already blown through a quarter of my savings -- and I'd only been in been in New York for a months--

Something chimed. An alarm. 

Mel cursed softly, reached into her bathrobe, and glared at her phone. Her eyes returned to their normal not black orbs and her shoulders slumped. "Look," she said, "I have to get back to work. Are you gonna try to kill me?"

"Try? I *can* kill you, vampire."

She groaned. "Ugh, yes, yes. Big bad hunter. I'm sooo scared. Are you gonna go for it or not? My break is almost over and I get paid hourly, dude. I gotta clock back in."

"You really do work customer service?"

"How do you think I pay rent?"

I lowered the crossbow, but didn't remove my fingers from the lever. "Are you going to seek vengeance for your kin?"

"Kin? Dude, I'm an only child. I don't care about other vamps. I care if you're gonna bust into my room and stake me while I'm sleeping. God -- I told Alex I needed to interview potential roommates before he filled the room. But did he even try to work with my schedule? No."

"He's the worst!" I added. "He asked me for six month's rent as a deposit. Six! You know I Googled that afterward and learned the limit in New York is two. Two! The prick."

"Sometimes I wanna -- drain him," she said at the same time I said, "stake him."

I chuckled and she smiled. 

"Truce?" she asked. 

"Uh -- where do you get your blood?"

"Blood bank. There's a guy that bottles them for gummers."

"Gummers?"

"Vamps that don't bite humans -- to feed. Self defense is another thing. So--" She pointed to her phone. "--truuuce?"

There was a lot I needed to learn. And maybe, Mel could teach me. That didn't mean I was gonna drop my guard. But, I took my fingers off the lever. 

"Truce."
