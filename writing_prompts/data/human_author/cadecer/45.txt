The country of Tempest, a pocket of towns and villages surrounded by powerful nations on all sides, is a realm famous for wizards. Eartherspeakers who restore the soil after harvest, Windbreakers who sooth the storms that would otherwise break Tempest, and even the Arch Wizards who hide away in their towers conducting arcane research have left Tempest to serve the surrounding nations as advisors, generals, or, following their own ambitions, wander the Nine Realms freely. Of course, the wisest and strongest was not a human, but a familiar -- a cat called Chomchom who in his time became both an Arch Wizard and Hero. This is the tale of how he died.

North of Tempest, in the fallen nation of Kerizad, rests the Gate of Infernity. The portal spews forth demons from the underworld without rest. The Arch Wizard Senilus spent two centuries studying the Gate and how to seal it for good. On the precipice of a great breakthrough, an assassin's blade took his life. But the Arch Wizard's work did not die with him.

Chomchom padded through dusty corridors, ignoring the sickly sweet scent of death in the air. Boko'Haran's ziggurat not only worshiped death, it seemed to draw necrotic power on all its own.

"I don't think he's home. Maybe we should head back to town, ask around some more?"

Rolan, the human, did not whisper despite Chomchom's *clear* instructions to keep quiet. Did the man not have ears? Chomchom switched his tail in annoyance.

"Silence, human," Chomchom hissed. "The demon is here."

Boko'Haran must of been aware of their presence. The wards lining the stone walls, invisible to those without power, tripped the moment they fought off a pack of ghouls patrolling the corridors.

Boko'Haran did not take Senilus' life. But as an agent of the Demon King, he most certainly knew who did. He had to. And if Chomchom didn't reach the heart of the Ziggurat in time, the wretched demon would finish his ritual and portal back to Kerizard, out of Chomchom's reach. No, there was no room for faliure, Chomchom reminded himself. The demons must pay.

Ghouls, Skelimen, and Dark Knights came at the pair in waves. Rolan had started out as a conniving, honorless investigator tasked with finding Senilus' murderer. He was still conniving and honorless, but now he wielded Tenubat -- the sword of light. If it weren't for Chomchom's lack of thumbs, he would have wielded the sword himself. But even an Arch Wizard can't do everything.

The undead did not cower before the sword, but they most certainly fell. And those that managed to slip past Rolan did not go far. Crimson runes swirled around the Chomchom, one by one shooting a lance of flames bright enough and hot enough to vaporize flesh and turn bone to ash. Darkness itself receded in their presence.

They reached a tall double pair of black doors, carved with humans suffering torture under demons. Chomchom sniffed the air, padding closer to the doors.

"The ritual is nearly complete," he said. "We must hurry. Remember, do not kill Boko'Haran. I need him alive."

"If he's gonna kill one of us, I won't hesitate to cut him down," Rolan said.

The hairs rose along Chomchom's back. Such insolence!

"You *will* obey, human!" Chomchom snapped. "Obey or stay outside."

Rolan knelt before Chomchom and pulled a tuft of herbs from a pouch on his belt. Before Chomchom could jump away, Rolan waved the herbs in Chomchom's face. He was suddenly aware of being on his back, pawing at nothing, a hand rubbing his belly.

"I know you miss your master," Rolan said. "We'll find his killer, I promise. But not if we're dead, okay?"

Chomchom snapped out of his stupor. Accursed nip leaves! Though, he did feel less tense. All the better for manipulating the power of creation.

"Very well, human," Chomchom said. "Let us go."

The chamber reeked of dark magic. Lamps burned green from iron cages, washing the vaulted chamber in nauseous glow. Rolan's hands trembled around the hilt of Tenubat. Chomchom most certainly did not tremble. An arch wizard did no such thing.

Hooded creatures -- not humans -- surrounded a dais, droning in what must have been Infernal. Power leaked from them like from a cracked mug and flowed to the figure atop the dais. Boko-Haran. Though a lesser demon, his power was not in question. Crimson eyes and hair, a single horn curling up from his forehead, skin as dark as dusk, he worked the power in his clawed hands like a potter would clay.

"Handle the cultits," said Chomchom, preparing a string of spells. "I'll lock down Haran."

Rolan took off at a run, Tenubat glowing brighter than a noon sun. The sword of light did not harm humans. It was a gift made by Tenoba, godess of the dawn, to protect humanity from the forces of darkness. So when Rolan slashed through the first cultist, no blood was drawn. Instead, whatever evil had possessed the human smoked out of eyes and ears, and the cultist fell unconscious.

"Stop them!" Boko'Haran screamed.

Skelimen, apparently baked into the walls, burst free in sprays of stone and dust and descended upon Rolan, rusted swords raised.

The human could handle himself, Chomchom assured himself. That left Haran.

"Boko'Haran!" Chomchom shouted. "I have business with you!"

The demon laughed, like old leather cracking.

"Ah, the familiar," he hissed. "I see you've made it this far. And you've even kept your little hat. Adorable."

Runes surrounded Chomchom, swirling shapes glowing brighter than phosflares, each one connecting to the next, bringing order to chaos. The power of Eternus was not simply magic. It was creation. Life. How would a demon who feeds upon death handle such a power?

Chomchom released his spell. A magic circle appeared beneath Boko'Haran, spinning lazily. Chains sprouted from the edges and wrapped the demon from ankle to neck. But the foul energies swirling around the demon like mist did not dissipate.

The demon grinned, flashing wicked fangs. "You lose."

The chains shattered. Boko'Haran raised a claw and pointed at Chomchom.

Everything went dark.
