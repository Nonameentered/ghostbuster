"Something's bothering me about this," said Sarah. She squared the stack of resumes on her desk. Mike's was on top. "Isn't this the guy that kicked you to the curb?"

Some people could make friends at work, actual friends. The kind of friends you end up getting really close with. The kind you invite over for the the holidays or ask to join your bridal party or to attend your kid's graduation. The types of friends that are normal and boring and emotionally stable. Blegh. No thank you.

But, Sarah is the same kind of fucked up as me, so we bonded immediately during my first week at Shavr (the direct to consumer razor company looking to disrupt the razor world and slowly drive me insane). We'd take lunch together and laugh over which dive bars we'd been kicked out of or how many of our family members went to rehab or where we slept between housing situations. There were no secrets between she and I, except for the stuff we tell no one.

"I believe his exact words were, 'Never darken my door again,'" I said and took a punctuating sip from my *World's Best Punching Bag* coffee mug -- a gift from Sarah for my year anniversary at Shavr. "But that's old news, boss-lady."

"First," Sarah said holding up two fingers, "don't call me boss-lady. Overlord Reynolds is my official title. And second, old news is still news. That's not team player behavior. You know the job is hard enough. Why would I want some selfish scuzz-bag watching my back during peak call hours?"

The words I wanted to say got into a fifty-car pile up in the back of my throat. Hours spent rehearsing my pitch alone in my bedroom all went out the window. Just say the truth, I prodded myself. Speak the freaking the words.

"Mike..." I reached for my coffee and missed the handle. My hands were shaking. I snatched them off the table before Sarah could notice. She didn't  need to see me all trembling. "I'm trying to make *amends* to Mike."

My heart was slamming against the inside of my chest like a jackhammer. I  could feel my pulse in my ears. There was no taking back the word.

Sarah sat and watched me for a long, silent moment. Her face flickered through different expressions, intrigue, confusion, wonder, and finally, understanding. Her mouth parted a little and her eyes narrowed.

"No shit," she said, finally. "You? Sober?"

"Yeah."

If the student loan company hadn't put a lien on my bank account, I maybe possibly would have run out of Sarah's tiny office, out of the building, and out of town and never looked back. The way she looked at me, it wasn't judgment. It was worse. Sarah looked disappointed with me.

"I'll still be your happy hour buddy," I said. "I'll just be drinking mocktails."

She coughed a small laugh and nodded slowly, smiling. Her eyes did not smile with her, but she looked like she was trying.

"Okay," she said. "So you're trying to get this Mike hired onto the company as part of your amends stuff. Is that the gist of it?"

A stab of panic cut through my guts. She wasn't on board at all. Not after telling her my real reason for all this. But there was no turning back. Not anymore.

"Yeah," I said. "But it's not *gist* that." I waited for a laugh and she did not oblige, so I continued. "He's got over five years on-phone experience. He was promoted to team lead after a year. And if wasn't for ZipZop going belly up, he'd probably would have kept working his way up the ladder. And..."

The air left my lungs and I suddenly very much wanted a beer and a shot and another beer. My sponsor was going to get one hell of a call during my lunch break.

"And," I continued, "I stole from Mike. Money. It was during his New Years party. I was drunk, and I found a safe in his bedroom closet. You know me and safes. I set to it. Belly to carpet, I had my ear pressed to the little metal door and spun that shit around, click clack clack, and all of a sudden... kerchunk. The lock opened. Mike had nearly five thousand dollars saved up in that safe. And he knows I did it. I never admitted, but he knows. So, I can't blame for kicking me to the curb. But now, I want to make it right. So I called him and told him about the money. Apologized. Offered a payment plan to pay him back for the five G. Asked how I could make it right. And do you know what he said?"

Sarah shook her head solemnly. She looked like she was hearing someone's last rights.

"'Get me a job and I'll call it even.' That's what he said. And so, here we are."

"Here we are," Sarah echoed.

After moment of silence, not wholly long enough to get uncomfortable but not short enough to avoid panic from starting to tingle up the base of my spine, Sarah said, "Okay. First, we split the recruitment bonus. Second, he's your friend. Not mine. Third, I'm holding you to your mocktail promise. I'm not doing happy hour alone, not with these unsweetened vanilla wafers. Understand? What are you smiling about?"

"Nothing," I lied. Because one thing I don't tell people is when I feel hopeful.

Not yet, at least.
