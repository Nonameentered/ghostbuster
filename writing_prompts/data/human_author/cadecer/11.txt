Every day, dozens of people get into accidents all over Los Angeles. One time, I was driving up the 405 in my old two-door Civic. When I merged into the left lane, the semi rumbling up behind me didn't see me and smashed the crap out of my car as we were both doing 70+ miles per hour. Miraculously, I was fine. My car was less than fine. That's when I learned that California has emergency vehicles cruise up and down highways at all hours in case of accidents. We happened to live off the 405.

When I called 911, two squad cars, an ambulance, and a tow truck all showed up within minutes. Sarah, being a RN, had no qualms about pulling the bloodied but alive driver from his seat. She split her attention between keeping the young Latino man's neck straight and ordering me around.

I wasn't freaking out, per se. Okay, okay. I don't like blood. Maybe I've been known to faint at the sight of it. This poor guy looked like someone dropped a bucket of the stuff on his head during prom. You could understand my reluctance to even look at him. So I just closed my eyes, held by breath, and grabbed him by the feet as Sarah carried him by the shoulders out to the sidewalk. I only wobbled twice the short walk over.

Each half of the black hatchback that had collided with Sarah had kept rolling up the street for a bit after the initial impact, like two motorcycles. The halves crashed into parked cars on either side of the street, but didn't blow up or anything. One would think cutting a car in half would blow it up, but nope.

When the first siren blared in the distance, we'd already pulled the driver out and set him down on the sidewalk a safe distance from the car. Then, Sarah grabbed me by the wrist and pulled us back into our apartment.

Inside our two-bedroom stucco apartment, Sarah ran to the bedroom and I could hear her start changing. I pressed my back against the front door and ignored the growing sirens. A small, distant part of me didn't believe this was happening. I closed my eyes. When I opened them, Sarah would walk out dressed. We'd squash the argument over my accidental purchase and drive over to my brother's house. We'd eat and laugh and politely ignore his fiance's binge drinking. Once Sarah had enough—she always tapped first when visiting my family and I can't blame her—she'd covertly squeeze my thigh twice under the table, and I'd know to start making the motions to depart. We'd be at their wedding. And, we'd be there when my brother, inevitably, gets divorced.

I opened my eyes and Sarah was standing by the stairs in her tiger-print bathrobe.

"We need to talk," she said.

"Yeah." Sirens blared outside our apartment, just on the other side of the door. "We do."

She sat on our patched-up Franken-sofa, kicked up her matching fuzzy slippers on the coffee table, and sighed.

"Okay, so," she started, rubbing her temples. "Ah, dammit. I wasn't expecting this so—"

"Is it Magic or is it Robots?" I asked, pronouncing both words so she could hear the capitalization. I didn't move from the door. "It's gotta be one of those two. And I count aliens with robots. Interdimensional beings can go either way. We'll cross that road if we get to it."

She started laughing, cackling, rolling on the couch. I waited. She'd let me in on the joke soon enough. Once her mirth had settled long enough for her to wipe tears from her face, she looked up at me and beamed.

I've seen her smile before. Seen her happy. The last time I saw her like this, it was when she graduated from her RN program. On stage receiving a diploma from the dean, she smiled out to me in the crowd. It was one of those smiles that looked like they were on the verge of tears. She'd worked a day job while attending classes and graduated third in her class (which she considered a victory). She was invincible that day.

Here, in our living room, she looked at me with that same smile and I was the one suddenly rubbing at my eyes.

"What's that all about, huh?" I asked.

"We, huh," she said, wiping away her own tears. "We'll cross that road."

"Are you interdimensional?"

She shook her head. "Man, that'd be way cooler. Sadly, no. I'm from this universe. To answer your brilliantly succinct question, I'm Magic."

If this were the sort of universe where steam spurted out of your ears from excitement, two jets of vapor would have exploded out of the sides of my head. Instead, I sort of curled into a Smeagol hunch and bombarded my girlfriend with too many questions.

Do you have mana? Can you talk to elemental spirits? Are you summoner? Do you have reinforcement magic? Are you a wizard? Can I be a wizard?

But one question cut through the rest.

"Why did we leave the scene of an accident?"

Her amused expression sank into her serious face. "Do you want to explain what happened to the police? Because I know why this happened and I'm pretty sure if I tried, they'd throw me in a padded room. We're not really going to argue about this, are we, Mark? Oh, god. Mark!"

"What!"

"I know that look on your face. Please, just sit down and let's go through this."

I did and we did. We decided that no, there was no way to explain what happened without bringing down the law on our heads. We also agreed that as long as the driver was safe, then that was what was important. His insurance would take care of the costs. Hell, they may even chalk up the accident to some factory defect on his hatchback. Why else would a car just split in half like that?

What we didn't agree with was what happened next.

"Sarah, I need to know."

"No," she said, arms crossed. "You really don't. It's enough to know this much, trust me. Okay? It's not like I'm some superhero hiding a double life. Technically, this is an affliction. A disease!"

"And shouldn't I know if my wi—my, you have a life threatening condition?"

"Well, technically," she said, "it was a life saving condition just then."

Fine. If she didn't want to tell me, then she didn't want to tell me. Not like I could pry the answer out of her if I wanted to. I checked my phone. It was already past ten PM. I sucked my teeth and headed toward the kitchen to make a call.

If I couldn't learn exactly why my girlfriend seems to be immune to cars, then at least I could explain to my brother why we'd missed his big engagement party.
