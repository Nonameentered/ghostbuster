"You call that a waylay?" I said, and rolled my right shoulder to work out the lingering soreness.

It wasn't just sore. It had been dislocated more times than seemed proper for a princess to experience. Of course, it wasn't like the Grimjaw Gang knew of my prestigious lineage.

"You're trained," said the scarless man with the blunted dagger in his hand.

"Indeed. Perhaps you're not completely hopeless. What gave me away?"

"You move like a fencer," he said. "And you always cover your blind spots. You've got defenses meant to hinder an assassin's blade."

I flipped my practice dagger in a reverse grip and crouched low. Now I was in a loose stance, swaying like a metronome, and balanced on the balls of my feet -- a rogue's stance, like that of a Grimjaw. I lunged at the rookie, and I connected with his belly.

"I am the left hand of Grimjaw," I told him. "Remember that, rookie. I have it in my power to make you … or break you. And don't try to bribe your way up the ranks -- you couldn't afford me. Now come."

I dropped into a rogue's stance once more.

"No," he said, and sheathed his practice dagger. "I appreciate the training and all, but I'm no highwayman. I know my place."

"Quitter," I said. "No. Worse. Coward. Perhaps you misheard me. I'm the left hand of Silus Grimjaw himself. The bandit king of Sen Jacobin? We're not talking about mere highway robbery. I can get you in on jobs that'll change your stars. Wealth beyond your wildest dreams. Power. Respect. All you have to do is prove yourself. So come at me."

"Please," he said, "I am grateful for the training. But I know my place. Are you thirsty? You've broken quite a sweat. And the sun has been quite vicious. Shall I fetch you something to drink?"

"Uh…" It wasn't until he mentioned it that I felt how sweaty my clothes had become. And my throat was indeed quite parched. "Are you carrying any watered wine?"

He fetched a sack from a saddlebag on a horse that was almost a twin to the thoroughbred on which I'd learned to ride during my youth at the palace.

"Thank you -- for the drink."

"My pleasure."

"Ah! I don't understand you, rookie. Every initiate I've had to babysit, they're drooling for the chance to raid with Grimjaw. They think themselves a prince to the bandit king. Nearly bursting at the seams with ambition -- not that you have any."

"Not so," he said. "Just because I don't want to slit throats or open bellies, doesn't mean I don't have dreams or goals. And stop calling me rookie, or initiate, or any sort of demeaning title. My name is Leto."

"Ah hah!" So that was it. "You want to infiltrate the Emperor's court. To trade in whispers and secrets? I understand. I can talk to Lord Krediq. Maybe get you into some snazzy silks?"

"No," he said. "I know my place. No silks. How's the wine?"

I told him that the rice wine was the most refreshing I'd ever tasted.

He asked me when I had decided to join up with Grimjaw, and if I'd been running away from something -- or someone. He asked about my family, and I told him that the price for joining the Grimjaw Gang was one's past. That all I cared about was the here and now. Second only to my future as the richest women in the empire.

He asked me if I liked sweetbread, and when I said that I did, he fetched me a roll from his saddlebag, and tore it in two, for us to enjoy.

I bit into my bread, sipped my wine, and ate with delight. The bread sparked an idea.

"You want to run a front," I said, knowingly. "Perhaps a tavern where you can serve wine and bread to locals. Gather information. Clean our money. I could help you with that. Get you enough start up coin to purchase a storefront. And you could keep the profits, of course. You'll be the one doing all the hard work."

"Thank you," he said, with a smile. "But no. Would you like to go for a ride?"

We rode out of the city together, onto the King's road. It felt good to breath fresh air after sweating all day in the city. We found our way to a little homestead and hitched our horses to a post. We sat under a willow, shaded from the sun. It was warm, but not humid, and the late-summer breeze swayed the branches drooping around us.

I told Leto about my first year in the gang, of how we used to fight over jobs and how Grimjaw would whip the losers in front of everyone. I told him of the bad-old-days, back when the bluecloaks were cracking down on crime, and how King Tarius had taken to planting thieves' heads on pikes outside the city walls.

He told me of his parents, who were both killed during the Red Plague, and who had left him a title (which title he did not say). He told me of his work, translating ancient texts, a passion he'd never would have had the time had he taken up the title and the arranged marriage that came with it, and of how much joy filled his heart whenever he discovered some new scroll or tome to decipher. He told me he shared his discoveries with the physikers when they revealed something to do with medicine, which helped save lives.

I saw no want, no desire unfulfilled in his life, no burning ambition scorching away at his heart, except...

"I see now your reason for joining the gang," I told him. "Noble duties would put quite the hamper on a scholar's studies. But you've left that all behind, and I won't pry. You seem to have everything you need. Except for someone to share it with. I can get you a wife -- a lady, by title only. Together, you can travel the territories under the perfect cover, spying for foreign artifacts. Yes, that is your goal..."

"Really, I'm fine. I know my place," he said.

We rode back to the city, stabled our horses, and slid into the safehouse.

"You vex me," I told him. "The Grimjaw Gang is no place for some -- content."

"And yet, here I am."

"Then what am I to *do* with you? We are to spend the summer training."

He thought for a moment. Then he grabbed a scroll from his little desk. "Can you read ancient Valtruvian?"

"You intent to make me your apprentice?"

"No. It's more something for you to do while I prepare our dinner."

I read through the scroll and jotted some loose notes on parchment, making sure to include any mentions of medicine. After dinner, I smoked a pipe while he served us spiced tea. I spent the night in the den downstairs.

It wasn't that he lacked ambition. It was that he knew exactly how to channel it, never working against anyone. Always in partnership. While he worked on his translations, I kept guard, watching for bluecloaks or imperial spies. On days he'd been reading for a long time, he let me rub his neck and shoulders. My hands were quite strong.

Shortly before his initiate training was over, I packed my clothes and daggers, brought them upstairs, and into his bedroom, and Leto's bed.

I watched him snore this morning. I stared at the crows feet tracking out from the corners of his eyes. The harvest sun weakly trickled through the curtains and dappled his brown cheeks, and he opened his eyes and stared at me, and he smiled.

"I know we're supposed to have forgotten our pasts," he said. "But I've never met a thief like you. You're so -- regal. Who *are* you?"

I thought for a moment. I snuggled my head into his shoulder.

"I was once a princess -- meant to marry a man I never knew." I smiled up at him. "But now, I know my place."
