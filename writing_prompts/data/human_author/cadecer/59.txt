It was always something with Dave.

The guy seemed chill enough when I first moved into our apartment. The realtor didn't say why the previous tenant moved out, and I didn't ask. The room was $800, utilities included, and for one of those recently-built gentrification towers in the middle of Brooklyn, it was rent worth killing for.

For work, he delivered (and smoked) weed on his skateboard. I didn't mind. I didn't partake, personally -- the stuff made me paranoid as all hell; and considering pot had recently been legalized, I wasn't judging. But having a professional stoner roommate when you weren't a stoner caused more problems than not.

Dave was always watching movies out in the living room at full blast (so much so I started wearing ear plugs to sleep) and the apartment reeked of incense and Ozium spray. Every day, he was trying some new recipe he found on TikTok, fusion this and flambe that, usually ending with him burning something because he forgot he was cooking. But he paid his rent on time, always cleaned up after himself (including the bathroom, such a hero), and was generally a chill dude.

But sometimes he'd freak out. Claimed he saw ghosts or "apparitions," especially when he was "barbecued." An uncle of mine developed full blown schizophrenia from smoking pot when I was a kid. The doctor's had said that pot supposedly speeds up the development of schizophrenia in certain people, that it's not the pot that causes the condition, rather it's usually a pre-existing thing.

So when Dave slammed open my bedroom door one night, demanding to know whether he was still alive, I cut him a lot of slack -- by not hurling the machete I keep under my mattress at his face (what? Home invasions happen and I'm not one to get caught unarmed. Also, I don't do guns).

I usually don't remember my dreams, but that night I could recall it exactly. It was the one where I was sprinting through a warehouse while a horde of fast zombies chased after me. I ran and ran, jumping up boxes like Super Mario, climbing up scaffolding as the zombies piled atop each other on the warehouse floor, slowly growing into a flesh-eating tower until a bloody claw was tugging at my shirt, and then -- WHAM. Dave slams open my door.

So, truly, it was a miracle I didn't hurl my machete at him. Dazed, confused, still half-asleep, I pulled the earplugs out and groaned, "What the hell?"

"Lou, am I *alive*?" he shouted.

"You look pretty alive to me, Dave."

"Oh, good," he said. "So the dead thing in the living-room just looks exactly like me."

A cloud of pot smoke curled into my room and skunked my nostrils. I groaned to my feet and flicked on my bedroom lights. Blinking the sleep from my eyes, I got a good look at Dave. He looked like shit. Pale, sweaty, like he'd just broken a fever. His eyes were bloodshot and his hands were trembling. In one of them he held a lit joint.

"Okay, okay," I said. "First of all, don't get smoke in my room. Come on, let's go."

He led me to the living room, gibbering about ghosts and clones and other possible explanations for the "Other Dave." All the lights in the apartment were on. As we passed the kitchen, the stink of burnt something hung in the air. Another failed culinary experiment probably. The clock on the stove read *2:22* and I muttered a curse under my breath. *I probably would have woken up from my nightmare anyway*, I told myself. *I would have gotten up for a drink of water. This is just a detour, then I go right back to bed.*

Dave walked into the living room and faced the couch, worrying his forehead with the heel of his palm. I couldn't see the couch; the fridge blocked my view. He looked seriously distressed. I hesitated, stopping just out of view of the rest of the living room, of the couch. Then I groaned at myself for getting caught up in Dave's stoner antics.

I marched into the living room â€¦ and immediately lost my shit.

There, on the couch, was Dave. But not Dave, because he was standing right next to me, smoking down his joint as he pulled another one out of a silver cigarette case. The Dave on the couch was dressed exactly like Alive Dave, torn jeans, yellow Nirvana t-shirt with Pearl Jam written over a faded print of Kurt Cobain and company, ratty black Chuck Taylors, and even the same amount of stubble on their identical faces. But Dead Dave was slumped over, bluish blood pouring from his eyes, nose, and ears.

"What the fuck!"

"Right? Big time tear in the fabric of reality," Dave said, sparking another joint to life. "We're talking Bernstein--Berenstain shit. Except Berenstain's dead, Lou. Berenstain's dead."

I slumped back against the wall, my knees feeling like Jell-O. It wasn't my first time seeing a dead body. Where I grew up, you sort of ran into them from time to time, whether from an over-dose or just plain old bad luck. But having an alive version of the dead person standing beside you, pitching you possible explanations to the nucking futz situation at hand -- well, it really threw me for a loop.

"We gotta get rid of it," I whispered.

"What?"

"We've ... got to get rid of -- you?" I said, still staring at the mess on the couch. "We'll go to jail, we can go to jail. This is a dead body, Dave. I don't care where it came from, there is a dead body on our couch and we need to get rid of it. Now!"

Dave starting laughing, which turned into a crunchy cough. "Shit, Lou. I didn't take you for a mafioso."

I whipped around and glared at him. "I'm not."

He raised his hands up in surrender. "Didn't say you were man. Just, I don't know. My first reaction wasn't to toss me into the East River, you know? This is fucked, but I wanna find out what *kind* of fucked."

"How are you not freaked out?" I pointed at the couch, careful not to look at it again. Not until it was necessary. "That is you. You, bleeding blue like some kind of Avatar, on *our* couch."

"Ooh, that's good," Dave said, pulling out his phone and typing something. "You think maybe its an alien? Like a clone or something? Maybe it had a built in expiration and it triggered early. Question is -- what information were they looking for?"

"Oh my god," I said, pinching the bridge of my nose. "We're going to jail. We are going to jail."

"Why?" Dave asked, with a tone of genuine confusion. "I'm not dead. That dude is. And if they the cops try to claim I was murdered, well, good luck prosecuting that case with me on the stand. 'Yeah, your honor, I plead innocent on the grounds that I am alive and my doppelganger is the one that ate it. I rest my case.'"

It wasn't like my life was perfect at the time. I'd worked hard to get out of Jersey, to get away from my family. I eked out a college degree (taking on a life-time of student loans in the process), moved to New York, got a decent job at an insurance company adjusting life insurance claims. I paid my rent, my bills, my loans. I played kickball on the weekends. I was doing it right, the whole life thing. And then this.

I wouldn't go to jail. I wouldn't end up like the rest of my family.

But there was only one person I knew that could get me, us, get out of this situation. And it was the last person I ever wanted to talk to, ever. But there was no choice.

I scrolled through my contact list, found his number, and dialed.

"Woah," Dave said. "You're not really calling the cops, are you?"

"No."

The call connected. A heavy breath blew into the receiver on the other line. I wanted to hang up, change my number, hurl my phone into the river. Instead, I said, "Hey, uncle Rico. I'm in trouble."

More breathing. Dave just stared at me, puffing at his joint. The lights in the living room seemed brighter and the smell of blood grew thicker and thicker. I was sweating.

A deep, gravely voice, like shaking a bucket full of stones, said in a thick, Jersey accent, "I'm on my way."
