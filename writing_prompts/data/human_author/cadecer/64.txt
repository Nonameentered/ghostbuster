There were plenty of weirdos at the Ridgewood Public Library, myself included.

The sand-colored building sat on the border between Brooklyn and Queens in the heart of the neighborhood. It wasn't terribly big. So part of my job was reaching out to larger branches to order books for guests with eclectic reading requests. Another part, the largest part really, was shelving.

Person-to-person interactions had been cut down thanks to the digital return slot outside the library. Most days, the staff (me) had to turn people away trying to return their books at the welcome desk, directing them to the return slot. It was like working at Wally's Vid-E-o all over again. But that was back in college, when instead of majoring in pre-med or computer science or marketing, I decided to worry my parents.

*Librarian?* My father had said over the phone when I broke the news. *You're taking out loans so you can become a librarian? I don't know, kiddo. In this economy?*

Well, history has shown that the "economy" has never been friendly to spontaneously sprouting intergenerational wealth. If my parents wanted me to be some hedge-fund millionaire, they should have been born rich. But I didn't say that.

*Yeah, dad. I love books and I want to be involved in the community. Don't worry, there's a loan forgiveness program for librarians. I'll be fine.*

They meant well, I know. If I had a kid, I'd want them to be financially secure too. But there's more to life than security. There's books, for example.

And in front of me was a cart stacked with them, fresh from the return box. Plenty of romance novels, some Stephen King, volumes of manga and graphic novels, the random classic with the mostly black covers Penguin liked to use. I didn't care what people read, so long as they read anything at all.

Virginia, the head librarian and my trainer, had said that Ridgewood was on the border of all things. That all sorts came to this library. That apparently included witches.

That's what I called them. I thought they were goths or Wiccans, openly walking around town wearing pointed black hats and wrapped in black shawls. There were also wizards. People in wide-brimmed hats and brilliant robes dotted with stars or crescent moons. I wasn't sure if there was a LARPing scene in Ridgewood, but if there was -- these folks were ready.

The odd part was, they always left with thick tomes under their arms or sticking out of their bags, but I never saw them approach the checkout station. The alarm never went off, so it wasn't like they were just walking out with the books. They had to have checked them out. 

It didn't bother me, per se. But I was a librarian (in training). These books were my charge, my responsibility. And so were the people who read them. If I was going to do my job, I needed to know what was up.

When I asked Virginia about it, she'd told me I probably missed them checking out the books. That I couldn't see everything all at once. Any follow up question was met with, "Don't you have books to shelve?"

I did, of course. Always.

But that didn't mean I couldn't do a little snooping. I pushed my cart, slipping a battered copy of *A Deadly Dalliance* back into the romance section, eyes locked on a gray-beard in a purple robe run-walking to the back of the library.

That was odd. 

The only thing back there was a storage room. The bathrooms were downstairs, along with the back exit. I followed him.

With my cart parked in front of a stack of encyclopedias, I pretended to scan the titles, keeping the old man at the edge of my vision. He stood before the locked storage room door, rummaging through his battered leather bag. After a muttering a couple of well-worn curses ( I think I heard him say "dang-fangled"?) he pulled out a black card and tapped it against the door. It opened. 

I was moving before my mind caught up. As the wizard walked through the door, I was hot on his heels. So much so, I bumped into him. 

"Excuse me!" he said, in a deep, imperious voice.

"So sorry! I--"

But whatever apology I was going to say was stolen by a gasp. The storage room wasn't the storage room. It was a massive chamber. The walls were dotted with iron sconces holding torches. Actual torches. There were maybe hundreds of book racks, locked in cages, chained, and secured with large iron locks. The books looked old, ancient. All cracked and faded leather with gilded or glowing letters scrawled down the spines. Most of them weren't in English. But what floored me was the ceiling. It stretched impossibly high, domed like a cathedral, but instead of stone or plaster, it was all glass. And through the glass wasn't the Ridgewood sky. It was stars.

"Now, see here young man," the gray-beard said. "I'm perfectly well aware that I'm overdue, but I hardly think it worth a thumping. It's *only* a century late."

"And yet, that is a century you've denied other guests access to *Principles of Oblivion*," said a voice from behind me. "I'd say a thumping is the least of your fine, Augefort."

It was Virgina. She closed the door behind her and approached with the stride of a drill sergeant. 

"Stars and stones," said the gray-beard, Augefort apparently. "Virgina Jones. The only fine I see here is you."

They two of them stared at each other, electricity practically sparking between them. It was getting weird.

I cleared my throat. "Excuse me -- ah. Virginia?"

Virginia held out her hand to Aguefort, who gingerly placed the overdue book in her hand. "We'll settle your tab later?"

Aguefort smiled, eyebrow arched. "I look forward to it."

And with that, he slipped off into the stacks.

"As for you," she said, the glow dulling from her face. "We need to talk."

I hooked a thumb toward the chamber of wonders behind me. "You think?"

"I would say you shouldn't have been able to find this section, but clearly that would be silly at this point."

"How could I not? I literally followed that guy--"

"Aguefort."

"Followed Aguefort here. But it's not a storage room. I thought it was. It's where we keep the Swiffer. Is there no Swiffer? What have I been sweeping with?"

"Follow me," she said, and led me back out to the library proper.

Outside, she closed the storage room door and opened it again. I braced myself, waiting for the chamber to astonish me once more, but -- nothing. It was the storage room. Rolls of toilet paper. Windex. The Swiffer.

"I don't--"

"Understand. Yes. It appears that you are ... sensitive. Most cannot see what truly lies beyond this door, nor the guests that patronize it. It is why I've gently steered you away from certain questions."

I folded my arms. "Why you've been gaslighting me, you mean?"

"Yes. I apologize. Overseeing the Spectral Branch is a serious responsibility. The books in there aren't just old, they're powerful. And the people that check them out -- they do important work."

"Like what?"

"Aguefort, for example, maintains the Border. Prevents things from coming here that would very much like to eat you, me, all of reality really. And the book he returned, *late*, helps him do his job."

I let that sink in. It wasn't totally insane, it was just -- weird. But there was something else poking at my craw.

"Are you and him ... ?" I waggled my eyebrows. 

"Aaand, we're done with that line of questions," she shut the door again, tapped her own black card against it, and opened it to not the storage room. Torchlight flickered through the doorway. Stepping inside she said, "Well, come on."

"Me?"

She half-sighed, handing me the leather bound copy of *Principles of Oblivion*. "Yes, you. We've got training to do. You'll need to learn how to shelve this without going insane. Now follow me, and do be careful."

I couldn't promise I would be careful. Because it turned out there was more to life than security, so much more. 

Like books.
