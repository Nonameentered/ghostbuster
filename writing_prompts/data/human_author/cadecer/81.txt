In the land of Babelor, there was no man stronger, more feared and worshiped, than the God-King Enorak. During the bad-old-days, when war ravaged Babelor and people starved and children searched for parents that would never return, they cried out for a savior. Enorak answered.

Kings and Queens fell before him. Their lands became his. But what does victory do to the heart and mind? Absolute victory? For there must have been some hunger that drives such men. Hunger for conquest, for challenge, for violence. And when no others stood against him, when no nation could muster the forces to challenge his rule, Enorak turned his hunger inward.

Instead of meeting with ministers or magistrates on matters of budget or policy, Enorak ordered the construction of a grand colosseum in the heart of Enostan, capital city of the empire and seat of his throne. Every day, the mighty God-King marched out into the blood-soaked sand, wrapped in his obsidian dreadplate, and welcomed all challengers -- taking on entire groups alone. Every day.

None succeeded.

At first, the people flooded the stands to watch their emperor vanquish challenger after challenger. The colosseum pages doled out wine and flat bread to all who came to witness Enorak's splendor. It was quite a time to be alive. As the poet, Polikrat, once said, "Feed the people food and fun, and their hearts shall always be won."

But who paid for the wine? The bread? The maintenance of the colosseum? Certainly not the emperor.

Soon, the challengers dwindled, and Enorak set to hiring foreign mercenaries to strike at him not just in the colosseum, but on parade. For every day, Enorak marched from his palace to the colosseum and welcomed any and all attackers during his commute. They failed to pierce his enchanted armor as well.

The people feared that Enorak's bloodlust would bleed the empire dry. Farms were failing. Buildings were collapsing from disrepair. And the streets were littered with the starving, the abandoned, the desperate. But that didn't matter to the God-King. His insatiable hunger for violence led him to proclaim a final challenge. Whomever should manage to defeat him would become emperor. But only the most ruthless killers were invited to strike at the God-King. Invited and commanded. It was almost as if he wanted to die.

Enorak sent his envoys to the four corners of the empire. One by one, the envoys contracted the finest killers to have ever walked in the shadows of Babelor. One by one, they too failed.

And then, one day, a knock came at my cabin door. It was a gray-bearded magistrate in ripped silks. He looked as thin as a rockhound.

"Are you the one they call Weaver?" he asked, his voice ragged and raspy.

I nodded.

The magistrate dropped to his knees and began to weep. "Please -- kill him. Please."

I accepted the contract.
