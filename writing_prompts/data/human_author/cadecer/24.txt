Lady Cthylla sits across from me, studying her menu. I told Tammy I wanted old and rich...not eldritch. This is the last time I let her talk me into a blind date.

We've already burned through all the standard first-date small talk. Where do you live? Me: Brooklyn. Her: beneath the flooded fishing town of Oakmont, not too far from Innsmouth. What do you do for a living? Me: freelance copywriting and improv comedy. Her: waiting to give birth to her own father in the distant future and selling jewelry on Etsy.

"What sort of jewelry?" I ask, steering the conversation away from kids. Cthylla is weird, even by Tammy's standards, but she's far from the worst date I've been on recently. So far she hasn't tried to recruit me into a cult or anything. 

"Amulets, mostly," she says, slightly wheezing. Was she a smoker?

"That's pretty cool. Must be a lot of fun making jewelry."

"It passes the time." She seems to deflate, shoulders sinking. "It's not like they'll let me do much of anything else."

The server comes around to take our orders. Cthylla orders paella and asks if the bread is free. When the server confirms, she orders another basket for the table. Hiding my smile, I go with the steak, medium rare. Tammy always warns to avoid the meat sweats during a first date — as if *that's* my biggest problem.

"Your parents pretty strict?" I ask.

"My father, the Great Cthulhu, named me his future vessel." She looks down, pale hands clenched into fists. "When the King in Yellow raises his Sine, my father will perish in the resulting conflict. This has been foretold."

"Foretold? Eh. I don't really buy into psychics and stuff."

"It is none of your concern," Cthylla sighs. "Their duel is not scheduled for another twenty-thousand years."

"Twenty thousand?"

"That is not dead which can eternal lie." 

The server arrives with our food. I spent most of the date glancing away from Cthylla to other tables, fighting not to stare too long. But now, I can't not stare at her. She's not magazine hot; she's Tim-Burton-designed-a-mermaid hot. Her eyes are the purest sea-foam green I've ever seen and her lips and nail polish match her eyes exactly. What I can see of her hair, under the seashell headpiece she's wearing, is so dark it almost looks blue in the dining room light. She seems tired and bored and utterly alone. My eyes won't look away, and I stop trying to make them.

When I was in the fifth grade, a new girl transferred into my school from another state. A week later I found her crying in the gym alone. It wasn't like I had many friends, being the only brown kid in school, but at least I knew the people who gave me the cold shoulder. This girl had no one. Somehow, it was like I could feel the loneliness growing around her, cold, like a wall of ice. I couldn't explain it more than that, but I didn't need to. I let her explain it to me after we started hanging out. Tammy and I are still friends to this day.

Whether or not Cthylla is legit certifiable or part of some sort of mermaid collective, I'm going to show this bored, lonely babe a night on the town.

Over coffee and custards, I tell her my weirdest improv show story. My team and I showed up to perform in the basement of a bar on a Tuesday night. The only people there were a middle-aged couple sitting right up front, drunk and loud. The couple kept fighting and ordering more drinks, shouting over our performance the entire time. An hour later, at the end of the show, the husband straightened his tie and handed me a business card before leaving the venue with his wife as if nothing had happened. 

"What was on the card?" she asks, head tilted in interest.

"The guy's name. Art Lieberman, an agent at Three Arts—this big talent agency that books people on TV shows and movies and stuff. There was a cell phone number on the card too."

"Did you call?"

"I did. But the number connected to a Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood. The Beef Lo Mein was pretty good."

Cthylla's lips curl into a smile. "You lie."

"No, it's true, except the Chinese restaurant part. The cell number was out of service." Still, the Beef Lo Mein at No. 1 Chinese Restaurant *was* exceptional.

"Can I walk you to the subway?" I ask once we finished signing our respective receipts. She shakes her head.

"It is not a far walk."

"I could use a walk. Got all this steak inside me."
