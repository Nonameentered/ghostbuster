It's not late but it's already dark. November in Manhattan, the sun goes down early and the tall buildings don't help. She fastened her turquoise cloak and we leave the restaurant. After a few blocks, she turned into Battery Park. Peddlers man their tables wrapped in Christmas lights and the path is lined with decorations all the way to the waterfront.

"Which god do they honor?" Cthylla asks.

"Santa. A mighty god dressed in red so that the blood of his enemies can never truly stain his sleeves."

I buy Cthylla a crocheted scarf from one of the vendors. She lets me put it on her gratefully.

People are gathering near a fountain. Cthylla and I slip into the crowd. There's a sudden thumping sound overhead and then a song kicks in as a group of dancers start flipping and jumping under lamplight.

"Such agility," Cthylla whispers, gently tugging on her scarf. We watch the dancers finish their routine. Cthylla claps enthusiastically. We walk back toward the edge of the park, past the SeaGlass carousel. Cthylla pauses to watch.

"Want to take a ride?" I ask.

"I have never ridden a horse."

"Seahorse, technically. You're probably a natural." I buy us a pair of tokens, taking her by the hand and guiding her to the end of the short queue. I help her hop onto the plastic seahorse in side saddle position, careful not to catch her fishnets on anything. I mount the crab beside her and wait for the music to kick on.

She clutches my arm. We're not so much riding as swimming around in circles inside a salt-water aquarium. I get a combination of car sick and sea sick, falling right into Cthylla's arms.

"My bad, my bad!"

"It's okay." She drags me upright by my jacket collar, giggling as the ride slows to a stop.

"If Flrgbbn could have seen me just now. Riding a seahorse. What insanity!"

We left the carousel and continued our walk. We should have reached the waterfront by now. I should be able to make out the Statue of Liberty rising from the Hudson River like a copper kaiju. All I see is more park. Looking back, I can no longer see the fountain or the city for that matter, but Cthylla seems sure of the way. We stop at a stone pillar twice my height. It's covered in weird graffiti, more like ancient hieroglyphics or something. A large stone building looms behind it. Cthylla stops.

"This is me. I have very much enjoyed my time with you, human." She hesitates for a second then pecks my cheek with a kiss. Smiling, she puts something in my hands, then turns around and disappears through the pillar.

Still disoriented, I walk back toward what should be uptown, rubbing the smooth stone attached to a leather cord. It looks like it must be made of glass, but its got colors and textures in it too—kind of pinks and salmon, and some threads of dark green. And...it almost feels wet. I look up at the sky in an attempt to navigate by light pollution but all I see are stars.

I'm pretty sure that I'm dreaming. No way in hell I should be able to see stars in Manhattan. I'm starting to panic when my phone buzzes against my thigh. I answer and breathe into the receiver, my standard hello.

"Sarah? I know you're there. I can hear you breathing." Tammy's voice crackled through the bad connection.

"Tammy? Are you awake?"

"Geez, how much you have to drink, tiger?" she replies. "You good to get home?"

I'm trying. Water. Trees. Fountain. I speed-walk around, still unsure of—the SeaGlass carousel and the little clearing with the dancers. And people. I'm back in Battery Park.

"Yeeeeaaah, okay. I'm fine. Everything's fine." And it is. Like when you haul ass to get to catch the subway and you see the train stopped at the station with the doors closing and the doors suddenly open because the conductor saw you coming. I glance up. The stars are gone. "Thanks, friend."

She's my best friend. Yet, I don't know much about her before moving to New York. She had always said she was from Rhode Island, that much I know. I've always left it at that.

"All right, I just spoke to Cthylla and she had a five-star experience. Look at you, satisfying expectations and shit."

"Ha. Thanks but I don't think we're good for date number two, Tamala. I'm pretty sure she's in a cult."

Tammy made a noise like if a grunt shrugged.

"And I think she's selling marbles on Etsy."

"Who isn't? Besides, I knew you weren't cult material. You didn't join, did you?" Her voices tightens, almost anxious?

"No way!"

"Good! That's what I call—" She affects a fake Italian accent. "—one-a-good-a first date."

"Is she and her dad gonna be alright? I wasn't sure about the whole epic story version of things, but it seems like there's some messiness there."

"Cthylla is what we in the therapy business call a victim of intergeneration drama. They'll never be alright by our standards. But for them? Here's hoping."

I let that sink in.

"Well, what's next weekend look like for you?"

"Should be free. What's up?"

"There's a girl I want you to meet. She's not as walled-off as poor Cthylla but she's definitely down for a good time. Maybe even some dancing. Interested?"

"Ah..." It had been a weird, sometimes dreamlike, evening. I close my eyes and rub the marble. I can see Cthylla gasping as the dancers flipped through the air. The way she laughed while I fell dizzy on top of her. Then I see Tammy in the gym, hugging her knees as she talked to me about her family and their weird parties, tears drying the more she talked. And behind all of that, I hear the distant crash of waves against rocks. I hear the sea.

"Okay, fine," I said.

"I've got a good feeling about this one, Sarah. Lilith is absolutely going to love you."
