Dio opened his eyes and disabled his phone alarm three minutes before going off and stayed in bed for another half hour, staring at the tiny white mountain ranges rising from stucco bedroom walls as the city woke up outside. Spring hardly put up a fight this year, it seemed, and Dio had started turning off his AC in favor of cracking the window at night a few weeks early compared to last fall. This morning, September whistled in through the window slit and nipped at his bare leg, sticking out from under the comforter. *Maybe some coffee first*, he thought. *Can't die without coffee.*

Dio had considered long and hard about this day, starting as a novel thought on his first day as an intern at the agency, fresh-faced and practically boiling with initiative. Now, ten years later, Dio no longer wondered why apotheosis campaigns were always marked for deletion. The high priests never mentioned them during their daily stand-ups or company-wide all hands meetings. It wasn't until he ignored protocol and went digging through temp storage folders on the company network that he discovered the truth. Anyone could ascend. Anyone. Taking into account the overwhelming success of his Greek campaigns over the years, Dio had absolute faith in himself.

Pouring a steaming cup of coffee from the automated machine in his easy bake-sized kitchen, Dio sat down at the table, mug warming his hands, and stared out of the tiny window looking out into his building's air shaft. It was as if some giant punched a hole into the heart of the building and healed up like a piercing. Across from Dio, Senora Cruz appeared in her window, a diminutive older Mexican woman who prayed to Jesus, Dio assumed, at an alter she'd built facing out into the air shaft. Perhaps it was worth telling her before transubstantiating into divinity?

He'd known Senora Cruz since moving into his apartment a decade ago. At least once a month he got one of her packages and dropped them off to her door. She'd invite him in for mouth-watering tamales and incredibly strong coffee as a thank you and he'd never been able to decline. After learning Dio worked as at a Worship Agency, launching sleek advertising campaigns for some of the oldest deities in existence, she started weaving her own sales pitch into their conversation: what would it take for Dio to drive out of her lot in a brand new faith? Well, nothing new about Jesus per se. But Dio's worship — that would certainly be new. He never converted and she never stopped trying. It was their little game. Was.

Dio finished his cup of coffee and loaded it into the dishwasher. He felt as if in slow motion, only vaguely aware of the caffeine revving up his heart as if it were someone else's body, his thoughts sliding across an impenetrable shield of utter and inescapable boredom, his mind constantly probing and finding no crack or flaw in the glass cage. Did the gods place this barrier within Dio's mind as a way to keep him from ascension or had he constructed it himself? Why hadn't he noticed it until after his thirty-third birthday?

On the subject of gods, did they know his intentions? Surely Mr. Wednesday should have foreseen this. And the Three Sisters. A mortal hasn't ascended to godhood since antiquity, when people seemed to trip over ambrosia or magic swords or gods in disguise waiting for their semi-divine bastards to show up. Dio's parents were not gods and every agency across the globe employed squadrons of mercenaries to find, secure, and erase any method for mortal ascendance. So either a) Dio was Destined, with a capital D, to ascend or b) no one knew of his intentions.

Dio shook his head as if to shake the notion free from his mind. He was distracting himself from the task at hand. He wrote a reminder to himself in his journal/future gospel, "Look into omnipotence."

Dio returned to his bedroom and sat at his desk overlooking the ritual he'd prepared the night before. Rubbing the edge of the obsidian dagger with his thumb, Dio considered whether or not he owed it to Senora Cruz to tell her about his ascension. Would she believe in him? He wasn't trained in conversions, that was for the sales team. No, Dio was known as the King of Comebacks. Resurrecting obscure gods from failing pantheons too proud to be absorbed by the big hitters like the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Norse. If Dio could singlehandedly raise \`A', the nameless Mayan death god, and his gaggle of demigod children to celebrity status through a particularly clever influencer campaign involving the cast of a funeral home competition reality show, then surly he could convince Senora Cruz of his own divinity? Focusing on the bleached human skull resting inside the copper bowl, Dio practices his pitch to Senora Cruz. The skull countered with, "Who are *you* to worship?"

A valid question. Dio's therapist claimed self-love was the only way out of the darkness that'd been his constant companion since childhood — what he called his "sphere of boredom." The self-care work sheets she'd provided him over the years grew into a stack of papers on his desk. He didn't need them, not anymore. What was the greatest show of love then absolute and complete worship? Heracles and Thor got their beaks wet with all the movies, comics, and books bearing their images. A steady stream of attention from the masses. Some gods, like the Old Ones, needed a regularly scheduled living sacrifice, sure. Whether by prayer or blood, humanity loved the gods and the gods loved them in return. Why not cut out the middle man? Why not create a self-fulfilling loop of worship, both supplicant and deity, one in the same? 

With his phone set up to record the ascension, Dio clicked on the ring light and stared into the camera. The motions came to him easily, like shaving or brushing his teeth. He wondered what sort of person would worship him? Would it be someone from this generation or would he wait, in stasis for centuries, before some arm-chair archeologist finds his story and decides to worship Dio ironically? Would it be wrong to try to sway Senora Cruz from her existing faith? (Jesus doesn't seem like the type to hold a grudge, unless Dio were running a roulette table in a church or something. Then it's all whips and shaming.)

Dio opened his palm with the obsidian dagger and made a fist over the copper bowl, blood pattering against the top of the skull resting inside. He took a deep breath in an attempt to ease the part of himself that screamed and writhed in the face of its own mortality.

"To you," Dio whispered into the camera, "I offer all of myself, to myself, Dio, god of boredom."

Dio plunged the dagger into his belly. Pain bloomed from the wound and flourished into a rose of agony, petals spreading fire through the rest of his body. He was breathing hard, sweating, hands wrapped around the hilt of the dagger in a white-knuckled grip. Through the pain, Dio focused on the top right corner of his phone's screen. The seconds weren't ticking on the clock. Time hadn't slowed down. It stopped.

Then came a knock on the door. Dio removed his hands from the dagger, now painlessly sticking out of his abdomen; dazed, he stumbled out to open the front door. Senora Cruz stood there holding a plate covered in aluminum foil and a red thermos. She wore a black dress, black sneakers, and a black cloth pinning up her mostly-grey hair under a black veil.

"May I come in?" she asked, her voice groaning like worn leather.

Dio stepped aside and gestured for her to come in. Senora Cruz uncovered the plate topped with tamales and poured her corpse-raising coffee into one of Dio's second-hand mugs. They sat in companionable silence until, eventually, the diminutive woman spoke.

"You did excellent work for my father," she said. "Very good work. But what you did today was not excellent. No, quite the opposite."

Dio began studying the knife hilt and the wound that seemed to stop bleeding all on its own. Nothing seemed to touch him through the sphere. Fear, confusion, anger, curiosity, all of it slid off the dome's smooth, unmarred surface. Yet, he'd upset Senora Cruz somehow. That he could feel.

"I'm sorry," he said, looking up.

Senora Cruz held up a hand. "Too late for that. Now I have to figure out what to do with you."

"You do?"

Senora Cruz studied Dio with big, dark eyes, like a bird inspecting a particularly interesting worm. Then, she said, "You made an offer to \`A' using his symbols, skull, knife. But you thought to claim his worship for yourself. No, this will not do. Not at all. You will come with me, Dio. We have much work to do."

"Am I in trouble?" Dio asked. Not afraid, merely interested.

"Trouble? Oh, yes. 2,000 years since a mortal was foolish enough to claim my father's worship for themselves. You know of him. And to think you'd try right under my nose! Well, enough of that. Come on. We've a train to catch."

Work. Trains. 2,000 years. Dio hadn't expected things to go this way. At least it wasn't boring.
