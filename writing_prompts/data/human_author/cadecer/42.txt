I woke up coughing and sputtering. Ploma was splashing water on my face, some of it going up my nose. I was outside.

"Get off me!" I shouted. "You'll drown me, you oaf!"

"Oaf!" She immediately collected herself, putting on that cool, imperious tone she must have learned from her tutors growing up. "Perhaps I should have let you collapse on the cavern floor and let your skull bounce off the rocks. Maybe that would teach you some manners."

"Lady Brich," one of the mercenaries said. A tall one with a hawkish nose. I gaped at him.

"We've gathered the drops like you asked."

"That's Ser Brich, you dullard," said a smaller, rounder merc. Had he combed his hair?

"Don't you recognize a paladin when you seent one?"

"Enough," Ploma commanded. And, to my utter horror, they brought fist to forehead and bowed. Bowed!

"Did I die?" I asked. "I'm dead, aren't I?"

"No," Ploma said with a sigh. "But you'll wish you were."

"Why?"

The third merc returned, left leg firmly bandaged, with one of our gathering packs. He knelt before us and presented the pack.

"Your graces," he said.

I groaned. "Oh, for the love of—!"

"Thank you, Farlemew," Ploma said, as placid as a pond. "How is your leg?"

"It'll do, mistress," the wounded man said. "I should be able to ride."

"It'll more than do," I said, calling upon the Light. I reached out and mended the wound as best as I could. I'd overtaxed myself purging the Skelimage, but I could at least help the healing along. Sweat beaded along my forehead, but it was done. "There."

Farlemew jumped up to his feet and did some sort of jig.

"By the Light. I'm healed!" He turned and shouted toward the other two mercs. "You see that! Who's a limper now? Hah!"

Ploma opened the bag with a chuckle and pulled something out. It caught the waning sunlight, glittering. She held a hunk of gold ore.

"Damn it!" I shouted. "What the hell are we supposed to do with that?"

It wasn't like we couldn't offload a couple of chunks of the stuff. But we'd only get a fraction of the guild rate and it'd come with a lot of questions. Chiefly, where did we get it? The fences that could get us a decent rate simply didn't work with unknowns. Two independents a year into dungeoneering? We'd have better luck hawking diamonds to the Empress herself.

"What we do," Ploma said, inspecting the ore in the light, "is dream bigger."

"Ploma, what good will that do?" I sat up against the tree behind me. "We're still years away from *any* fence of that level meeting with us! Or should we apply for the guild? Is that what you want? Hauling harvest sacks around like pack mules for a decade as an apprentice? Not *me*."

Ploma stared at me, jaw working like she was chewing her words.

"I am willing to use my name," she said.

"No," I said. Was she serious? She'd worked so hard to run away from the House of Brich. To run from her ridiculous engagement. "You can't. We'll figure something out."

"When, Riko? I do not mind waiting if there is a plan. But all we've done since we started was run around like hunting dogs following the scent of your premonitions. There is more out there to this life of adventure, and if it means binding myself to my family's fate, then so be it."

I punched the ground. "There has to be someone willing to buy these stupid chunks!"

"Mistress."

Farlemew pressed fist to forehead and bowed before continuing. Such sycophants. This was why Ploma hated revealing her family name. I would too.

Ploma waved a vague hand, gesturing for the merc to continue.

"The boys and I overheard—" He sputtered. "—course, we wasn't droppin' eaves or nuttin'. Just heard is all."

"Spit it out man!" I snapped.

"We trade in gold, my brother and I, back in Junji. It's a small operation, course. But we get solid rates considering. We'd be honored to fence your ore."

If only I could have seen my face then. It couldn't have looked half as bad as Ploma's gaping expression.

"Master Farelemew, I could kiss you!" She beamed.

The man's face went beet red and he started inspecting the tips of his boots.

"Oh, it's nuffin' at all."

I climbed to my feet, dusted off my cloak, and grabbed my mace from its spot against the tree.

"And where are you going?" Ploma asked.

"You'd better hurry up" I said, putting on my best Iskander accent. "There be gold in them caverns."
