\[Part 1 of 2\]

"So, we're selling reefer now?" Joey asked, carting a box packed with individually sealed eighths and half ounces of medical-grade, New York-grown cannabis.

"Medicinal marijuana," I said as I jiggled a key in the padlock on the storefront gate. "It's medicine."

"Medicine? That's one hell of an Advil."

I sighed. "Just bring in the boxes."

He half-shrugged. "You're the boss."

I took care not to bend, or worse, break the key off inside the padlock. The locksmith claimed it was the "best lock." No one could get through that lock, he'd promised. If only that didn't include me.

Behind me, Brooklyn was still waking up. Buses stopped to pick up neighborhood stiffs on their way to work. Bums set up their folding chairs and cups against the wall on the supermarket across the street. Uniformed teenagers smoked vapes as they walked to school. And me? Just opening up your friendly neighborhood weed store. Nothing to look at here.

Finally, I caught the teeth in the lock and turned the key with a "Fuck youuu."

"Why don't we get one of those electronic locks?" Joey asked behind me.

I removed the lock and threw up the metal gate unceremoniously. The glass door read *CNC Herbal Remedies*, CNC standing for *Cosa Nostra Cannabis*, of course. But no one needs to know that.

I held the door open for Joey and said, "Because if the power goes out, then no one's getting in. Understand?"

Whether he did or didn't was between him and God. I had too much to do already and the last thing I needed was to have to teach this mamaluke the finer points of running a brick and mortar.

"You know what," I said, "Just bring in the boxes."

Joey shrugged again and dropped off the box on the counter and went back out to the Escalade to retrieve the rest.

Joey was a nice enough kid. My sister's husband's nephew. Yeah, he annoyed the shit out of me with all his questions, but that wasn't enough reason to bust his balls.

Truth was, the consigliere from the Abondanza Crime Family, my employers, was slated to visit the shop today. Make sure everything was on the up and up. Gideon Sloan was no fool. Guy went to Harvard Law, on the Don's dime of course. I had to have all the paper ready, sales figures, permits, everything ready for inspection.

The whole point of opening up a dispensary was to create a legitimate front for our more sensitive transactions. Any uncrossed T's and undotted I's and the whole place was a bust.

And it would fall on me. Why? Because the front was my idea.

By the time Joey finished unloading the truck, I had all the paperwork laid out on the counter and spreadsheets open on the tablet we used as a terminal. I'd cleaned the place last night myself. You could eat off the linoleum. I wouldn't recommend it, but you could.

"So when's the Jew showing up?" Joey asked.

Before I could call him an idiot, the bell chimed. Standing on the other side of the front door stood a man in his early fifties. His head was shaved and his Buddy Holly glasses didn't make him look like an asshole. Instead, they sort of worked with his perfectly tailored grey suit. Nothing about him was accidental or incidental. Gideon Sloan was a man who knew what he was about.

And what he was about would decide my future in the family business.

"You keep your mouth shut," I hissed at Joey. "Let me do all the talking."

I pushed the buzzer under the counter, right beside the double barrel shotgun, and Gideon walked in cool as a cucumber on ice.

"Mister Sloan," I said, arms spread open. "Welcome to CNC. Can I get you anything? Coffee? A little toot-a-roots?"

Gideon smiled. Nothing seemed to ruffle the man. "Good morning, Carlo, no. Thank you for the hospitality. Is this your...?"

"Joey," I said. "My sister's nephew in law. Just joined up in the business. I'm training him up."

"Of course," Gideon said, eyeing Joey like a crow inspecting a particularly curious worm. All cold and calculating, despite his smile. "Happy to have you, Joey."

"You fucking kidding me? I'm half-hard thinking about the scores I'm gonna--"

"Joey," I snapped. "Remember what I said?"

Joey eyed me, not bird-like, and leaned against the wall, sucking on a vape pen.

Gideon and I exchanged a look that Joey wouldn't have understood. It said, "Yeah. We might have to kill him some day."

But that was neither here nor there.

After Gideon finished inspecting the permits and licenses, he walked behind the counter and started running through the numbers for the past three months of operation. His eyebrows shot up over the rim of his glasses.

"Are these numbers legit?" Gideon asked, still scrolling.

"Yeah," I said. "No funny business. There a problem?"

The door chimed.
