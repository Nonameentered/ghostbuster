Dad always called us his princesses, which I loved but Susan hated.

Every night, he'd tuck us into bed and tell us a story -- no matter how tired he was from work. They were always about space adventures. And the best part was that we were in them. Zora and Susan, twin princesses of the Falconian Empire, fighting against the Vornians and their insectoid forces. Susan preferred Harry Potter. Not me.

We were too young to remember when mom died. But after it happened, that's when dad started telling us those stories. I ate them up. Daydreamed about my own adventures in space, with my scientist sister by my side. Susan always said my head was in a nebula, and my teachers tended to agree. But whenever dad got called into school because of my grades or my ditching, he never got mad. He'd say, "I'll talk to her." And he did. He'd tell me a story about how princess Zora was misunderstood, how eventually she found her calling.

It was junior year when dad gave me the phone. A pink plastic toy that beeped when you pushed down on the blocky buttons. He said, "Remember this number, and only call if you and your sister are in trouble."

Now, we were in trouble.

"Let him go!" I shouted at the cops hauling dad away. "He didn't do anything!"

"It's going to be okay, Zora," the twitchy social worker said, standing between me and the door of our trailer.

Susan had gone quiet the moment the cops busted inside. Did they even have a warrant? Now she was sitting on the sofa, scrolling on her phone. "Tell them," I said to her. "Tell them he wasn't abusing us!"

"It won't make a difference, Zo," Susan said without looking up.

I could have punched her. Of course it would! This so-called social worker claimed dad was "criminally neglecting" us. That even though Sue and I are plenty old enough to take care of ourselves, we were in danger. That we'd be safer in foster care. Foster care! No way. I wasn't letting them put us in there. And I wasn't letting them get away with dragging dad's name like that. He was the best dad. Period.

"You're off your rocker, my son," I said to the social worker. "All sixes and sevens!"

Susan groaned. "Not the cockney accent..."

The social worker smiled sadly. "Zora -- when was the last time you were in school?"

"Today," I said, without blinking.

"And if I were to check with the school -- would they agree?"

Silence stretched between us. Sure, I'd been playing hooky lately, but dad knew. He always knew.

The social worker scuttled over to the front door.

"Girls," he said, "I've been on this case for quite some time. And I'm here to help. But to do that, you need to help me."

He locked the door.

"Ah hah! Found it," Susan said. "It says here we can apply for emancipation. We're old enough."

"Why did you lock the door?" I asked.

The social worker smiled again, this time a little too wide. Like he wasn't sure how.

"For your safety," he said. "Now, about the stories your father told you. Did he happen to mention … *where* the Falconians are hiding?"

"What?" Susan blurted.

"How do *you* know about his stories?" I demanded. "Who are you?"

One moment, the social worker was by the door. The next, he was in front of us. His eyes were bulging out of his skull as if his head were caught in a vise. Susan screamed. I grabbed her by the wrist and made a break for it, dragging her to our bedroom.

"What the hell!" Susan shouted, as we slammed the door shut and locked it. Susan slumped to the carpet, her back against the door. "What the actual hell!"

My heart was in my throat. *Trouble. We're in trouble.* I reached under my mattress, pulled out dad's pink plastic toy phone, started punching numbers. The toy *beeped* and *booped*. The social worker started knocking on the door in a shave and a haircut rhythm, asking for us to let him in.

"Is that the toy?" Susan demanded. "Are you serious right now!"

"Dad said to do it if we were in trouble!"

"Dad is crazy," she snapped. "*That's* why we're in trouble!"

"No he's not! I'm trying it." The phone made a double beep that repeated over and over, as if it were … ringing. "Hello? Is anyone there? They took our dad, and he said to call for help."

"I'm running out of patience," the social worker's muffled voice said. He started banging, rattling the door in its frame.

"Zo," Susan said. "Just run for it."

"What?"

She was holding the door, heels dug into the carpet. She had that *I'm a minute older than you* tone in her voice. "We can't let him take us both. Run. I'll figure this out."

"No... No, Sue. It's gonna be okay." I was shaking. This wasn't happening. But it was. And Susan wanted me run. "The Falconians, they--"

An arm busted through the door and grabbed Susan by the hair. She cursed.

I leapt at the arm, punched at it. "No! Let her go!"

"Galactic Battle Cruiser 'Dragon' responding. Help is on the way, your highness!"

It was a voice, grainy and small, but an actual voice -- coming from the *phone*.

On the other side of the door a sound like a drunk Theremin warbled, and then multiple voices appeared. The social worker let go of Susan and made an inhuman screech. Someone shouted "Fire!" and pew-freaking-pews went off. Dozens of them. There was one final, gurgling screech -- then silence.

Susan and I were on the carpet, holding each other. Then someone gently knocked on the door.

I reached for the knob, but Susan grabbed my arm. She shook her head once, sharply. I whispered, "It's okay," and opened the door.

Three soldiers in blue battle armor stood on the other side. They looked like space marines, their armor scratched up, their giant blaster rifles still smoking, and what remained of the social worker was twitching at their feet. But it wasn't a social worker. Because it wasn't human. It looked like a giant roach in a jacket and khakis. Like a *Vornian*.

"Your highnesses," the lead soldier said. She had wings printed on her helmet and breastplate. "Are you harmed?"

Susan padded up beside me. "You're--you're Falconian Dragoons. You're real."

The lead soldier pounded her chest twice. "At your command. And the king?"

"They took him, the knaves!" I shouted. "We need to rescue him. And I need a blaster!"

"Uh -- me too!" shouted Susan. "And training."

I grinned at her and she shrugged.

"Roger that," the soldier said.

Dad always called us his princesses. I loved it. And … it was growing on Susan.
