Some fancy-pants influencer showed up in town today. Rumor is he's planning on pulling pranks on the townsfolk for his YouTube channel. Maggie said he'd tweeted about egging the "lamezorz" bakery after touring the square. Not the first time my bakery got egged on mischief night. I was planning on closing up early anyway. I've got to put the final touches on my decorations after all. If Eugene Beckett thinks he's winning Spookiest House in Salem again, well. Let me tell you. He's DEAD WRONG!

So it happened again. Eugene won. BUT -- all is not lost. Today, Maggie pointed to the influencer through the front window of the bakery as he stumbled around the square looking lost as all heck. She said the sooner we helped him change, the sooner we could get back to our lives, to which I said, what's the rush? But Maggie warned that Eugene Beckett would have just as many chances to spruce up his house as I did. And she was right, of course, because while the mayor called for an emergency town hall, I spotted ol' Eugene slithering toward the Spirit Halloween store. 

I bumped into the influencer after closing up the bakery earlier than planned (no way was I falling behind Eugene). He said his name was Nick Wiggins, but that everyone called him "Shinobi." I was not everyone, because I excused myself from *mister Wiggins* and headed to the Halloween store. He decided to follow me, so I talked out my plan to build a realistic mummy on my front lawn. It required A LOT of jerky. Mister Wiggins was speechless. I guess he's not that big into Halloween?

I really thought the mummy would cinch it this time. But Eugene had to go and one up me again by building a functional guillotine and borrowed (or stole) a bunch of life-like human dummies from the university hospital. There were baskets of heads all over his friggin front lawn. Nothing at Spirit Halloween could compete with that. And where did he find the time to assemble a working guillotine? Maggie said I should get my priorities in order. I told her the only thing on order was defeat -- for Eugene.

After attending today's town hall, the townsfolk pretty much decided to go all-in on un-jerk-ifying mister Wiggins. Outside, sirens were blaring all across town. Mister Wiggins had stolen a horse and was live-streaming his own mid-speed chase. I had set up donuts and coffee in the back of the community center when Eugene -- the smug little bastard -- stopped by, gave me a small bow, and while I was paralyzed with anger, swiped a donut from the table. Yes, they were for the community. But there was no sense in feeding the enemy. I let it go. If history taught us anything it was that people don't change overnight. I'd have my chance at beating Eugene. And, with any luck, I'd make it stick.

A live performance, I believe, may be the key to winning. I was telling Maddie this at the bakery when mister Wiggins walked in. Maggie leaned over and whispered that he smelled like the floor of a bar. Maggie said something about a Hedonism phase -- fully indulging in the sins of the flesh, which made me think about how I could incorporate actual meat into my decorations. Would cow or pork work better as a human flesh analogue? I asked Maggie, but she said I wasn't listening, then took mister Wiggin's order. Three dozen assorted donuts. As Maggie set to picking and boxing Donuts, mister Wiggins drank from a flask, belched, and asked me if anything mattered? I truthfully told him that the most important thing to me was winning this year's Spookiest House in Salem competition. He said that was stupid, but that he "respected my gangster." Whatever that meant. He left without his donuts.

Mister Wiggins was standing outside the bakery as I walked up to open up for the day -- again, which I could have done with out because he'd been Russian wedding-drunk every time. But today, he wasn't. He asked if given the choice, would I take the "red pill or the blue pill?" I told him the only pills I take are two baby aspirin every night before bed. This didn't seem to satisfy him. So then he asked why the Spookiest House competition was so important to me. That was easy. I told him it wasn't just about the title (though bragging rights were a big part of it), but that this was Salem -- a Halloween town. And most of the folks here enjoyed getting spooked. The competition was my way of being a part of the community. And who doesn't like winning?

Mister Wiggins said nothing and walked off into town, probably to pick a pill.

I didn't open the shop today so I could have enough time to assemble my meat man and tie him to the stake outside my front lawn. Maggie thought my recreation of a witch burning was in bad taste, but no one said anything when Eugene sewed together a bunch of medical cadavers into a human centipede. I mean -- how was that even legal? At least I was using pork, AND, I planned on serving said pork to the judges after the conflagration. But my plans were all thrown to heck when Susan found mister Wiggin's body in the bathtub of his room at her Bed and Breakfast. So we got to that part of the loops.

I decided to take today off from house decorating and just have a regular-degular day at the bakery. Maggie was taking mister Wiggin's most recent death pretty hard, and I couldn't blame her. She was the one who found his body in our walk-in freezer. Which gave me an idea for a decoration involving lots of dry ice, but I kept it to myself.

Today was the day. Mister Wiggins surprised us at the shop when he showed up with a pick-up truck packed with lumber, machinery, and some fancy looking prosthetic arms. When I asked him where he got all this from, he wouldn't say. All he did say was that he promised to make my house go viral. I glanced over at Maggie and she had this nervous little smile on her face, but she nodded and said she could hold down the shop solo. I asked if she was sure and she threw a kruller at my head. 

The plan was simple. Mister Wiggins explained that Eugene kept escalating and escalating his decorations. But that wasn't sustainable. At a certain point, there would be nowhere for him to go. What scared people wasn't the gross out or the shock. It was dread. "A slow, inescapable fate, Bob. That's what truly scares people," he said. I agreed, asked how were we gonna pull it off? He grinned and held up a prosthetic hand. 

That night, the judges gathered on my lawn. Eugene was there too, since they'd already visited his house. Mister Wiggins stood before a fake-stone alter, wearing a black robe with a hood pulled low over his face. The kid had a real knack for the theatrical. He put on this rasping voice and sort-of-British accent, something Medieval, and set to chanting. He threw in lines about old Salem, about witches, devils, and innocents. It was already a cloudy night, but the bluetooth speakers attached to drones flying up high blasted thunder sound effects. 

When he said the signal word, "doom," Maggie hit the switch on the hydraulics. Hands erupted out from the grass beneath the judges feet. The judges jumped. Eugene hardly moved, but that was fine. Because in the distance, a massive groan came up the street. It was twenty zombies, lumbering toward the judges. Sure, the judges may have known, intellectually, that they were probably townsfolk in movie-quality makeup. But they saw these shambling figures slowly get closer and closer, and somewhere in their lizard brains, an old ancient fear network was screaming for them to run. 

That's when I punched through the ground. The prosthetic hands were a misdirect. Look at the fake-ish hands. Then, oh wow, that's a lot of zombies coming up the street. But then, BOOM! A zombie just burst through the ground, right in front of you. 

It worked. The judges ran screaming. Eugene dropped to the grass, shaking. I groaned and clawed my way closer. He started kicking at me, screeching for me to get away, and that's when I broke down laughing.

The best part? Mister Wiggins caught it all on camera. 

The bestest part? I WON!

Mister Wiggins decided to stay for a little longer. Maggie and I invited him over for breakfast. He said he was thinking about getting into stage construction and was looking at schools in the area. I thought it was an excellent idea. Also, it turned out -- at some point -- he and Eugene had sparked a little romance. I was worried that meant he'd help Eugene reclaim his title next year, but mister Wiggins assured me he'd be helping neither of us, because he intended to win the title for himself. 

Well. To that I say, bring it on, "Shinobi."
