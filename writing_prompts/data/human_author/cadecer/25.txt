Once-ler struggled to block out the mercenaries' laughter while fumbling to switch on the com-box and punching buttons to connect with headquarters.

"O'Hare Textiles," Aloysius O'Hare answered. His voice was tense, Once-ler thought, nervous.

"It's Once-ler" he said. "The hunt was a success. We found it."

"That so?" O'Hare asked. He blew out a long breath. "Bad news, boy-o. Terrible, terrible indeed."

The head mercenary bit into an apple and hurled it at Once-ler's head. He connected, hard enough to snap Once-ler's head back. The mercenary looked like a thumb, bald and thick necked and stretching the fabric of his black tactical outfit. And he had a hell of a throw.

Once-ler brought the com-box back to his face and turned his shoulder to the mercenaries while they whooped and cackled. "I'm on with headquarters!" he yelled over at them.

"I'm on with headquarters," the head mercenary mimed, pitching his voice up and hopping on tippy-toes.

"Pay attention, Once-ler, because I'm only saying this once," O'Hare said. "You are to pack up operations and return to the mill at once."

"I'm sorry?" Once-ler asked. "Mr. O'Hare, the Lorax is cornered. We've got it dead to rights."

"Listen here, you dim-wit. You've got the roles reversed. It's the Lorax that's got you within its sights. Now get back to the mill at once!"

Once-ler glowered at the com-box. "We'll never get another chance like this, sir," Once-ler protested.

"You're flirting with insubordination, Once-ler!"

"I'm trying to complete the mission, sir."

"If you get those men killed the consequences will fall upon *both* of our heads. The Woodsmen are not fond of losing their members. Now uncircle the wagons and get back here this instant!"

"I'm sorry, Mr. O'Hare," Once-ler said. "I'm afraid I can't do that."

"If you make me come down there, you'll wish the Lorax had gotten to you first!"

"We're south of the Truffula forest, by the caverns. Me and the men will be here, doing our duty, sir."

"Fuck duty," shouted the head mercenary, annoyed. "We're getting paid to babysit you, brainiac!" He hurled another apple, and Once-ler more or less dodged out of its trajectory, only taking a glancing blow off the top of his head.

"The Woodsmen will not risk their lives for you," O'Hare said. "They will leave you for dead and laugh as they run. Mark my words, Once-ler."

"And what if we succeed?"

"There is no succeeding! The Lorax is armed. You understand? This isn't just some mere beast. It thinks. It plans. It learns. Learns, Once-ler!"

Once-ler nodded, but his neck felt tight, and his stomach churned with anger. He'd tried warning O'Hare. Everyone. But no one believed Once-ler. Not until it was too late. "We've got the element of surprise, Mr. O'Hare. It'll have to do. If you're coming, bring an extra transport."

"What happened to the PX5 I sent you with?"

"We drove it afoul."

"Afoul? What the hell does that mean? What did you do to my truck!"

"We'll recover it after the mission, sir." Once-ler fired back. O'Hare was all forehead veins and flushed cheeks. When it came down to his business' success, he wouldn't let Once-ler and the Woodsmen claim all the credit. Even if there was a slim chance of a bunch of humans armed with pop-guns facing down and winning against the avatar of nature itself. Still, O'Hare would come.

O'Hare muttered something that sounded mostly obscene, then said, "Bring me its head, Once-ler. The PX7 isn't all-terrain yet, so I'll be on the north side of the forest. Take out the Lorax and cross the bridge into the north. Reserve company men will be on the lookout for you. You have an hour. If you and the Woodsmen aren't back by then, I'm purging the southern wood. Understood?"

"Things will get better, Mr. O'Hare. I promise."
