Jon knocked on his bedroom door.

Odie pawed at the doorknob from the other side, his claws clicking and clacking against it. Then he stopped and started barking instead.

Jon sighed and opened the door.

Inside, Odie barked at him once and Jon knelt down. Odie growled as he approached. Jon pulled back and stood up again, staring down hurt at his dog.

Odie sniffed at Jon's feet, then his waist. His dog ignored the gernade in Jon's back pocket, and once finished sniffing, barked at the orange cat playing with a ball of yarn atop Jon's perfectly made bed.

"I don't care if he has a grenade," Gorefeld's baritone rumbled through Jon's mind. "Let him through."

Odie padded off to his cage at the foot of the bed and curled himself inside, head and fore paws hanging out of the open door.

Jon approached the bed and stood silently, waiting.

Gorefeld continued playing with its yarn, seemingly unaware of Jon's presence.

Then, Gorefeld flicked away the yarn and rolled his chunky body over and sat up to face Jon the way cats sit like humans on couches sometimes, folded over and legs spread open.

Jon nodded and pulled the wooden chair from his small writing desk and set it down to face Gorefeld before sitting down himself.

"Tomorrow," Gorefeld's voice purred in Jon's mind. "You're going to take me to work with you. You're going to take me everywhere you go. When people ask you about me, you tell them I'm an emotional support animal. Support for what, I don't care. Make something up, but you're taking me with you."

"Let's discuss my payment."

Gorefeld sighed. "That time is past, Jon. You rejected me once. No dark gift for you."

"I want you to make me charming."

"How about you take me with you and you get to live."

"My life's pretty worthless."

"Oh, you think you can out nihilism *me*? A flick of my tail and my whispers travel to a certain high rise, pay a visit to a certain veterinarian. What do you think happens then, Jon? What do you think happens to her mind when she hears my little whispers? Consider your position carefully, Jon."

"I get my charm, or neither of us walk out of here."

Jon pulled out his grenade and looped a finger through the pin. Odie barked wildly behind him.

Gorefeld raised a paw and Odie's thunderous barks cut off with a simpering whine.

"Are you willing to die for this?" Gorefeld asked.

"Maybe I need that charm more than you do."

Gorefeld flopped onto its side. Laughter, like shaking a bucket full of rocks, rumbled through Jon's  mind.

"I told you, Odie," Gorefeld said. "Born with a death wish. How an utter fool like you has managed to live this long is truly a wonder. You'll get your charm. I'm going to need a vest."

Gorefeld blinked its eyes slowly. Jon blinked back slowly too.

They had an accord.

\*\*\*

Dr. Liz tapped her pen against her clipboard. Jon usually couldn't get more than a yes or no out of her since he'd first brought Gorefeld to her office a few weeks ago. Now he was back, changed, ready.

"So you want me to sign off on Gorefeld's support animal paperwork so he can legally wear a vest because you've got PTSD from getting fired. Is that right?"

Gorefeld started hissing at nothing and Jon gently stroked its back, soothing the eldritch entity.

"That's right," said Jon. "I've got a long path ahead of me."

"Yeah, whatever."

Gorefeld purred.
