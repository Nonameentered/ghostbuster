"What charming ink."

I sat up bolt straight, launching my shaded lenses off my face and a few paces away into the sand. The sun blared and I shielded my eyes, lurching around. Blinking, I managed to make out a woman wrapped in a seafoam cloth for a dress and wide brim hat atop her head. The rest of her, what was visible, was covered in ink. I couldn't help but stare at the craftsmanship and the intricate details of each piece. Taking it all in, I realized she was thrumming with Power.

"Thank you," I said, shifting to my knees. The snakes wrapped around my left wrist started writhing under my skin, preparing to immobilize the mystery woman at a moment's notice. I willed them back, but not completely.

She pointed to my sheet. "May I join you?"

"There's plenty of sand. Didn't bring a sheet?"

She hoisted her basket up. "Oh, come now. What good is a picnic without company?"

If she wanted to kill me, I would have already been dead. That much I knew. She'd been able to suppress her Power enough to sneak up on me. Me. Normally, I could sense another mage at least a good half-mile away. Of course, that'd been ages ago. Maybe I was getting old.

The winged statue on her right shin started flapping its wings. A cool breeze blew over us, strong enough to play with her dress. It'd been plenty hot that day and the chill was more than welcome. She smiled. "I've got blue peach."

My mouth watered. *Blue peach?* I thought. *How long since I've tasted home?*

I made room for her on my shabby sheet. She sat without another word and set the basket down between us. We stared out at the crystalline water lapping at the shore in companionable silence. The Leo on my right shoulder started stretching, anticipating a challenge.

"That is quite a beautiful piece," she said.

I turned to face her and she was staring at my shoulder. She hardly seemed worried. I wouldn't have been either. Zodiac tattoos only enhanced one's inherent abilities. A proper mage wouldn't fear such a tattoo. And she appeared to be most proper.

"Thanks. I got it in Tanjico."

"Master Horihoji?"

I grunted. "He's the best with zodiac work. I've been meaning to go back for a Taurus—" I pointed to a blank spot on my left breast. "—just haven't found the will."

The woman pointed to an Aquarius tattoo on her left forearm. As she flexed her muscles, the statuesque man pitched his jug forward and water started pouring from the woman's arm, spilling onto the sheet.

I felt my eyebrows raise up two inches too high. "Well. I've never seen that before."

She chuckled. "Master Horihoji is quite tight-lipped. It took me a while to work out the depths of his work."

I glanced at my shoulder. The Leo had settled back to its resting position, and the surge of courage and boldness it had started spreading through me faded. Not that I was afraid of her. But she had yet to introduce herself or her purpose. I wouldn't be the first to break. Based on ink alone, we were peers. To have most of one's body covered required an incredible amount of control, endurance, and talent. From ankle to neck, I was more ink than skin. And she was too.

At this level, one didn't have picnics with other mages. You dueled. Often to the death. Perhaps that's why there were so few of us...

"What's your name?" I asked, staring out at the water again.

"Lisandra. Lisandra Maldeux. And you?"

"Korvin Guff. But my friends call me 'Smudge.'"

"And mine call me 'Widow.'"

With that, we ate. She split open the peach and the grayish pit fell out of the bright blue flesh of the frigid fruit. That first bite was like eating snow, but sweet and tart and glorious. For a moment, I was a boy again, running through the Jenji Mountain paths looking for blue peaches and adventure. That was back before my first tattoo. Before I had to leave home. Lisandra hummed as she ate her half and shared the story of how she'd found a fruit stand back in town that'd been selling the peaches for locals only. A few soft words and hard coins in his hand, and he'd sold her the fruit. I thanked her for the peach and the story.

Soon, the sun started sinking into the sea, painting the sky orange and purple and gold. The salty breeze further chilled the already cooling evening and I put on my shirt, simple brown linen.

"Wine?" Lisandra asked.

"Absolutely. I was planning on heading back to one of those seaside taverns. Might as well get started now."

As we worked the boozy bottle of Fresian Amber down and the sun finished setting, little clumps of green light winked to life along the shore. Light moss, the locals called it. It bathed the beach in a sickly green glow. Lisandra told me of her journey from the Tower of Lo, where she'd been tasked with hunting down rogue mages. Lisandra, it seemed, was a Warder. She looked me in the eyes when she said it, perhaps gauging my reaction. I betrayed nothing.

Finally, when the bottle was done and the beach was a sea of luminous green, she broke.

"What are you doing here, Korvin?"

"Same as you, I suppose," I said, my head swimming from the wine. "Hunting."

She shook her head. "No. I'm not hunting. I'm waiting. Always waiting."

"For who?"

"Everyone, it seems. You're not on my list, Korvin. But I know of you. The *Smudge*. The *Ink Eraser*. I wondered what had happened to you when dueling was outlawed."

I spread my arms and gestured to the sand. "This. A slow, boring death."

She didn't say anything. What was there to say? Silence stretched between us until it grew taught and tense like an overtaxed string.

"It doesn't have to be," she said, finally. "You could always join us."

I barked a laugh and wobbled to my feet. The yellow sponge tattooed over my liver started squeezing and the wine buzz quickly left my system. "The only way I'm going to the Tower of Lo is in irons."

Lisandra rose gracefully, apparently also free of the potent wine's effects. "It was merely an offer." Perhaps there was too much edge in my voice because Power thrummed from her; the tattoos on her arms and legs started shifting and moving. "No need to ruin a lovely day, Korvin."

Sucking my teeth, I turned and started walking away from her. "Keep the sheet," I shouted over my shoulder. "Don't wanna get sand in your skivvies."

She didn't say anything.

The sand felt cool between my toes as I trudged back to the town. The Leo on my shoulder roared a yawn and went back to sleep. Maybe I'd go hunting for some blue peach? Maybe that'd make me feel alive again.
