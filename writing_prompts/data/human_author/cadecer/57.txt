"You think you know your wife?" the stranger said, swirling a glass of scotch. His other hand was hidden under our table. "You have no idea, Mr. Diaz. No idea at all."

He looked so freaking smug. Like a that kid in science class that knew the answer to teacher's question, the one everyone else got wrong. Well, I knew that the mitochondria was the powerhouse of the cell alright. And all I wanted to do was wipe that smirk off his Ken Doll face.

But first, I needed to figure out how much he knew. Tasha would want me to try as much.

"No idea of what?" I asked, feigning worry. "Who are you?"

He sniffed his scotch. "A friend. And you'll need friends, Mr. Diaz. I assure you."

*Oh my god,* I thought to myself. *Just get to the point, you tool.*

I pressed my palms against the underside of the table, preparing my move.

Around me, the restaurant buzzed with activity. Severs took orders, dropped off steaming plates, refilled waters. The tables were all full -- it was a miracle we found an empty one to sit at -- and the customer's voices all melded into a sea of noise. Every time the kitchen doors swung open, the smells of cooking wafted through. I should have been at my station, grilling up pork gyozas. Instead...

"Why do you keep dodging my questions?" I asked. "What do you want?"

Maybe it was a little too pushy? I wasn't sure if my worried husband act was blown, but it was hard to keep up the act considering I was legitimately losing my patience.

"My name is Agent Anderson. I'm with the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA." He paused, clearly waiting for my shocked reaction.

I gasped and he nodded.

"The reason I'm here is because your wife is not an Avon sales representative, Mr. Diaz. I know this may sound ridiculous, but â€¦ your wife is a spy." He held up a manila folder and slid it across the table. "Her name, her real name, is Natacha Vladachyenko. She's with the FSB. That's the new name for the KGB. You know the KGB?"

I opened the folder to a large printout of Tasha's Russian passport; I liked her wig in the French one --  a black bob with bangs. Beneath the picture were several documents with redactions cutting out line after line, leaving some pages barely readable. I raised my eyebrows.

"Y-yes," I said. "I've heard about them on the news. And in movies. You're saying my wife is with them? But, she's from Cleveland."

He chuckled. "That's her cover, Mr. Diaz. It's 2022. False identities are as easy to come by as AR15s, I'm afraid. Especially for someone with her political and financial backing. The question I have is -- what is her mission? Clearly she's married to you for cover. Ingratiated herself into American society. But why?"

*Because she wants to live a normal life*, I thought. *Because she wants to stay away from power tools like you.*

"I don't--" I worried my forehead with the heel of my palm. "--I'm sorry. I'm just finding this all hard to believe. I mean, isn't the CIA only supposed to be active *outside* the U.S.? Shouldn't the FBI be talking to me or something?"

Agent Anderson, or whatever his name was, set down his scotch and leaned back in his chair. He stared at me for a few moments before saying, "Well, aren't you well informed."

"I'm pretty sure I heard that in a movie," I said. "Is that right?"

"Mr. Diaz, let me be frank here for a moment. Your wife is a murderer. Do you understand? She is a highly trained killer with a trail of bodies behind her long enough to wrap around this block. There are things I did not include in that folder. Things that would steal your sleep, guaranteed. So, again, what I need to know is why is she here?"

"I don't know!"

He slapped the table, rattling the silverware. "I think you do. I think, after ten years of marriage, she had to have let *something* slip. The movies make it seem like spies can truly live some false life, play Mrs. Smith to the T. That's not true, Mr. Diaz. No one's perfect. No one. So, think. Think long and hard, because if you don't answer my questions, we're going for a ride. Understand?"

Well. I supposed enough was enough. I only hoped that he didn't start shooting.

"You're wrong," I said.

"Excuse me?"

"I said, you're wrong. Tasha *is* perfect. But not because some Russian black-ops facility trained her to be a killing machine. And not because she could easily have infiltrated our government -- hell, she probably could have made the cabinet. No. She's perfect because she's kind and warm and smart and funny and original and honest and brave. My wife is brave, Agent Anderson. Brave enough to tell me the truth about herself while we were still dating. Brave enough to walk away from her life, from people like you."

A smile stretched across Agent Anderson's face. "You knew--"

"Oh," I cut in. "She's also a great teacher."

With all my strength, I flipped the table up into Anderson's face. The couple behind me screamed. I had to make this quick. There was no telling what this guy was capable of. He definitely wasn't CIA. And if he was bounty hunter, that was even worse. Those cowboys had no qualms about shooting up a place just to get closer to their target. *Hard and fast, Tony. Hit him hard and fast.*

Anderson appeared from around the table in a low crouch. Something flashed in his right hand as he shot toward me.

Tasha had said that all the training in the world was no substitute for real life experience. That was why we trained with real knives. Add to that my years as a line cook, and compared to the average person, knives didn't phase me one bit.

And clearly, Anderson hadn't been expecting that. I stepped into his lunge, knocking his knife arm down with both of my arms, and grappled his wrist into a lock. In two breaths, I had his knife under his chin.

The servers were running around trying to sooth the customers freaking out at tables, and the cooks started pouring out from the kitchen. It was time to go.

"Don't struggle," I whispered into Anderson's ear. "I'm very good with knives, but don't think I won't slip."

Anderson didn't fight me, letting me lead him toward the back exit. "You're making a huge mistake," he said. "I promise you, Diaz. You're going to regret this."

I pushed the door open with my back. We stumbled out into the cold night air, the shadowy alley reeking of garbage. I tossed the knife, wrapped an arm around Anderson's neck, and started counting.

To his credit, I didn't see him pull the second knife. But I felt it when he buried into my left thigh. White hot pain seared into my leg. He gurgled, probably trying to smug me some more. But I didn't loosen my grip one bit.

By the time I reached fifteen, Anderson went limp.

I gently lowered him to the ground and tried not to look at the knife handle sticking out of my thigh -- and failed. I was breathing hard, winded from the brutal struggle. Blood soaked through my tie-dye joggers and started pooling into my clog. I didn't have much time before the cops arrived. The staff had to have called them.

I pulled out my phone and hit the speed dial.

"Hey babe," Tasha said, the television on in the background. "I'm making perogies! I found this recipe on TikTok I wanted to try. I'll leave you some in the fridge. Are you still at work?"

"Pineapple."

Her American accent vanished, and she simply replied, "I'll be there in five."

In the distance, sirens cried through the city streets. But they'd be too late. Tasha would beat them here and she'd scoop up this joker and I'd have to find a new gig. But that was the life. Our life.

And she was absolutely worth it.
