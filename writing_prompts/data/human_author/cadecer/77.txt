2,300 years ago, the rulers of Alexandria set out to complete one hell of an achievement -- to collect all the knowledge in the world under one roof. At its peak, the Library of Alexandria stored a metric butt ton of scrolls and attracted some of the Greek world’s biggest dorks. But by the end of the fifth century CE, it had apparently vanished from the face of the earth.

Two months ago, my deadbeat dad set out to complete one hell of an achievement -- leave possibly the worst inheritance in the history of inheritances. At his worst, my dad racked up enough gambling debts to make the mafia blush. And when he died, his lawyer handed me a will that transferred said debts to me.

I also got a box.

The contents of that box are why a sweaty, bearded mercenary had a gun pointed at me in an Alexandria alley.

"Give me the plaque," he demanded. His voice was raspy, and sounded desperate, I think.

"Bite me," I said.

He made a face like he was doing calculus by hand. "I will kill you, girl. Give me the plaque."

It wasn't that I *wanted* to die. But if sweaty beard really wanted the plaque, then why not shoot me and take it? Well - it's because the plaque had *my* name on it. And, according to the letter that came with it, the plaque was no good to anyone but the inscribed owner. And, the only way to change the name was by the owner *willingly* passing it off to another person. Like how my dad willed it to me before his death (that and his MASSIVE debts --  yes, I'm still mad).

What I wasn't counting on was this asshole shooting to maim.

Without warning, sweaty beard lowered his gun and shot me in the leg. Guns don't bark like they do in the movies. It was more like a coughing click sound. My scream, however, was just like the movies. Loud and obscene.

"No one will come," said sweaty beard, holstering his gun. He squat to talk to me, like a Hezbollah Mister Rodgers. "The Ashen control this city, girl. The Ashen control all. We *will* burn the library to the ground. Whether you live to see it burn, depends on you. Give me plaque."

I'll admit, most of what he said was lost on the searing pain radiating out from the gunshot in my left thigh. I thought shock was supposed to numb all that. You know, like how soldiers can run for miles only to get back to their platoon and realize they're riddled with holes. But nope. Getting shot hurt like hell.

And maybe it was the pain that brought a sudden clarity to mind. I was doing all of this because I had thought my dad was just a degenerate gambler. A deadbeat who walked out on me and my mom when I was twelve. But ever since I got this plaque, it's like maybe -- just maybe, he's not the man I thought he was. Maybe he left because he was trying to protect us? Because if he didn't, these Ashen-holes would have come after us all the time. The only way to know was to get to library.

But was it worth being tortured?

"Fine," I said through gritted teeth. "Burn it. But first, let me go inside. I'll bring you with me -- you can be my plus one."

Sweaty beard shook his head. "There is no negotiation." He stuck his finger in the bullet hole.

My vision went white. I tried shoving him away, but he was too strong. I thought I was going to puke from the pain.

"Fuck--off, Jesus what the hell, you're insane!"

"I," he said, "am committed to--"

A hand shoved a rag over sweaty beard's mouth and a voice said, "Does this smell like chloroform to you?"

Sweaty beard struggled, but it was too late. His eyes rolled back and he toppled like the last round of Jenga.

Standing over him, in the middle of an alley in Egypt, was my father. I must have been hallucinating from the pain. Darkness started creeping in from the edges of my vision and I suddenly got really light headed.

Maybe-Dad smiled and knelt down in front of me. "Just like when you fell of your bike," he said, and pressed his palm over my bleeding wound.

I winced, jerked my leg back, but he kept his hand firmly pressed. Then … the pain stopped.

Whatever shock I was in started to wear off and I was able to focus on his face. There were a lot more lines at the corners of his mouth and his stubble was more salt than pepper, but he still had those slate-gray eyes -- my eyes.

"Dad? You're alive?"

He chuckled. "Yes, and, we should probably talk--"

"What the hell!" I punched his chest. "You couldn't show up BEFORE I got shot?"

"Yeah," he said sheepishly. "Sorry, I was searching for you and the gunshot lead me here. Mixed blessing?"

I went to push myself up and realized that my leg was -- fine. Standing, I inspected the hole in my jeans and found no wound. Just a slightly discolored patch of skin. Probably freshly healed?

"Are you a wizard?"

"No," he said, peeking out of the alley left and right. "Just well read. Okay, come on. The coast is clear."

"Wait, wait, wait. No!" I shouted. "You were dead. I *saw* your body at the wake. And, the will. The debt." My eyes widened. "The debt … you sonofabitch, you left me so much debt! Who does that?"

Undead-dad shook his head and put his hands on my shoulders. "I owe you and your mom a lot of apologies. And I deserve no forgiveness. Like, at all. But right now, there is a shadowy organization that wants your plaque and will do anything to get it. So, I would be happy to take the world's longest ear beating from you. Happy! But please, can we do it *inside* the library?"

"World's longest?" I said.

"Till your throat dries and your tongue quits."

"Fine," I said, shoving toward the mouth of the alley. "Where is the library anyway? I couldn't find it."

My alive-dad stepped up beside me and, with a smile, pointed up.

"You're shitting me."

By the end of the fifth century CE, the library of Alexandria had apparently vanished from the face of the earth. That's because it's in the freaking sky.
