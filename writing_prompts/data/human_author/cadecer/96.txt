Julia and I reach the end of the alley, careful not to eat shit on sections of pavement that'd been switched out for cake. Before running out into the street, I check my map. No use getting lost at this point.

"The bakery stopped answering their radio," I say around a mouthful of smoked jerky. I hand some to Julia but she shakes her head no. "They said they'd keep taking refugees until sundown tonight. I don't know. Maybe they cut the power? They're on generators or something?"

"Maybe it's cake too?" Julia asks. "Maybe it's all cake?"

The question is like a punch to the gut. Her face is kinked-up, sympathetic. Pained. Tired. I can't let her give up. I won't. Hope is the only thing keeping us, me, going in the face of this insanity.

"They can't bake without a working kitchen, Jules. What, they're gonna shove their trays into cake ovens? Mix their batter in cake mixers? No. We'll be safe here."

"Safe from what, Tony? We were fine at home. Just you and me, day by day, figuring it out. Together."

I point at my bandaged head. "Fine? I fell through the floor, Jules. They turned our floor to cake. Our phones got turned to cake. Eric's insulin pump got turned to cake. The FEMA camp got turned to cake. I can't live unsure if the next time I sit, I'll just sink through the chair. That if I reach out to--" I stop myself. That one's too painful to even consider. I blow out a breath. "That's not a life, Jules. I need something real in my life."

Julia's expression sinks. "*I'm* real."

A stab of shame cuts through my chest. I suddenly feel small under the guilt. I reach out and she pulls her hand back. The guilt doubles, triples. I'm smothered under it. I smile weakly. "Yes. Yes you are. You're the realest thing in my entire life, babe."

In the distance, a siren blares followed by a sickening crunch of metal against something. Their brake pedal probably got turned to cake, I thought. 

"Come on," I say, pointing to an X on the map. "We're not far. They'll probably be a mob around the place." 

She nods, eyes still watery but appearing less hurt. I pat the kitchen knife in my coat pocket, comforted by its weight and solidness against my side. 

Somethings *had* to be real.

\*\*\*

"This is it!" I cheer at Julia. "Oh, god. We did it. We made it. We--"

There's no one outside the one-story bakery. No lights through the windows. It wasn't until we got closer that it dawned on me. It wasn't possible. This was supposed to be it. The final bastion. And yet...

"Babe," Julia whispers. "Let's go home. Come on, it's okay. Let's go."

"No. It can't be. It can't!"

I stabbed, hacked, sliced at the building. Chunks of chocolate and fondant spray into the air. I'm covered in sugar. I kept going, boring a hole wide enough to fit my head. I look inside, but I don't have to. I already know.

The entire building was made of cake.

"Fuck! Fucking, fuck! I can't take this! I can't!"

"Tony. Put down the knife. Look at me," Julia says from behind me. I keep staring at the donut hole I carved into the building. She touches my shaking hand. I drop the knife. "We're already cake. Layers upon layers, baked by time and experience. It's cake all the way down, babe. We're just waking up to it."

We're ... already cake. 

I turn to Julia. She looks blurry through the tears pooling in my eyes. I choke, cough out, "Babe?" 

She smiles. "Yes, dear?"

I reach out and she doesn't move. When I hug her, my arms sink into her flesh. I keep squeezing, sobbing, shaking, until my arms scissor her torso in half. Everything above her shoulders splats to the ground. 

I'm covered in cake.
