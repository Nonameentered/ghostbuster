I didn't want to move. But dad got a new job in New Jersey, selling insurance or something, and mom worked from home. It wasn't like they cared about  how hard it was for me to make new friends or anything. They cared about paying *the bills*. Always the bills.

So we moved.

Jess swore we'd keep in touch. My sister from another mister. And we did -- for a while. At first, we texted every day. I'd tell her about the weird kids in my new school, their funny accents, the creepy forest near my house, whatever new fic I was reading. And she'd tell me all about Mrs. Fitzterrible's pop quizzes and how Sasha was dating someone new and the latest prank Richie Smith pulled on the seniors.

But soon I started missing little things. References to new stuff. Jess would try to explain, but she'd end up saying, "You had to be there." She said it more and more, until, eventually, it was clear that I wasn't there. That I would never be there. We started texting just once a week or so. Then it was just memes, no words. Then nothing.

Mom said I should try to make friends. That they'd spent so much money on the speech therapists, so there was no excuse for my "shyness." Dad said nothing, of course. Just grunted.

I didn't want to argue with her again. There was no winning against hypocrites. Mom spent all her time working, cleaning the house, taking her night courses. Anything to not have to spend time with us. And dad was permanently checked out. Always "tired" from work. If anything, *they* needed some freaking friends. But god forbid I point that out.

So, one day, I told them I met some kids that were cool and I was going to hang out with them. Mom was suspicious at first, asking me a bunch of questions. I'd already prepared answers based of what I thought my classmates were like. Dad said it wasn't "good to look a gift horse in the mouth." Mom shot him a look that meant I was going to need my ear plugs to sleep that night.

I broke the silence, told them I was gonna meet my new friends at the mall. They let me borrow the Jeep. But instead of meeting my imaginary friends at the mall, I drove out to the Pine Barrens. That was what they called the spooky forest near our house.

It was early November and there was a low fog everywhere. It ruled. The paths were pretty well worn. It was like some evil sorcerer set up shot and blighted the whole forest, so that all the trees were bare and gnarled and thin. I'd read online that the "Jersey Devil" lived in the forest. But I'd already met it on my first day of school. It's name was Mr. Pataki and he was my creepy new gym teacher.

As I walked the forest path, I noticed sneakers hanging from knotted laces off branches. They must have belonged to the local kids. Was it a memorial thing? I wondered. A way to honor the dead? I took some pictures on my phone.

As I was snapping some pics of a dangling pair of red Chucks, I noticed not-shoes hanging off a branch. It was a rusty old can attached to a string.

The sun was already sinking into the top of the tree line. I should have started heading back to the Jeep, but what was a few minutes?

It hung a good foot over my head, but as I reached for it, my finger tips reached the edge of the can. I must have misjudged the height. The can was icy-cold in my hand, like it'd been stored in a freezer for days. I grabbed my gloves from my coat and put them on, and even then, the cold cut through the fabric. But not enough that I couldn't hold the can.

I brought it up to my mouth and said, "Hello. Anyone there?"

I held it up to my ear and waited. Nothing.

I started laughing. I thought maybe it'd be like a conch or something. That maybe I'd hear the ocean. The Pacific. My ocean. But all I heard was the crunchy silence of a barren forest.

I let go of the can and turned back for the car.

"*Hello...?"*

I whipped back. The can swayed on its branch, attached to a tree that looked more crooked than I remembered. Like it was reaching the branch out closer to me.

"Hello?" I called out. I searched the trees for any sign of movement. Was there someone else out there? Another bored, lonely kid lying to their parents about where they were? Maybe one of the kids from school who recognized me. Yeah. Here to mess with the mumbly new girl.

"*Who's there?"* the small voice hissed. It was coming from the can.

I took a small step forward, another. My heart was racing. The fog seemed thicker. It was getting darker, the sun bleeding violet and orange into the gray overcast sky. I was utterly alone. But someone, maybe something, was calling out to me from the can.

I caught the can mid swing and held it up to my ear.

"*Hello*," the voice said. It sounded young. Like a middle schooler. "*Can anyone hear me?*"

"Yes," I replied. I forced myself to slow down, to pronounce my words as clear as I could, like the speech therapists had taught me. Most of the time I didn't care if anyone understood me. This time I did. "Hello. My name is Alex. I can hear you. Who is this?"

Silence. Then, "*Phillip. My name is Phillip. Are you -- are you real*?"

Phillip's voice was shaking. I started shaking too. He sounded so scared.

"I'm real. I'm here. Where are you?"

"*Her woods. Please. You have to help us. We don't have much time.*"

"Slow down. I don't understand."

"*Please help. She's hungry again. She's--*"

Phillip screamed and I jumped. A burning pain stretched across my cheek. I reached up and the tips of my gloves came back wet. I'd cut myself with the edge of the can.

There was a hissing coming from the can, like a balloon leaking or television static.

"Phillip? Are you okay?" I asked, then held up the can to my ear. Waiting. Hoping.

But it wasn't Phillip's voice that answered. This one was deep and harsh and rasping. It bubbled, like the words were pushing through a pond of phlegm. And it said just two words...

"*Hello, Alex.*"
