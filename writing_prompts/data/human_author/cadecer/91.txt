The lab was straight out of a b-horror flick. Bugs floating in jars on shelving, glass tubes and bottles bubbling, dozens of tomes open on tables with drawings that'd make a serial killer blush. I wasn't sure if Fileas was a chemist or mad scientist. Either way, I was going to make a potion for Lena and her aunt. It was my duty.

"Grab the mortar," Fileas said dryly. "This here's gonna take some finessin' so watch carefully and learn, Physiker."

I grabbed the stone mortar from a shelf and set it down on Fileas' work table. He lit candles and muttered something under his breath as he did. 

"Thank you," I said. "For helping."

"Not like I had much choice. Big fancy title throwing a tantrum in my shop." He turned to face me, blowing out a lighting stick. "You know, there ain't no guarantee this'll work. Them leaves is dryer than me mother's roast. Potions herbs gotta be fresh if ye lookin' to extract the necessary elements. Saying we do pull it off, the potency'll probably be down to lesser or minor potion level. Understand?"

"I guess. What does that mean?"

Fileas sighed. "It means, a greater potion's enough to treat two cases of Blood Fever. But lesser? Minor? We're only lookin' at treatin' one. And, by my guess, it's that wee lass in the cot that's gonna be gettin' it."

It was like Fileas had scooped out the inside of my chest. I started sweating. "So, one of them is going to die?"

"If that's how you wanna look at it. I see it as one of them's gonna live. Course, it'll be up to the wee lass to decide. Our job is to make the potion."

"No," I said. "That's unacceptable. Why can't we just give her a potion?"

"Wake up, boy-o--" Fileas clapped his hands. "We give that girl a potion and every Blood-case is gonna come banging on my door for more than their share. We'll have to post guards outside. Guards that'll have to push them back into sick houses or knife them in the street, because, and let me be clear here, when people get desperate they don't give a single care about their own lives -- even if they're trying to save it. That's why we've got a quota. Things are bad, aye. None of us expected that tar-sucking bastard to unleash a plague upon us. Yet, here we are. So, you understand?"

I leaned on the table, my knees shaking a little. It was like the shame was too much for my legs. Yes, I understood. I just got here and thanks to some fancy title, I was calling shots like a local, like I had any clue of what I was doing. I blew out a shaky breath. "Fileas, I'm sorry--"

Something exploded in the other room. The floorboards rumbled beneath my feet. I caught myself on the edge of the work station. "What the--"

"Oh, gods--don't tell me--" But Fileas didn't finish. Instead, he darted into the storage room and me right behind him.

Inside the storage room, it was like a bomb had gone off. Crates splintered. Bottles shattered. Bright red potion pooling on the hardwood. And standing in the middle of it all was Lena.

"Please help," she said, her voice a rough and guttural basso. "My aunties sick. We're all going to *die*." The last word stretched out into a horrid wail. 

Fileas drew a dagger from his belt. "Get back, boy-o. It's one of the Demon Lord's agents."

I stared at Lena. Little Lena who had been burning up in my arms. Now she was twitching in the middle of the storage room, her eyes completely black, sclera and all. A small voice in the back of my head was screaming for me to run, to get out of the shop and never look back. But my legs wouldn't move. 

"I said run, boy!" Fileas threw himself at Lena. 

It was like a puppy attacking a lion. With a flick of her arm, Lena batted Fileas into a wall. He landed against the wall with a sickening crunch, broke through and partially hungfrom the hole, limp.

Lena's head snapped forward and focused on me. "Please help," she repeated, taking a step forward. "My auntie's sick..."

*I'm going to die*, a voice echoed through my mind. *I came to this world, weak, useless, and now I'm going to die.*

I sank to my knees. This was all my fault. I brought her inside. I fought to save her and her aunt. But there probably was no aunt. And now an entire stock of Goldmar's potion supply was destroyed. Fileas was hurt, if not dead. And now... 

I looked up. Lena was standing before me. She raised her hand like a knife. Time slowed down as she brought down a chop meant to cut me in half.

Something sparked inside of me. An ember that'd been dormant since I arrived to this world. A voice, different from all the ones that been whispering or screaming through my mind, very calmly and with absolute certainty asked, *Would you like to use a skill?*

*Yes.*

*Fission or Fusion?*

*Ah. Fission.*

*Activating skill.*

Time sped up. I reached out my hand in a defensive gesture, made contact with Lena's karate chop, and her hand disappeared in a spray of dust. Blood spurted from the stump at her elbow. She reeled back, screaming, looking from me to her stump. Back and forth. 

Then she lunged for me with her other hand, pointed like a spear. I covered myself with my arms and she slammed into me. The impact knocked me flat on my back and I smacked my head against the floor. Stars filled my vision and I suddenly felt like throwing up.  Lena screamed again. I heard footsteps, but my vision started darkening around the edges, closing like an aperture. 

I blacked out.
