There was a boy who hated his life, though it wasn't as if he went hungry or cold -- as his parents constantly reminded him. He was like a duck in a flock of -- well, not ducks. Did badgers flock? He had two older sisters, who were not really his sisters because they came with his mother's new husband, but the boy's mother hissed and pinched at him whenever he said so. When his not-sisters weren't busy talking about boys or girls, they'd force him into a chair and try make-up on him because he shared their bronze complexion, and better to try it on him than themselves. He did not like makeup. But it kept them busy from teasing or hurting him, so he suffered through. They had a name for their little brother. They called him Blush.

They started calling him Blush after their first makeup session, and at first their parents had castigated the sisters for their bullying.

The sisters said, "It's just a nickname. You wanted us to try to include him. Well this is us trying." Their parents looked at the boy, still wearing a clown's worth of makeup and chuckled.

Maybe because names had power, no matter how much the boy scrubbed his face after his sister's cosmetic attacks, the rosiness in his cheeks never seemed to fully fade. It didn't help that he had big round cheeks that shined like apples when he smiled. And when the other boys from school heard of his new nickname, they stopped calling him Jaime and started calling him by his "true name." And soon, the only people who didn't call him Blush were the ones that didn't know him.

Eventually, he stopped smiling altogether.

His not-sisters ran track at their high school: one sprinting and the other cross country. Their father never missed a meet, and would buy McDonalds afterward for the sister who'd won gold, so he usually ended up buying McDonalds for them both. Blush didn't play any sports. His mother called herself a fashion-designer, although she mostly drew sketches of elegant suits and hung them up around the sewing machine in her little craft room. She also worked selling Mary Kay products to her girlfriends, so she called herself a small-business owner too.

Blush could not have told you when he started sneaking out at night. He wanted to run away, but he'd seen enough YouTube videos on surviving off the grid and decided that solar panels and generators and venison weren't worth the effort. Sometimes, he'd catch his sisters climbing out of their windows and heading to whatever party was happening that week. Blush patiently waited until they vanished west down the road, then snuck out to his favorite place.

Blush was a pudgy twelve-year-old, short, with a shock of black hair and a sleepy expression. He looked like he belonged on the cover of a Benetton ad or on the side of a milk carton.

After his sisters were out of sight, Blush heaved himself over his window sill and dropped to the soft grass below with a plop. He walked east down the road until the sidewalk melted away, so when any cars came past he would edge over into the ditch, to safety.

The last of the sun sank into the thick tree line and blazed the horizon with purple fire before giving way to the first stars of the night. He remembered something he had read in a book once: that sunrise and sunset were when the veil between worlds were at its thinnest. He'd always wanted to be a wizard, but he didn't know if Mexican kids were allowed. He shuffled his way up a gravel path that lead to a looming iron gateway, rusted part open, part closed.

As he wedged himself between a gap in the gate, he wondered if tonight was the night his mother would lift the covers on his bed and reveal the pillows lined up in replica of his body. He imagined her running out into the road, hauling her husband behind, and rushing into the woods with nothing but flashlights and a burning desire to find her missing little boy. But he'd been sneaking out for months now, so the odds seemed slim.

There were dozens of stones of all sizes spread throughout the dying grass. Blush walked the rows of faded or vine covered stones, soil crunching beneath his feet. He stopped before a pair of stones, blasted nearly blank by wind and rain and time, and imagined his not-sister's names on the stones. His mother's husband would leave, the marriage unrepairable. It would be just the two of them again. A sudden shame burned in his chest, and he banished the fantasy from his mind.

Above him, the moon was sort of full, still as yellow as cheese, and he wondered if there were werewolves out there staring up too -- waiting for their one night to be themselves.

A voice said, "You're not from around here."

He turned, not scared, not yet, and looked around him. Stones. Long grass. "Who's there?" he demanded, putting on his best wizardly voice. "Reveal yourself!"

Something he'd mistaken for a shadow moved, beside a gnarled tree on the edge of the graveyard, and saw a girl that must have been his age, maybe a little older. "What are you doing here?"

"I'm out for my night walk," said Blush.

"What's a night walk?" asked the girl.

He cocked his head to the side. "It's a walk. At night. A night walk. Don't you know anything?"

"I know lots," she replied with a smirk. She had long, dark hair that spilled like ink over her shoulders in the moonlight. "Plenty, in fact. But I don't know you. And I know everyone here. What's your name?"

"Jaime," said Blush. And then, "But everyone calls me Blush."

"What do you want to be called?"

"Um--Jaime. Jaime. What do they call you?"

The girl hesitated. "Here," she said.

"Oh. Like, who's on first."

"Who?"

Blush chuckled. "Never mind. That's a cool name, Here."

Here said, "There was more, but it's missing now."

Blush brightened. "Like a mystery?"

"Sort of," said Here. "More like a puzzle. But I haven't been able to figure it out. Wanna help?"

Blush nodded eagerly.

It was a perfect early September night, still dragging the summer heat behind it, but dipping into the October chill, and the Autumn moon hung low and fat in the night sky. It was almost as clear as day.

"Which way to your stone?" asked Blush.

Here hiked up her skirt with one hand and took Blush's with the other. She pulled him to an overgrown patch of grass. There, she urged Blush forward and the boy folded over the tall grass. The stone was flat on its back and broken into four large chunks. The dates, still legible, were from a hundred years back. Three of the four chunks were covered in thick vines, but the fourth was not and there was one word still carved into the stone:

HERE

Blush tore away the vines from the other fragments, breathing harder from the effort, and once cleared, he pushed the heavy pieces together until finally, the completed stone read:

HERE LIES

MARTHA SHEP

"Martha," said Blush. "Martha â€¦ probably Shepard? Or Shepriguez. Could always be Shepriguez.

"Martha," she repeated wistfully. "I don't know about Shepriguez. Sounds a little off."

They didn't say much as they left the stone. Here took Blush by the hand, and they walked in step up to the gate.

"Thanks," said Here. "That puzzle's been gnawing at me for ages."

"I had fun," said Blush.

"Me too," said Here. "Are you coming back, Jaime?"

Above, clouds shifted and half-covered the moon. The graveyard darkened, but not enough that Blush couldn't make out the expectant look and Here's face.

"Yeah." He smiled -- bright, like a freshly polished apple. "I'd like that."
