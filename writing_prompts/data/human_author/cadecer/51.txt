"A cursed bracelet?" Van said. "That be your mission?"

"It's *the* mission," I said. "If the Witch Queen gets this bracelet, it's all over for us."

Not that there was much left. The main road into Keld was half absorbed back into nature; grass, weeds, and shrubs had reclaimed what they could. No one dared leave their homes long enough to clear the road. Most of the roofs had collapsed and in some cases had taken the entire house with it. Others looked in decent enough shape and were simply dirty and packed with multiple families. Keld was a mere distant memory of better times, but even my grandfather hadn't seen those days. No one had.

Van nodded. "But only rumors say the Witch Queen be hiding away in her ivory tower,” he said. “Legends hundreds of years old. The Night King be taking people here, now."

I glowered at him. "I'm aware."

"Awareness no be action," he said, pointing to a cracked window. "Those people be counting on us to keep them safe."

"Don't you think I know that!" I shouted. "That bastard took my little brother."

He opened his mouth and closed it, his vigor draining away. "Then we take down the Night King," he said. "We bring the dawn ... together."

"I can't," I said, holding up the golden bracelet. "This is bigger than some vampire. Bigger than you or me or--" *Armin*... "--people die. I can't change that. But I can destroy this. *I* can do that. With or without you."

\*\*\*

I rode out of the village alone--not counting Cloud, my horse. Fortunately the putrid aura radiating from the bracelet scared off most of the Night King's minions. It took an incredible amount of fortitude to resist the bracelet's taint. I was the chosen one after all, just like Van.

The road was empty, and the sun just started sinking into the treeline.

"For the Witch Queen!"

The voice bubbled out from behind me. I glanced over my shoulder and saw three robed figures shambling toward me holding daggers. The Witch Queen's cultists.

"Shamar'Ghul will never get her prize," I shouted at them, "so long as I draw breathe. *Infirgo*!"

The cultist didn't even slow down as my fire spell engulfed them. Their twisted, deformed bodies writhed in the flames until too burned to stand.

Which was worse? Killed by an ancient vampire or turned into a mindless horror by an eldritch goddess?

As the cultist's remains burned in the middle of the road, still twitching, I ignored the cold bracelet around my left wrist.

"I'll end you, witch," I said to no one and everyone.

\*\*\*

Van was furious. I was wrapping my left arm with fresh bandages. He was getting an update from one of his volunteer soldiers, a Keldian no more than a year or two older than what Armin should have been was rattling off the number of dead after the Night King's forces most recent raid on the refugee camps.

"How can you be sitting there silent?" Van asked.

"Like this," I said. "It helps if you don't condescend to me."

Van shook his head solemnly, waving the Keldian soldier away. It made him look like father too tired to explain why the sky was blue to his child.

"We be meeting here for a reason," he said. "Do you no be seeing that?"

"I do," I said. "The Night King's Keep is on the way to the Witch's Forest. It only makes sense that I'd run into you eventually. But that doesn't mean I have to help you get all these people killed. Just as you don't have to ride into the forest with me."

"What would your brother think?" he said, his voice barely a whisper.

"Nothing," I said. "Because he's dead. Just like all these *soldiers* are going to be if you lead them against that monster. But I suppose maybe it's better they die than end up twisted into shambling abominations."

Van glared at me. He knew I was right. I flexed my hand but didn't feel the motion. The bracelet's taint was spreading.

"Well, it's been a pleasure. I hope to see you on the road back," I added.

Van drew his short sword and pointed it at my chest. "We help these people, now," he growled.

I grabbed the blade's end with my bandaged hand. If it cut me, I didn't notice. The blade started turning black and Van dropped it before the taint reached the hilt.

"You ever point a sword at me again, it'll be the last thing you do," I said, but Van was already stalking away to his ramshackle army. Fine. Let them die.

There was only one chosen one. One.

\*\*\*

The Band of the Black Hand were waiting for me on the road to the forest, a knot of bandits and mercenaries with black cloths wrapped around their left hands. They rode behind me in silence, aside from their horse's hooves pounding the hard-packed dirt, and if any cultists attempted an ambush, the Band knew enough to soak the bastards in oil and set them aflame.

My own Band. They were with me.

I looked back at the refugee camp. There should have been more.

One of the soldiers, a thick-necked, bearded brigand with a long scar cutting down his left cheek started singing a song.

*We'll ride all night till the moon do cry*

*And cut through wood and cursed vine*

*And burn the men that do no die*

*To end the Witch's terror.*

I couldn't help but sing along.

The bearded brigand turned, and gave me a big grin and a nod. I nodded back.

The song continued, on and on, and when it ended another started.

Once the bracelet was destroyed, we'd crush the Night King. Me and the Band of the Black Hand. Together.

\*\*\*

"Take off the bracelet," said Van. "Don't you be seeing what it's done to you?"

His volunteer army wore steel breastplates and white cloaks with golden suns embroidered over their hearts. They looked battle hardened. Still, they were mere mortals. The Witch Queen could break their wills with nothing but a whisper. How had they all made it this deep into the forest?

"It's not too late," I said. "Help me destroy the bracelet and then we can go crush the Night--"

"Take it off!" he shouted. "Look around you."

"Enough," I said. "If you're not with me, your against me, Van. Get your mortals out of my way."

"Or what?" he said.

"Or I'll have my Band remove them."

Van pointed his blade at me. His face twisted into something pained and confused, like a dog that'd been beat for no reason, his eyes wide and hard and desperate.

"Look at them!" he shouted. "They no be men!"

Of course. Just because those following me had been criminals, people who'd made mistakes, they didn't meet Van's standards. Self-righteous prick.

"Move," I said. "Or I will not hold back. My power is the Band's power. This *is* your final warning, Van."

"I be sorry it came to this," he said, and tears rolled down his cheeks. "Light save me, I be so sorry I didn't see it sooner. I'm sorry."

Too late for apologies. Far, far too late. I pointed a blackened finger at the white-cloaked militia and ordered the Band to attack.

They shambled forward, daggers at the ready.

I did warn him.

\*\*\*

I alone survived the battle. Three hundred white-cloaked soldiers perished along with my Band of thirteen. So did Van, of course. He'd been chosen to slay a mere vampire, and I was chosen to destroy a god. The outcome was obvious.

When I entered the tower, I found it uninhabited. Candles and torches flickered to life as I ascended the familiar spiraling staircase.

The throne, empty, looked so comfortable. All those padded cushions.

It called to me, as if I was chosen.
