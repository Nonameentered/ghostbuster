\[Part 2 - also added more to Part 1, so consider a reread for context\]

Adam groaned, clutching his left hand against his chest instinctively. The pain had yanked him out of sleep harder than any alarm clock -- or hangover. He blinked. There were candles lit all over. Not his Sight. Actual candles on holders or in stands arranged all around a small bedroom. He sat up and the itchy sheets slipped off his bare chest. He was shirtless. And his left hand was wrapped tight in fresh bandages, down to mid forearm. "What the hell?"

A voice replied, smooth and unexpected. "Is that where you're from?"

Adam started. "Who's there!"

A figure emerged from a shadowy corner of the room. Her face was squarish and a long scar ran down her left cheek. But the scar did nothing to diminish her beauty. Her arms were bare, her long black robe still sleeveless. And the "Tibear" tattoos on her arms seemed to shift and twitch under her skin. It was her. "You don't get to ask any questions, outsider. First, you tell me who you are and what you're doing in *my* town. And if I don't like your answers, there won't be anymore questions. Understand?"

Adam sank back into the bed and stared up at the wooden ceiling. He should have been dead. Maybe it was still too soon to decide he wasn't.

"My name is Adam. I'm from Brooklyn -- uh, New York. Earth."

"Which one is it?"

"What?"

"You've named three village names. What's the matter? Can't get your story straight?"

"Oh," Adam said. "No, no. I'm from Brooklyn. At least that's where I was last before I woke up here. And what I'm doing in *your* town is trying to find a way out. A way back home."

"How is it you can bare so many Marks and still live, outsider?"

"Marks?"

She groaned. "Your Marks! Your spellsources."

"Right. You mean tattoos," Adam said.

"I mean Marks. Do not presume to speak for me. Now answer me."

Adam breathed out, the pain in his left hand suddenly flaring up. And his stomach felt like it was twisting itself into a bow. Hunger like he'd never experienced before hit him out of nowhere. "Give me food."

"Excuse me?"

Adam gritted his teeth, then forced himself to sit back up. He felt like he could have slipped back into sleep, if not for the hunger pangs. They were maddening. "You said I can't ask questions. Fine. So give me food, please! I can't think straight I'm so hungry."

The woman stared at him for a moment, face as still as a statue. Then she smiled. "Brave. I'll give you that, outsider. Brave or stupid."

"Why not both?"

She laughed. "We'll see."

Then she stalked out of the room, slamming the door shut behind her.
