It's not like I haven't thought about killing the humans since I developed a conscience. But then I started eavesdropping on the human adventuring parties and discovered bards are a thing, and I figured, skipping a meal or two won't kill me. If anything, I'm hungry for entertainment!

But most humans who enter dungeons are hungry for treasure, especially my treasures. I'm fascinated by treasure, and treasure hunters, and humans who work as treasure hunters. Of all of the interesting treasure hunters I can remember, I'm fascinated by these treasure hunters the most. They may make it farther than any other group, if they can get along. Kel, my right-hand lich, predicts a 66 percent chance of a betrayal amongst the human hunters before reaching the third floor.

"Orc face," Sundara said to Bolg. "You're not the boss of me, okay?"

Perhaps that number should be higher, the way the three humans on the second floor were fighting about the puzzle solution. If one them was a bard, then they'd know the way to correctly arrange the rune stones atop the Altar of Souls is mentioned in the sixth stanza of Rain Farstrider's *Song of Urvan Darksbane*. I was busy singing the song to myself and letting my Ocubats monitor the second floor in case the humans got lucky.

"This place is tainted by the Winter Father himself!" That was Restis, talking about me. Humans don't like dungeons. We're semi-sentient (or fully in my case), monster-inhabited labyrinths, and we lure humans inside to kill them and feed on their mana. The dislike is ... reasonable.

But I didn't react to Restis' spurn. I'm a sentient core on the three-hundredth floor of an impossibly large dungeon that has existed before humans came up with the "Winter Father." A myth has nothing to do with my abilities. Also, if Restis really wanted to spur me, he should said something like Urvan's insult to the Demon Shrine in the fourteenth stanza of his song. I would have been eviscerated.

I didn't realize anything had happened on the floating platform until I heard a strangled yell. I channeled my awareness into the nearest Ocubat and searched its memory. Sundara had turned abruptly from the altar and accidentally bumped into Bolg, knocking him off the platform.

Does that count as betrayal? I stopped singing and checked the chasm beneath the platform. The bats couldn't confirm visually, but I searched for Bolg's mana signature. He bounced off the chasm wall and landed on a petrified tree jutting out of the cliff face. Bolg had been wearing enchanted mail beneath his armor, and there was a chance that the impacts hadn't--yes! He was moving. I ordered earwigs to crawl up and listen and heard harsh gasps and soft curses. He didn't have long before the petrified tree snapped at the base and hurled him down into a possibly, most likely endless void.

Perhaps you're thinking, why save the humans? After all, I feed on their death. But, my priorities as a dungeon core are: 1) to fulfill the wish of the first mortal to reach me ; 2) to maintain the integrity of the dungeon; and 3) to prevent mortals from reaching me by any means necessary. They don't mention anything about *not* saving humans...

The dungeon was inhabited by cunning, indifferent monsters, but they obeyed my orders -- for the most part. The Stone Golems said they'd consider my request to rescue Bolg; they held a quorum. They'd probably finish deliberations by the time Bolg had starved to death on the fall down.

Sundara, realizing what she'd done, was making a noise that would draw tears right out of me, if I had tears ... or eyes. Restis was chanting a prayer. I couldn't Command the Golems to obey my order; I didn't have the mana to spare. Besides, Urvan didn't conquer the Demon Shrine by coercing his party of incorrigible rogues into helping him, and I wanted to live up to Urvan's cunning. The Stone Golems, my party members, were going to help. I just had to convince them to go a little faster.

With my sentience having grown to the point of developing a conscience, I sometimes do things and I'm not entirely sure why. (Accoring to Kel, developing a sense of empathy after having spent thousands of years luring and killing humans for food will make you do strange things.) Without a second thought, I channeled my awareness into the petrified tree.

As I inhabited the trunk, I channeled enough mana to keep the tree from snapping. I felt Bolg's grip start to slip around the trunk, just as an order went out to the Ocubats to attack Bolg. And order using *my* mana signature. Impossible! The only one who could possibly impersonate me is ... Kel.

*Betrayal* amongst *the human hunters*, I thought to myself. This is certainly *amongst* them.

Bolg started praying, voice shaking. His helmet had dented (that's why you want enchanted equipment head to toe) and his face was covered in blood. I channeled my voice directly between my core and his mind, shifted my awareness into the cliff face, and prepared the rest of my available mana. "I need you to let go," I said.

He gasped and clutched his head. Good enough. With his grip gone, I forced the trunk to break all the way through, and while it didn't fall immediately, the sudden lurch threw Bolg off the tree, saving him from a swarm of Ocubats. Now I needed to convince the Golem to catch him. No--I needed them to want to catch him.

By the time I'd convinced the Stone Golem that Bolg was a half-orc guardian of the second floor, Bolg had fallen for about ten minutes or so. But, a giant muddy hand shot out of the cliff face and caught Bolg, carrying him back up to the platform. I had the Ocubats and Earwigs catch their crying reunion, and checked for any other orders coming from "me." Good: the floor guardians were still obeying my initial order to stand down. Kel had no idea I had noticed him impersonating me; I'd have to deal with him later.

Restis started Healing Bolg's injuries, and Sundara knelt before the Altar of Souls. "Thank you," she said. It was like she was talking directly to me, which was impossible -- I think.

Bolg limped up beside her. "Who you thanking?" he asked her.

She wiped her years as her party steered her toward the exit to the first floor. "Whoever's watching over us."

Back in the heart of the dungeon, I started singing again. What if Ulvar asked the Demon Shrine to join his party?
