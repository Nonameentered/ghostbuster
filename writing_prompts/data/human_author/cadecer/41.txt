"Fancy seeing you again," says the hangman, adjusting my hood.

I cannot see through the hood, but I do not need eyes to know what is happening. The hangman's hot breath seeps through the itchy woolen sack over my head. Spiced mutton and cheap wine, of course. 

"A little joke for the dearly departed," he adds then tugs the noose sharply. Once, twice. Ready.

The midday sun beams through the hood, a white spot fuzzing around the edges overhead. Sweat runs down my face harder than the Twin Rivers, stinging my eyes. I bring up my bound hands and wipe my face against the hood. 

The crowd is cheering. All of Glen Ferry came out for this particular hanging. Kasban the Horsetaker finally hangs. Jackals the lot of them. What do they know of me? Of what I'v been through? Did they know it'd been a decade since I'd last stolen a horse? No, of course not. 

My crime, my *true* crime could not be tried in any mortal court. But a lifetime of theft left enough rope for a magistrate to tie a noose.

"Any last words?" asks the hangman.

I kick off my left boot then the right, blindly toeing the soft leather upright and before me with the smoothness of practice.

"Make sure these go to a kid," I whisper. As if it matters. They'd be back on my feet shortly.

Marlow grunts and stomps away toward the lever, of course. 

Not much time left. What was I supposed to do with ten seconds? Ten! What sort of life was this? I clench my toes, digging into the wooden planks. She promised I'd live forever. Forever! 

*But I cannot say* how *you will live...*

Her voice tinkles like wind chimes in my mind. I close my eyes. She's there, a pale figure in the darkness behind the hood, draped in shadows as thick as silk. Just like how I found her.

The crowd cheers. Marlow must have his hands on the lever.

South of Glen Ferry rests the ruins of Mandolhar. The King's law forbids entry, but treasure hunter obey only one law — the law of First Claim. I was no horsetaker, not anymore. Many a night did I curl up out under the stars and warm myself with dreams and possibilities. But what I found in those crumbling ruins wasn't gold or gems. It was Her.

Beneath the half-collapsed temple in the heart of the dead city was a cavern. Crystals jutted out of the stone walls and floor, glowing sickly green. The light hit me harder than a month at sea. But I persisted. Because there, beneath the inky black waters of that massive underground lake, immortality waited.

I hear the gears cough. One moment I stood atop a platform, the next my feet are kicking air. Sometimes my neck broke. A mercy, those times. This time, it did not. The rope bites into my neck, tighter, harder. Stars twinkle to life in my vision. I gasp. No breath for me. Not yet.

Mandolhana emerged from the ebon lake, soaking wet. Silk dress darker than a moonless night pressed firmly against her body, skin paler than death. Great silver manacles bound her wrists and ankles to heavy chains sinking beneath the water. Yet, she rose and stood and walked across the lake, stopping at the shore where I waited.

"Free me, mortal," she said. "Free me and know my gift."

"Yes," I whispered. "Of course."

I picked the locks on her manacles, one by one. With each she moaned and writhed with either ecstasy or impatience. Desire wrestled with fear over control of my heart. Either way, it raced and my fingers trembled working the final manacle. Then she was free.

"I want to live forever," I said, staring up at her. Her pure black eyes stared down at me like a raven would a worm. Calculating. I held up her manacles, shook them. "I have freed you, witch. I claim my gift."

She tapped a black nail against her bottom lip. "This can be done," she said. "But I cannot guarantee *how* you will live..."

"I don't care."

She smiled. "Then neither shall I."

Darkness, true darkness, creeps in from the edges of my vision. I can not hear the crowd. I can not feel the noose around my neck. Ten seconds. That is all the time I have. All the time in the world. All I deser—

"Fancy seeing you again," says the hangman, adjusting my hood.

I cannot see through the hood, but I do not need eyes to know what is happening.
