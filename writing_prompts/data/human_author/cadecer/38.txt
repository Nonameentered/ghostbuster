When I first started working in the Left Hand Path, the neighborhood wasn't all yoga studios and iced coffees, not yet. This was pre-gentrified Brooklyn. Drug dealers still owned the parks. Rent was still under a thousand bucks. The streets weren't safe at night -- for anyone.

So when old John Dink decided to retire and leave me in charge of his precious dive bar, I wasn't sure if it was a gift or a fuck you. But I was new in town. No friends, no savings, no career aside from making two ends meet. All I had was my binder with my 25-year plan all laid out and laminated.

John knew my situation. He also didn't leave me much of a choice. I showed up for my shift one night and I found the place locked up. When I got in using the spare, I found a set of keys and a note explaining my promotion.

The Left Hand Path was a hole in the wall. Couldn't hold more than twenty even if they stood shoulder to shoulder. So running it alone wasn't a problem. Most folk ordered beers or shots or beers with shots. An old coot like John could have run the place easy even if he'd gone senile. Especially considering he worked the day shift. No one came to the Left Hand Path during the day. Not even drunks.

My first morning working the Path (head still splitting from two too many shots the night before) I found a guy sleeping in the door way like some Dickensian factory worker, floppy cap tucked down low and pulling a gray woolen jacket around himself tight. Thick brown hair covered the back of his hands, and his snores sounded closer to growls.

He didn't bother me as I shoved up the heavy metal grates over the front doors and the windows, so I didn't bother him. He wanted to sleep there? Cool. Hope he didn't mind rat bites.

Inside, I clicked on the lights which flickered before settling on a weak, yellow hum. The place still smelled of off-brand disinfectant and pine. Seven stools sat upside down atop the scratched-up bar. Three booths lined the wall opposite the bar. The place felt like a coffin. Cozy.

When I finished opening the place up, I walked over to the front door and before I could flip the sign over to Open, the door swung open. It was Dickens. It turned out he didn't just have hair on the back his hands, he also had it all over his face. I remember as a kid seeing the National Inquirer at the grocery checkout line with a cover claiming they'd found a werewolf working as a circus act in Mexico. Of course, it turned out he wasn't a werewolf. Just a Mexican with Hypertrichosis. Being in the know, I nodded at Dickens without flinching or grimacing at his appearance and waved him inside.

He ordered one of the mixed drinks on the ancient chalkboard hanging behind me over the mirror. And god save me if he didn't have a British accent.

*\[Hair of the Dog --* Two parts whiskey, one part egg yoke, one part cow's blood\]

It was a joke. That's what old John had said when I asked about it, but he still made me learn every drink on that board and had me stock the mini fridge below the bar with ingredients meant more for a witch's brew (one of the drinks on the board) than a cocktail.

"You sure?" I asked Dickens. "It's pretty gross."

He looked up from the bar with baby blue eyes. "You drink it too?"

I nodded. "I've tried them all. Part of the job."

Dickens seemed almost disappointed when he looked back down at the bar and asked for his drink again.

I obliged.

No one else came into the Path as the man worked on his drink; half way through the bloody, runny mixture he started talking. He spoke about the weather and the trains and, soon enough, he was telling a story.
