"Will you hurry up, Riko!"

Considering how many packs she carried, including her plate armor and sword and backup sword, the fact Ploma could manage to complain as we sprinted through the Witch Wood served as a testament to her ridiculous stamina. I wasn't doing as well.

"Wait... hold... on," I panted.

Ploma dug her heels like a horse, kicking up mud and rocks as she slowed. Behind us, the three mercs we picked up at Junji Village wasted no time lighting pipes and sipping from canteens that most certainly did not smell of water.

"We might as well," Ploma said, shrugging into her armor. "The entrance is just around the bend."

Swallowing huge gulps of air, I managed to catch my breath enough to speak without gasping like a drowining fish.

"Let me bless your sword," I said. The Witch Wood was home to more than just fel-touched sorcerers. Undead, wraiths, and even lesser demons all called this bog home. Which meant any dungeons springing up here were certain to contain the same within. Of course, Ploma didn't even blink at my warning before running off to recruit a party. "Stop wriggling!"

"I do not like how it glows!" she fussed. "I might as well hold a giant banner and blow a horn announcing myself."

The mercs laughed and muttered behind us. They hadn't believed us to be actual Dungeoneers. Too young they'd said. Or worse, too *pretty*. As if a scruffy gang of cutpurses was better suited to dungeoneering. But they changed their tune once our coin touched their palms. The Grimjow Boys were at our service. Great.

"Promise me we'll go," I said, finishing the blessing. If the drops from the monsters were outside of our fence's network, then there was no point in clearing and harvesting the place. Lumber? Tubers? Salt? That was how we made our coin. But neither of us had the connections to sell gold or gems, even metal ore. "Ploma, I won't go inside if you don't promise."

"*Fine*," Ploma rolled her eyes so hard I thought she'd suffered a seizure. "Now let's go before the guilders show up."

"They won't," I said.

It was true. I wasn't an oracle by any means, but sometimes I dreamt of dungeons. Could see them appear somewhere and simply know where they were. The Guild sent parties to seize control of any new dungeons, expedited thanks to their airships or ship ships. But independents like us? Boot and hoof. That was all. But I'd dreamt of the Witch Wood dungeon last night. It was only a day's ride away. The guild would learn about it soon, but not soon enough.

The dungeon entrance, a dungeon so new it hadn't even been named yet, looked like a mouth opening on the side of a rocky hill covered with gnarled, leafless trees. The depressions above the mouth made the formation look like a monstrous skull. I muttered a silent prayer, blessing my mace, and stayed nearly glued to Ploma's heels.

"No one is here," Ploma said, nearly beaming at me. "We really beat them."

"Let's not lose our lead then. Go on."

Really, I was afraid of losing my nerve. But Ploma never did. Even facing death, she'd raise her chin and talk down to it. As long as she kept moving forward, so could I. Though I'd never admit it to her.

"Place gives me the creeps," said one of the mercenaries in his sing-songy yet gruff, Iskander accent. He wasn't alone.

Stalactites seemed to bore down overhead like spikes in an Iron Maiden. Shadows danced all around us, shifting with the light from our weapons. A breeze blew from the bowels of the dungeon, carrying the sickly sweet smell of decay. We hadn't gone more than two dozen paces and already my stomach somersaulted.

"Just one," Ploma muttered to herself. "One boogum and we'll know."

"Maybe we shouldâ€”" the sound of clicking and clacking stole my breath.

Ploma pointed her sword ahead. A white skeletal face emerged from the darkness and clattered into the light.

"Skelimen!" Ploma shouted.

A fist of the skeletal warriors, draped in rotting leather and wielding rusted weapons, charged our group. The mercenaries darted around us and charged the Skelimen.

Daggers and short swords slashed and glanced. One of the mercenaries howled as a one-armed Skeliman stabbed its jagged, broken forearm into the mercenary's thigh. The other two leapt to his defense, freeing up the rest of the undead soldiers to charge us.

Ploma is only one year older than me, nineteen years old. Daughter of Lord Brich, a respectable country lord governing my home village, she was trained in politics, rhetoric, manners. Fully prepared for the life of courts and intrigues, her duty was to marry well and preserve her house. Of course, she learned more than politics and rhetoric. Ploma Brich was also trained in the sword.

She danced like a leaf on a river. Ebb and Flow, a stance weaving a seemingly chaotic stream of attacks and parries, switched into Thunder From Above, cleaving a Skeliman in two, switched into Mist on the Lake, a purely defensive stance melting between blows, finished with Swallow Rises, dropping the last two Skelimen with one upward strike.

"Behind you, paladin!" shouted one of the mercs.

A Skelimage floated into the light, green flames flickering in its eye sockets. It raised a scepter and hissed something in the tongue of the dead. A spell was coming.

I am not a priest, not really. While the Archon's Second Decree allowed anyone, from any station, to join the church, they still turned some away. My dreams didn't always happen while I was asleep. They can happen anytime. Like, for example, in the middle of the church's entrance exam. Afflicted. That's what they labeled me. I thought I'd never be a priest. But the Light did not demand a fancy robe or some sacred badge pinned on by a bishop. The Light came to those who believed. Those needed her grace.

I raised my mace, which served more as a focus than a weapon in my stringy, scholar arms, and called upon the Light. Divinity poured through me, warm and sweet and knowing. Golden fireflies danced across my vision until all I saw was burning white.

Though I could not see, I knew a beam of light touched down atop the Skelimage, surrounding it in a golden tower. It burned. But darkness took me.
