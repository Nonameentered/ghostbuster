Old man Amos was already at his spot at the head of the bonfire, puffing on his wooden pipe. Sunset further chilled the already frigid June night. It was going to be a cold winter.

The graying Teller wrapped himself tighter with a black poncho he claims to have woven himself from pure llampaka wool which he apparently sheared with nothing but a razor blade. We ignore the fact that Marta, his wife, weaves ponchos for the caravan using plain old sheep's wool. The old man liked to ruffle his feathers for the younglings, so we let him.

I take my seat beside Cal and interlace fingers with my husband's perma-warm hands. He turns and smiles, his dark face more wrinkled than I remember. It feels like only yesterday that we'd started sneaking off to make out behind the supply carts and now we've spent three migrations sharing the same tent. I rest my hand on my bump without thinking about it. Soon, it'd be three of us sharing a tent.

Meister, our notch-eared gray tabby, sprung up out of nowhere and landed in Cal's lap, purring up a storm. Cal stroked the black stripe down Meister's back obediently.

Correction, there'd be four of us sharing a tent.

Amos, our caravan's prestigious Teller, stands and clears his throat. Underlit by the roaring bonfire, he loomed over the circle of caravani gathered around him. He seemed to be enjoying himself extra tonight.

Tomorrow we'd start our journey south for the winter. For some children, this would be their first migration. Same for those who joined our caravan, usually travelers or traders looking for safety in numbers for a little while. The journey south was dangerous, of course. And so it was Amos' duty as Teller to teach the children about the blight and the sickness and our furry guardians.

I reach over and scratch Meister under the chin and he leans into my hand. Then, Amos starts speaking...

Once upon a time, there was a youngling named Geiger. Geiger lived with his family and the rest of his caravan, traveling the scorched plains from settlement to settlement, as was their way. Geiger loved his parents, and his two little sisters, but he also loved exploring. And as the caravan crossed the broken plains season after season, Geiger stared out at the ancient ruins of cities long dead and dreamed.

Why? Because hidden in those decrepit buildings, buried beneath rubble and dust and decay, if you were lucky, was treasure. Steel tools, unspoiling food, weapons, books, gold.

Everyday, young hunters left the caravan in search of riches, in search of fame. Few ever came back. Those that did never lived more than a tenweek. The caravan elders knew why, especially the oldest and wisest among themâ€”elder Namos. In his great and handsome wisdom, he knew the reason why the caravan never stops longer than a season, why they never, ever settled within cities.

Why? Because of the Blight.

Elder Namos reminded the young hunters every night around the campfires, as was his sworn duty. Some listened. Others didn't. It only cost them their lives.

You see, the caravani's ancestors did always not live in bands, wandering the wastes, ever in search of water and shade. No. Before the Cataclysm, people lived in towers of glass that scraped the sky and slept on beds made of solid air and poured water into their basins from spouts that never ran dry. They were magicians, and the mightiest amongst them could blight a city with nothing but the turn of a key. Eventually, they did. Now, all that remains are ruined cities that corrupt the flesh, killing with certainty, with merciless cruelty. This is the magician's legacy; this was the caravani's inheritance.

Still, Geiger planned on exploring the most famous of the ruins, Nujork City, when their caravan made its next stop. He knew staying in the ruins longer than a night was embracing death. But the older hunters, ones like his father, always came back from foraging the ruins. What did they know that Geiger and the rest of the younglings didn't? And why wouldn't they tell them?

Geiger couldn't ask his father. He was one of the afflicted during the last migration. It wasn't only cities that carried the blight. Sometimes, according to elder Namos, an Ill Wind blew from one of the ruined cities, carrying the Blight on its current. Those afflicted wither away within weeks. There's no rhyme or reason to it, just how it goes sometimes. That's what Geiger told himself, anyway.

On the road to the Southern Yonklands, their next stop, Geiger's mother tried convincing him not to forage the ruins of Nujork City. She reminded Geiger that he was two years too young to even test for hunter, let alone go off and explore ruins alone. But what she wouldn't admit was that his family was struggling to keep up with the rest of the caravan. They received charity of course, but trade was the lifeblood of the caravani. If a family couldn't forage to find goods to trade at bazaars and settlements, they were a weight on the caravan. Ever since Geiger's father died, they'd been getting by on the mercy of others. No one expected Geiger's mother to forage, not with a limp as bad as hers. How long would that charity last? Geiger asked himself, almost daily.

He wasn't going to find out.

On the night the caravan settled in the Southern Yonklands, Geiger slung an empty pack over his shoulder, glanced back to his sleeping mother, arms wrapped around both of his little sisters, and sneaked out of their tent into the dead of night.

The ruins of Nujork City was only an hour's walk south, across the Brawnks river. Geiger made it in half the time. He wasn't the strongest amongst the younglings, but he could run like death was nipping at his heels.

Crossing the bridge, Geiger stared up at the ruined towers of Nujork, walls crumbled to expose iron skeletons. The streets were empty save for abandoned horseless-carriages and the occasional shifting shadow. Geiger slowed his breath. The charcoal packed into his breather would last four hours so long as he kept his breathing nice and even.

A shadow flickered on the edge of his vision. Geiger whipped to the right, knife in hand, and stopped. An orange tabby padded out from the shadows and plopped down in front of Geiger. He'd heard about cats from elder Namos in stories, but only in passing. They were supposed to be guardians, meant to protect humans from plague by hunting the rats that carried disease. Geiger tore a piece of smoked tack from his belt pouch and offered it to the tabby. The orange cat accepted the offering, chomping down the tack and rubbing against Geiger's leg in gratitude.
