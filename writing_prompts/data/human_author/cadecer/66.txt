Ask anyone in the Seven Kingdoms what they know of the history of rune printing, and it is certain that -- if they know anything beyond the condemnations -- they'll start with a name: Ohan Tenberg. 

In Farfala and Bralor, Tenberg's name is not only synonymous with the birth of the rune press, but the bloody wars it sparked. The mass distribution of unchecked spells is said to have caused the greatest loss of life in the history of humanity.

But I ask you -- can one man truly be held responsible for the conflicts of nations? Or, were the wars between the Seven Nations inevitable? 

I do not have the answers. But as my master once said, to safely look forward you must first look back.

\*\*\*

Scattered villages marked the border of Bralor, and fields where tired farmers trudged their arid lands. It was said that Mentz was the sort of town where mirth came to die. A city of dust and wind and debt. A sign creaked above a door of a storefront, red brick and thatch-roofed like every other building along the street. The storefront's carved sign proclaimed the Carver's Cove.

Shielding my eyes from the dust, I ran around the building to the back entrance. If there was anyone watching, I could not say. I was not of mind to consider such things. My parcel consumed my attention. 

Inside, Master Tenberg was at his desk, chiseling and sweating. He looked up as I entered the workshop and set down his tools. 

"Was there any trouble?" he asked, stroking his ashen beard. It'd been darker when I first started as his apprentice. In only two years, I'd watched the man age like a date in the sun. 

"No, master," I said, setting the parcel down on his workstation. "I expected Markus to change the arrangement, at least ask for a few shinnings more. But he handed me the casts without even trying."

"Hmm. That's unlike him. Well, never mind that. Let's see it then."

I opened the leather bag and pulled out the wooden box Markus the jeweler had handed over to me moments earlier. Inside the box were not rings or gems or chains. They were orichalcum rune sets. Each set, the length and thickness of your first finger, was tipped with the impression of one of the twenty runes of power. 

Master Tenberg's eyes looked upon them as if the Creator had cast them personally, a gift from the heavens. Or a test.

"Shall we try them?" he said, more to himself. "Yes. Yes we should."

When I first came to Mentz, I was lost. I'd left my village headed north for the city of Strafheim, looking to enroll in the Scrivener's Guild. I'd always had a knack for drawing, and while I never dared try my hand at runes, the local lord took me on as a scribe's assistant. Lord Juten sponsored my journey to Strafheim, my application fee, even wrote me a letter of recommendation.  

I found my way to Strafheim. Found my way to the guild. Found what the Scriveners thought of "country mice." The secretary ripped up Lord Juten's letter in front of everyone. I was devestated.

On my way back home, down to a fist full of dullings, I stopped in Mentz. I couldn't afford a room, but I could afford a drink. So I went to the tavern, plopped myself down on the bar, and ordered a drink. I couldn't help but take out a piece of paper from my bag and sketch something. 

A man in his middle years had been sitting to my left. I hadn't noticed him there. He asked me about my sketch, if I drew. I did. And then he hushed his tone and asked if I knew runes. I did. 

The man introduced himself as Ohan Tenberg, a merchant. I didn't think much of the man, but he offered me a job right then and there. He asked me if I wanted to be a part of something great. 

I did.

The rune sequence Master Tenberg and I lined up on the press form was for a spell called *Neuralindo Infecenta*. It was a simple unlocking spell only requiring seven runes. As he set the paper, I inked the rune type then stood ready at the press handle.

"This is it," he said, sweat dripping down his shoe-leather cheeks. 

"On your order, master."

He nodded and I pulled the lever.

Before that day, spells could only be cast from scrolls. Hand written scrolls. Some argued that the Scrivener's Guild was more influential than the church, than the city lords, than the Queen of Bralor herself. Perhaps it was true. They controlled the creation and distribution of magic. They sent their Erasers at the merest rumor of unsanctioned scrolls spreading in a town or village. Mercenaries turned policing force. What would the Erasers, the Scrivener's Guild, think of what we had created? 

I pushed the lever and the rune form lifted, revealing the single sheet of paper. And on the paper were seven runes, seven glowing runes. 

We didn't say anything. For a long moment, Master Tenberg and I just stared at the sheet as it the runes glowed the brown of dry dirt. 

"Shall we try it?" Master Tenberg asked no one. "Yes. Yes we should."

He snatched the paper from the hopper and ran for the front door shouting for me to lock it behind him. I was right behind him. He ran out and I engaged all three locks. 

A moment later, an intertwining duo of dim, brown streams snaked out from each keyhole and twisted sharply. All three locks opened simultaneously. I opened the door.

Master Tenberg's grin was brighter than the midday sun overhead. 

"We did it," he said. 

I said nothing. Instead, I ran back to the press and pulled out the rune casts. That spell had worked. It was a simple, seven rune spell. What about something more complicated? I had to know the limits of work. I had to know if what I, we, created could match the mighty works of the Scrivener's Guild. Or would it surpass them?

Master Tenberg had traded for the rarest spell scrolls so that I could create the molds by hand. The molds went to Markus who cast them into orichalcum. There were multiple possible failure points. Any one of our mistakes would lead to a dun sheet. But the door opened. It had worked. 

"What are you doing, my boy?" Master Tenberg asked from behind me. 

"Watch, master," I said. 

I lined up the runes for a combination of spells. *Vengeelio Intimiactus, Immolinio Persous, Araeris Personelio*. They required all twenty runes. Master Tenberg watched as I worked and only spoke when I pushed the lever forward and revealed the full glowing sheet.

"They won't be able to find us with that," he said.

"No, they won't."

"Not the guild, nor my debtors, no one."

I held up the sheet and it hummed between my fingers. "We could sell these to whoever *we* choose. Not them. Us. They'll send Erasers, but they'll never find us, Master. No one will."

He opened his mouth, hesitated. "Perhaps we should take some time, Enino. Before we look forward, we must first look back."

"But, Master--"

"We cannot afford to make mistakes, not with this. Do you understand?"

I did.

"Of course, Master," I said, setting the paper down on the worktable.

"Do not worry, my boy. We have much to celebrate. Come, it’s about time Orlov popped open that bottle of Fresian brandy. Why not for us?”

"I'll clean up here first, lock up. Can't risk someone stumbling inside."

"Very good. I will save you a seat. Yes. We will drink, to our success!"

When Master Tenberg left, I wiped down the press form, put rune casts back in their box, and locked the door. Then I went back to the work table, to the glowing sheet of runes.

*Vengeelio Intimiactus* transports a designated target to a distant location. *Immolinio Persous* masks a target from magical detection. *Araeris Personelio* makes things invisible. I hand wrote the target at the bottom of the sheet and cast the spells.

My target was the Carver's Cove.

If you're reading this, Master Tenberg, know that I'm sorry. I never meant to sully your name. I borrowed it to honor you, to share what we achieved. Something great.
