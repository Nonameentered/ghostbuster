Councilor Eezeas cleared her throats and waited for the grand hall to settle.

Session should have been over by now. She could be on the pitch, fresh air, sunslight, a round of TukTuk or two with Vice Chancellor Zaek, perhaps. Maybe he'd finally stop cheating and use a regular mallet. One could hope. But as long as she let him win, he'd continue to funnel mining contracts her way. Ah—the losses endured for victory.

But there was no hope of Session ending before she could catch the last shuttle off world. Not with the Valtruvian councilor going apoplectic over the "impossible" raid on their garrison. A fleet of unclassified ships dropped out of FTL on top of the Valtruvian's second largest and most well-fortified garrisons and took it. As simple as that. Eezeas had to admit it was quite audacious, whoever did it. The Valtruvians could blast the sun out of the sky with all their ships and turrets and bombs, but not this time. They'd actually been overwhelmed by sheer numbers. And now it was up to the council to investigate and arrange compensation and bleh, bleh, bleh.

Everyone knew it was the Domari. The only military strong enough to dominate the Valtruvians, are the Valtruvians themselves. And the Domari were all former Valtruvians. Civil wars had a way of doing that.

Even if they'd settled the issue in record time, Eezeas would not have had enough time to make it back to her home world. There was one more item on the schedule after Phimmair finished blustering over Valtruvian pride and the bonds of the Galactic Council. And that was the subject of Terra.

"Thank you, Councilor Phimmair," Eezeas said, after the room had settled enough for her voices to carry. "I assure you, this subject is of upmost importance to the council and—"

"Subject!" Phimmair looked moments away from bursting, his throat sack filled to capacity and quivering with indignation. He always seemed to quiver with something. Typical barbarian. "This is not some mere docket item. This is war!"

"Need I remind you, councilor, that it is war when the council votes upon it. But, I agree that this is a most concerning situation and we—" She raised her voices over Phimmair's incoming protest. "—and WE will do everything in our power to find those responsible and hold them accountable for their most audacious actions. This case will be transferred to the GC Punitive force. Motion to close the item and move on—?"

"Motion seconded," Councilor Diaz from Terra called out, his rough, human tongue translated via the babelphones installed at each councilor's desk. Phimmair's air sack collapsed and the Valtruvian turned blood green. One of his aids knelt by his side and gently dabbed at him with a towel.

Chuckles tinkled through the room as the votes were tallied and Eezeas could not help but smile herself. Their first assembly and already the humans were making enemies of Phimmair. Not that it was particularly hard. Unless you heeled to the Valtruvian, you were an enemy. Still, process was process. Councilor Eezeas clicked her mandibles toward the human to grab his attention and banged her hammer of station.

"Order!" she shouted, though everyone had started calming down already, save Phimmair. "Our next and final item is the induction of Terra to the Galactic Council."

Councilor Ghacols swirled inside their containment field, the sentient gas shifting from color to color, and their voice suddenly crackled through Eezeas' bablephone.

"This is preposterous!" Ghacols said. "I refuse to acknowledge these hairless apes as members. They've barely left their own system! How have they earned their place here?"

Councilor Diaz did not react, no stick, no banging, no hooting and hollering—as their kin are want to do. Eezeas had to admit she did find their species repulsive. Hairless skin on a bipedal frame with an endoskeleton. Bones on the inside! What a universe. And those found on Terra closest to her appearance, what the humans called spiders, were far from the dominant species. But she suspected it was only because of their limited numbers. Grow enough of anything and technological superiority doesn't count for much.

"Thank you, Councilor Ghacols," Eezeas replied without looking in Ghacol's direction. "But now is not the time for discussion. If you were here during the previous session, then you'd know the council presented, debated, and ultimately accepted Terra's induction into the council. Today is merely a formality."

Eezeas gestured one of her six arms toward Councilor Diaz, nodding. The Terran nodded back and rose from his seat.

"Thank you, High Councilor," he said. He stood erect, hands behind his back, not looking at anyone in particular. A confident pose, according to her Terran behavior charts. "Thank you all, for being here. It is my sincerest honor and pleasure to represent Earth, uh, Terra in joining the—"

Something landed on Councilor Diaz' desk with a jingle. No one spoke. No one moved. Then, Councilor Phimmair's throat sack quivered as it filled with air, and he said, "For you, Terran. I believe it is customary on your world. It's even got your name on it."

When Councilor Diaz lifted the collar, controlled laughter trickled from pockets and corners of the hall. Some of the councilors muttered amongst themselves. Others just stared straight ahead. Diaz smiled. He slowly coiled the leash and held the collar in his left fist.

It was customary to give collars on Terra, to pets. Say what you will about Phimmair, the barbarian did his research.

"As newly christened members of the Galactic Council," the Terran said, "I hereby make a motion that Valtruvia be removed from the council, effective immediately, and Terra replace them as the Galactic Council's weapon manufacturers."

Again, no one spoke, but this time it was because the entire hall, even the councilors, were laughing. Phimmair most of all, his great neck jiggling with each huff. Everyone laughed but Eezeas.

The Terran was not making a joke, nothing about his posture or facial expression said so. Eezeas' eight compound eyes focused on the Terran, measuring and inspecting him for any movement, the slightest shift or twitch. If she focused hard enough, she could even see his heartbeat through his neck—pulse slightly elevated over the average, but overall calm, for a human.

"Order!" Eezeas said, hammering her gavel until the hall returned to some semblance of order. Then, she continued, "This is a very serious motion, Councilor Diaz. If no one seconds, you will lose your motion rights for the next five cycles. Are you sure you want to do this?"

The Terran smiled. "You know, councilor, back on Terra, we've got this saying. When you get to prison, look for the biggest, uglist guy and hit him as hard as you can. Take him out. Because if you don't, then you're gonna spend the rest of your time looking over your shoulder, wondering. We're not looking wonder, Councilor Eezeas. We're looking to win."

Eezeas' mandibles clicked. Oh. Oh, how audacious indeed. She looked around the hall and most of the councilors were either still whispering amongst each other or tuned out completely. Phimmair was leaned back in his chair, being fed fireslugs by an attendant. She'd need to ask the Terran—Councilor Diaz—how they pulled off their raid, after session has concluded of course. Perhaps the pitch could wait.

"I think I understand, Councilor Diaz," Eezeas said. "Very well. I second the motion."

No one laughed.
