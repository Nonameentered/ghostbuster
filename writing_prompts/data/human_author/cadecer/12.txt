My girlfriend was hit by a car yesterday. The car was killed instantly.

When we left our apartment last night we were heading for my brother Mark's engagement party over in Los Feliz. Sarah and I had been arguing about expenses earlier that evening. It was the kind of fight couples have when one’s the ant and the other's the grasshopper. We usually figure out a way through the disagreement, but this argument found no rest. We walked out into the night, still fuming at each other.

"You can't make me the grown up," she said, stalking out to the hood of our Prius. Her leather jacket groaned as she crossed her arms. "If you're going to make an irresponsible purchase, you include me, Mark. You don't go behind my back."

I bit my lip. What could I say? I had messed up bad. The reason I couldn't, wouldn't tell her about the purchase was because it was an engagement ring. A ring she wasn't supposed to know about—except I put the payment on our shared bank card instead of my credit card. They're both gray...

I pressed my lips together tight and unlocked the car with the key fob. Nothing to say. She'd cool off on the ride over.

But first, she stomped out into the middle of the street and started waving her arms, shouting, "You can't just not talk to me, Mark! I'm here and alive and a person!"

"Get out of the street!" I shouted back, suppressing a smile.

Growing up, the one thing my shitty father taught me was that when it came to arguing with women, the only way to win was to not play the game. I worshiped my dad at the time, and I guess I was young enough that crappy advice like that got downloaded to the hard drive between my ears. Sarah knew that. She knew it and she loved me anyway. Said she'd help me not run away from conflict even if she had to jump around in the middle of the street.

Well, there she was. My wife to be.

She started laughing. "Are you done sulking? Can we talk about this like adults?"

I started to say, "Yes—" when a black Civic Hatchback came out of nowhere, headlights off, and going way over the limit. Only when I heard the brakes screech did I register the roar of the suped-up engine or the growling exhaust.

When the car crashed into Sarah, time didn't slow down. Everything happened in an instant, but I think with all the adrenaline and stress hormones or whatever, I focused on the accident in front of me with one hundred percent concentration.

It was like she turned into a hot knife and a slab of butter crashed into her. Carbon fiber, glass, and steel. Cut into two, each half of the car still going, hardly slowed down. Shattered glass rained down and a couple pelted the top of my head.

There's this aspect of shock that a lot of people talk about as "stepping out of your own body." I always wondered about that. It wasn't like people were hallucinating, were they? Imagining seeing themselves from a third-person point of view as something horrific unfolded around them?

For me, it was like my whole body was surrounded in bubble wrap. Everything I heard and saw and smelled had to go through this thick, invisible barrier. Even sensations from within me. My heart was racing, but it was like it was pounding against someone else's chest, far away, and I was getting the feedback.

That must be what those people were talking about. Stepping outside yourself. But when Sarah looked up at me, torn clothes hanging off her in shreds, I snapped back to myself and immediately started freaking out.

"Calm down!" Sarah shouted as she padded over to me, hands up in a calming posture. It wasn't calming at all. "It's okay. I'm okay!"

"I know!" I babbled back. "Why! Why are you okay?"

"Well, what the hell is that supposed to mean?" she asked, crossing her arms again. "You want me dead?"

I straightened, riding the panic like a wave. A mile-high wave. "Of course not," I said, glancing up and down the street. No cars. "But you should be dead. Sarah. You got hit by a car."

"I did," she confirmed with a nod, and continued, "and I'm okay. And we're gonna talk about this after we help the driver of that Tokyo Drift car. Okay?"

The driver! I hoped they were alive so I could shake the shit out of them for hitting my fiance (soon-to-be fiance) with their wanna-be race car. There were a lot of thoughts going through my mind in that moment. Was Sarah a robot? Was she a terminator? Did that make me her John Connor? Could I lead humanity to victory against SkyNet? But those answers had to wait.

I dialed for an ambulance and followed Sarah over to the torn-in-half hatchback still smoking up the street. My brother was going to be pissed.
