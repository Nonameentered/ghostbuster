Footsteps echoed from behind Geiger.

He crouched behind a rusted steel-carriage and waited for the footsteps to get closer. The orange tabby plopped down beside him, oblivious to any danger.

Shadows grew across a tower wall, flickering. For a moment, all he heard was the distant slapping of boots against concrete, growing closer and louder with every step. The, three younglings appeared from around a corner, the lead holding a torch. They were from the caravan, Geiger realized. His father wasn't the only one to succumb to an Ill Wind. And while the caravan would never abandon anyone, those who could not forage seemed to drop away overtime. No one ever asked where they went. It just wasn't done. Everyone simply new. Gone, was all.

It was their way.

Geiger and his family would not simply drop away. 

Waiting, low, silent, he lay on the ground flat. From under the carriage, he watched boots stomp by in a trot. The orange tabby rubbed against the side of his head. Geiger ignored the cat. He didn't breathe. He didn't move.

Then they were gone. 

Geiger gathered himself and sneaked against the wall of a tower, crouched and silent, the orange tabby lumbering at his heels, his belly swaying with ever step. The cat followed Geiger inside ruined buildings and watched as he dug through ruble and broke away rusted locks on half-buried doors. He was lucky when the opened in, as opposed to pulling open. He found a cavern filled with ancient leather coats, the leather so fragile it shattered when touched. He found several homes with the rotted remains of furniture, sometimes bones. And then he found a building that sent the orange tabby into a frenzy.

But it wasn't just a frenzy. Standing outside a broken tower, the clouds parted and moonlight touched down on the tabby. The tabby which was no longer orange. It was green.

Geiger rubbed his eyes with the heels of his palms. Was he afflicted? His father started seeing things before he fell into a deep sleep. Was that what was happening to him? 

To his left, another cat yowled. Geiger turned and found at least ten cats stalking out from an alley, all of them the same sickly green as the tabby at his feet. They stood in a row, the orange tabby joining them.  When Geiger tried crossing the line, the cats all turned and hissed at him in unison. Geiger stumbled back, shocked, and glared at the cats each in turn. Then he stopped. The cats weren't just in a line, they were forming a ring. A ring around the broken tower. 

Geiger stared at the tower closer, down at the base, at the rubbled street around it. Bones. There were animal bones scattered all around the tower. They reached across the street all the way to line of angry cats. None beyond them.

It was then that Geiger understood the situation. The cats could detect the Blight. The cats could actually detect and warn humans to the presence of the Blight. 

Did the elders know this? Why wasn't the caravan littered with cats?

The cats hissed in unison and swarmed Geiger, chasing him around a corner and on for another handful of paces. Then stopped.

Behind him, a wind howled down the street Geiger had just been standing on. The cats hissed at the wind, their hair standing on end. An Ill Wind, Geiger thought.

If he brought back some cats with him, they could train them to stay with the caravan and warn them of Ill Winds. Or maybe train them to accompany hunters. Are they the reason the older hunters can forage safely and return unafflicted?

"They must be," Geiger said to himself.

Geiger tore the rest of his smoked tack into as many pieces as he could and lured the cats nearest him. Many of them were some combination of gray and brown and gold, while others ranged from all black to all white. Only his tabby was orange. Geiger realized that the cats being back to their original color must have meant the Blight was not near.

Footsteps. There wasn't enough warning this time. Geiger was still crouching behind an overturned steel-carriage when the three younglings turned the corner and spotted him. The lead holding the torch quickly barked out orders and his two companions drew their knives. The cats started hissing.

With them in front of him, Geiger watched as every cat bristles and turned bile-green  from the tip of their noses to the end of their tails. They were all hissing at the three younglings.

"Stop!" shouted Geiger, pleading with the poor hunters. "You're afflicted. The Blight. You've got to get back to the caravan, now!"

Only the cats slowed the two youngling hunters. If they heard any of Geiger's words, they made no show of it. Crossing some invisible threshold, the cats gave up on warnings and clawed at the two instead, screeching bloody murder.

One of the cats, the orange tabby by the swing of its belly, launched itself at Geiger. He ran, chased by the tubby cat all the way down a long street. Behind Geiger he heard the shouts of younglings and the cries of cats. 

*There's nothing left for me here*, he thought, running straight for the Brawnks River. He left a peppered trail of smoked tack, all the way from the intersection where the younglings had pounced upon him, to the bridge across the river leading back to the Southern Yonklands and camp.

Only then did Geiger turn and see the orange tabby, happily eating the piece of smoked tack he'd just dropped. Geiger trotted back a bit and saw no tack. He trotted a bit more and still, no tack. When he got back to the bridge, the orange tabby was splayed out on its side, claws extended and belly spilling out in a puddle of fur. The cat had eaten his trail.

Geiger could do nothing but laugh.
