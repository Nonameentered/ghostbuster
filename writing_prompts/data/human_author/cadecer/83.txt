When the doorbell rang, Gloria was in the kitchen waiting for her snickerdoodles to finish baking. Plenty of mouths to feed, ever since Acorn had invited his kin to shelter while his wing grew back. He hadn't asked permission, but Gloria didn't mind. It was just nice to have some company around.

"Now who could that be?" Gloria asked herself. "My walker, dearies." A handful of fairies glittered away from her apron and dragged her walker back with them. Gloria thanked her shiny little friends as they rejoined the forty-something little folk that clung to Gloria's clothes, like barnacles on a ship that only the ship could see. She didn't mind that either.

A foot away or so from the door, Acorn buzzed up from his usual perch atop Gloria's head and hovered in front of her face with the help of two of his kin. "Bad feeling," he said, in a gruff but nasal voice. "No open."

The bell rang again.

"Now, now," Gloria said. "No one's going to hurt you."

Acorn's little blue face was as grim as the tax man, but Gloria pushed ahead and opened the door.

A man in a perfectly-tailored suit stood on her porch. He looked like a cross between a snake and a lawyer, or just a lawyer, Gloria decided. She tried not to chuckle. "Yes?" she said, smiling.

The man's eyes darted around as he spoke. "Good day, madam." His voice was oil dripping into her ears. "My name is doctor Nicholas Tillinghast. I hope I'm not disturbing you."

"You are," she said, matter-of-factly. "I'm in the middle of some baking."

"Yes," he said, sniffing the air. Gloria was surprised a forked tongue didn't flicker out out from between his lips. "It smells quite magical in there. May I … come in?"

"Don't think so."

"Thank yo--I'm sorry?"

"No," said Gloria and slammed the door in the man's face. She'd learned about fishing at the senior center. Though why fishermen turned from an honest living to scamming money from seniors, she had no clue. *Times are truly lean*, she thought.

Acorn spoke from his perch. "Bad smell. Dangerous man."

"Aye," Gloria said, making her way back to the kitchen. "Nothing to worry about--"

Something slammed into her front door. Gloria nearly jumped out of her apron. Another slam collapsed the door inward, tearing it right off the hinges. Standing in the doorway was doctor fancy suit. His once slicked back hair was now out of place, and his eyes were all black. Like two pieces of charcoal stuck into his face.

It all happened too fast for Gloria's heart to catch up to what her mind had clearly registered as danger. Then he crossed the threshold into her home. Without her permission. That set her pulse racing. 

“You’re—you’re not welcome here,” Gloria muttered. 

"Please. I’m not a vampire, Mrs. Tuttle," said the coal-eyed man, running his hands through his hair. "Now, you are in possession of a small clan of Fae. I require them."

"No," Gloria said. "Get out of my house!"

He smiled. "Of course. Once you hand them over."

Acorn buzzed from his perch and floated between Gloria and the doctor. "Black blood!" he shouted. "You no harm kin."

"There you are," the doctor hissed.

Shadowy arms sprouted from the doctor's back and shot out toward Gloria. But before they reached her, dozens of little folk lit up like torches. Acorn charged, followed by a stream of his kin. The bright little sprites managed to push back the doctor's attack. But one by one the lights were snuffed out by shadowy hands.

A deep pain cut through Gloria's heart. She didn't understand who this man was and why he was doing this. But the little folk were dying. That she knew. She felt it in her soul. They were dying to protect her. Grief threatened to swallow Gloria, but she couldn't break down now. She had to move.

Gloria turned and would have shuffled into the kitchen, had it not been for a handful of little folk that wrapped themselves around her slippers. Instead of a shuffle, Gloria nearly sprinted out of the foyer and into the kitchen.

"Well I'll be," she said, catching her breath.

From the foyer, she could hear the doctor shout and grunt as the fight continued. A moment later, Acorn fluttered into the kitchen alone. His half-healed wing barley held him up and Gloria caught him in her her cupped hands. He looked exhausted.

"You escape," he said to Gloria. "We fight."

"Now don't be silly," she said, fighting back tears. "We made a deal, Acorn Moonwing. You are still under my roof. So no. *You* escape. And *I* will fight."

Acorn's little face was a portrait of shock. "But--"

"No buts, mister. I command you. Take your kin and leave my home."

The bargain struck between little folk and mortal was unbreakable. That was how Acorn explained it. While the fairies sheltered under her roof, they had to obey her commands. And so, shouting their defiance, they gathered and left through an open window, leaving her in the kitchen alone.

Gloria was thankful for the time they'd spent together. It had been so long since she'd felt useful to anyone. When her son, Michael, died, it was like a part of her went with him. Angela, her daughter-in-law, had to take care of funeral arrangements -- and of Gloria, after she'd slipped in the shower and broken her hip. It was all too much. Gloria had lost too much. But at least, with the little folk, with Acorn, she'd regained something. A sliver of purpose.

She'd rather die and lose it again.

The doctor rounded the corner and took a slow, slithering step into the kitchen. Smoke rose from his skin as if he were burning. "Where are they?" he hissed.

"Gone," she said. "I'm not afraid of you, boogum. So do what you've got to do, or get out. I've got cookies in the oven."

Two of the shadowy hands ran through the doctor's hair as his actual hands straightened his tie. "Very well," he said. "I guess I'll just have to go find them."

"Wait--" Gloria blurted. But the doctor simply turned on his heel and started walking back toward the front door.

No. She had to stop him, keep him there until the little folk could get plenty far away.

"You won't find them!" she shouted. "Only I know where they went."

There was no response. She shuffled forward toward the foyer, and the doctor reappeared.

"Where did you send them?" he growled.

*Hook, line, and sinker*, she thought. "Somewhere far from here. Farther than you could ever hope to reach."

His face crunched into a scowl, but then he shook his head, composing himself. "Mrs. Tuttle, I commend your courage. I do. But I do not have the time for games."

Six shadowy arms shot out and wrapped around Gloria, raising her from the ground.

"Where. Are. They?"

She said nothing. And she would say nothing, for as long as it took. And longer still. *I'll see you soon, Mikey.*

A torrent of light rushed through the open kitchen window and crashed into the doctor like a firehose. Gloria shielded her eyes from the small sun that had suddenly appeared in her kitchen.

The doctor's howl was inhuman. The shadow arms released Gloria but she didn't fall to the floor. Instead, dozens of little hands gently lowered her to her feet.

Then it was over. Her eyes were still adjusting to the normal light, but Gloria heard something stomp out of her house through the front door.

"Are you hurt?" Acorn's familiar voice asked.

"No," she said, blinking. "I'm fine." For a moment she worried that her eyes had been permanently damaged because she was seeing nothing but little glowing dots. But then the lights dimmed. Dozens upon dozens of little folk fluttered around her kitchen. There must have been a hundred or so, maybe more.

"Oh, my," she said.

Acorn buzzed up to his perch atop her head, and said, "Called kin for help. We stay?"

Gloria thought for a moment, then said, "I'm going to need a bigger oven."
