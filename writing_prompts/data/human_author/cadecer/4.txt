\[Part 2 of 2\]

Benny was in his late forties and a proud Puerto Rican, if you couldn't tell by his Puerto Rican flag basketball jersey, sneakers, and hat. He had a bad habit of whistling at women as they walked by, but aside from that -- he was a decent enough guy. He was also early.

I buzzed the door.

Gideon looked up. "Customer?" he asked.

"One of my best," I said. "Joey, go help Benny."

"But it's my first day."

I swallowed what I was gonna say and instead said, "Well, you're sucking on that vape like a two-dollar hooker. I'd say you're pretty well acquainted." Yeah, what I was gonna say was way worse, but there was a customer.

Gideon nodded my way and stepped into the back room.

"Papi!" Benny shouted, peeking over his aviators. "What's crackin' you wap mothafucka! Oye, who's the kid?"

I couldn't help but laugh.

"He's new, Benny," I shouted from behind the counter. "Be nice, or no moon rocks for you."

Benny clutched his chest and moaned on about how much I didn't appreciate his hard earned money. Benny was on disability for a slip in a supermarket over twenty years ago. Just can't seem to get that hip working right. The cannabis helps with the pain.

After challenging Joey to a slap-boxing match for a third time, Benny called my new employee a sissy for not accepting, and came up to the counter to put in his order.

"I'm gonna need two O's, ten of those Lego edibles, and three vape cartridges," Benny said, setting down his thick, worn-leather wallet on the counter.

I whistled. "Little more than your usual order. Not complaining, mind you. Something up?"

Benny sighed. "My sister just got diagnosed with the Leukemia, pobresita. The Medicade is gonna cover the chemo, gracias a dios. But she's a recovering heroine addict. They give you pills for the pain and shit, but she can't. So I'm picking her up a whole poopoo platter of marijuana. It helps with the cancer, you know."

"I'm sorry to hear about your sister, Benny," I said. "Joey, come ring up Mister Diaz, and give him twenty percent off." Before Joey could say something stupid, I added, "And don't tell me you don't know how to ring him up, you worked at a CVS before working for me, okay?"

Benny laughed a crunchy, smoker's laugh, and said," You gotta teach him how to be a man before he gets hurt out here."

"Your lips to God's ears, Benny," I said.

Benny left with one final challenge to Joey who again disappointed my best customer. As the door closed, I turned to Joey and froze.

He was up against the wall, a gun pointed to the back of his head. Gideon was holding the gun.

"I'm going to ask this once, Carlo," Gideon said with the calm of a professional. He looked as cool as scrolling through a spreadsheet. "Where did your profits come from for the last quarter?"

Gideon Sloan wasn't a button man. The whole point of a consigliere was not to get his hands dirty. He was a fixer, a manager, a wise council. But that didn't mean he couldn't get his hands dirty. Especially if no one was left to finger him in a courtroom.

What had he seen in the numbers? They were all legit. No fudging, no nothing. Yeah, we went through our month's stock in a week, but that was everywhere. They decriminalized cannabis, what the hell did he expect? People *not* to buy weed?

No, there had to be something else at work here. And why pin the kid? Well, I would have done the same. Joey's not smart enough to keep his cool. Gideon knows I am. He knows it; just like he knows about the shotgun under the counter--the one directly behind me. That's why he's not pointing the gun at me.

It may be a risk, but fuck it. When you're walking on thin ice, you might as well dance.

"The pass code to the till is 42069," I said, slowly raising my hands. "Take whatever you want, just don't hurt us."

"What the fuck, Carlo!" Joey screamed into the wall. "Fucking smoke this Jew mothafucka!"

"Joey!" I snapped. "Please, for the love of Mary, Mother of God, please, please--shut your fucking mouth."

Gideon didn't even blink. He just stood there, finger on the trigger, eyes on me, watching.

I counted two full minutes before Gideon finally pulled the gun back. Joey turned and took a swing at the consigliere. Big mistake. Gideon caught my nephew-in-law's arm and judo flipped the idiot flat onto his back. He landed with a splat, like a wet bag of laundry. I sucked in air through my teeth and made the sign of the cross. He'd be alright, eventually.

Gideon straightened his tie and gave me short nod.

"Pass the test?" I asked.

"Flying colors," Gideon said. "You know, the Don and I have been talking."

"Oh, yeah?"

Gideon adjusted his glasses and looked tip-top-magoo.

"It's rather unfortunate, but the current environment simply hasn't been conducive to a profitable year regarding our more sensitive operations. Frankly, we're thinking about going legit."

I whistled. "So we doing online gambling now, or?"

Gideon looked down at Joey, who was groaning and still alive, for now. "We're thinking about something more...medicinal."

I smiled. "I think I can help with that."
