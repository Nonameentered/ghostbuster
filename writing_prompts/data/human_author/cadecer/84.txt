Hospitality (A Sonnet)

The rules are clear. The ones that Bram went by 

and later wrote into a book. Within 

a home, you're s'pposedly safe. We can't break in 

or cross thresholds. But rules do not apply

&#x200B;

to mortal hunters of the night. And what 

of us that drink and drain not from a neck 

but bags from banks? It matters not. They trek 

from far and wide, their stakes in hand. They strut

&#x200B;

as if they're Helsing's sons, into the dark; 

They say to let sleeping dogs lie. Then why 

must fools kick down my doors? Is it to die? 

Awake, I ask myself, *to bite or bark?*

&#x200B;

There is no choice. To you, I say, "This house 

is where the cat will play. Welcome, my mouse."
