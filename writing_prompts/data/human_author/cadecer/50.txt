Nancy "Nance" Hamilton did not notice the kettle whistling.

It was nearly three-thirty and her "guest" was yet to arrive. She snatched the kettle off the stove, ignoring the splash of boiling water against the back of her hand, and sat herself down at her kitchen table. In *her* seat of course, facing the front window. A willow tree swayed outside, drooping branches like wet, stringy hair over a weeping face.

"What are we drinking today?"

The voice came out of nowhere. It was harsh and pitched, like scraping glass against stone. But, it'd become familiar. Nance didn't even twitch.

"Tea," Nance said.

"Hell yeah."

The demon named Choks wore spiked leather mostly with a pink mohawk flanked by two curling horns. He plopped down in the other seat and rested one boot over the other.

"You heard the news?" Chocks said. "Another school shooting, not far from here. Freaking brutal."

"Sugar?" Nance asked, pouring water over loose tealeaves. What was the point? It wasn't like he ever drank the bloody stuff.

He smiled. "I'm sweet enough, thanks."

They sat and drank tea (well, Nance at least), and she listened numbly as Choks went on and on about the latest atrocity or tragedy, whether local or abroad. After a while it all became noise. But noise was better than the silence.

It was morning and Nance knew she had to do something, but she just couldn't remember what. She'd finished dressing and pinning up her silver hair. Staring into her vanity mirror, she wracked her brain for the thing, whatever it was, that she had to do today. When did she get so old?

The doorbell rang. Whatever it was, it'd come to her. Important things had a way of coming back.

"Good morning, Nance," said Linade. "Beautiful day, isn't it?"

Nance peered out past the demon standing in her door way. It was hard not to with him wearing a bland suit that looked like it belonged to the head of the IRS. He blended into the sky which was the gray of ash and soot.

"Perhaps for Poe," Nance said, smirking.

"Oh—oh, that's rich," said Linade. His chuckle felt forced, but Nance appreciated the laugh anyway. She did love jokes. "Well, are we ready?"

"For what?"

"The beach," he said, suddenly whispering. "We're going to the beach today."

"Whatever for?"

Linade stared at her unblinking. After a few heartbeats, he smiled and said, "I'm just being silly. Would you like some tea?"

She didn't, but maybe the company would help jog her memory. There *was* something she had to do today. Something important.

When Gerna pulled up on her Harley Davidson into Nance's driveway, it was all Nance could do not to hurl a record at her. Yes, Gerna may have been a demon, but that bloody didn't mean she had to roar up like a jackhammer every time she showed up.

Gerna pulled off her helmet, letting her raven black hair unfurl past her shoulders and her horns grow to their natural length. "You ready to do this, babe?"

"I told you I'll let you know!" Nance snapped. There was so much to clean out of the garage. So much ... stuff. "I'm busy."

Gerna sauntered into the garage, fingered through a box of records, and said, "Busy organizing trash? I mean, who listens to 'The Best of Bread?'"

"Leave it," Nance said, staring down at her own box of records.

"It's not like you've got any kids to help. I can't believe he left you will *all* this junk."

"I said, leave it," Nance growled.

"No," Gerna said, her voice rumbling back, "He left it, his stuff. *He* left."

Something inside Nance shifted, and she could have sworn with an audible crack. Her face felt wet. She was crying, but not sobbing. Just tears rolling down her burning cheeks. "He left me. He left me alone. He said—" She bit off her words, jaw clenched past hurting.

Gerna handed her The Best of Bread.

Nance flung it against the garage wall. It shattered.

"I hate tea," Nance said, sitting at the kitchen table in her seat. She stirred her Sanka, the tea spoon clinking against porcelain. "Always hated it. But George—he loved it. So, I lied."

Gargbianni knuckled his long, gray mustache that hid his upper lip. He looked like a Venetian merchant, straight out of a Shakespeare play, but with horns. "It is a white lie, perhaps," he said.

"I told him he could have the garage. That I didn't need that much space."

"Did you?"

She chuckled. "Of course. Who doesn't?"

Gargbianni stirred his own cup of decaf. "The dead."

"That's why," Nance said, staring into her cup, "I can't be mad that he lied to me."

"About his illness."

Nance nodded.

They sat there for a few moments in companionable silence. Then, Nance said, "I want him back. I—I could have done things differently. Been different. If I'd have known George was sick, maybe—"

"You could have made the most of the time you had together," Gargbianni finished.

"Yes."

He sighed and removed his floppy cap, revealing his stubby horns. "No deal, my dear."

Nance sniffed. "But—"

"No. Deal."
