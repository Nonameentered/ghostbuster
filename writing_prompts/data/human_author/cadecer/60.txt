I kept my stun gun pointed at the growling middle-aged *hunter* while fumbling with my phone to dial Rocko with my other hand. 

"Talk to me," Rocko said, his voice sounded gruffer and tenser than usual, like he was about to get a root canal.

"We've got a real live wire here, boss," I said.

"You found him?" He chuckled and broke into a smoker's cough. "Oh boy."

The wannabe hunter raised his crossbow and fired. The bolt whistled toward my face but I knocked it away with my stun gun. He gaped at me. The guy looked like an accountant playing dress up as Rambo, with the red headband, bandolier of crossbow bolts, camouflage, everything. Despite his coke-bottle glasses, he had decent aim.

He started reloading.

I leveled the red laser dot at his leg and fired, pumping just enough juice to drop him to his knees screaming. "Enough with the crossbow!"

"You're going down, monster lover!" he shouted back at me, clawing at the leads stuck in his thigh. I waggled the stun gun at him and he raised his hands, softly muttering curses under his breath. 

"Cut him loose, Vick," Rocko said. "The mission's dead in the water. You hear? Bloated corpse in the East River."

"What?" I said. "No, he's alive. I just zapped him a little. I've got him, Rocko. Alive!"

"Quit yer yellin'! I heard you. I'm saying, you gotta cut him loose."

"Yeah right. It took me all day to chase his ass down."

"You're not hearing me. The Dawnshots put a bounty on their man. They're coming for him, now. Cut the zealot loose and get your ass back to headquarters. The last thing we need is another incident -- not after Jersey."

I groaned. "That wasn't my fault! How was I supposed to know they were based out of a strip club?" 

"Yeah, yeah. Look, mongo. The way I see it, you've got two choices. Either toss the zealot or face down a whole posse of Dawnshots. You think they're gonna care about keeping quiet? I don't even know why I have to ask. This is just plain common sense."

"Can't do it, Rocko," I said. "If his people turned on him, then that's double reason to bring him in from the cold. This guy doesn't know what he's doing. He's a bean counter, not a warrior."

"I'm not an accountant!" the wannabe hunter shouted, his voice cracking. "I'll have you know I'm an insurance claims adjustor and hunter of monsters, you traitor!" He started lowering his hands and I tapped on the stun gun trigger, not enough to shock him but enough to get a few clacks out of the gun. He shot his hands back up and glowered at me.

"Sounds like a real upstanding citizen. Why are we still talking about this?"

"Rocko."

"You think I'm gonna help you with the paperwork if this thing goes sideways? We're already in Dutch with management -- why are you putting me in this position, Vick? I tell you the well is fouled and you try to drink from it. Just let the guy go. He wouldn't think twice about putting a bullet through you if the tables were turned."

Anger started bubbling up in my stomach, or it could have been the extra jalapenos on my lunch burrito. My burps were fueled by fury and indigestion. "But the tables *aren't* turned. They're facing straight ahead and our jobs ain't to put down hunters. Right? So get off your ass and come pick us up!"

"What's wrong with the subway?"

"Are you serious! I'm not taking this guy on the subway. Besides, we're nowhere near a station. I'm way off Metropolitan, by the strip club. Pick us up, now!"

"Okay, fine, fine. But I can't get into Brooklyn easy at this hour. Get your ass up to the warehouse district and I can slip off the BQE. I'll meet your right off the ramp, by the gas station. Just keep low. Dawnshots had plenty of time to track both of your knuckleheads down. I'll be there in twenty. You heard? Twenty. Move it."

"It'll be worth it, boss. Trust me."

"Twenty!" Rocko shouted then hung up on me.
