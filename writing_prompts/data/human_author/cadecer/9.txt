Vicks disengaged the safety on her blaster. Standard operating procedure stated hunters should only ready their weapons in the presence of pathogens and only when prepared to exterminate the threat. She looked around at the inflamed, reddish walls, built from mailbox-sized sinus cells. Mucus spilled from the roof, slid down every surface, and pooled up to her team's ankles. Just around the bend was their target. Her target.

"I'll take point," she said, pulling up the targeting HUD on her visor.

Erol Salk, leader of their three-person team, stared down his sharp nose at Vicks. The gray-haired veteran had been doing that since landing in the patient's nasal cavity. She'd ask a question and he'd just stare at her. She wasn't some kid to babysit! And she most certainly didn't let some "legendary" hunter treat her like one. She'd *earned* her place in the field. If Salk had a problem, that was between him and his god.

"Maybe I can take some samples first?" asked Melvin, the team's tech. Vicks and Salk both wore standard issue enviro-suits, lightweight and made of highly-durable synthfabrics. Melvin looked more like a mech; but instead of firepower, he was packing something even more dangerous—protein markers. His "life's work."

"You keep to the rear, can launchers at the ready," Salk snapped over his com. "I'm not losing anyone on a routine rhino hunt. Especially not some wet-nosed noobs playing dragon slayers."

"Who are you calling a noob?" Vicks demanded.

"There's nothing routine about this mission, sir," Melvin added, lamely. "I'm actually quite close to a breakthrough in my symbiosis research—"

"Enough!" Salk shouted over the com, loud enough to clip his voice. "You two—"

Something moved; not something. The entire nasal cavity shuddered beneath their boots; the world turned sideways.

Vicks bounced off the sinus wall face first, blanketed in mucus. She landed flat on her back then was suddenly on her feet again. Looking through her visor was like looking through an inch of petroleum jelly. Wiping it clean with a rag from her belt pack, she searched for the rest of her team.

"God damn sneezes," Salk muttered over the com. He was climbing to his feet, covered in mucus too. "Med techs got one damn job—can't even do that much..."

If the patient's anti-sneezing meds were wearing off, then there wasn't much time left on the mission. At one point, there were thousands of rhinoviruses running amok. The patient's compromised immune system could only sit and watch as the virus multiplied.

But that's when Phage Hunters stepped in. People who geared up, shrunk down, and fought the only battles that truly mattered. The ones between life and death. Vicks had watched too many loved ones lose that battle. She was done watching. With only a few hundred of the rhinoviruses left in the patient, every kill counted.

"I'm going on ahead while you clean your glasses, old timer."

"Hold!" Salk shouted. "God damnit, I said hold. Where's the nerd?"

When she bounced off the sinus wall, Vicks' HUD automatically switched over to vitals. She switched back to targeting, which also brought up a map of her immediate area, highlighting her teammate's locations.

A red dot blinked to her dot's left. Salk's dot even blinked angrily. She searched around, switching her focus between the HUD and her physical surroundings beyond her sort-of-mucusy visor. No sign at all. This was not good.

"MIA," said Vicks, her heart suddenly racing. Her suit offered to counter the adrenal spike with meds, but she declined. The adrenaline calmed her in a way, helped her focus. "We should fan out. I'll take out the rhino and we'll meet back here after searching the area."

Vicks didn't feel it when Salk grabbed her by the faceplate and slammed her into the sinus wall. That wasn't exactly true. His assault didn't hurt, but she felt something. Rage.

Vicks brought up her knee in a well-practiced thrust, hopefully strong enough to knock Salk's balls a good six inches into his abdomen. But the veteran hunter shifted his hips and took the knee on his thigh. He slammed her head into the wall again, this time her helmet sinking into the inflamed tissue.

Salk's snarling mouth moved, but Vicks couldn't hear a word.

"Your com!" she shouted. "Turn on your com, you idiot!"

The com clicked on and Salk's voice crackled through.

"Listen here, you little shit," he said, breathing hard. "I don't care who your daddy was or how many merit badges you earned. You're a glorified clerk, not a hunter. So pull your head out of your ass and stop making my job harder!"

"And what is your job!" Vicks shouted right back. "You're too old for oncology. You refused retirement. So what? You just wanna lead rookies on cold jobs? Show off to us? Nobody calls you *Penicillin* anymore, Salk. They haven't since my dad's generation. So why don't you cut the macho shit and make room for the rest of us!"

"It's beautiful..." Melvin's voice crackled through the com, staticky and low.

"Melvin?" she asked at the same time Salk barked, "Nerd?"

His dot blinked to life on Vicks' HUD. He was just around the bend, up a tunnel, and in contact with the rhinovirus...

Everything happened fast then. Salk dropped her and took point, linking to her targeting computer vis his HUD. Vicks fell in line behind him, crouched, safety off, and head on a swivel. They stalked around the bend and up the tunnel, firing anti-viral foam on any recently infected sinus cells. The walls grew redder and rawer the closer they came. Then, they found them.

Melvin's suit lay in a pile of canisters and synthcloth on the mucus-covered ground. Growing into the wall was the rhinovirus node, a massive tumor covered in thousands of horns. And growing out of the node, was Melvin. Thick fleshy tubes grew from the node and directly into Melvin's body. Naked, save for his helmet which still had coms. His lower half disappeared into the node itself. Vicks wanted to scream.

Instead, she said, "What the fuck?"

"I'm pulling him out!" Salk shouted, and charged the virus. "Cover me!"

It was insane. Madness. You never charged a phage, especially one growing out of the patient's tissue like that. They had control over the human cells in their near vicinity. Every hunter knew that. At least, they were supposed to.

When Vicks fired over Salk's helmet onto the rhinovirus node, fleshy spikes shot out of the sinus walls and ceiling and floor, each one as thick as a telephone pole. All of them aimed at Salk.

Vicks kept firing. She emptied her clip, reloaded, and emptied it again. Then she loaded an anti-viral grenade into the belly of her blaster and fired that too. When the blue mist cleared, the spikes were gone and the node was gone and all that remained of her team were two empty biosuits.

A voice crackled over the com. Vicks couldn't understand.

"Evacuation in ten, nine, eight..." said the voice.

Vicks engaged the safety on her blaster. She'd missed.
