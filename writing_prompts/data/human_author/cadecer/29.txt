The Lacriplex started playing commercials before screening motion pictures, mopics, and one of them was about corn. On the giant glowing screen projecting into the otherwise pitch dark theater, giant farmers all in a long row stretching across their barren fields, chanted in unison. Then, as if in defiance of the gods themselves, shoots sprouted from the grayish soil and continued growing until the entire field stood three to four hands over each farmer, stalks leaning and hanging from their burden: ears and ears of corn.

From his reserved seat, compliments of his position, Antides didn't have to crane his neck back at all. Farewell front row seats. Hello entertainment. 

Two rows down, a figure in shadow rose and started shouting about faulty spell scrolls, about the chokehold the High Magus has over competition, how it was the common folk that paid the blood price. 

"Security," Antides called into the communication lacrima built into the arm of his seat. "There is a disturbance." 

On screen, the farmers rejoiced around their harvest and the screen brightened to reveal the symbol of the High Magus, an owl perched on a shepherd's crook. So long as they chanted the spells properly, nothing to worry about. Nothing at all.

"I want you to join us," said Klebin. "We could use your help."

He did not hurl an inkwell at Antides this time, instead gingerly setting it down on Antides' home desk beside a written oath addressed simply to "The People." 

"Give it time, young man," said Antides. "You'll learn soon enough there's no point in fighting."

"Join us," Klebin repeated.

"Oh come off it!" Antides snapped. "There is no resistance. There's no re—"

"No what?"

"No ... reality where you people can possibly stand against the High Magus."

Klebin stopped, suddenly frozen as if hit with a stasis spell, his mouth half open as if about to say something. Then, he did:

"What would need to be different?"

There it was. The inexhaustible stubbornness of youth. There's only one way of bringing that ox down, and that's the truth. 

"I know this is about your pa," Antides said. "I looked into it after you quit. What happened to him had nothing to do with—"

"No," Klebin said, raising his hand. "I think I see the problem. What you're missing, what we're all missing in this reality, is a little bit of imagination. Thank you, master, for your instruction. It was very ... educational." 

Antides said nothing as his former apprentice left. Nothing else to it, really.

Antides won another contract. A small one for a baker looking to expand her kitchen. Still, it showed that there were gaps that the High Magus could not fill. And even if he could, those accidents-waiting-to-happen he calls spells are most certainly not fit for public use. Yes, they work, but without redundancies for mis-chants, there's no guaranteeing the user's safety. And the user, humans, will never be one hundred percent accurate in their chanting. It's just not possible.

But, with a little imagination and a lot of nights at the enchanting desk, safe and affordable spellwork is possible. One simply had to think outside of the scroll.

Staring at the pile of contracted work sitting atop his inbox, Antides mused over the merits of hiring an apprentice. They'd need to be open minded, hard working, and determined. There was nothing else to it.
