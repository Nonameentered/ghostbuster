Johnny "Boom-Boom" Boombatz flipped over his brother's cold, mutilated body. His eyes were still open, staring accusingly. *Where were you?* they demanded. *I needed you*.

"You need a minute?" asked Ricky No Name, crunching up behind Johnny through the shattered glass and broken, splintered dining tables. Yellow streetlight spilled in through restaurant's busted-out windows. *Paulie wen't out fighting, that's for sure*, he told himself. *Went out fighting alone.*

"Na," Johnny said, pointing his flashlight at the short hitman's chest. "Have the bleachers take care of all this. I'll be out in a minute."

Ricky nodded, and turned but stopped. He looked down at Johnny with that constipated look on his face, meaning he wanted to say something stupid but was fighting that pea he called a brain before flapping his gums. Finally, he said, "The Don don't want us back without the package."

He could kill Ricky. As easy as pushing a button. Chalk it up to ... collateral damage. But no, it'd be too much trouble. Johnny would rather smash his nuts with a cinderblock than deal with Arlo. The old bastard loomed over his precious bleachers like a pimp would his stable. Let Ricky handle the clean up. "Yeah," Johnny said, turning back to his little brother's body. "I know."

When Johnny heard the hammer click back, his stomach didn't jump a centimeter. Fear was the difference between life and death in this line of work. That's what these young punks don't understand. You wanna live long enough to retire, you need ice in your veins. Not heat. Passion gets you killed.

"It's nothing personal," said Ricky. The little shit's voice was all nasally and mocking. Mocking! Like he'd really gotten the jump on Johnny Boombatz. "The Balzini's are making a play for the package, and you need to go. That's all there is to it."

Back during World War II, the French that didn't fold when Hitler rolled into Paris on tanks became guerillas. Most amongst them turning to sabotage. Johnny's great-great-grandfather was in Paris when the shit went down and he wasn't gonna twiddle his thumbs all idle-like. During that time spent blowing up Nazi tanks and strongholds, Antonio Boombatz earned a nickname: The Mad Sicilian.

Now, over a century-and-a-half later, Johnny carried on that family tradition. But instead of blowing up Nazis, he blew up whoever needs killing.

The heels of polished black shoes exploded, firing two small flares between him and Ricky. Ricky screamed, gun firing, rounds going wild. Johnny spun, sprung, and pressed his cybernetic palm against the stunned hitman chest. The lights dotted along his hand glowed green, then blue, then red in quick succession.

"No," Tommy whispered. "Please—"

Johnny's palm exploded, punching a can-sized hole through Ricky's chest right where his heart would have been. The young hitman dropped to his knees and flopped over, smoking.

"Kind of name is Ricky No Name," Johnny muttered to himself as he wiped blood from his hand with a handkerchief he produced from his jacket pocket. "Fucking traitor."

The Balzini's are making a play for the package. Don Coretto's mobilizing the entire family towards getting it back and everyone's getting ready for war. Johnny wasn't afraid of spilling a little blood, but blood was bad for business. Easiest way to soften everyone's hard-ons was to find the package. But no one knows who the hell this "Tourist" is. The bastard took out every goon, hand, and hitter sent his way. Even the best...

Johnny knelt down beside his brother and gently closed his eyes with two fingers, whispering a prayer to a God he long stopped believing in, wishing his brother was at peace. Was a prayer empty if it came from love? "Fuck it," Johnny said to himself. There was one thing he could do, one thing that wasn't empty or wishful. He could find the animal that killed his brother and make him pay.

But first, he had to track it down. To do that he needed to know one thing.

"What are you after?"

\*\*\*

Gerald Paloma was not going to lose this month's *Ruler of Cakes* qualifier. He set to mixing his ingredients on the small rolling counter supplied to each of the six contestants. The triple-tiered souffle mold was a custom job, a favor from his new coworkers down at the 3-D printing warehouse. A surprising number of Gerald's coworkers were not only *Ruler of Cakes* fans but immediately jumped on his "official bandwagon," a couple of them actually coming down to the community center during their off time to cheer him on. All Gerald had to do was win.

The  judge called time and five of six of the contestants raised their hands. Yugo chuckled and continued frosting his Pumpernickel Pumpkin Raisin Cake, accepting his disqualification gracefully. There was something about the old-timer that unsettled Gerald, despite Yugo's ever-present smile and warmth. Like watching a trained bear on a game-show. It's all smiles and laughs until it's not, then everyone's scratching their head asking "How could this happen?" Maybe don't mess with bears?

"Let's get this over with!" Marissa cheered from her station. Her Double Dare Devil's Food Cake shined under the kitchen lights. Perfect frosting, smooth enough to reflect your face, around what probably was a perfect bake. 

The self-proclaimed "Queen of Cakes" singled Gerald out during his first baking class at the community center. So what if he'd been baking since high school? There was always something new to learn. She'd called him a shark and when it came to the *Ruler of Cakes* qualifier competition, she very loudly swore to "beat him like egg yokes."

But Gerald wasn't some helpless babe. He stuck out his chest and clasped his hands behind his back, proudly showing off his Caramel Cloud Castle Souffle. Three tiers of fluffy baked goodness, mixed with caramel, cinnamon, and cardamon and drizzled with a dulce de leche and espresso syrup. Perfection.

The judge, a mustached official bearing the Ruler of Bakes silver cake pin on his lapel, walked from station to station with a clipboard and a gold ribbon. Whoever won the ribbon qualified to compete for a spot on the next season of Ruler of Bakes. Pop rocks and cola mixed in Gerald's stomach as the judge approached his station.

"Hello, Mr. Paloma," the judge said in a pleasant tone. "What do we have here, today?"

"Thank you for stopping by," Gerald said and covered his mouth in shock. He'd already skipped to the end of his prepared speech!

Marissa barked a laugh from her station. Did she hear him slip up? He'd beat her this time for sure. Gerald collected himself and started again.

"Hello. My name is Gerald Paloma and this is my—"

Someone screamed. It was Yugo. He was clutching his chest and swaying. The old-timer collapsed forward, knocking his cake to the ground.

"Call an ambulance," someone shouted. Yugo shouted back that he was fine, no ambulances, and ran out through the emergency exit leading into the alley.

Gerald was already pushing his way through the emergency door before he realized he was running. His father had died from a slow heart attack. Not enough to kill him immediately, but a long painful decline that could have been prevented had his father not insisted he was "fine" and gone back to work at the printing warehouse. Yugo was not fine.

The door closed behind him and Yugo's feet were sticking out from behind a dumpster. Gerald ran and found the graying, grizzled baker slumped up against the community center's brick exterior. He was holding a metallic case.

"I thought—" Yugo covered his mouth to cough. When he dropped his hand, blood painted his lips and chin a dark red, like cherry syrup. "—more time. I'd have more..." He clutched his chest, wincing.

"Don't speak," Gerald said, dialing emergency services on his hand terminal. But Yugo slapped Gerald's terminal out of his hand with surprising speed.

"I am sorry," Yugo wheezed and coughed up another glob of blood, not bothering to cover his mouth. He shoved the case into Gerald's arms. "Get. This to king..."

He didn't finish. Yugo stared out at nothing, blood dripping from his stubbly chin down to his ruined white button up, motionless.

The emergency door opened and Marissa peaked her head out, green eyes narrowed, and said, "The judge said you lost, by the way. You done out here? What the hell!"

Gerald stumbled back from his crouch, scrambling away from Yugo's body while trying to hold the metallic case. It was like a flare had gone off inside the dead man's head. Smoke plumed out from his nose and ears and two orange sparks replaced his eyes. Yugo slumped over, still smoking.

Gerald clutched the case to his chest and tried to ignore the smell of cooking flesh. It didn't work.
