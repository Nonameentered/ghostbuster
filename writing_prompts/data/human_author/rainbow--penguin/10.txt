The Artificial Wisdom Generator's last words were still playing over and over in my mind.

*Dangerous things are paid for with poor choices.* 

But it hadn't seemed like a poor choice at the time. Jacob had been so charming, with those twinkling eyes and that lopsided smile. *And* he'd practically saved my life.

It was just my luck that he'd turned out to be a fairy, and fairies took life debts *very* seriously. But, I mean, who'd ever heard of fairy *rodeos*. Fairy carnivals, sure. Maybe a fairy circus here or there. But fairy *rodeos*?

He'd taken me back to the site of our first date — that dreaded mechanical bull — but this time, it was as if a glamour had been lifted. I saw his fellow rodeo clowns for what they really were — *almost* human creatures with too large eyes and jagged, angular features.  Then, there were the horses that seemed to be made out of earth and tree alike. He'd hurried me through it all, and I'd been powerless to resist, a strange thread tugging at my heart, tying me to him.

Then, he'd left me here, this library tent on the outskirts of the rodeo, filled with dusty old tomes bound in leather, piled upon every surface. It was amazing how many books one could fit into a room, assuming one didn't want to move around very much. Perhaps that had been the point. Rather than locking me up properly, these volumes were to be my prison bars, trapping me in one spot for fear of causing an avalanche of paper.

When he finally returned, I was seething. "What the hell do you think you're doing?" I snapped. "I'm not Belle from Beauty and the Beast! You can't just leave me in a library and expect me to be happy!"

A pulse of warmth surged along the ethereal thread that tied us together, and I felt the tightness in my chest ease slightly.

His warped face shifted into an oddly familiar expression, too-large eyes twinkling and too-wide mouth quirking up. "Wouldn't that make you my Disney princess?" With a slight flourish, he burst into song. "*Be my guest, be my guest, put my patience to the test!*"

Another wave of anger burnt through me. Jacob seemed to sense it. His next line caught in his throat, gaze dropping. "I'm sorry," he muttered. "But our rules are clear. I can no more break the bond of a life debt than you. We are fused together until the end of our days. And no amount of amarulence will change that."

"So, what? You're going to keep me here? People will come looking you know."

"We'll have moved on by then," Jacob said sadly. "We're always moving on." He turned to leave, before glancing back over his shoulder. "Sorry about the cattywampus in here, but perhaps you'll find something... useful... to read."

Then, I was alone once again. Reluctant as I was to do *anything* he suggested, boredom soon overcame stubbornness. I started flicking through one of the smaller volumes until I felt that strange tugging on my heart, pulling me towards *something*.

Unable to resist, I followed, abandoning the book I'd chosen for a larger, grander one, bound in ornately patterned leather, pages filled with complex runes. As I stared down at the incomprehensible gibberish, understanding flowed along the thread. I knew what I had to do. What we had to do.

Sometime later, Jacob returned with dinner. The tray was laden with flowers and nuts and berries, beautiful vibrant colours that made my stomach growl. But I only had eyes for the two goblets that seemed to be made of the night sky itself.

"You understand what will happen?" he whispered as he passed me one.

I nodded, taking the drink with trembling hands.

"And you're sure you want to do this?"

To my surprise, my stomach fluttered at the question. But I nodded again nonetheless.

Jacob smiled that lopsided smile of his. "I suppose it is for the best. You're but a young whippersnapper compared to me."

Despite all the fear bubbling beneath the surface, my lip twitched up in return. Then, I drank deep from my cup of stars.

Warmth radiated out as the liquid trickled down my throat. Then, it grew to heat. Soon, fire was raging through my veins, burning away everything until — *snap*. Agony lanced my chest as the bond broke, and the world faded to black.

\---------------------------------------------------------------

Wait, where was I? And what was this stuff in my hair? 

I reached up to pull a chunk of frosting out of it, and memories flooded back of a disastrous decoupage date ended by exploding cake.

As I set off towards home, a voice whispered in my heart *Be careful crossing the road, my dear.*
