Thanks for reading and commenting. I don't do poetry much. The only times I've tried it before I stuck to a very strict structure of syllable counts etc and wanted to try being a little freer here. I think the problem I have is I can hear the rhythm so clearly in my head I forget other people won't necessarily read it that way, so it's useful to know it hasn't worked for you.
