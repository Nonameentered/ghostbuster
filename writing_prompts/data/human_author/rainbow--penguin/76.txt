#Love at First Sight

Euryale took a sip of her coffee, inhaling the rich, chocolatey scent. With the fiery glow the setting sun cast on the piazza and the hum of life in the air, this should have felt like a little slice of heaven. And perhaps it would have been, if she didn't have to experience it alone.

It had been over a century since she'd lost her sister Stheno. And many more since Medusa's death. But she still felt their loss keenly. Perhaps because they had been the only other two beings in the world that could truly know her.

Now, she hid in plain sight in an attempt to avoid meeting the same fate — never leaving the house without a scarf wrapped tightly around her head and a pair of dark sunglasses on her eyes. 

She could feel the snakes writing on her scalp now, itching to be set free to feel the warmth of the sun on their scales. She wished she could oblige them.

Taking another sip of her coffee, she tried to turn her thoughts to more pleasant matters. Perhaps she'd never be able to fully engage with the humans for fear of harming them — or of them harming her — but she could still live vicariously through them. She let her mind wander as she listened in to snatches of conversation around her. 

There was a couple arguing about what they wanted to do tomorrow, visit the acropolis or the Parthenon, go hiking up Philopappos Hill, or have a lazy day lounging by the pool. Euryale suspected the relationship wouldn't last long once they got back home.

A couple of tables over, a proposal was happening. Though she cringed at the cliché of it all, she had to admit the joy on the bride-to-be's face warmed her heart.

In the other direction, a clearly exhausted mum and dad sagged down to sit on the edge of the fountain, their three children running around squealing with delight as they splashed each other. Euryale chuckled to herself.

But even as she savoured these delights of the human experience, her enjoyment was tinged with bitterness. She would never have a lover to bicker with. Never have a wedding. Never have a family. 

Deciding she was clearly too maudlin, she left a few euros on the table and started back to her loft apartment. If she was going to sulk, she might as well do so in peace.

As she walked briskly across the piazza, she kept her gaze lowered to the flagstones — the sunglasses usually kept people safe, but she'd learnt it always paid to be careful. Unfortunately, not looking where she was going had some risks associated with it too.

She only saw the stranger's feet approaching hers when it was too late. They collided head-on, sending Euryale tumbling to the ground.

The stranger faired even worse, getting caught up with Euryale so as to land between her and the flagstones.

"Oh my god! Are you okay?" the gorgon asked, glancing down at the poor woman she was currently crushing. It was only then that she realised the woman's sunkissed skin was too light, the twinkling blue of her eyes too sharp, the shine of her golden locks too bright. She reached up, only to find her sunglasses no longer on her face.

Frozen in horror, she waited for the stranger to turn to stone. Soon, the whole world would see her for what she was and she'd be chased out into exile or killed. Her heart raced as her limbs turned to lead.

"I think so," the woman replied. "Are you?"

Euryale was so shocked, she couldn't find the words. She'd looked at this woman — looked into her eyes — why was she okay? 

"Hello? I'm assuming you're still there. I mean, I can feel you lying on top of me."

"Oh, right," the gorgon mumbled. "Sorry about that." She hurriedly climbed to her feet, hauling the stranger up in the process. As she did, she slowly began to process what the woman had said. Looking more closely at her, she realised the stranger wasn't really looking directly at anything. Her eyes wandered around without focus. 

Still, just because this woman's blindness saved her from the gorgon's stare, didn't mean everything was safe. She looked around frantically until her gaze fell on the fallen sunglasses. Grabbing them as quickly as possible while keeping her eyes lowered, she hurriedly shoved them back onto her face.

"Everything alright?" the woman asked.

"Yes, sorry. I just... I was just picking up something I'd dropped." Her mind worked slowly, used to listening into conversation but not used to engaging in it. "Oh, sorry about the collision by the way. I was miles away."

"Don't worry," the stranger said with a laugh. "These things usually feel like my fault."

"Not at all, I assure you," the gorgon said hastily. 

"Well, that's nice of you to say. So where were you headed in such a hurry?"

"Oh, just home."

"Really? On a beautiful evening like this? The air is so warm. It smells so clear. And can't you feel the hum of the city?"

"I suppose," Euryale replied. But as much as those sensations might have appealed, she was transfixed by the animation and life in the woman's face as she described them.

"In that case, maybe I can persuade you to stay out for a *little* longer. Perhaps even buy you a drink by way of an apology for the collision."

The gorgon's heart fluttered in a way it never had before. Without thinking, she found her mouth replying. "Sure. But I think I should be the one buying the drink."

The woman chuckled. "If you insist. I'm Phoebe by the way."

"Lovely to meet you, Phoebe. I'm... I'm Eury."
