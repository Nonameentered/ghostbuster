Hello! First off, I have to admit that I wasn't *entirely* sure what this one was about. I read it as being about overcoming some hurdle or some adversary or trauma.

Something I thought you did well in the second stanza is to play with the rhythm to get shorter lines and create this kind of frantic feeling like building to something.

Thanks for sharing!
