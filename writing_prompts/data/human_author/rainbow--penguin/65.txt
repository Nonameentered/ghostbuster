#Love Song

“Fly me to the moon,” she said  
“Like the song of old.  
We’ll dance and sing and shout our love,  
And with it warm the cold  
Of deep and dark and endless space.  
We’ll fill the universe  
With the beauty of our true love  
Which can break any curse.”  

I smiled at her little speech,  
Let the words warm my heart.  
With her mind so full of fancy,  
She turned her feelings into art.  
I, of course, had no such skill  
So took her in my arms  
And held her there in soft silence,  
Grateful for her charms.  

Eventually, I found the words,  
That could express my love.  
I took a breath and whispered them.  
“My dear, the stars above  
Hold no great appeal for me,   
For while they may be new,  
I already sit atop the world  
When I am with you.”
