#Customer Complaints

The Reptile Roast Room was known far and wide as the best cafe in all the lands. It was famed for its friendly, warm atmosphere, its *excellent* coffee, and, of course, its owners.

Javaking and Grindjar were expert baristas, completely dedicated to their craft. People would come from far and wide to watch them work. And the novelty draw of watching two dragons at work certainly helped as well.

Javaking was in charge of the bean selection and the roasting. He could sniff out the best blend for the perfect cup of coffee. And he had perfect control over the heat of the roast because he used his own flame to do it, breathing gently on the beans until they were *just* right.

Then it was Grindjar's turn. He used his strong claws to grind the beans to the exact size required for each type of brewing equipment. And they did it all, espresso machines, drip filters, french presses, aero presses, percolators, vacuum siphors. There wasn't a brewing method that they hadn't tried and tested. 

They took great pride in their work. And they *knew* that every cup they made was perfect.

Which is why, when a particularly loud-mouthed customer started complaining about his brew being burnt, they weren't having any of it.

"I demand a refund!" the short, red-faced man shouted. "And another cup!"

"But sir," Javaking said smoothly, "You seem to have completely finished your last one already."

"Well... Yes... Err... I had to be *sure* it was burnt, you see."

Grindjar looked down at him, letting a tendril of smoke coil out of one nostril.

The man suppressed a shudder. "Look, I know my rights. It's bad enough they let the likes of you run a business anyway, so you'd damn well better respect your customers." He glared at them, eyes flicking between the reptilian heads towering over him. "And if you don't, I'll... I'll fetch a knight to slay you both!" He folded his arms, a satisfied smile on his face.

"Oh, you'll fetch a night, will you?" purred Javaking. He turned to his co-worker. "He'll fetch a knight."

"It seems he wants a return to the old ways," Grindjar replied. "To how dragon-human relations once were."

"It does seem that way, doesn't it."

The pair turned back to him, eyes narrowing and nostrils flaring.

All colour drained from the man's face, turning it from beet red to ghostly white. Yet still, he persisted. "Look here. you aren't going to— Argh!"

A large claw closing around him cut him off. Javaking dragged him out of the shop before beating his wings a couple of times and taking to the air. The man's wails could be heard throughout the village as he was carried away, but the townsfolk paid it no heed. They were used to how the dragons dealt with problem customers.

Javaking eventually came to land on a tall tower, gently lowering the once angry now scared man through a window. Inside were a handful of other people — previous problem customers.

"Who's this then?" one man said. "I'm not going to be sharing any more space!"

"Too right!" a woman declared. "I demand to speak to... to the monarch about this!"

"He'd better pull his weight with the cooking at cleaning!"

Javaking smirked. "I'm sorry you were dissatisfied with your service. I'll leave you here to think over your complaint." As he took back to the air, he called over his shoulder, "We'll be happy to talk again once you can manage to do so in a civilised manner."

The Reptile Room was known far and wide as the best cafe in all the lands. And it had the *politest* customers.
