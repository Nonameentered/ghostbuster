#Face of an Angel

I first saw her in the library. She had her button nose buried in a book, freckles dancing as emotions flitted across her face — wholly absorbed in the fictional world.

I couldn't go over, beaten down by fear and self-doubt as I was. But in the end, it didn't matter. She came to me, chestnut curls bouncing with each step, floral dress floating around her as she walked.

"Hey there," she half-whispered. 

Even in these hushed tones, her sultry voice sent a shiver down my spine. 

"I don't suppose you know where I might find something else like this?" She held up the book — *Wuthering Heights*. 

I blinked a couple of times, trying to collect my thoughts. It wasn't that I was a complete stranger to women. I had plenty of experience pursuing them, working my way into their hearts. But normally I had more time to prepare. "You'll have to forgive me," I said with a nervous chuckle. "You find me a little jargorgled, by which I mean—"

"That you're confused." Her freckled face split in two with a wide grin which set my pulse racing.

"Exactly. But I should still be able to help you find your next book." With a gargantuan force of will, I tore my eyes away from her to start walking. "Come on, I'll show you where you can find some similar titles."

From then on, I couldn't stop thinking about her. My last shred of self-control melted away. We all go a little mad sometimes, but she had bewitched me body and soul.

After a few more chance encounters and book recommendations, I finally secured a date. Dinner. Her place. Friday night.

I spent the whole day prepping. By the time evening rolled around I was buzzing with anticipation. Heart racing. Palms sweating. Skin tingling.

After taking a moment to adjust my backpack, I raised a trembling hand and knocked.

The door swung open to reveal that angelic face, eyes sparkling and lips pulled back in an inviting smile that sent a jolt of desire to my chest. The corners of my own mouth couldn't help but twitch upwards.

"Well, hello there," she said softly. "Would you like to come inside?"

I nodded, not trusting myself to keep my voice level, bubbling with excitement as I was. 

As I stepped through the entrance, my arm brushed against hers, sending static shooting over my skin and crimson flashing behind my eyes. I'd planned to wait until after dinner. To enjoy the meal. To savour the moment.

But I couldn't last that long alone in her presence.

As soon as I heard the lock *click* into place, I whirled around to face her — so close I could feel the warmth coming off of her, feel her breath on my skin. Her eyes flashed, widening as I stepped closer still, trapping her between my body and the door.

I knew I should have waited. Followed the plan, like with the others. I hadn't even taken the time to get my *gifts* for her out of my bag. But there was just something about *her* that called to me.

Slowly, deliberately, I raised a trembling hand to stroke her cheek, gently tucking a wayward chestnut curl behind her ear before trailing my fingers down to that long elegant neck—

Her eyes flashed again as agony lanced my gut.

Staggering back, I glanced down to see scarlet blossoming from a wound in my stomach, a flash of steel in her hand.

Before I could recover myself, she shoved me hard, the impact rattling out from my shoulder and sending me sagging to the ground. 

I stared up at the beautiful, fearsome angle of death towering over me, pain lancing through me with every movement. Every breath. "Why?" I rasped.

"Why!" she spat. "Like you weren't planning on doing the same! Like you didn't already do the same to so many others!" She stepped closer, staring down at me along the blade of her knife. "You think I didn't recognise you the moment I first saw you in the library?"

"Recognise?"

"You took my roommate on a date she never returned from." She bent closer, the tip of her weapon grazing against my neck. "Of course, you don't remember me. Back then, you only had eyes for *her*."

"But... But I loved you," I cried. "You were different. I swear it's the truth."

Her face twisted in disgust. "Your truths are worse than your lies! You think I could ever want to be loved by someone like you?"

"But—"

"Enough talk." The blade pressed deeper against my neck.

The last thing I saw was her staring down that button nose, freckles dancing with the expressions flitting across her face as the life drained out of me.
