#The Sphinx of Deadwood

Papa always said the mines were dangerous. I wasn't to go near 'em. 

Sometimes, Papa's rules confused me, but I knew they were never to be broke. Besides, there were plenty other places in Deadwood I could run and play — when I wasn't stuck helping Mama in the kitchen. 

Oh, how I loved to spend the afternoon climbin' trees or splashin' in the creek, always in the company of Jimmy. He lived next door and had sandy hair, freckles, and the cutest button nose I'd ever seen, and I was gonna marry him one day. I'd decided that on the first day I met him, when he offered me a shiny pebble he'd found on the dusty ground. That pebble had sat in my pocket ever since. 

The day it all happened, we were stompin' around in the hills playin' at being bandits.

When the real thing rode into town, it was like our game had come to life. Until the first shot rang out, and we knew they weren't playin'.


"Quick!" Jimmy beckoned me towards him.

I didn't need to be told twice, scurrying through the fallen leaves to where he stood. We looked this way and that, searchin' for a spot to hide, clutchin' at each other like the village drunk holdin' onto his last bottle of Apple Jack.

Another shot echoed off the hills, settin' my knees quakin'. 

"Whadda we do?" he whispered.

"How in the hell should I know?" I muttered back, hoping Papa would forgive me for airin' my lungs given the circumstance. "Maybe we'll be safe here. Ain't much out here bandits could want."

Jimmy nodded, but he was shiverin' and shakin' as much as me.

We stood like that for Lord knows how long, clingin' to each other for fear of our lives, frozen to the spot.

Until the clatter of hoof-beats snapped us back to life, and we were out of there faster than a bull on brandin' day. We tore through the trees like it was the devil himself behind us, payin' no heed to where we were goin'. And that's how we ended up where I was never meant to go.

"Come on," Jimmy hissed, draggin' me toward the mine entrance — a great black hole in the side of the hill that looked like it might swallow me whole.

"I can't. I promised Papa!"

"I think your Papa would prefer a broken promise to a broken head! Now come on!"

A hollerin' and hootin' from down the track was all the encouragement I needed, and I followed jimmy into the forbidden zone. We didn't get far before the sunlight ran out, leavin' us stranded in dark so deep it could drown you. 

I could feel the weight of the earth on top of me. The only sounds were our raspin' breaths and the scuffle of our feet. 

"Here we are, boys!" The voice from the mine entrance made us both jump outta our skins. "There's always money in these here mines!"

Heavy footsteps followed, along with laughter full so full o' malice and spite it could strip paint.

"They're comin' in," I hissed, clutchin' to Jimmy even tighter.

Together we shuffled further into the earth's belly, backs grazin' against the mine wall. An orange glow was creepin' in after us with the faint flicker of a flame.

I bit my lip to hold in the screams that were begging to be let out, plunging my free hand into my pocket to squeeze the pebble there as if it could give me comfort. I thought we were done for. And I'm certain Jimmy did too.

Until a voice smooth as silk purred from the darkness. "Hello there, little ones."

Ice ran through my veins, freezin' every inch o' me. Jimmy stiffened too, back ramrod straight.

"Don't fear. I will not harm you," the voice said. A strange light leapt into the air from the same direction, enough to see shadows and hints at a shape. It looked like a woman. Or maybe a mountain lion. But then, there were the wings.

Whatever it was, it prowled past until it stood firmly between us and the danger that was fast approachin'.

"What... Who are you, miss?" Jimmy asked quietly, ever the gentleman. "Doncha know those men are bandits? They're dangerous."

The creature glanced over a shoulder, flashin' a smile that glinted in the strange light it cast. "Not as dangerous as me, dear one," she purred.

Quiverin' behind Jimmy, I poked my head out. "You're dangerous?"

She chuckled. "Not to you little ones. Only to those who would take my treasure — the treasures of the earth — as these men intend to." 

"What are you gonna—"

"Hush now, child. They're almost here. Now close your eyes and cover your ears. Do it!"

The stern tone brooked no argument. I buried my face in Jimmy's shoulder and he buried his in mine. Before I could bring my hands to my ears I heard a snarl that set my bones a-shiverin' followed by a scream that turned my blood to ice. Then, everything was muffled and quiet.

I don't know how long we stood like that, wrapped around each other, blockin' out the terrors of the world. We only peeled apart when that strange creature padded back to us, tappin' me with a long, soft tail.

"It is safe now, little ones," she purred. 

The light she cast was fadin', but before we sank into the black again, I caught a flash o' scarlet over the walls of the cave. 

"Thanks, miss," Jimmy muttered.

"Yeah, thanks," I added hastily.

"Go on now," she replied. "I'm sure your parents are worried about where their treasures have gotten to."

As we started to hurry back towards the mine entrance, somethin' stopped me in my tracks — a sense of debt or gratitude. This stranger had most likely saved our lives and the town's livelihood. I wanted to give her something just as precious.

Reaching into my pocket I drew out that shiny pebble Jimmy had given me all those years ago and held it out on my outstretched palm. "Here, miss," I said. "I want ya to have this. As a thank you."

I couldn't see what was happenin' in the dark. But I felt somethin' strange brush against my hand. Then, the weight of the pebble had gone.

"Thank you, dear one," the voice purred. "I will treasure it just as you did."

Our debt paid, we hurried back into the light of day, and back to our parents. Though we never told 'em what happened that day in the mines. It was to be our secret, for the rest of our days together.

Thanks for the prompt. This one was a real challenge as I'm not comfortable in the Western genre, but I wanted to try and stretch myself.
