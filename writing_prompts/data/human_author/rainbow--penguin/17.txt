So, this month hasn't been great. I think I managed two out of the four tasks:

1) Write a Western — I did not do this, but I'm going to blame the fact that I'd written one for a PM the previous week so was all tapped out for ideas

2) Share a novel idea — Yep! And some good brainstorming came out of it.

3) Dig through old notes and write an outline — Yep! I have an outline ready from a template on NaNo's website. Now to just see how much I'll stick to it.

4) Write four serial chapters — lol, nope! I managed one. Still that's something I suppose.

This month I will:

1) For at least twenty days in November, write at least 500 words.

2) Not let the amount of time I spend on a hobby other than writing drop (I often worry I do a few too many things, so I probably won't find this too difficult XD).

3) I figure I might as well set myself the big 50k goal here as a little extra motivation to really go for it.

4) Hmmm, coming up with a fourth this month is tough as I'll mainly be focussing on Nano. So perhaps I'll go with a slightly wishy-washy one of communicating with my fellow writers, to both offer and receive support throughout the month, as I think it might be all too easy to shut myself away as I try and plough on through the words.
