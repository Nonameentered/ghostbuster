#The Cost of Truth

A single moment was all it took to dispel my illusions of a happy life, one joking comment from a coworker about seeing me the next day, and the day after that...

I saw my life mapped out, following the flow that had been laid out before me. I was at the mercy of the currents of fate, trapped in the single swirling eddy that was The Bubble.

For years, I'd accepted it. But now, I was famelicose for more.

Except that there was no *more*. Not here. There was no room for it. No room for growth. No room for change. We're born and we die without ever having truly lived.

So I did the one thing we were never meant to do. I left.

When I reached the border, staring up at the dome of shimmering light encompassing everything, I closed my eyes and stepped through. There was a slight resistance, as if the air grew thicker, like treacle, but it gave way with a *twang* as I pushed onward.

I opened my eyes onto a new world. Gone were the ordered streets, lined with identical dull, drab buildings. Instead, vibrant forest stretched before me. Not the pristinely pruned trees from inside the Bubble, but wild, overgrown oaks, teeming with life. Squirrels chattered. Birds sang. The breeze tickled my skin.

I breathed deeply, inhaling the scents of sweet pollen and fresh green shoots, letting my lungs fill with freedom.

No wonder they kept this from us. Who would waste their life toiling away in The Bubble when they knew this was what awaited them outside?

Hoiking my bag up on my back, I started walking, each footstep throwing new sounds and scents into the air. The snap of twigs beneath my feet. The rustle of leaves. The earthy smell of decay, feeding into the new life blooming all around. I wondered if there were others out here, like me, who'd thrown off the shackles of ordinary life to explore the outside world.

I got my answer soon enough.

As I continued through the forest, something *crunched* beneath my foot, catching on my shoe. I yanked it up as hard as I could, stumbling in the process, landing on a bed of leaves and pine needles with a thud that reverberated up my spine, staring into the *thing* on my foot.

A skull.

Cold dread swept through me, chased away by the fire of adrenaline coursing through my veins. I tried to scrabble away but my shoe was firmly lodged inside, sunken, hollow eyes staring into my soul as it followed.

*Another one?* a strange voice whispered from the canopy above. It sounded like it came from the trees themselves, formed by the wind through the leaves and the creak of the branches.

I looked around frantically. But I couldn't see the speaker.

*Did it not like the world we made for it?* 

*Ungrateful wretch! We shall just have to consume it the old-fashioned way.*

Driven by desperation, I worked up the courage to grab the skull that held my foot captive, shivering at the touch of the cold bone as I yanked myself free. Then, I scrabbled to my feet and ran.

But no matter where I went, the voices followed.

*Ooh! A chase! How exciting!*

*Yes! Run! It's been too long since we had some sport.*

I tried to block them out, focusing on the sound of blood rushing in my ears, of my racing heart, of my pounding feet.

As I ran, I searched for a familiar sight, anything that would lead me back to the safety of The Bubble, but it was as if the trees had twisted around me. I had no idea where I was. Where I was going. But still, I ran.

Until a root caught at my foot, pain exploding as my ankle twisted. I fell to the ground hard, grazing my hands as I scrabbled back to my feet. 

Fire flared in the joint with every step. But still, I limped on.

*Has it had enough yet?*

*Is it time?*

Tears streamed down my face as I bit back screams of agony. Vision blurred, I stumbled once more. But this time, I couldn't find the strength to get back up.

*It's time.*

I dragged myself onward, scraping across the forest debris. Until something clamped around my ankle, and I could hold back the screams no more.

*Silly creature. We tried to do you a kindness.*

*Made you a home and a life to feed off of you in peace.*

*And yet you chose to die in distress.*

The last thing I saw was a flash of teeth and claws formed from splintered bark.

Don't part with your illusions of a happy life. The lie is far preferable to the truth.
