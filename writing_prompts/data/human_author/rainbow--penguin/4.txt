I really enjoyed your setting descriptions, particularly how it was all viewed through the eyes of the MC with a view to the assassination. That was a great way to let you include those details naturally while also chucking in some characterisation and plot at the same time.

The only exception to that for me was here:

> I brushed my hand against the hilt of the dagger at my hip--I knew it was secure, as my own gown (which was an undistinguished steel blue) had been custom-tailored to conceal the blade in the petticoat.

where because we had an aside within an aside (brackets within em-dashed section) it just felt a little bit too "tell" rather than "show". I think you could probably just cut the detail about the colour of the gown, or include it elsewhere as the MC is walking through the crowd with their dress brushing against others.

Overall I loved the premise of the story and think you executed it well with a distinctive character voice. I just wish there was a little more room for words so we could see what happens next!
