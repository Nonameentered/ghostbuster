Great advice. A perhaps on brand (given the username) fact that I love is that most penguins live places without land predators so they're super friendly to humans. Stuff like that is really important for what will happen in a story.

And as you mention, that might change for an animal depending on if it has eggs or babies too.

Thanks for sharing!
