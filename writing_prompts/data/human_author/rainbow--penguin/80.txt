#With the Help of the Hydra

Helen the Hydra sighed as she picked herself up off the ground, regrowing body parts as she needed. With her one, still fully-intact head, she peered out at the boat sailing away, carrying yet another hero who'd come to prove his strength by slaying her.

There had been a time she'd enjoyed the sport of it all. She'd practically dared them to come find her, prowling the marshes around their villages and stealing livestock. But age had mellowed her.

It had been many years ago now that she'd retreated from the realms of man, secreting herself away on this desolate island, miles from anything. Yet still, they came.

Perhaps she should kill them as she used to. But she found she didn't have the energy or appetite anymore. So she pretended to let them win, feigning death until they left her in peace.

As the victorious hero's ship fell over the horizon, she slunk back to her main residence, a lake sheltered by a cave near the centre of the island. There she tended her wounds, brushing away damaged scales, before coiling her tail and many long necks around herself to sleep.

Helen was awoken some time later by a timid cough.

Opening one of her large, slitted eyes, she took in the scene. It wasn't long after dawn, the pale pink and purple hues still hanging in the sky. She could feel the warmth of the sun's first rays on her dark scales. But she couldn't see the source of the sound.

She slid back her second set of eyelids and lifted a head to look around. There was the dark cavern behind her — empty save a few bones from previous meals. The trees were swaying in the breeze, a few of the braver or more reckless inhabitants of the island watching her from their branches — but they were all at least smart enough to remain silent.

Eventually, her gaze fell on a small figure standing a hundred or so metres back from the edge of her lake, half hidden by the long grass.

As her eyes locked onto his, she saw his pupils widen, his whole body trembling. But he stood his ground.

She watched him carefully, unsure what to make of this. Normally, people who discovered her sleeping took full advantage of that fact. She barely even stirred before sagging to the ground in an imitation of death as they severed her heads. Yet this young man seemed to be waiting for something — perhaps had even intentionally woken her.

"G-Greetings," he shouted over to her. "M-My apologies for disturbing you."

Arching an eyebrow, she slithered towards him. 

He stumbled back a couple of steps before standing his ground.

"And who might you be?" Helen hissed.

"I am Alexander," he declared. 

"And why are you here?"

He blanched slightly, colour draining from his face. "I was sent to... to kill you." Seeing her bared teeth, he hurriedly added, "But I don't want to. I just want to prove myself to my love's family so that can be with her. It was them that insisted I come. They said it was the only way." His head dropped to the ground, shoulders slumping. "I think they said it as they know I'm not a fighter. They meant for me to die here so their daughter could marry some great warrior."

"I see," Helen said slowly. "So what do you mean to do?"

"I wondered if... if maybe I could just pretend I'd killed you?"

The hydra snorted. Technically that was what all the heroes who came to kill her did. They just did so in ignorance, fully believing the lie of their victory. "I think that can be arranged."

Alexander's jaw dropped, face lighting up. "Really?"

"Though I will ask something of you in return," she added, an idea forming. This conversation was the most interesting thing to happen to her in decades.

"Yes, of course," he said hurriedly. "Anything."

"All I ask is that you return here once a year. Tell me tales of the outside world. Keep me company."

Alexander's brow furrowed for a moment. "Really? That's all?"

"That's all," Helen nodded her many heads.

"Then I accept!"

After some careful deliberation, the hydra selected a neck for him to sever, lying it gently across the ground at his feet. She winced as the blade sank into her flesh, but she was used to it by now. 

She watched him hurry back to a ship with a smile spreading across her many mouths, wondering if he'd keep his word.

Sure enough, one year and many encounters with foolish heroes later, Alexander returned. And he brought with him a young woman.

"Greetings, Hydra!" he called out on his approach. "I'd like you to meet Sophia."

"Welcome. And please, you may call me Helen."

She watched and listened, every one of her many pairs of eyes and ears trained on him, as he recounted the year's events. But, as interested as Helen was in what he had to say, she found her attention more focused on Alexander and Helen's body language. 

She noticed how each would gaze at the other when they weren't looking, eyes swimming with adoration and lips pulled into a wide smile. She saw how they seemed to find it impossible to ever *not* be in contact with each other. Their fingers entwined together. Heads rested on each other's shoulders. Feet brushing against each other.

It warmed her heart to see a young couple so in love.

The pair returned many times, always with news from the outside world. Over the years, she watched their love deepen and their relationship grow. She greeted the children they brought with them, allowing them to play hero with her.

Perhaps she would never find another of her kind, but at least now she felt she had a family.
