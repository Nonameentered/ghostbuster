#Project Phoenix

Man had often sought to venture amongst the stars. At some point in their long history, it became a matter of *when* rather than *if*. The only other question was — *how*?

Many methods were proposed. Plasma thrusters. Fusion engines. Solar sails. Wormhole generators.

No one expected the solution to be organic.

That is, until a small group of scientists, inspired by the myths and legends of old, began working on Project Phoenix.

A mere decade later, the fleet was born — each ship crafted around one of the specially engineered creatures. The inbuilt navigation system of the birds was ideal for long-haul flight. Their strong wings guaranteed easy take-off and steering. And the flame that lived inside them would provide the propulsion and warmth needed in the vacuum of space.

As the lead genetic engineer behind the project, Dr Eleanor Shiffer set sail on the first voyage, along with a team handpicked for establishing a permanent colony in another star system. There were mechanics, farmers, biologists, and engineers — each with their own important skill. It was difficult not to feel like an impostor amongst them. After all, what help could Eleanor be now? Her part in all of this was done, surely.

But she was saved from fretting about it too much, instead sinking into the deep, blissful sleep of cryostasis trusting the phoenix to find its own way through the stars.

The feeling of waking from the long sleep was a strange one. In what seemed like the blink of an eye to her, she knew generations had lived and died back on Earth. Perhaps more of the Phoenix fleet hat set off on their journeys. Perhaps the technology was now obsolete.

But there wasn't much room for such musings as the crew caught the first glimpse of their destination — designated planet WY-5 3RN.

It had been selected based on measurements of its atmosphere, temperature, and gravitational field. It seemed ideal to support life. It was also conveniently situated as a stepping stone to other star systems. And their first view of it was breathtaking.

"I can definitely see water," her colleague Michael remarked.

"And there's plenty of green, too," Georgie said. "Very promising indeed."

Eleanor only smiled, staring out at the orb floating in the blackness of space, growing ever larger. So still. So peaceful. Until—

"What was that?" she gasped.

"What?" Michael asked.

"That!" Eleanor pointed out the porthole at the planet's surface. "I definitely saw something move. And quickly too."

"It was probably just the clouds shifting," Georgie said. "Maybe a strong wind. The weather patterns are likely going to be different to Earth."

Watching the planet closely, Eleanor said nothing. She wasn't sure what she'd seen, and she wasn't going to argue with the experts.

Soon, the ship was descending into the new atmosphere, the phoenix's wings taking control once more to glide down to the surface. The journey was smooth and gentle. Eleanor had almost managed to put the strange sight out of her mind when a shadow darted by once again.

The Phoenix swerved to avoid a collision, sending the crew tumbling to the ground. 

Eleanor's heart raced, legs turning to jelly. She looked around, hoping one of the security experts would take control.

Sure enough, an alarm blared. "Please take up emergency positions. Fasten seatbelts and brace."

Eleanor pulled one of the foldable chairs down from the wall and sank into it gratefully, buckling herself in. Around her, her colleagues were doing the same.

Without speaking, they linked hands, squeezing each other tight in an attempt to draw some comfort, no one wanting to voice the question in all of their minds.

But, after a few more bumps and swerves, they came to a stop on firm ground once again. 

Eleanor let out a breath, extracting sweaty palms from her neighbours. "We made it," she sighed, a laugh of relief bubbling up inside of her. "We actually made it."

"But what was all that?" Michael asked. "Just... turbulence?"

Georgie shrugged. "I suppose we'll just have to find out."

A voice boomed over the intercom again. "Would Dr Eleanor Shiffer please report to the bridge. Dr Eleanor Schiffer to the bridge."

Eleanor blanched, colour draining from her face and legs turning to jelly. If she hadn't already been sat down, she feared she would have sagged to the floor. "What can they want with me?" she whispered.

"Oh, I don't know," Georgie said, lightly elbowing her in the ribs. "You're only the genius that got us here after all."

"Go on." Michael helped her to her feet and shoved her gently in the right direction. "You don't want to keep them waiting."

The journey down the steel corridor felt like an eternity. Even when she reached the bridge she didn't get her answers, instead being bundled off to get dressed in landing gear before being led to an airlock. It was only as she waited there, separated only from the new world by a single sheet of metal, that she found her voice again.

"What's going on?" she asked one of the security team.

"Well, we're not quite sure, Doc," he replied. "But it looks like your phoenix has made a friend."

With a hiss, the door opened onto a world of dense vegetation. Flanked by the security team, Eleanor stepped outside marvelling at the alien sights and sounds.

There was a lot that was reminiscent of Earth. Things that were vaguely tree-shaped. Bright coloured plants that would have graced any garden. The whir of insects in the air. But everything was slightly *wrong*. 

The shades and shapes were all wrong — everything too big or too small, too bright or too dim. There was no doubt that this wasn't Earth.

As the group walked forward, Eleanor's eyes fell on the phoenix's 'friend' and all thoughts of similarities were chased from her mind. A large reptile with mottled purple scales and wings made of a thin membrane was nuzzling the beak of her bird. As she watched, a jet of flame shot out of the creature's nose which the phoenix playfully snapped at.

Perhaps she should have felt scared or anxious. But all she could muster was wonder and curiosity. Perhaps there *would* be something for her to do here after all.

Thanks for the prompt. Sorry if I didn't properly include the planet, but I couldn't quite get this idea out of my head so had to write it.
