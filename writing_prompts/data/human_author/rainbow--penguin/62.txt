#A Good Old-Fashioned Haunting

Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground and start over. Particularly when the house you're haunting is inhabited by *the* most ridiculous, obnoxious, infuriating imbecile.

A spilt bottle of oil and a well-placed spark was all it took, and I was finally free of Dave's constant inane chatter to himself, his ludicrously loud chewing, and his frankly appalling housekeeping skills. If anything, the fire tidied the place up.

Don't get me wrong, I made sure Dave was out of the house when it happened. After all, I didn't want to get stuck with him for eternity. Just the thought makes me want to immigrate to a different plane of existence. I just wanted — no, needed him to find somewhere else to live.

And for the first few years, it was bliss!

I got to haunt the creepy, burnt-out ruin on the corner of the street. The garden got overgrown. The gate rusted. And the local legend grew. Kids would dare each other to go into the house and I'd give them the fright of their lives. I pulled out all the old classics — scraping my nails across the wall to make a horrible screeching sound and leave tracks in the soot, passing through the unsuspecting victim to leave them shaken and shivering. 

Every now and then I'd let the intrepid explorer go unscathed — those I found intriguing. I have an interest in the outsiders. The underdogs. And they'd come back again and again. I knew it was most likely all just them showing off to their friends, proving how brave they were to venture into the haunted house where most feared to tread. But I liked to think that perhaps they sensed the presence of a kindred spirit.

Of course, my bliss couldn't last. Eventually, the construction crew arrived with their noisy tools and gruff manner. They were harder prey than the local kids, but I gave it my best, repeating my mantra at every failure: *Every time you find something that doesn't work, you're a step closer to what does work.*

Moving coffee mugs didn't seem to have the desired effect.

Nor did banging on the walls — they could hardly hear it over their own noise.

But messing with their machinery... Now that had potential.

Over the next few months, I gave them many a scare with a well-timed drill swerving out of their grip, or a digger trundling across the sight of its own volition. Though they always seemed to blame each other or the *damn no good tech*, their reactions still offered some amusement.

Until their work was done, and I was alone in a perfect, freshly built house with a neat garden and a white picket fence. Not the ideal spot for a ghost, but I was used to making the best of things.

So when the new family moved in, I immediately got to work.

The young boy was the obvious first target. Parents could easily be creeped out by messages of doom from a child's lips. So I knew exactly what to do.

Taking my time, I scratched a message into his bedroom wall: *GET OUT* 

A little cliché, I know, but they're classics for a reason.

Only this time, when I turned around eagerly to see the effect it had... Nothing. Instead of quaking in fear or running from the room, he was lounging on his bed with headphones on and a screen in front of his face, completely oblivious.

So I moved on to the older sister. I spent my time moving her things around and tearing up her clothes. But she was such a slob she hardly noticed. And what difference did a few extra tears make to those strange jeans she chose to wear anyway.

Giving up on the children, I moved on to the parents. Adults were always harder. They rationalised and explained away. But I had to try, otherwise, what point was there?

And I tried everything. Flickering lights. Rumbling pipes. Doors slamming. Heck, I even threw a salt shaker across the room. They'd just glance up from their phones and mutter something about 'damn new builds' before returning to their virtual world.

It was hopeless. I found myself drifting the halls in search of peace and quiet from them and their music and their squabbles and their games, jumping whenever one of *them* appeared.

Such is the life of a ghost in this modern world. Now everything is upside-down and inside out. I no longer haunt humans. I am haunted by humans.
