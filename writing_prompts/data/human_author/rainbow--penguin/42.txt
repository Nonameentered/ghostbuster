#The Most Haunted City

It was a dark and stormy night in York, the wind howling down the narrow, twisty streets. Nathalie pulled her coat tighter to keep out the chill as she hurried along the Shambles, shoes clacking over the cobblestones. The warmth of the library seemed but a distant memory now.

As she rounded the corner, the Minster bell started tolling in the background. She counted off the *bongs* in time to her steps.

*Bong. Click. Bong. Click.*

It was hard to hear over the storm, but as she reached Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma-Gate, she *thought* it had reached twelve.

Until she stepped onto the tiny street and another *BONG* rang out, reverberating in her bones and sending a shiver down her spine.

Dipping her head, Nathalie picked up the pace.

But when she glanced up again, everything had...changed? The storm had faded into the background and though she still felt chilled to her core, the icy touch of the wind had died away. And she could have sworn she'd been walking in the opposite direction before. So how was she facing the Golden Fleece?

Staring at the pub in confusion, something shifted. *Shouldn't there be a cat statue?*

The question hooked into her brain, drawing her toward the building, gaze locked on.

There! That movement again! Always on the edge of her vision, dancing in her peripheries.

Until it danced straight into view — a small white cat prancing through the air, twirling around the sign holder.

Nathalie blinked a few times, rubbing her temples. Clearly, she'd listened to one too many ghost stories about the pub, retold over and over by fellow history students, and now her exhausted and befuddled brain was playing tricks on her. Shaking her head, she turned to start back in the *correct* direction—

But instead of the *click* of cobblestones, her shoes squelched in *something*. She looked down to see a dark red substance flowing out of the Shambles. The tang of copper assaulted her senses, clawing at the back of her throat.

She tried to scream, but it came out a strangled shriek as she choked on the stench, staggering away until she'd regained enough composure to start running.

Her eyes streamed, heart pounding and blood rushing in her ears. No idea where she was going. Anywhere but here.

She ran past a battalion of men marching down the street with spears held aloft. She ran past a devil who cackled with glee. She ran past a fire raging on the top of Clifford's tower, screams ringing out from inside. 

Her feet tore through a fog which crept over the moonlit Knavesmire. A knocking drew her attention, head whipping around to land on a gallows jutting out the mist, noose swinging against the post. A horse that looked to be made out of the night itself charged past, its masked rider brandishing a pistol.

These flashes of York passed her by, connected in ways that made no sense, each of them burning itself into her brain and making her blood roar.

But eventually, despite the adrenaline coursing through her, she could run no longer. Heaving in deep breaths, she sank back against an old brick wall, legs trembling beneath her as wide, streaming eyes glanced all around

"You alright there, dear?" a voice whispered into her ear.

Yelping, she flinched away, turning to face a washed-out-looking woman in a window.

"I... don't know," she sobbed. "I was just... walking home..."

"Did you walk through Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma-Gate, my love?"

The strange question was oddly calming, confusing her out of her fear. "Yes, but I don't see—"

"At midnight?"

"...yes."

"That'll do it then." The woman nodded, frizzy, knotted hair moving oddly out of sync with her head. "That street's neither one thing nor the other. No one remembers when it started, but it acts kinda like a bridge — under particular conditions. Just head back out that way and you'll be right as rain, dear."

"Thanks," Nathalie muttered, forcing her trembling legs to take her full weight once again as she started walking.

"Oh, dearie!" the woman called after her. "Probably best to forget all about this. Who cares if it's true or not? Wouldn't want to lose your mind."

Nathalie nodded, hurrying out of Mad Alice Lane and back to Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma-Gate. As she walked out the other end of the street, she heard the dying toll of the Minster bell and felt the rain on her skin.

With a shake of her head, she strode purposefully towards home, pushing all other thoughts out of her mind. It had been a dream. It must have been. A hallucination spawned by sleepless nights spent studying and stressing over exams, spurred on by the weather. It had been a dark and stormy night.
