Hello!

I loved the imagery in this and the journey we went on. I thought you did a great job describing the scene and all the emotions of the climber throughout.

I also loved your last stanza. I really like how you end on that note of trying and trying again, not giving up.

Only things I noticed here were that sometimes the last line of the stanza felt almost as if it was one syllable short. Like here:

> Pure joy on my face.

I kind of expected "pure joy upon my face"

The other thing was the rhyming scheme here:

>Nearby rests a deep, clear pond,  
>Peacefulness unmatched.  
>I walk the bank and dip my toes,  
>Yet know that this won't last.  

I wondered if you'd chosen to break it on purpose, but wasn't quite sure what the effect you were going for was. I thought it might have just been trying to make things feel unsettled, which would fit in with what happened next.

Overall I really enjoyed the story you told through the poem. I think you encapsulated the prompt and the bonus constraint very well.
