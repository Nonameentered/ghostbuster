#Midlife Crisis

"And how are you today, Arges?" the optometrist asked, adjusting her own glasses as she glanced down at her notes.

"I'm alright, Theia. A little tired. You know how it is."

She nodded. "Zeus keeping you busy, I'd guess."

"Yeah," Arges said with a sigh. "There's always something that needs smithing. Not that I don't love it of course, it's just..." He trailed off, not really sure where the sentence had been going anyway.

Theia looked back up at him, a sympathetic smile tugging at her lips. "So what brings you here today?"

Snapping his thoughts back into order, Arges replied, "Oh, you know. Us cyclops need to take especially good care of our vision. No back-ups so to speak."

She gave a polite chuckle. "Any problems?"

"Not that I've noticed. Perhaps things aren't as sharp as they used to be but... it's tough to remember after so many centuries."

"Well, let's have a look then. Pop your chin here for me."

Arges leaned forward, resting his head in the strange contraption. The optometrist hurriedly adjusted a few settings, aligning it for his one central eye instead of the more usual two. 

A small image of a sheep appeared for him to stare at, shifting in and out of focus. 

When that was over, a puff of air fired into his eye. He gritted his teeth against the urge to blink.

Next, a bright light shone, making the urge even stronger. But as soon as it had arrived, it was gone.

"Alrighty then," Theia said. "You can lift your head back up for me now and we'll move on to the main test."

The cyclops blinked his eye a few times, rubbing it with a knuckle as he sat back up. 

"Over here," the optometrist called, pointing at a sign on the wall. "Read aloud for me."

Arges said each letter as he read it, progressing down the sign as the script got smaller and smaller. Eventually, he reached the point where it was all just a black blur to him. 

"Is that bad?" he asked, palms sweating slightly. "My vision definitely feels worse to me."

Theia lay a hand on his shoulder. "It's nothing to worry about. Now, tell me if this is any better."

She cycled through a series of lenses in front of his eye, each time checking if it made his sight better or worse.

When they came to the end, Arges's head was starting to ache.

"Okay," Theia said. "I've got your prescription here. It looks like your vision is starting to go a little. But it's nothing to worry about. Just the millennia catching up with you. I've got a prescription ready for you that should help."

Despite her calm tone, Arges could feel his heart racing. For so long, it had felt like he'd live forever, blacksmith to the gods with his two brothers. But if he was starting to show signs of old age, what next? How long would he be able to swing his hammer? How long until the work was too hard for him? And when that happened, what would he do with his life? Would he be too old and broken to enjoy it?

"Arges?" her soft voice snapped him out of his thoughts. "You okay there, Arges?"

He shook his head but said, "Yeah. Just a... what do the humans call it... a bit of a midlife crisis."

She gave another polite chuckle. "Well then, I suggest you pick up your new monocle and go and enjoy the centuries you have left. And don't forget to come back in another couple of decades for a check-up!"

He left with a smile, resolving to do as she bid. Sure, he loved blacksmithing, but there was more to life than work. And if his time was limited, he was going to make the most of it.
