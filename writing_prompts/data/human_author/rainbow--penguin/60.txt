#Fishing for Compliments

To Trixie, the school trip to the aquarium meant one thing â€” a non-uniform day. And she was dressed to impress, with one person in particular in mind.

Though the chill of autumn was creeping into the air, she was clinging to her cute summer look by her fingertips, ignoring the goosebumps and the shivers brought on by the breeze. After all, it was worth it for *the outfit*. She'd spent all week planning it, researching the interior of the aquarium to make sure she stood out while not clashing with any of the colours.

The end result was a pair of denim shorts to match the blues of the fish tanks, paired with a floaty floral blouse in complementary shades of purple and pink. To accent the look she wore a number of silver bangles on one wrist, adorned with patterns of dolphins dancing among the waves. But the touch that Trixie was most proud of was the hair. She had her usually dull, flat, brown locks scraped up into a messy bun that she thought made her look laid back and artsy, with a bright red bandana folded to use as a hairband. The aim was to give the impression that she *just woke up like this* despite the fact she'd taken hours to get ready.

As she strolled through the aquarium, pretending to be captivated by the fish swimming around her, she spotted her real target gazing into one of the tanks. With a deep breath, she approached.

Meghan glanced over her shoulder, fiery hair sweeping across her back as she turned.  A bolt of lightning ran through Trixie as she met the gaze of those piercing green eyes, setting her heart fluttering.

"Hey, Trixie!" the other girl said with a dazzling smile. "Cool bandana!"

Worth it!
