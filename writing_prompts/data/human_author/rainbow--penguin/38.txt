Well that was very creepy! I loved how you used sound to suggest what was going on while leaving the details up to the imagination (which is always creepier). Great worldbuilding and wonderful descriptions too.

Just thought I'd mention, it looks like Reddit might have eaten your formatting as it shows up as a wall of text for me. Though that might just be because I'm on mobile right now.

Anyway, thanks for writing!
