#The Perfect Spot

Peter the pigeon fluffed up his neck feathers as he *cooed*, head bobbing backwards and forwards.

"You can stop all that now!" Polly sighed, batting him lightly with her wing to dissuade any further displays. "There's no need to keep trying to woo me when I've already said yes. Now we need to build our nest!"

"Oh, right," he muttered sheepishly. "Sorry!"

Polly softly pressed her head into his to reaffirm their bond. Then, the pair took off in search of a suitable nest site.

First, they gravitated toward the city. With so much food left there by the humans and so many sheltered alcoves, it seemed like the perfect place to raise their chicks.

After scouting out a few possible spots from above, they began their controlled descent, circling down to one of many grey buildings amidst the concrete.

It was perfect â€” surrounded by cafes and fast food restaurants, sheltered from strong winds on all sides, and with plenty of overhangs and ledges.

Or so it seemed until they got closer.

As they flew around and around, every single surface they came to was covered in strange metal spikes, jutting out at every angle. Try as they might to settle down, the spikes made it impossible.

And so they moved on to the next building. And the next building. But at each one, they were met with the same dilemma.

"What shall we do, love?" Peter called to Polly as they took flight once again. "It seems we aren't welcome here."

"We'll just have to try elsewhere, then," she replied resolutely.

Next, they flew to the city's edge, where allotments clustered. Perhaps there wasn't quite as much tasty food so readily available. But the seeds and grubs would be more nutritious for their chicks, so maybe it was for the best.

But as they approached, Polly's heart began to sink. *What was all this netting doing here?*

They glided over row after row of allotments, some with fine trees or hedges that would be perfect for a nest. But all of them were protected from the outside world by that stupid netting.

Perching on a branch that jutted through the mesh, Polly and Peter took stock of the situation. A crow who was perched nearby, pecking at the string, glanced over before returning to his attempts to break through.

"But why would the humans do this?" Peter asked. "Surely it stands in opposition to the original intent. I thought they came out here to be at one with nature, and yet they try and keep it out."

"I don't know," Polly sighed.

"It's to prevent crime," the crow cawed.

The pair of pigeons glanced over at him. 

Hopping closer, the crow continued, "They don't want us to steal their seeds or plants." He shook his head sadly. "Complete disregard for the natural order of things if you ask me."

Peter turned back to Polly. "So what now?"

"Now? We keep searching."

And so, the pair took flight once more.

This time, they headed further out, to where the dwellings had gardens. Perhaps the pruned, pristine trees and bushes wouldn't provide quite as much cover. But the continual human presence might scare off predators, so maybe it was for the best.

They took their time as they soared low over the gardens, carrying out much-needed surveillance for any troublesome cats or dogs.

Eventually, they found a place that looked suitable.

The garden was small, attached to a house squished in by others on either side. But what it lacked in space it made up for in cover. Everything was overgrown, from grass to hedges to branches. And even better was the bird table, sticking precariously out of the ground with all manner of weeds climbing up it, covered in tasty seeds.

*Yes,* Polly thought to herself. *This would do very nicely.*

The pair glided down to a branch of the tall, unruly fir tree. Once they'd landed, they hopped along until there were submerged among its foliage, hidden from the world.

Polly settled down, stretching her tired wings, while Peter took to the skies again in search of twigs.

Finally, they had their nest. Soon, the eggs would come. Then, the chicks. And they would make it all worth it.

\***

From her window, Iris watched a pair of pigeons meticulously selecting twigs one at a time. She carefully tracked their journey back to the tree at the far end of her garden. Smiling to herself, she resolved to put out extra seeds this spring.

It saddened her that she couldn't take better care of her garden, but if it provided a haven for the local wildlife, maybe it was for the best.
