#Sasquatches Among the Stars

"Order! Order!" Sarah shouted, beating her chest to draw attention to herself.

The other sasquatches quieted a little, hundreds of pairs of large, dark eyes turning to her.

"I know this is scary," she said calmly. "We all remember why we came to be here. The humans encroached on every secret place we had on earth. Not even the deepest forests were safe anymore."

A shudder passed through the crowd as they remembered the dark times, the brown fur of every sasquatch standing on end.

"But remember," she pressed on, keen to prevent them from sinking further into fear, "we didn't let that beat us then. We mobilised our greatest minds to construct starships from the materials the Earth provided us — ore from the ground, fuel from the air, wood from the forest. We came here, to the moon we spent our days as cubs gazing up at. And we prospered."

"But now they're coming here too!" a voice shouted from the crowd.

Sarah glanced over to the culprit — Sam — always a worrier.

"Yes," she said softly. "The humans are once again encroaching on our space. There have been shuttles orbiting. And it seems ever more likely they will land here soon."

Another ripple of panic spread through the group.

"And we will be ready, as we were before."

"But how?" Sam asked.

"We did the impossible before, journeying into the heavens. Now we must do so again."

"Where will we go?" another voice called out — Sally.

Sarah sighed, when she'd been elected leader of the tribe, she hadn't expected that meant thinking of *absolutely everything* for them. "To one of the other heavenly bodies, perhaps," she suggested through gritted teeth. "Mars is far enough away. It will take them much longer to reach us there."

"How do you know we can survive there?" Sally asked.

Sarah clenched her fists in both her hands and feet. It was an annoyingly good question. Why the woman couldn't use that intelligence to think of answers instead was beyond her. "Did we know we could survive here when we left?" She paused. When no one in the crown answered, she continued. "No, we didn't. But we came anyway and here we are. We are a hardy people. We will adapt. And anything our bodies cannot adapt to — that's what technology is for."

There were a few murmurs between neighbours, but thankfully no more questions.

Except...

"So what now?" Susan, her second in command, asked.

"Now? Now we get to work."

It didn't take long for the scientists to come up with a design. What her people lacked in common sense, they made up for in intelligence and ingenuity of every other kind. Before the humans had even launched their next rocket, the sasquatches were taking off once more to settle another planet.

But they had learnt from their mistake before. Having only one home made them vulnerable. If anything in their life was certain, it was that the humans would come eventually. And so, when they reached Mars they didn't stop there. As they improved the design of their ships they travelled further and further, leaving a settlement everywhere they stopped.

When humans finally turned their attention to other solar systems, the sasquatches had colonised the entire galaxy.
