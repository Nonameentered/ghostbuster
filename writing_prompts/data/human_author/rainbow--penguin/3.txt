I love how well you write characters for me to hate, kat!

Only nitpick I can find for you is this line here:

> Canâ€™t imagine why.

It just felt a little random when they're "betting" she cries when they're not around to then say that they can't imagine why, if that makes sense (sorry, not explaining this well). I think what I'm looking for is just a tad more justification here about how good the MC thinks their assistant has it.

Overall though, great story. Characterisation and dialogue on point, as always.
