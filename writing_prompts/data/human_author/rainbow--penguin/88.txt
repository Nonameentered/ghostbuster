You notice a scent you don't have a name for other than 'food'. It's unlike anything you've ever smelt before. So vivid you can almost see it, like a trail of gold through the air reaching through your nostrils deep into your stomach. 

The tendrils of scent consume you, drawing you onward.

Streets pass in a blur, the concrete warm against your padded paws. Soon, the grey of the city gives way to the green of the forest. The air is clearer here. Less busy with all the sounds and scents and sights that humans clutter their lives with. 

There are still distractions. But they're purer. With purpose. 

Your head whips around at the chatter of a squirrel, accompanied by a soft, nutty scent. Then, a rustle in the leaves as a millipede skitters by, releasing a musty, earthy smell.

Something about this feels right. Like you're home. It fills your chest with an urge so strong you're powerless to stop it. Your nose turns skywards as you release the air in your lungs with one long *hooooooowwwwl*, breath misting in the moonlight. 

Your ears prick at a distant sound. Was that a reply? Or just an echo?

Before you can make up your mind, that scent grabs your attention once more â€” that golden thread pulling at your stomach. It's close now. So close you can almost taste it.

You walk forward tentatively. Twigs creak under your paws but don't snap. You're too lightfooted for that.

It isn't long before you find the source. A deer, not long dead. The sight makes your mouth water and your stomach rumble. 

But before you can sink your teeth into your prize, you sense a blur of movement heading straight for you.
