#Love in the Time of Monsters

I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking. I like to think that one day I'll come to life again — use everything I've witnessed and the information amassed in my head to actually do something — and my brief sojourn into the emptiness of grief will be over. 

After all, I wasn't always like this. Not when I was with Mark.

I met him in a shelter, cowering behind strong walls and bright lights while the sirens wailed. While everyone else sat in shaken silence — thoughts of the ghouls prowling outside sending goosebumps prickling across our skin — he smiled and chatted away. He had that kind of easy charm that can make you forget yourself and your surroundings, and for the first time in years, I almost forgot to be afraid.

Somehow, despite everything that had happened, he'd managed to maintain a wanderlust. He was homesick for anywhere but here and was happy to regale me with tales of the places he planned to visit. Meanwhile, I struggled to find the will to leave my house in the morning, every second of my day strictly regimented to minimise risk. Even with all the precautions that had been put in place since the ghouls rose, I couldn't forget those first days — the air thick with that coppery stench, the screams and gurgles of those unlucky enough to be caught, and the splashes of scarlet as the creatures tore into their victims.

But Mark... he exuded positivity to the point it was infectious. I'll never forget what he said to me that first night. "Everything that has happened to me has been amazing and surprising." He'd chuckled then, a deep melodious sound I could have listened to all day. "Of course, amazing and surprising don't always mean *good* or *safe*, but they certainly keep life interesting."

I was immediately enchanted, and I think he knew it. When the wail of the siren finally died down and the red flashing lights came to a stop, we left the shelter together into the golden rays of predawn. Walking with him, I hardly noticed the destruction around us. And when he draped his arm around my shoulder, I didn't notice it at all.

From that moment on, I hardly left his side. After all, why waste a second when life was so unpredictable? 

We used every ounce of daylight for some new adventure — hiking, sailing, climbing, swimming. I'd forgotten how beautiful this world could be, distracted instead by the ugliness in it. 

Of course, when the safety of daylight ran out, we stayed closer to home, spending our evenings in cafes or restaurants. But we never retreated into the shelters until the red lights flashed and the sirens blared. Why waste a second, right? 

We'd gotten greedy with our time, squeezing every last drop out of life. And because of that, we lost so much more of it.

The day it happened started so perfectly. Mark bought me a pocket sundial to mark our first year together. It was beautiful, with its intricate interlocking bronze rings, and fitting, given how much the course of the sun in the sky dictated our lives. It made my gift of a travel journal feel empty, like the pages themselves, but of course, he claimed to love it.

We spent the daylight hours in our usual fashion, roaming and exploring a beautiful spot Mark had found. And oh lord was it beautiful. A forest of redwoods reaching for the heavens, their branches filled with birdsong. The only other sounds were the rustle of leaves and the trickle of a river. We followed its flow along to a waterfall that shimmered in the winter sun like a sheet of pure silver.

By the end of the day, my limbs ached and my lungs burnt, but it was a glorious feeling. The feeling of living. 

The last traces of pink and purple had already faded from the sky when we returned to the city, so enraptured by the beauty had we been that time had gotten away from us. But we were almost home, parked up on the street and walking to the door.

And that was when it happened. A shadow shifted. A shape burst forth from the dark. Its skin was mottled grey and green, with jagged claws and teeth protruding from its twisted form. Bloodshot eyes locked onto us, and it charged.

It tore through Mark before I could even move, frozen by fear — the tang of copper, the screams and gurgles, the splashes of scarlet.

As the ghoul scurried away with its prize, the sirens started wailing.

It was then that I shut down. No longer living, simply recording. I turned away from the flashing red lights and hurried to my house.
