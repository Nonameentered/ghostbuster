I'm going for it this year, for the first time. Though it's highly probable that work and life will get in the way of me completing it, it's the push I need to dive into this project. Plus, I'm easily swept up in a hype train.

The tldr of my story is: 

>in a world where magic is rare and concentrated in the higher classes, what happens when someone is born with no magic of their own, but the ability to control others' magic?

Good luck to everyone else taking part! I hope y'all meet and surpass your goals, and have a great time doing it!
