#The Curious Case of the Volcanic Eruption

"So, I suppose you're wondering why I gathered you here today..." Shirelock Hooves trotted through the group of assembled gods, all glaring at either him or each other.

"I was more wondering *how dare* you summon us here," Zeus said, voice rumbling like thunder.

"It was not he," Artemis said coolly. "I commissioned Shirelock to discover who was responsible for the destruction of my temple, and the sacrifice of my followers — without my permission."

The centaur nodded at his mistress, before continuing, "Indeed, a most shocking affair that happened here on this very mountain. Or should I say..." He glanced around at the gods. "Volcano!"

"But this isn't a volcano!" Poseidon spluttered. "There's only one of them near here. That... what was it called..."

"Mount Vesuvius," Athena supplied.

"Ah!" Shirelock raised a finger, stomping a hoof for good measure. "There *was* only one. But *someone* used their godly powers to create another. *And* to cause an eruption. Said eruption tore through my lady Artemis's temple full of followers."

"Sounds like Ares to me," Poseidon grumped. "He's always trying to start something."

"I'll start something right now if you don't watch out," the god of war growled, leaping toward his foe.

Zeus stepped between them. "Enough!" The word rang out like a clap of thunder, lightning flashing in the sky. "There are strict rules we gods live by. Whilst we all enjoy the occasional family squabble, sacrificing disciples without permission is absolutely forbidden." He turned to face the centaur detective. "Mr Hooves, do you know who is responsible?"

Preening under the attention, Shirelock resumed his trot through the group. "Well, as you say, Ares was the natural suspect — always spoiling for a fight... But," he came to an abrupt halt on the word, "he never does things sneakily or slyly like this. If it *had* been him he'd have claimed the deaths in his name instantly."

The other gods grumbled their ascent, Ares looking around smugly.

"Then, of course," Shirelock continued, "Poseidon certainly has a history of rivalries with other gods. There was that whole business with Athena."

The group turned to glare at the god of the sea.

Until Shirelock said, "But what power does he have over land and fire to have caused this."

Though he looked ready to protest the slight against his strength, Poseidon held his tongue.

"Now, despite your standing almighty Zeus, it would be remiss of me to leave you completely free of suspicion." Shirelock flinched as a lightning bolt struck the ground next to him, but pressed on regardless. "After all, you've been known to become jealous and possessive over mortals."

The god strode towards him, fists clenched. "I'll have you know that—"

"But," the centaur added hurriedly, trotting backwards away from the approaching angry god, "he was spoken for at the time, as a thunderstorm struck a village on the other side of the realm."

Zeus deflated slightly, fury fading. He settled for folding his arms with a look of righteous indignation. "Glad you came to the correct conclusion."

"And of course, that just leaves Athena." 

All eyes turned to the goddess of wisdom.

"Usually seen as so calm and sensible, what possible motive could she have," Shirelock mused. 

"None, I assure you," Athena said. "Despite our differences, I will always stand by my sister's side and I by hers."

"And so I thought, too," the centaur continued. "Which led me to realise this was a group effort!"

"A what?" Zeus rumbled.

"You see, the twins Athena and Artemis have long sought to rule their gods with their combined strength and intelligence," Shirelock said. "But how to go about it when all are so loyal to Zeus." He paused for effect. "The answer is simple: they sought to frame you."

"Frame me?" the god of the sky. "How?"

"They created the volcano together, sacrificing Artemis's followers and absorbing all the power that came with that. Then, see here," the centaur pointed, "they scorched the earth with lightning stolen from you. And Artemis commissioned me int eh hopes I'd find the planted evidence."

"You traitor!" Artemis snarled. "Don't you know you work for me!"

"I work for the truth, my good lady," Shirelock said proudly. "Now, if you don't mind, I'll leave you all to your family drama."
