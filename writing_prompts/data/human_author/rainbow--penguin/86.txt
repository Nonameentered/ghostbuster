The scent is stronger now. Closer. Your legs move ever faster, drawn onward by instinct alone. 

A bark to your left draws your attention. The white-muzzled elder, directing his pack.

You fall into formation, flanking the predator that, tonight, will become your prey.

The pack fans out to surround a tent. Your nose can make out three distinct scent profiles — three humans — blissfully unaware of the danger that they're in. 

A rustle in the trees makes your ears prick, gaze snapping to the source of the sound. A strange human-like figure with elongated limbs, bones protruding from it's emaciated form and antlers sprouting from its skull. Its hands are twisted into gnarled claws, covered in a substance that looks almost black in the moonlight, but you'd recognise that coppery smell anywhere — blood.

As it lumbers through the trees towards the humans, you pick up that that sharp, foul scent again, radiating off of the creature. The second it hits your nose, instinct takes over.

The pack moves as one, descending on the monster. Your teeth tear through flesh and hot, sweet liquid erupts into your mouth. Soon, warmth radiates out from your full belly. The sensation makes your brain foggy as waves of drowsiness overcome you.

A howl from the Elder cuts through the exhaustion — an announcement that the hunt is done. Now is the time for rest. You stumble away in search of sleep.

The blare of the alarm wakes you the next morning, head pounding and limbs leaden. As you stretch and climb out of bed, you can't help but feel somewhat clumsy on two legs, though why that should be escapes you. 

A quick glance in the fridge on the way out the door reveals nothing that tempts you. Besides, you're oddly full already...
