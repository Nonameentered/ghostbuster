Hey Dbootloot! Great story as usual. your descriptions are wonderful to read and you set the tone and atmosphere so well throughout. I also loved all the casual world-building. Lots of details included very naturally giving us exactly the right amount of information.

One small thing I noticed (which is very subjective and also might be me misinterpreting things) is that the dialogue from Allen:

> "When are you gonna loosen up? We're living the bougie life now, man." Allen punched me lightly in the shoulder. "Whatever. You'll cave eventually. I'm telling you, that stuff is so...freeing! I.. Well, you'll have to try to get what I mean."

felt a little out of place with the tone of the narration. I understand building the contrast between the MC and Allen, but as friends(ish) I'd kind of expect them to have similar language and formality, so the casual parlance just stuck out a little compared to the beautiful prose. But like I say, that is super minor and subjective anyway.

Thanks for writing! I thoroughly enjoyed it!
