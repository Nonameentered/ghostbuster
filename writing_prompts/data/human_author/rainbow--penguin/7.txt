#The Important Things in Life

I am always satisfied with the best. That's what I tell myself anyway, over and over, as I sit amongst my bougie brethren, gorging ourselves on the finest foods and the finest wines. After all, only the best will satisfy. Or it should. But no matter how many times I tell myself that, it doesn't fill the emptiness — doesn't ignite the missing spark.  My satisfaction is illusory.

There was a time once I came close to something more, an evening spent on yet another rooftop terrace, underscored by a string quartet and the inconsequential chatter of people trying to appear consequential — brutish, boorish men trying to impress women far too young for them. The sun was grazing the horizon, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and fiery red, bathing us in its warm light while the rest of the city wallowed in our long shadow.

I sipped at my champagne flute, milling about in a desultory fashion as I wandered from one conversation to the next, making my rounds of the other guests to ensure I was seen here, being happy and convivial and prosperous. But my meandering was interrupted when my eyes fell on his face. It was a face different from any other here, weathered by work and lit by a genuine smile that reached tired eyes.

"Michael!" he beamed. "You *are* here!"

Flustered, I turned away, trying to pretend I hadn't seen him. But it was too late.

His hand clapped on my shoulder as he drew me into an embrace. "It's been years, brother," he whispered. "I was worried I'd never see you again."

"How did you know I was here?" I asked, extricating myself from his arms. My eyes darted around, wondering if anyone had noticed me with my unfortunate connection.

"I saw it in the papers," he replied, still grinning like an idiot. "We're all so proud of you, you know."

I gave him a tight smile in return. "Well, it was good to see you."

He caught my arm as I turned to leave once more. "Wait! Don't you want to... I don't know... catch up?" he asked, eyes pleading. "I might have followed your life in the media, but I've got so much to tell you. A husband. Two beautiful children I'd love you to meet. A lifetime of memories to share."

"Sorry," I muttered, pulling out of his grip. "I'm jetting off early tomorrow. Maybe when I get back..." There were eyes on us now, and I felt sweat pricking at my skin. If they saw... If they realised...

The smile on his face finally dropped. "Don't worry about it. You always were ashamed of where you came from. I guess that means you're ashamed of me now, too."

Despite its lack of use, my heart twisted. "No!" I whispered. "It's just..."

He turned away. "Don't bother." As he started to go, he paused, glancing back over his shoulder. "Enjoy your new life, Michael. I hope it makes you as happy as mine makes me."

Then, he was gone, disappearing into the crowd as the sun disappeared below the horizon, taking the last traces of soft, warm light with it.

For a long while after that, I stood alone, watching the crowd flit around me as indecision warred inside me, yearning to chase after him but scared to leave this all behind. Men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.

Eventually, I came to my decision. I plastered on my best fake smile, grabbed another flute of champagne, and walked over to join a nearby group, guffawing at whatever joke had just been told.

My satisfaction may be illusory, but sometimes, the illusion is all that really matters.
