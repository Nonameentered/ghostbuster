I'd like to be clear that it was never my idea to start the camp. It was something that my father's father's father's father started; it's a family business, essentially. We've had our ups and downs as a company, but I do my best to make sure that everyone turns out alright. It's a tight ship, and I kinda hate how strict the rules are sometimes, but I get it, and I work with it. The reason we're the ones running the show, and not somebody else, is because we're immune. Our power is, essentially, the fact that we don't get effected by anybody else.

A couple of weeks ago, though, a question floated from the bottom of my mind. Where did the bad ones go? Oh there's always bad ones in a bunch, always will be. Children that like to use their powers on others, just for their own fun, and maybe sometimes a bit of curiosity. Like I said, I don't make the rules, those are court mandated. 

The question started off as an inkling in the back of my mind, like how sometimes you can till the field and notice that a small patch is lookin' a bit rough. But over the next couple of days, when one of my favorites, a kid named Adam, got shipped off, I couldn't help but raise the question as a priority. 

Now of course, this is the kinda question that the big powerful folk don't really give you an answer to. They don't like it when you start askin' questions about their business. So of course, I had to do a bit of diggin' on my own; something I'm not quite opposed to. 

Ever since I've known the business, we keep a record of everyone that gets shipped off; just for routine checks, make sure that all of the people in the camp that need to be are still there...Some kids do like to run. So I started getting into the nit and gritty of it, trying to see if we had any typical records of where they were shipped to. Funnily enough, all we ever got were vehicle numbers. 

So, after about a fortnight of lookin' into the whole business, I came to the conclusion that I'd just follow one of them buses myself. So of course, I got myself a reasonable alibi to play off followin' the bus a little ways. And when everything came down to just gettin' behind their bus, I found myself stumblin' upon something that no human being should ever have to struggle through.

They were makin' villains. That's right, all of that crime you see on T.V at night? It's all just manufactured violence. Now, I'm not exactly the best to tell people what needs to be told, but if you can get this out there for me, it'd be much appreciated. I just need to make sure that all of my kids turn out alright, and stop these people from ever stealin' children in the night again.
