Most people in life, rather unsurprisingly, don't amount to much. Yet with the right lies, history can be rewritten. I never quite knew, until after, exactly what I was rewriting.

The king now officially had an heir, and within his future I saw the history of a typical noble. He would use his power for his own benefit, yet would eventually turn to lead the people with a fair hand; insignificant in all regards, as his father had been.

Yet nobody likes to hear the truth, so I wrote up a clever lie. 

This lie, ten weeks later, resulted in an ancient wizard walking into our town. Already, the tides of time were shifting. The babe's name was even changed when the king read the fortune, and great wars began to unfurl in the future.

It was quite funny, to see an unremarkable Prince pull a sword from stone, working on nothing but conviction and full belief. He fought more than any other man of his age, working for a land fit for all. Then, as all Kings do, he fell into the night, journeying on to Avalon.

He was my most famous lie, the once and future king.
