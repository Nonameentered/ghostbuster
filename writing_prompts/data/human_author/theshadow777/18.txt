*Life is complicated. Constant high stress situations as a depressed individual can be even moreso. Plus, just about everybody likes spandex, and that seems to be the current fashion rage within the Villain Industry. Could anyone truly fault the Hero, for the feelings that he gained over time? In a situation where you have an almost work-like relationship with the people that you fight, wouldn't you end up falling for one of them?* 

*Whilst I, as a reporter, do not necessarily condone such feelings towards individuals of such stature as the Red Mistress, surely we as people can understand the feelings that Vortex has gained as their fights progressed. It certainly doesn't help that The Red Mistress has toned down her crimes, and almost appears as if she can be redeemed. Surely as a hero he saw this plausible change of heart, and simply could not help but dwell on what could be.*

"D-does that seem alright?" His finger shook upon the keyboard, as the blade pressed itself gently against his throat; the woman in red spandex leaned over him, reading from the screen.

"Yes, I do believe it does. Just so long as the press attention towards him isn't negative, I couldn't care less," 

Courage built in the back of his throat like acid, begging to be spat out, "But you don't mind negative press around yourself?" 

"Oh of course I mind it. Where Vortex is considered, it...Matters more," 

Once more, his idiotic tongue moved forwards, "Do you actually-"

"We've been fighting one another since we were fifteen, what do you think? Oh I could lie and say that I don't have any feelings for the man, but you don't go after one specific person for so long without *some* feelings relational to them. Now just write your damn article while we wait for Vortex,"
