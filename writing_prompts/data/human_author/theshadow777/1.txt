Part 2:

*He was running late*. He was never late, he could open *portals*, but here he was, late to his great showdown with the Red Mistress, who was holding a Newsboy hostage for some reason. It wasn't his fault! Well okay, it might've slightly been his fault, he'd stared in the mirror for like an hour, trying to get his hair to lay flat, even though he *knew* it was gonna fly everywhere when he left. Feeling his mask, he rushed into the building, opening a portal, and falling flat on his face in-front of the Red Mistress...Because of course that would happen to him.

"You're not getting away with this!" He shouted, as he pulled himself to his feet.

Across from him, she just smirked, casual and cool as she always was. Dammit, why was his heart racing? Taking a deep breath, he raised his fist, but his legs were shaking. This had *never* been easy, but it was getting even more difficult now. 

Coughing into his fist, he started with, "Just let him go, and I'll," 

"You'll what, Vortex?" 

The pounding of his heart and racing mind made everything stop; she had that smirk again...He couldn't control what came out of his mouth, "And I'll take you on a date," *Yeah real smooth dude*.

She stared at him for a moment, seemingly flabbergasted, "Fucking *Finally*," She sounded particularly frustrated, "I've been waiting for you to grow a spine for *years*," 

He stared at her for a moment, completely forgetting that there was an innocent civilian between the two of them. Seemingly she'd forgotten as well, as her arm went limp, and the knife casually nicked a bit of the dude's throat. He whimpered, and they both stared at him.

"Well that would've sucked, getting thrown into the prison right before our big date," She chuckled, "Where do you wanna meet? I know this great Italian place right off of Main Street," 

His heart...Was steadily calming down. Oh, the anxiety was certainly still there; practically every time she looked at him it went right back to heart attack levels; but this was good, he'd *finally* done it. 

 "U-umm...Send me the address yeah? I know you have my number because you uh..." *She probably already knows, dumbass, she's the one that sent you the location,* "Right, well...Um, see ya around?" 

She smirked, "Yeah, see ya. Now I got a bank to rob on first street if you don't mind," 

"Oh, okay...Hey wait!" But she was already gone, flying through an already shattered window, "I...Don't think I can handle going after her right now," 

"Wouldn't blame you," The journalist on the floor said, "Good luck on your date tonight," 

"Yeah, thanks. Do you umm...Need anything?" 

The man on the floor chuckled, "No, I think I'm just gonna lay here for a bit,"
