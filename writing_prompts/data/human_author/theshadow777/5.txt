It had been happening all night. His friend had decided it would be a good joke to stumble on stage, and act like the performer's for that night. The show had even found it amusing, when they asked for permission. Every single joke that he did *happened*. None of it was supposed to work, he was supposed to be the *comedy* before the show actually took place. He'd pulled a rabbit from his hat, *he hadn't even brought a rabbit*. Something was really, really wrong, and now a person had just disappeared, a person he'd been looking directly at, someone he was pretty sure was the actual performer for the night, had just *disappeared*. 

"We need to go," He whispered to his friend, desperation lacing his voice, "I just made a fucking person disappear, and I was looking right at them," 

They met eyes, and nodded. He stared blankly towards the red cloth for a moment more, before nodding and bowing to the audience.

"Well, I believe that's been enough from us tonight. We'd like to welcome the *True* Magicians onto the show," 

As he stepped off, he found his disconcerting notion proving true. The Magician had yet to step onto the stage. Slowly, he pushed his way around the chairs and crowds of people, jumping onto the city street. Night was slowly descending, and he wanted to get out of there *fast*.

From behind an alley, two men stepped out. They wore the exact same suit, with no nonsense expressions on their face. Each of them walked steadily forwards, and that was when he knew they needed to run. 

But they couldn't outrun them. Somehow, the men matched their pace perfectly, lingering behind them at a consistent rate. When they finally stopped for breath, the two men walked calmly up to them. Neither was in a sweat, they didn't even appear winded.

"You'll be coming with us," The first man said.

"Provision number 6.0359 dictates that your rights are now forfeit, and you are governmental property. If you don't appear to hold psychic abilities, or other such phenomenon, this Provision will be rescinded. But as of this moment, you're coming with us,"
