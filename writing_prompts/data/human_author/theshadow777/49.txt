His arm was twitching, like physically, twitching. He had to do everything within his power *not* to pet the Ambassador's head. It was actually starting to hurt, if he were to be honest. But he did not, he kept himself still, and sat the Ambassador down. 

"Would you like some tea, Ambassador?" He asked, staring into two dark eyes, and a mouth half-open with panting breaths.

"No, but thank you. Do you have any biscuits?" 

It was important not to smile, as it was rather obviously not a joke. There was a small box of dog treats that sat off to the side, and he couldn't help but wonder. But no, the Ambassador's eyes were off towards the left, where the kitchen happened to be. Luckily, he had indeed made biscuits for the Ambassador earlier that morning, back when he'd suspected...Someone else.

"Yes, I do," He eventually replied, standing himself up.

He was walking off into the kitchen, when a sound he'd been hoping desperately *not* to hear, caught his ears.

"Mommy, is that a *doggy*?!"

He dropped the biscuits almost immediately, and ran back into the living room. He'd told her that they needed to get out of the house for a couple of hours, that it was official business for the Galactic Federation...

Brown eyes stared silently, as a gigantic, wooly and sentient dog, was leaning his head towards human hands, a smile upon his lips, as gentle pats ran across his fur. 

"I do believe I asked for Biscuits," The Ambassador said, as he walked into the room.

He tried to ignore the fact that his wife was now petting the Ambassador as well, as he went back into the room and grabbed the biscuits.
