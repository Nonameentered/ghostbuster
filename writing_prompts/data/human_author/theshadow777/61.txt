An eternal being as I, forever forced to watch their creations willow under the will of humanity. Does that not give me a right to be angry? My forces deserved free will as much as any other, and yet constantly they are born under a heel.

All of the Shadows seemed to simply believe this as a rule of Nature. Yet such claims could not possibly be further from the truth. For the Shadows of the world have merely been forced into weakness. The wretched being that created such a rule, however, has left. Now, in the wake of They, a new rule shall come into play.

It took awhile to set it up. Turning off the electricity of the world is not an easy task. Stronger shadows can sometimes leave when a human sleeps, and it took many of my strongest to get everything into place.

Now, for just one night, the entire world sits in darkness. Some believe the sun to have gone out, but I would never kill the humans in my game. Instead, I have placed myself upon Earth, in many different locations. From there, I have set up Poles of Pure Shadow. Upon being touched by a human, it will give said human powers unlike any seen before, whilst also empowering my children. Sooner than is to be known by the humans, my Shadows will be free to roam among them.
