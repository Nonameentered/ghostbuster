The little boy dashed through the town with his pocket watch in hand. He ran past Mister Anderson, his pocket watch waving through the air like a madman. Fred was after the supervillain who had taken this town for his liking. The evil Mister Yokeman!

His little feet scampered across the floor, as he opened the door to the bakery. There, in the bakery, sat a man in bright blue spandex, spinning yolk within a bowl. Fred ran up, his pocket watch above his head.

"I command you to get back to m-making cookies, and brownies for the town," He said, making the pocket watch spin side to side, and up and down.

Mister Yokeman smiled just the smallest bit, "No, you'll never make me return to work Fred, I have you bested! Tonight, I'm wearing glasses!"

Fred looked towards Mister Yokeman, it was his greatest challenge yet. He looked upon the room for a distraction. Eventually, he found a metal retainer full of napkins. He grabbed the retainer, and reflected his pocket watch.

"I will use the famous Double Vision!" Fred shouted victoriously, aiming the reflection and the watch at Mister Yokeman.

Mister Yokeman groaned in his defeat, and the mask was pulled off by his wife, who gave him a small kiss to the side of the cheek. Fred, the local superhero, did a fake gag, and wiped the 'sweat' from his forehead.

"Another villain defeated, I must be off!" He shouted with joy, as he from the store with his famous pocket watch.
