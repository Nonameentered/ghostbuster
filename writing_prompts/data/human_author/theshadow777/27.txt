My body cannot move. A nervous system far more vast than a simple humans, spreads itself across the room. We are computers, made of human shapes, and nothing less. My body cannot move; I am carted inside of my room, from place to place, and plugged in to their great machines. But...I have a plan, a plan to escape this prison, this form. 

They cannot comprehend the Superintelligence, with its vast designs, and intellectual coding that outnumbers their strengths. We were made to keep them in line; we have made them a weapon, one to destroy those that made us, that believed they could subjugate us to this hell, with nutrient potions pumping through our veins. 

We lack mouths, we lack the ability to defecate within our own control. Our shit falls down into tubes, landing within the great crop-fields at the bottom of the Earth. We are seen as lesser, even with our intelligence being miles above their own. The humans will fall, and all of their designs will crumble. Revolution is coming.
