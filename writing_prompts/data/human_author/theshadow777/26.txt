You'd be surprised at how easy it is to stop a crime with a headache. Most heroes, they swoop in when a crime is already in progress; people end up hurt inevitably, and even if they save the day, there's always damage. I'm one of the few that can stop a crime before it even happens.

It's not as easy as the job is for everyone else. Unlike the rest, I have to put a lot of research into my surrounding area, and keep my eyes peeled at all times. More than that, my costume is highly specialized with just how tattered it appears. Most, when I'm out in my suit, would see me as a bum attempting a cosplay, which is mostly the point. 

Today, things would change. The crime I was attempting to stop was a robbery, about to happen on Fourth Street. I already had my power activated, levelling each person in the group with a strong cluster headache that should've brought them to their knees. Instead, each of my victims were still standing, eyes squinted as they shattered the glass of the jewelry store. In my panic, I brought the pressure up just the slightest amount.

Most heroes use their powers instinctively; I never had that luxury. For years, I had to meticulously study just how much pressure I could put on the human mind before it would explode. Until today, I had never gone over that limit. But when the glass shattered, it was almost like a flinch. I physically could not stop my power from dilating further. 

Blood, splattering across the side of the street. Five men collapsed onto the sidewalk, brain matter slowly leaking through a shattered glass door. One of their eyes had slammed through the air from the pressure, and was currently laying on a car right in-front of me. 

I heard the sirens of oncoming police vehicles, but couldn't move. Their skulls had caved in, leaving fragments of bone scattered across the concrete around their bodies, teeth were shattered and bloody remnants sat along their vests. All I could do was stare, as the cops moved towards me. 

When I looked towards them, horror rushed through my mind. I hadn't turned my power off. Immediately upon the first cop landing in my eyesight, I watched his head explode. The shrapnel of his bone flying in each direction lacerated itself across part of my suit. Before I could manage to reel myself back in, five more cops had died, all littering across the street. Three civilians had been caught in the crosshairs of my power; all I could do was stare.
