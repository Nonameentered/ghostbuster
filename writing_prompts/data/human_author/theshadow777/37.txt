Burnt skin, and a charred corpse. Not a single shred of hair was left over. Thousands stared at the body, admiring the cracks along the skin, and the few remnants of non-boiled blood that seeped onto the floor. The dragon had taken one thing, her eyes, for as bright as they had been, and full of determined arrogance. 

It was horrifying, to watch, as men, women, and children alike, all walked up to the corpse, and seemed to stare at it in blind hypnosis, as if they knew not how to look away. All the while, the dragon laughed, flying high up into the sky. 

I had been making the trek, to see the woman who supposedly held more beauty than any other. If I'm honest, my plan had been to murder her, simply because I knew such a thing to be a curse. Beauty is not something that comes without a price, especially not in a land like ours. If someone were to ever have a beauty similar to the legends told of her, it would inevitably lead to evils such as this. Where your corpse would be looked upon by eyes desperate to take cuts of your meat, just so they can hang it up on a wall. 

Silently, I slid my knife back into its holster, and watched as the townsfolk grabbed at a burnt corpse, throwing pieces of bloodied meat into their mouth, desperate to attain even the slightest similarities to a woman now dead on the floor.
