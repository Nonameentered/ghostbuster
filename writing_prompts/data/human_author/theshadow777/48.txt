It was only a year afterwards, that I realized why I had never gotten a System, as everyone had taken to calling them. For that long year, I'd lived in jealousy of everyone else. People that gained impossible powers, that grew into monsters far beyond what had once been possible. Humanity even took to the stars, became Gods, yet I was still stuck upon Earth, looking towards all of them. 

That was, until one Midsummer afternoon, when the countdown to Doomsday finally reached zero. In-front of my eyes, was more stats than I had ever seen possible. And there were two paths that showed themselves to me. It hardly felt like a choice, if I were to be entirely honest. 

I stared out towards the heavens, where their hand had reached, and I smiled my largest smile yet. Yes, the choice was obvious, and I now knew why it was called Doomsday.
