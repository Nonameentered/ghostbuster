Abraham Lincoln was a lovely ol' chap when he didn't look like a downright ghoul. Each night, he'd set his shovel against the earth and lean against it. When the other gravekeepers left for the night, he'd dig up his grave, and start gettin' ahead on his own line of work.

Some of the common entities were already up and about, enjoying the darkness. He looked about, making sure everybody was getting ready for the common battle. It mainly came from the Tech Freaks. They were strange abominations that started appearing from the future, and Abraham was putting most of his line's work on the line just to bring 'em down. They had downright mangled faces, with weird barbed wire sticking out of their eyes and skulls, changing their appearance to make them look like horrifying apparatus.

One of the old vampires was cracking his knuckles and his neck. His eyes were alight with a fire that had been going for a couple of weeks strong. He looked over at some of his other motley crew for the night. The goblins that had often been his opposition were now all lined up with their forged weapons. He breathed a sigh, and lifted up his shovel.

When the first one appeared, he stared into her eyes. She was an abomination, just like the rest. Whereas the plastic surgery of the modern century was certainly getting out of hand, her body was amassed in weight from plastic skin. It wasn't just the perking of her chest that hinted him in, but the way her face seemed mangled. Where skin would slowly crack in one place, the plastic overlayered it, creating a strange wrinkling effect that seemed cemented in stone. The way it drooped down with the small pigeons of fat made it seem as if overgrown leeches had latched onto her cheeks, now hewing into a brimstone-red glow. 

The graverobbers they called 'em. But they were more than just that. Those weapons that they held in their hands? Those attatchments to their body? They were meant specifically to steal a soul, to rip it straight from their undead bodies.

"Alright everyone, listen up!" Lincoln called to his amassed army, "This is gonna be the biggest night of our lives. The coalition of the Monster Mash, Attack!" He screamed at the top of his lungs, as he hefted his shovel from the ground, and ran.
