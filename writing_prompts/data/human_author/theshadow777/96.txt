It hadn't been a lie. The voice boomed into every muscle of my being. It hadn't been a lie! I looked out through my capsule, towards the great white all around me. My body held together within tangible reality, only because of the containment cell that held me. My eyes looked out towards the endless oblivion, as the voice rattled even my own containment. Yet then, in a flash of blazing light, the universe swirled into color.

Blinking the light from my eyes, hoping desperately to not have gone blind, I looked up towards a man. His robes were startling white, seemingly swirling in abstract masses within his body. He looked towards me with a strange curiosity.

"Are you the God of this universe?" The man asked, far too casually, far too slippery.

"W-what?" I stumbled out, confused, was this man not the god that had spoken?

"I asked are you the God of this universe? I heard the voice, it shook my core. I am looking for him."

The sentence that slipped my mouth was one of utter loss, "I thought...I thought you were...The god that..."

The man looked around at my unfinished sentence, towards the blaze of white and black that centered its mass all around us.

"I don't suppose you know where he is?" The man asked.

"N-no..." I said.

The man then reentered his focus upon me, "Who are you then? If you are not the God of this existence?"

Slowly, I breathed in, it was surprisingly difficult to tell the truth, "I'm from the future."

His eyes widened, "The future you say? That implies that you know how this universe is supposed to begin?"

I nodded, "Y-yes, I read all about it, a thousand times, m-maybe even more..."

"Excellent!" The man said with a bright smile, "Than tell me how it begins. We will work upon this universe until whatever God is bound to return."
