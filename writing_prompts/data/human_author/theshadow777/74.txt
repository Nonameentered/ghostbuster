You see the problem with being able to turn into anything, is the fact that you can become God. I mean, imagine what the regular human would do with that kind of power. They could destroy the Universe, rewrite everything in their image....

Or....

Or they could end up getting trapped by a twelve year old. A kid that REALLY shouldn't have been wandering into a god's territory, locking a God up in a pokeball, and subsequently trapping him in a non-verbal Pokemon body.

History could've been remade, rewritten even, if a twelve year old hadn't trapped him in an overglorified tennis ball. The world could've been destroyed, if that twelve year old didn't have the brain of a goldfish and the stupid desires to match.

It was absolutely ridiculous. But at least after the kid died he'd be free, right? But no, no the fucking kid had to grow up, and give the pokeball to his OWN ELEVEN YEAR OLD KID, NOT EVEN TELLING HIM WHAT WAS INSIDE, SO THAT THE POKEBALL WOULD GET LOST IN THE, THE FUCKING FOREST, BEFORE THEN BEING BURIED BY A GODDAMN RATTATA.

Just imagine that.
