Stories. The fates. Destiny. They all have one thing in common. They all connect in that one little margin. If there's something that those things want done, they won't stop until they've done it.

When I was fifteen and my hair was still a sheen of bright blonde and brown, I thought to be an oyster. At the age of twenty, I learned it was not an oyster for me. At the age of twenty five, I learned it was the oyster of the rich. At the age of thirty, I saw it was the oyster of the powerful. Now, many years have passed, and at the age of fifty, I've seen it the oyster of the fates.

When I learned of what the rich do to the poor, I never wanted to be a hero. It was of my opinion that the rich deserved to die. When I was pushed and to the dirt, and beaten to the point that I could hardly breathe, I wanted nothing more to tear limb from limb the measely bastards in pristine cloaks that had done this from me.

Years I spent gathering strength for my revenge. I wanted to do it alone, and I wanted to hurt them to the fullest of my abilities. But you see, something happened, something that one might deem to be, out of the ordinary. On the day when my plan was to be set, an object of Power was stolen from my home.

Now, I didn't think much of it. I merely went off in search of my object. Along the way, I found a map hinting towards its location; which is of course, just the slightest bit conspicuous. It was not this, however, that set of the alarm inside my head.

What set off an alarm, was a young boy by the name of Jabraxas. Something about him had an air of magic that I simply could not identify. It is here that I regret to admit that I did not think. Instead, I did the least sensible thing. I kept the boy, in the hopes that I could steal his peculiar magic to wield against those that had so hurt me in the past.

It is here that I would like to offer a rejoinder. The object in mind was a sort of Destruction Stone. It has and had the potential to destroy quite a wild amount of space if used properly. One might find themselves simply banishing these certain areas into a sort of temporal darkness.

Long story made rather short, I found out what the boy's magic could do. In just ten weeks worth of work, the stone that I'd carefully crafted for months was utterly destroyed. What's more, instead of going back to his parents where he belonged, the boy claimed me as his mentor and 'national hero'. Which has now led me to a rather large convention full of the wealthy elite.

And it has taken Years. Five to be exact, to train the boy for what we are about to do next. His magic is slowly raging from where sits high above, on a large pane of glass. And there are others too. Chaperones and bartenders with narrowed eyes. In just a few minutes, the glass will shatter, and their blood will pour.

As it turns out, fate can get you somewhere with some time. And all you have to do sometimes is pick up that impressionable youth that oh so desperately wants to be a hero. Maybe you sprinkle something about a stone. Maybe you have your own business steal it from you. Finally, you tell him that he's the 'chosen one'. For extra measure, tell him just how badly you were treated by the rich.

Conditioning can be quite easy if you know how to play it.
