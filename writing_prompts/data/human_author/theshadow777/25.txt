Part Two:

I was sent out by my organization when I heard what had happened. A fight with a high powered Villain out on Fourth Street. The people were in a panic, and supposedly, nobody could even get close to the villain. 

Unlike usual, I approached from the streets, muffling my footsteps as I had been taught. He stood on the sidewalk, body motionless. I felt vomit pushing its way forwards as I looked towards the bodies. They piled along the streets, blood and viscera torn in every direction. Several heroes, with masks limp against their neck, or strewn across the ground.

For a long stretch of minutes, I was left motionless. What could I possibly do against something like this? An unimaginable horror, tearing its way into every hero, people I had known for so long, all piled in front of such a horrifying Monster.

Perhaps it was because I hadn't moved, and my Super Senses were reaching out, that I heard it.

His voice was barely above a whisper, but he said, "Help me,"

"Help you? Why would I ever help someone li-"

"I can't turn it off," He interrupted, voice still held at a whisper, "E-everytime I look at someone I...." His voice trailed off, and from where I stood, I could see a smile move onto his lips, "I'll be a hero, just like I've always tried to be,"

Before I could ask what he meant, he frantically reached into his pocket and snapped out his phone. I'd only just begun to understand what his plan was, when his head snapped open, blood shooting outwards into the sky, bone ricocheting violently all around the surrounding area, and small figments of his brain rocketing towards the dead heroes across the ground.
