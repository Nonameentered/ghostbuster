I was happy at first, after the initial confusion was cleared. Once I learned what the translation was, I was on my way to buy a cat. And buy a cat I did.

On the first day of owning said cat, I was too nervous to use the power that was called my own. A lot of questions filtered through my head, like what the ability might actually be, and what I'd be able to do with it, etc. etc. 

It was on the second day that I gained the courage, and walked over to the little cat that I had bought. He was resting peacefully, when I walked over, and placed a gentle hand against his head. The kitten leaned into it, purring gently in his sleep. Than, tentatively, I applied the smallest amount of a magical pull against his body.

To my horror, I heard his ribs snapping. Yet, even as they did, the kitten didn't wake up. He didn't mewl in alarm.

I attempted my best to somehow magically put the rib back into place, but when I applied more magic, his body only grew, gestating outwards. The rib snapped into place, but now he was the size of a pitbull, with porous eyes just barely contained into his skull. My feet backed away in horror, and too late I realized, I was still applying magic into the body.

He grew outwards, bones cracking and reforming, his body growing to resemble a tiger, with teeth large and drooling pooling out onto the ground. After he reached that height, his body stopped. My mind went outwards in desperation, one singular thought leaping from the mold. I begged not to see what would happen next, but it happened anyways.

His body began to pool outwards, skin melting away, eyes becoming little dew droplets against the ground. Steadily, he became nothing more than a pool of muddled blood and fur. 

That was the moment when the cat awoke. He mewled gently against the ground, nothing more than a bubbling. The blood and guts against the floor began to steadily puss closer to my outstretched hand.

"Yo, dude, what the hell?!" 

For one singular moment, my thoughts were unravelled from the sight in front of me, and up towards my roommate. He was looking towards the mess against the ground in disgust and horror, with a bag of chips in his hand. A food bender.

"I-i-i..." But I didn't know how to get the words out.

He seemed to have a solution, throwing his phone at me. 

I caught it in my surprise, and looked at the picture on the adoption papers. Steadily, I transformed the deformed cat back into its original form.

"Let's just agree that you are never to use that power of yours again, yeah?"
