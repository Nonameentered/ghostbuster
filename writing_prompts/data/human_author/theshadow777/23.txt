When the first angel arrives, it's a disaster. He falls from the Heavens with a sword made out of fire, and casually kills the governor of Louisiana. Everyone in his near vicinity just stares in awe and horror. The mayor's organs slop out of his body, miniature pustules screaming out, as his five-eyed head collapses onto the floor. Absolutely nobody says a word.

"I have arrived to cleanse the Earth upon the Mortal World, freeing Humanity from that which seeks to enslave it," The being of three heads proclaims. 

It is then, that one of the many citizens within the hall speaks up, the man who commandeered peace amongst the many different strange individuals that appeared upon the Earth fourteen years ago. He steps forwards, taking steady breaths, as he reaches through an old satchel on his chest.

"Would you identify as an angel?" He asks, staring down the man, "You fit the description, but so have some of the other patrons in this hall,"

The angel, a countenance of eight feet tall, burning eyes, stares down towards the measly human. For a moment, there is silence, before the angel, with a voice rumbling like Thunder, deigns it upon itself to reply.

"Yes, I am what you humans would call an Angel,"

The man nods, flipping through a stack of paper, "Great, meet me in office Eight down the hall please, and refrain from attacking anyone else on the way,"

A look of puzzlement falls upon the boar-head to the left, "I am attempting to free huma-"

"Humanity from Enslavement, and the Terror of the Demons. Yes, yes, I've heard it before; Merlin believed he was doing the same thing, funnily enough. Now come along, come along,"

The awkward entity follows the man into his office, before carefully sitting upon a chair that is surely held together by magics beyond comprehension. As the angel adjusts a slight bit, the man reaches around, and grabs at a large stack of paper.

"Now, within the community of Angels, what would you consider yourself to be? Do you believe yourself to be a *Warrior Of The Light,* or perhaps just a *Measly Scribe?"* 

"I-I don't understand, I am here t-"

"Please, it'll make the integration process easier if we both understand each other. You're here to 'purge the darkness', I understand that. But what designation would you give yourself amongst your people?" 

"A, a warrior of the light," The angel replies, scratching at the back of its head.

"I'm sorry? I couldn't quite hear you,"

"I said that I would be a," With a sigh, the angel restarts the sentence, "Technically, I'm a scribe, but I consider myself to be a *warrior*, no matter what Azazel says," 

"Of course, of course. Now, onto the meat of the issue. There will be no purging," 

"Bu-"

"No buts, sir. Humanity is doing quite well for itself. The demons work rather amazingly as Jailors, the Cursed Immortals have been given rather amazing advice on how to use their curses for the betterment of society, and we have Merlin and other such folk terraforming other planets as we speak. You will choose to help in one of the many efforts of society, or we'll have the demons banish you. Do you understand?" 

Scratching at one of his many arms, the angel sheepishly replies, "Yes sir. Perhaps I could help with spaceship advancement? I've always liked those," 

"Of course. My assistant will lead you to the right people to talk to, and you'll apologize to the demon that you banished on the way out,"
