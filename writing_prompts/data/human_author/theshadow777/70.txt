We were on two sides. There was a man with a staff trying to kill me. He was saying all of these complicated words, and there was a fire slowly growing in front of me. I didn't know what to think, I simply couldn't Believe that I had ever wanted to be a mage when it took so long to throw a firebolt.

When the man was three seconds away from finishing the spell, I lifted up my gun. Everyone on the battlefield was too focused on their own battles. Some of them were wizards helping the scientists, whilst others were common folk. I was the only scientist sent, partly because I was the only one who had chosen to go. Back at our own little place, we believed in free will.

I pulled the trigger. The mage dropped dead in an instant. I aimed towards my next target, a man who was throwing lightning in every direction. A fast caster for sure, but I could pull a trigger with a lot more ease, and no words necessary.

In the end, the revolt one. I got the honor of becoming king, and got the honor of breaking the crown and the throne when I ushered in a brand new form of government. Brand new to them anyways. And when I walked away? I got a Noble Prize.
