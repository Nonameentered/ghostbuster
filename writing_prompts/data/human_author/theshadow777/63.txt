"Okay... I can get through this, yeah, I can get through this, just gotta, umm," I mumbled blankly to myself as I paced around the body of the Now Dead King, "I know! I'll just banish his body and say the spell... No, they'll just kill me anyways. Maybe I could just teleport out? Again, no, the Assassins will find me no matter where I go,"

A knock came at the door, "Report?"

"Shit!" Looking towards the body, placing strings of my own magic against it, with a slight compelling charm to make air move through its lungs.

"The Ritual is going along nicely, why, I believe I'm beginning to feel younger than I have in years,"

Silence, and I was left staring back towards the body I had forcibly animated. It wasn't a good idea. In fact, as ideas go it seems rather terrible. All of my magic would go into this, and this alone, but perhaps I could use the time to plan even further.

"From now on, this Mage will have to stay by my side. It is his life force that I am taking from to extend my own. As such, he will act as my advisor upon all things magic related,"

I could feel a stir of unrest somewhere in the background. A small child with a fire in his eyes. Oh Gods, the Prince, I had forgotten about the Prince. This was fine, all I need to do is have the Prince killed, and then elect myself as King, with the 'dying words' of a freshly assassinated King. Then, finally, this entire debacle will be put to a rest.
