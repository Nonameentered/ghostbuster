I stare at the letter blankly, vision still half-red. Calmly, I put the letter down, directly into the fireplace. My hands are shaking as I look at one of the pictures on my wall. It was the two of us at the Grand Canyon. Calmly, I walk into the kitchen and grab a knife. I don't care that they were hired, and neither do I care about their stupid as shit '*freedom*'...They don't deserve it. 

Slowly, I bend down to the flames, and stare towards the crumpling letter. I'll find out who did this from their mouth, and then I'll hunt them down too. 

The drive is long, but my resolve doesn't falter. As I drive up to their house, I calmly knock on the door. A look of surprise comes over, before a schooled expression appears over their face. 

"I see you got my letter. I admit I didn't think you'd listen to me," They beckon for me to step in, and I smile lightly; at least my luck is off the charts tonight.

As we walk into their house, I punch the back of their head. He's downed instantly, and I stare towards the daunting staircase. As I'm dragging them up the steps, I do my best to be as ungentle as I can, allowing their head to slam into each step by dragging them from the legs, and shoving their body across the hallway that we meet, with plenty of 'accidental' steps on his crotch. 

When we make it into his room, I grab a spare chair, and walk to his closet where I find the rope he always keeps. He says it's the last thing his granddad ever gave him, after he won in a knot tying competition in fifth grade. By the end of the night, that'll be burning down with the rest of his house. 

After all of the hard-work is done, I rather calmly slap him across the face. His eyes jolt open, and we're left staring towards each other. With those eyes wide, the fear is evident, and the amount of satisfaction it gives me is perhaps a slight bit unhealthy. 

"Did you honestly think I'd forgive you?" I say after a quiet moment, "How could you possibly be so *delusional* to think that I'd ever give *HALF OF A SHIT*, about your precious little 'freedom', from whatever organization you're working for? They weren't the ones to ruin my life, *you* were," 

With a shaking hand, I grab the knife from behind my back. The work, to begin with, is easy. His first organ that he loses is his eyes, jabbed with succinct precision. The next that he loses doesn't involve the knife, and instead involves careful placement of my fingers.

"Careful, if you squirm too much, I think losing your toenails might hurt just a bit more," After that, it's his fingernails.

Slowly, using all of the supplies I know he has, I rip him apart piece by piece, chunk by chunk. When I'm done, all that's left is a bleeding out torso and head.

"Who hired you to do this to me?" I ask lightly.

"It's...It's an underground, organization. Y-your parents, they're part of it...They wanted you under their control, before revealing it to you," 

I don't bother to ask what 'it' is, the last things to go are his teeth and then his tongue. Before I stab his ears, I have one last thing to say to him.

"I do hope that your grandfather actually gave you that rope, I'd love to know you said at least one truthful thing," 

The gasoline I grab from my car; and since his house is fairly isolated, I don't have to worry too much about anyone knowing about this late-night endeavor. When the fire is set, I finally decide that I should go back home, and find out whatever they want to tell me. After that, well let's just say that the fate of their 'organization' isn't looking too bright.
