The first time it happened, I presumed him to be weak, and I was right. But then, from the shadows, from the depths, he once more crawled into my inner chamber, sword bloodied by enemies fallen. I could only stare, as we battled once more. Yet again, I had him slain with nary a thought.

This kept happening, within hours, he was stronger than ever before, proving a challenge I had assumed him impossible of. Worry started to cloud my judgement, but I kept up my attacks, the patterns I had honed all throughout my life. This last time, he used my own patterns against me, attacking and exploiting the weaknesses I *knew* were there; yet had not enough time to change.

Desperation began to build, as I knew he would certainly appear once more. Far few choices presented themselves to me in that dark corridor. He would attack, most likely stronger than before, and he would claim my throne, as I knew everyone wanted to do. So I dug into the arcane texts, I travelled from the area that I had sat for hours, and desperately rammed my head through all of the books in my private collection. There, I found word of what I was up against.

Throughout the lands, he was called the 'Hero'. Some eight hundred odd years ago, he surfaced upon the land, striking it like a monster. He would refuse to die, constantly rising from the dust. But something made him disappear, something unpredictable; an enemy he could not best, one that caused such palpable anger within he, that it appeared his form faded, disappearing from the lands entirely.

Desperately, my arms flipped through the text, reading throughout all of it as fast as I could, trying to find that which angered the supposed 'Hero'. Finally, I found it. The person that they had fought had...Transformed, in some untold way, body becoming stronger in such impossible aspects. Some phenomenon known as the 'Second Phase'.

The hero appeared once more, within my chamber. They were stronger than ever before, attacks slamming through my body without even a hint of mercy. The secrets of the 'Second Phase' were as of yet, still unknown to me. Yet I fought with all of my will, hoping beyond hope that I would outlast, that I could unlock the powers necessary.

It was just as I felt my life leaving me, as the last of my spirit began to hover above my skin, that I felt the secret unlocking. Holding my form in place, I pushed it from the ground, animating my body from the outside. Skin hardened and lengthened, my body mass pushing new limbs to the surface. With cold hard eyes, I pushed forwards, fighting the Hero once more. Only time would tell if they could persevere, but I held confidence within my fist, laying each attack without a hint of mercy.
