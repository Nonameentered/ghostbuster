It was actually rather amusing. When we first figured out how humans worked. Almost all of us ended up dead, besides the Mind Wraiths. So many of the humans were afraid of encountering them. Which is likely the best thing that ever happened, as soon enough, they were the ones who generated The Plan.

No longer do we as monsters attack humans. Well, some of the more primal ones still try. Instead, we rule their world through our stock shares. Why, even their funny little heroes are funded by us! Surely you don't believe that farmer's child could buy all that armor on his own, do you? Oh and that destiny he heard? Yeah, we made that up to.

But he's doing a pretty good job of defeating that man with all of those evil 'mind controlled' monsters under his liege isn't he? In a couple of days, the stocks that human had will be Ours. It's practically a monopoly, what with all Mind Wraiths being able to communicate psychically.

Soon enough, for all practical purposes, the world won't belong to humans anymore. And what's better than that, is the fact that nobody notices. It all started with a little spa resort down deep in a mountain.
