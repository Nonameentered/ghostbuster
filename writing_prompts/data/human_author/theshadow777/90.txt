It was like a trigger going off in my head. I stared towards the gate, and tried to step through. Yet the moment I touched the base of the gate, that loud sound reverberated through my skull. Like a thousand torrent souls screaming in pure agony. I was forced backwards, landing against the hard stone ground.

"I can't," The meek whisper left my mouth, "It won't let me,"

I couldn't understand why. I had never done anything troubling, I'd always done everything right. Maybe it had been out of fear, I could admit that much. I think everyone was afraid of walking through the gate. The moment of truth when your life might fall into shambles, when you'd die in just one moment, or rather, disappear to never be seen across the other side.

The others were whispering now. Some looked towards me in confusion, others had the look of murder within them.

"Something isn't right. Every person has been able to pass beyond the portal," A man said from behind me.

"Try once more! We will decide what to do with you if you so fail,"

I walked up to the gate, to the portal, placing one hand against it. For just one moment, my hand lingered in that fiery of light and air, and then, in one flash, I was physically forced backwards, landing against the ground upon my back.

All of the villagers looked towards me then, uncertain of what to say, or even what to do.

"We must hold a counsel," One of the oldest whispered.
