It's funny when something says that to you. The great thing in the sky, the architect of the Ancient Night, telling you that you had to stay on a planet until everything's dead beside yourself. It makes you functionally immortal and invincible, right? That, and it gives you a rather interesting challenge. 

At first, I thought about Nuclear War. I admit, it would've worked, but the pain would've been unbearable. So I journeyed back to that which first claimed me. An alcove, they called it, a world just beyond our own. It is what the Architect of the Ancient Night first created, *magic*. I just knew there had to be a spell, something to eliminate all life or other. Oh, it's greatly forbidden, but everybody reads about it at least once. It's that whole 'putting the new mage in line' sort of thing. The great big, Humbilizer. But for me, the thing is my tool, the one and only spell that will help me set everything right. 

If the Architect of the Ancient Night wants everything to die, then so be it! It could've just asked nicely though. It didn't take long to ingratiate myself to the bastards, they always had an eye for sore cases; and reincarnation certainly is a sore one (luckily they haven't tried to figure out just *who's* been reincarnated). The great Humbilizer came and went, and I was on my way to figuring out what it was. Oh but this random bastard showed up. Yeah, a new mage if you'd believe it. I mean, I expected new mages all around, but the dude was giving me the stink-eye for some reason. 

Anyways, I finally cracked the code. Got the All-Kill command in hand, right? Then this dude, *shows up again*, and ruins my plans. But luckily for me, I have the spell memorized, so I can just cast it, right? N*ope*, Wizard Jail, wonderful. 

But I was right, and the stupid as shit hero was wrong. The stars *are* aligning, and in my favor too. A couple of years and I'll be right back out of here. Nothing anybody can do will stop me from getting the just death that I deserve.
