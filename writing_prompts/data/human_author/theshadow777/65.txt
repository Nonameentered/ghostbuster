There are some things people cannot understand. They'll look into your eyes, and religiously attempt to look away. It takes perseverance to make a person see the truth, and the fullness of it.

I spent five years ignoring that in which I am now, and it took a solid thirty more, before I finally ended up where I am today. For you see, there is a book, and it is one that many ignore. Oh they spout meanings from it, turning their apples into cherries. But none have ever truly paid it any mind, or actually read it for what it is.

But I have, and I was forced to understand it, so that none else have to. For I doubt you know what the Lord truly wants. Not even I, with all of my reading could ever confess to such a capability. For he is a Mad God, rampant with power, and the only name in which we can take understanding, is the name that comes from below.

A flood is upon us, the Savior is not the one who burned for the atrocities of mankind, for he was merely a desperate fool. The Savior is the one who does not ask for your sacrifice. There is only one God that you can predict, and it is not the one that pretends to smile from above.
