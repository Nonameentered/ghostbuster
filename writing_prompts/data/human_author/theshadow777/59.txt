I am not exactly what you would call a kind entity. I have spent most of my life as any demon would. You could say that it is within my nature to ascend in power. But, as the years went along, I began to grow tired. All of my life had consisted of the same thing, and I no longer had a desire to what filled my days and nights with life.

So along came a day. It was quite a simple one for me, rifling through papers and repaying debts. But there was a new page, the newest for me in a long while. It felt as if it had been centuries since my last dealing with a human. But here before me sat an offering for power. The payment? A newborn, as was standard.

I sat there for a long while, merely staring towards the page in thought. There is little I know of humans, and even less of their care. Yet such things are easy to fix, surely. With such small thoughts, a plan began to form.

The days passed quickly after that. I began to prepare my abode for a child. It appeared that minimum magic content was of importance within earlier years, but if you wanted one to be able to live comfortably within later years, it is recommended to steadily increase the content with time. I also went to lengths to find younglings within my area, as children are primarily social creatures.

Perhaps the most difficult part of my preparations, was lowering the heat within my home. Once that was done, however, I prepared my usual attire, and walked into the human realm. My garb shifted slowly as I made my way from the forest. As it seems, human fashion has evolved, and so has their intricacy.

I did not bother to soak in the sights, merely intent upon retrieving the child, and sealing the deal. Perhaps if I were honest with my emotions, I would say that ripplings of anxiety moved along my mind. As it is, however, I remained as calm as I could.

That night, I arrived into my home with a child full of warmth, their head gently cradles upon one of my hands. And never once, after that point, have I regretted the decisions of those first weeks. For a human might age quickly, but with them, they bring such impossible joy.
