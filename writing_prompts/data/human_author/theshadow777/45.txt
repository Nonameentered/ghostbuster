The echo of my footsteps clanged to a halt as I stared towards the old, rusted sign. Thoughts wavered as my hand reached up, and brushes the slightest marring from the side. Dim lights flickered off to the left, and I slowly looked towards an old hotel hallway.

'Something's wrong,' The thought went through my mind, as I stepped into the hallway.

I remembered this hotel, from a lifetime ago. We'd taken a trip to Galveston, and the hotel lights had always flickered just the slightest bit; we never knew why, and never asked. I stepped deeper into the hall, and stared towards one of the room numbers. They were dilapidated, wood plasters cracked and half-decaying.

My hand ran along the wall, feeling old grooves as a deep nostalgia settled over my mind. Life had been... Simpler then, but everything had changed. Why had everything changed?

An old ice cream cone sat on the floor, just like the one I'd been running with. I'd been chastised, of course, but the pain of losing my ice cream had been something else. Reaching down, I grabbed at the old cone. Only it didn't feel like the brittle bundle that I expected it to. Instead, my hand grasped against something unreasonably cold.

Something in my mind snapped, like a rubber band leaping from my finger. I had never been to Galveston, we'd gone to Florida. The night that we got settled was the night of a horrifying Earthquake that shook almost the entire U.S. Certain areas sunk completely under the Earth, and others were cordoned off by a National Agency that none had known existed until that day.

They called it Paramnesia, even before it was fully understood. It's a lure, pushing unsuspecting victims deeper into a trap. When I'd gotten older, I was drafted into the Testing Department of this agency, meant to find possible solutions to the Threat Under The Earth.

Calmly, I stared towards the quickly blurring ice cream cone....

....

I'd had one just like that, running across the Hotel floor.
