Alright, look, Johnathan's not a bad dude. If you get him on a good day, he can be quite fun. But he isn't without his... Issues.

I didn't want to say it outright, but he's really into LCD. And about every other week he breaks into my house. Sometimes it's funny, but then came yesterday. He blasted through my window with a gun, holding the damn thing like a slingshot, tumbled through, smashed the TV I bought two weeks ago.

So yeah, he got arrested; I didn't press charges, but I wasn't going to stop my wife. But just... He's not a bad person, and I don't think he meant to kill that lady, or blow up a supermarket.
