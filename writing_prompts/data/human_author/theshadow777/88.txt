I went to the library often, it was the only real place that I felt *safe,* y'know? And there was the head librarian, Mister Andrews. He was a kindly fellow, if a bit quiet. He often wore the same outfit everyday. I had a running joke with one of the other librarians that he either had a wardrobe full of that one sweater, with the blue jeans, or he washed and dried the same pair of clothing every night.

There was something about Mister Andrews that just made the place feel safe, I guess. Even when he was reading, he always seemed to be studying the place around him, looking around, making sure nothing too exciting was happening. There were these few times, when I would rush in, and he would glance at me. He placed a small, thin-lipped smile on his face as I walked in, always something mildly fake, but welcoming nonetheless.

"Another day running from bullies?" He would ask sometimes, when I rushed in.

I would nod, or give some noncommittal reply, on the days when I was feeling a bit more jovial. 

Today, however, was a day unlike any other. I wasn't running, when I walked into the library. It was a saturday, and I had no one chasing after me.

When I walked into the library, Mister Andrews wasn't siting at his desk. He was beside one of his librarians, observing, something. In my curiosity, I walked closer, finding myself standing in front of a dead man. For some reason, I wasn't as horrified as I ought to be, as I observed the frail body of the man, mostly bones, with a body drained of existence. It did, however, raise a question, one I wasn't surprised that I already knew the answer to.

"So you've arrived," Mister Andrews said, his voice slightly cold.

"Yes, I suppose I have," I replied, wondering on what he might do now.

"Well, there are two ways of which this might go, Sir Adam," He said to me, finally looking away from the body.

His eyes were a glistening red, and he had a little bit of the same crimson against his chin. We looked towards one another, as I stared, my legs primed and prepared to run if he might suggest my death.

"What are the two ways...?"

"I have studied you for quite awhile now, though I doubt you were to fully realize it, and I have an offer that I might appoint you," When I said nothing, he continued, "Would you like to work in my library?"
