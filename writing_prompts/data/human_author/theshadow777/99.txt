You see the thing about most wizards, is that they have a very strong tendency not to *think* in crisis situations. But there came a certain strength in common sense. If you were to ask, of course there is no sense in blindly running up to a wizard, and using the same weapon that they do. And do not attempt to apply anything electronic against them either. But harry had a plan, it was quite a simple, and laid out plan. The funniest bit is, it was he and Ron who came up with it.

It was over the summer before their seventh year. Ron had been wondering about the ways to bring about the end of this particular tyrant. They both had diagrams of complicated plans laid out, with careful sketching. Hermione was supposed to arrive later, but at the moment, it was just them, and something had just clicked.

"No, no, we've been going about it wrong." Harry said, suddenly getting up and pacing, his eyes were darting towards the board, "We've been going about all of it wrong."

"What do you mean, harry?"

"Think about it, Ron! Power that the dark lord knows not...It can't be Love, love as a power doesn't make any rationalistic sense when it comes to a war. But think about the things that no dark lord would ever think of, because they consider it purely *beneath* them."

Ron seemed to get the idea, and his eyes brightened, "Muggle Technology? Like the kind that dad always lo-"

"Yes!!" Harry shouted triumphantly.

Everything was falling into place then. There were so many things. Muggles had artillery, guns, bombs, tens and thousands of other pieces of tech that could *easily* be deployed against people who didn't have proper training against them. It was, for all intents and purposes, perfect for the approach needed.

Harry had assembled a team. They were meant purely as Duelist's, or at least that's what everyone else heard. After smuggling guns into Hogwarts (Which was concernedly easy), he had set up a Dueling team. He had certain people picked out for different positions. Neville, who had always looked shaky, was surprisingly well with a sniper. Luna seemed to prefer a semi-automatic pistol, Ron worked well with pretty much any gun given to him, after a bit of work, and Hermione had stated that she didn't want to wield a gun at all, it was respectable, and there would need to be people wielding wands on the battlefield as well. This was merely the tactical unit. None of the wizards were likely to be trained in gun warfare, which meant this was for our advantage.

The day then came. Neville was somewhere along the tower, watching carefully. None of them had warned the teachers of their plan. It would not bode well for anyone to overhear, or purposefully listen in. For if they saw a student talking to a teacher for too long, they were bound to report to whoever they worked for. This was not such a simple school anymore.

Harry had his gun concealed in the invisibility cloak. Some other students had theirs hidden in bags enchanted by Hermione. 

The first gunshot didn't come until the middle of the fight. A strong KRAK slammed through the air above them. The students who had been trained, grimaced, but did not otherwise flinch. They began to bring out their guns now. One by one, students with fully loaded automated weapons began aiming. The Death Eaters and their legions were purely outmatched. It was almost brutal, the pure shed of blood that came after.

Death Eaters and their monsters fell to the ground as if they were purely rag dolls, and nothing more.

Another large KRAK came from the sky, and I watched as, perhaps one of the most dangerous, Bellatrix Lestrange, fell to the ground. Neville's aim was far superior than everyone else's on the ground. His first bullet, had easily taken down the first death eater, and now to secure a kill like that...

Voldemort now, sat all alone. His eyes were wide, like a perturbed child. Both he and Harry stared at one another in nonnegotiable silence.

"Dumbledore would've had us both believe, that the power you know not, is love." Harry said, in a whisper that seemed to float through the now dead-air, "But his hints were always there. Something that could destroy the power of you, Voldemort." Harry spat the name out, as if it had never mattered in the first place.

Those were all the words that Harry had desire to say. Without any further hesitation, he aimed the gun, and shot straight into Voldemort's skull.

The entire battlefield was silent. None of the adults who had come, it seemed, really knew what to say. Harry dropped the gun, and looked around the battlefield. There were a few people who were still alive, people who it would be necessary to deal with later. 

Snape, had been left to live. Not out of any mercy. What he had done to Dumbledore was simply unforgivable to Harry, and so he would then suffer a fate worst than death.

There was Lucius, who had only been left alive on accounts of Draco. Although Harry had no sympathy to Draco, he understood the importance of family.

Harry stared towards the gun on the ground. He made a distinct promise to never use one again. Looking around at every person on that field, it left something *sickening* in the back of his mind. Like, using something like that simply wasn't *fair.* It was pure slaughter. Sure, the Death Eaters would've done the same to them, but it was easy to see how they detached themselves. When you killed someone with a spell like Avada Kedavra, you were killing them without any blood. You simply, stole the life from their minds, from their eyes, from the pumping hearts that lived inside them. But with a gun, you tore into their bodies, stopping their heart with forceful slammings. You ripped into their skin, into their shells, into everything that made them them, and when you looked at all of that, you had to feel *something.*

No, he would simply disavow weapons of that nature. They were horrifying.
