It was a really, really bizarre circumstance, to start off with. Due to the fact that my phone had service, but for some reason wasn't pulling up the internet, I had a friend pull up the number to some people who could help us with the locked car. 

As it turns out, I dialed the number wrong, and the person I actually ended up calling, just so happened to be an underground organization, not unlike the illuminati. Then, after the most bizarre misunderstanding, I apparently ordered them to take over half of the west coast in my name, and just so happened to get the credentials needed, that being 'key locked'. 

It was funny, because after that weird misunderstanding, my friend called the company that should unlock my car himself. Whilst he was in the middle of doing that, a chopper landed on our location, saying that I was to go to a secret meeting.

The secret meeting itself was, nervewracking, and yet I somehow went through the entire thing without them recognizing that I wasn't part of them. That, and some of the things I said started a rumor that I was their undercover shadow-boss, which ended with a rather shady resolution.

So yeah, at that point, I controlled half of the west coast. The thing is...Things didn't exactly stop there.

I was out with a friend a couple of days after, and we both decided that we wanted pizza, but for the second time in my life, the internet wasn't working. He gave me a sheet with a bunch of phone numbers on it, which were to the local pizza joints, something he had gotten in case of a situation like this (He's the smarter of the two of us). Well, I ended up dialing the wrong number *again,* and it just so happened to be *another* one of the secret numbers for this group. Another colossal misunderstanding later, that just so happened to have their secret code for taking over the entire world be 'pizza with stuffed crust and extra ranch', or maybe just some of those words, and I ended up being the secret ruler of the entire world.

So...An interesting week, right? Just wait until you hear about Sunday, and what happened then.
