It was the easy to be the 'evil' companion. To be the one who acted all 'twisted' and 'deranged'. The character of the story who always acted like they were something that they weren't. Admittedly, it had only ever been done, because I wanted the attention. I mean, what else are you supposed to do, when you're the tenth child in a family, and you're mana is only at 10, when your brothers and sisters all coast at 50 or 60, without even trying. I was the one who had to *work* to get my mana up to their standards. What the hell was I gonna do, just *stop* working, once I got average mana scores?

My eyes blinked, as I looked away the tears. The funny thing is, I had it all planned out, every single bit of it. We were going to have an actual character arc. He was going to redeem me by the end of his story, and I was going to see the end of my ways. Yet now...Now he was gone. Gone by the hands of the villain. A man who stood there, perplexed, laughing, actually fucking *laughing.* 

I tried desperately to blink the tears out of my eyes.

"Let me guess. You're going to beg and plead to join me? You're going to kiss my hand, and then I get to say some cliched line, like 'off with your head'... It'll be so much fun. So why don't we just get the shtick over with?"

Even when I was acting like an asshole. Even the time I burned half of a village, he had always stuck by me. I hadn't meant for anyone to get killed, but some had...But he had still stuck with me. Even after everything I had done...

"Ah, you're no fun...C'mon, beg a little bit, please? Don't just stand there and cry, *mourning.* Which is such bullshit, we both know you're a bastard with no moral complex anyways."

I stared towards the man. The man who had spoken those words. He had no right to be talking. He had no *right* to be talking. But...What could I do? Even with an above average mana of 100, I couldn't possibly expect to kill him. He was an overlord, his powers came from a *demon,* and people like him could only be killed by... By the hero. And I wasn't the hero. I was just some kid who never got attention. The runt of the litter.

*But you can be...*

The voice filtered through the air. Like a ringing song, coming from the blade. I stared, tears still streaming as I tried to process what I had just heard.

*Grab my handle. You can do what needs to be done...I have faith in you, you should have faith in you too.*

My arm was shaking, as I stooped down, and grabbed the blade. Something within my chest seemed to alleviate. All of the sorrow I had been holding, for at least the moment, had faded. Something of a dull roar replaced it.

"Ooh, picking up the blade like some kind of *hero.* You really are dedicated to your whole 'redemption arc' aren't you? In fact, I bet once you kill me, you're going to rule in my place, is that right?"

I smiled, it was really the only thing I could do. The boy who came from the runt of the litter wasn't a hero. No, but he had served under the best one there was. That dude might've been good with the comebacks, but I wasn't.

"I know on this night I failed you," I whispered, staring down, "But let me make it up to you, yeah? I'll take down this bastard, how about that?"

*You can.*

*Yeah...I* ***can.***
