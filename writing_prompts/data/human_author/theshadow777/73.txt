Shuddering and coughing organs on the floor. I smiled nervously. Carefully, I pushed the organs back into Golpher's mouth. I'd been quite lucky that my parents hadn't seen that one.

Golpher looked up at me with kind eyes, and I patted his fur gently, "It's alright, we'll fix this, you'll be better in no time," Golpher wagged his tail.

Necromancy could resurrect, I just, I needed the time. But my parents were catching on. They hadn't seen him die, but they had watched all of his fur fall off that one time, and the decayed flesh under was quite telling. I was more than lucky when the Vet chalked it off to be a rather rare disease.

It's just... I couldn't let him die. If he died than, than what was the point? There simply wasn't anything for me if Golpher wasn't by my side. I knew, I Know, that Necromancy can resurrect. If you latch the soul strong enough, you can bring someone back.

Only, Golpher's soul wasn't coming back. It kept slipping like half-melted ice. The means I was using was a list of anchors. Golpher's soul was only still around because I was latching it to multiple objects. But there was Still some sort of disturbance, something going wrong.

"C'mon Golpher, I'm gonna take one last shot at this," With that, I took the list of anchors, and placed them all around my beloved Golpher.

The rest of it is, as they say, history. 

I don't know how to describe it. As soon as I started the ritual, something wrong happened. One of the strings connecting Golpher to this universe vibrated in the Wrong direction. The magic keeping Golpher alive seemed to stretch thin. I watched it all happen, but like any mage, it was more feeling than anything else. Desperation took over my mind, and in the instant it did, I felt the first of the chords snapping.

My reaction was the wrong one. I forcefully grabbed the first tether with my own soul. It strengthened Golpher's own energy, but weakened my own. Panic unraveled through my mind, which only seemed to strengthen the process.

Before I could react, my soul leapt from my body. I felt myself tumbling across the room. Everything spun into darkness.

Everything hurt, for just the smallest of moments. I groaned, but the sound came out wrong. Carefully, I reached out a hand to place it against my side. Only... Only...

My hand was gone. My body was gone. Something else, something different. I stared towards what looked like a paw. Then, my eyes glanced over, and I saw... I saw myself standing up straight, brushing of my clothes, and talking.

"Right then! This body is rather prime, isn't it? Young too, lots of growing left over. Thanks, by the way," And with that, I watched my body walk out of the shed.
