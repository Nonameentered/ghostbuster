Upon every world within the Solar System, there is something known as a dead zone. No man, woman, or even God, can step foot into the Dead Zone and live to tell the tale. Well, none but us.

It is theorized by the Wizards that we are an evolutionary response to these Dead Zones. For they have not always existed. These strange lands where impossible beings reside were a curse from The Unequivocable and his mad designs.

When I learned what I was destined for, I said my goodbyes to my family and friends. For even The Immune rarely make it back from the Dead Lands. Then, I went to the Local Church of Azairah, the goddess of hope and new beginnings. As an Immune, I knew the prayers would hardly work, but I prayed in hopes that she might guide my path as best as she could.

It was after that I got onto The bus, which was swift in its journey to a realm I had no desire to explore. Once we had arrived at our destination, I stared out at the land just beyond the border. In the distance I could hear the cry of maddening things, and as I walked closer, I saw the sky itself begin to bleed.
