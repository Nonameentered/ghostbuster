I've been doing this almost my entire life. Typically the results are normal, just some old floorboards, and maybe a couple of gas leaks. Nothing would prepare me for that day though. 

It started just like any other would, I got a tired call from my secretary (you'd be surprised how easy it is to make a business out of something like this), about some old Victorian home on the countryside, reportedly being haunted by one evil entity or another. They always had a name, shared delusions of demons passed down from family/history. So of course, I started digging into the history of the house, figuring out whoever had died there, and what the cause might've been. It's always important to sell the 'danger' aspect to it, so you get paid a bit more, and they get out of the house for a few days. 

So when I got to the house, I started getting to work. Checking the gas lines was my first priority, so I didn't spend too long in a house that might kill me. Despite being older than me, the lines held up, so I went to checking the floorboards. There was a bit of creaking, but nothing that felt like it could 'reverberate throughout the entire house', as one of the witnesses said. 

Naturally, there were a few cases that weren't that easy, like windows shattering on their own, and an entire part of the house caving in, but I always managed to figure them out with time. Which is what led me outside, to checking the barn that sat not too far from the building. It hadn't been used in ages, the floor and ceiling looked as if they were rotting entirely, and the building itself looked as if it were one wrong breeze away from total collapse.

After a thorough, yet entirely useless investigation, I concluded that the sound couldn't be echoing from the barn. Not even the entire building shifting would cause the sound that had been described. I decided, inevitably, to just wait it out at the house.

My breathing was shallow, and my heart was racing. Slowly, my eyes pulled themselves opened. The cold wood sat against my back, and I stared towards a scene unfamiliar. I was in the basement, after having fallen asleep in the guest bedroom. Something...Something was staring back at me.

Large, gloating eyes, five in total, all shifting and distorting like a bad dream. This had to be the effects of some sort of drug, right? Had the owners drugged me before they left? But it wouldn't have taken so long to take effect.

Suddenly, a mouth, larger than the ocean, opened right before my eyes. Rows upon rows upon rows upon rows of sharp teeth slithered their way upwards, cascading in a horrid miasma of sharp serpent-like fangs. 

"I have been watching," Its voice whispered so loud, that it felt like hurricanes and Earthquakes were slamming themselves upon my skin.

"It's impressive to see, just how far a human mind will go, to suppress an obvious truth," 

"I-I-I," Taking deep breaths, "I don't know what you're talking about,"

"Oh of course you do. It's that little ink-droplet in the middle of your mind. You know, *exactly*, what I'm talking about," 

Flashes across the back of my mind. Impossible images, memories, relocating and pulsing their way into the front of my brain. But it was foreign matter, tearing to shreds everything that was already there. I felt thoughts implausible leak their way into my mind, as the things in the centerfold were ripped asunder. 

"I made you. But your business is done here, you're needed for *other* things,"
