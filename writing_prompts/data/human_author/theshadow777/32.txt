Do you know what is like to be hunted by three different factions, and five geese? Of course you don't. Do you know what it's like to have a date in an hour, and panic as you throw shit onto yourself? Probably.

First, and most importantly, I had to cover the steadily spreading rot on my left forearm. After that, I had to throw my contacts in, to hide the heterochromia, which consisted of one pure red eye, and another sauron-esque one. Finally, with all of that done, I got to do the normal human thing, like putting on make up, and finding a nice outfit.

Just as I was about to leave, I saw the squadron of geese moving down the street. Their Quacks were almost comically in-tune with the orders the vampire hunters would shout out. 

Speaking of Vampire Hunters, the whirring of a helicopter can be heard in the distance. Taking a deep breath to calm my building nerves, I let myself forcefully walk into my car, and slam the door. But of course, since I have super strength from three different sources, the door dents, severely.

Taking a careful deep breath, and start my car. Luckily, my key doesn't break; like it did last time. The werewolf hunters with their bolt guns and high powered motorcycles come swerving out, just as I get onto the street.

Several traffic laws are broken, and I make it to the restaurant with thirty minutes to spare. Just as I'm getting out of the car, a man with a submachine gun takes aim.

"Oh for fuck's sake!" I scream as one of the bullets slams through my arm.

The decay I'd been carefully hiding with layer upon layer of make up and Fake Skin, is now officially ruined. I find the hunger clenching in my stomach as the skin heals, and I stare over towards the man that just ruined my night.

From one second to the next, I'm on top of him, clawing out his eyes and biting into his neck. Then the chopper comes, and before I can even think, I'm flying through the air, slamming into the five men on board. Each are dead in hardly a second, and I'm jumping down towards the Werewolf hunters.

None of them have time to react, but for just a single moment, I'm blinded. Each of my contacts fall to the floor, before I summon the full power of each infection. In seconds, each and every one of them are dead.

I stare lightly towards the Geese Brigade, watching as they back away.

Suddenly, like an alarm bell, I look down at myself. Blood is dripping from my dress, little specks of muscle, bone, and tendrils of meat, are dripping down my arms and legs. As I look up, I find my date standing right in front of me.

He clears his throat, before reaching up to his eyes, and tearing out two contacts, "Well, guess I won't be needing these anymore,"
