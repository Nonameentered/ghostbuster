Yeah, sure, it was terrifying. Having cat nip show up the day before I realized I was out, or that one time that a pan was brought through, the hour before I broke my last. I thought nothing of it, although it was kinda terrifying after a bit. But what was I supposed to do? My cat actually *loved* this brand, he went a little bit more insane over the smell than normal. And the pan that I got? It had extra dexterity, with an even faster heating cycle, even if that did sound impossible I had tested it. 

There was advertisement a couple of days ago, one that truly set alarm bells ringing in my head. The two couple of problems, were the price, how long it would take to get here, and the thing itself.

The thing was, it was free. It was pretty high-grade equipment, and yet it was free. It wasn't exactly the sort of thing that *should* be free, you understand? That's why I was so worried. Something like that just doesn't end up free on amazon, with absolutely no one ordering it. But given the trend of things that had been happening lately, I couldn't not buy it, since with everything else, there might've been a need for it (secretly, I was hoping there wasn't).

The second part, was that it would take three days to get here. Three days shipping, barely any time at all. With how short of an amount of time it was going to take, I was even more frightened. What would I *possibly* need this for, and why would it be arriving so damn soon? The questions rolled around my brain, as I waited near the door.

The third, was the weapon. It was a weapon, to be more precise, a semi-automatic pistol. that was why I was so confused, so absolutely *horrified.* I sat by the door, waiting patiently for the package to arrive. The seconds ticked away, as I looked at the street from my window. Eventually, a van pulled out of my door.

It wasn't amazon's delivery service. I recognized that almost immediately. A man in a nondescript black suit, walked towards my house, holding a grey cardboard box. When he got to my door, he rang the bell. Quickly, I rushed over, opening the door.

"Y-yes...?" I asked, glancing towards the package.

When he reached into his pocket, I got nervous, heart thrumming in my chest as I stared towards that hand. He took out a note, placing it above the package, and then handing them both to me. With that, he left, riding off and away from my view. I watched for five more seconds, before opening the note, and staring in complete shock and horror.

*Dear Mr. Borren,*

*In five short minutes, three men will make their way towards your house. Now, you have three choices. The first, is that you let yourself die a painful death, the second, is that you run, inevitably leading towards the first. The third, is that you shoot them before they can shoot you. I will explain everything at a later date, However, at this moment, I ask for you compliance. Please take care of the men, and meet me at the third aisle within Rosemary Streets most popular shop.*

*Yours Truly,*

*The Eyes Behind The Black Hat.*

Before I even had time to comprehend this, the sound of something crashed against my ears. I looked towards the window, watching in slow motion as the glass began to break. Without even thinking, I dived to the ground.
