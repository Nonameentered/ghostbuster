"Sir, the Eyes in Sector Six are moving,"

Taking a drag from his cigarette, an old man's eyes drifted from a dreg of papers, "Advise the U.S to look elsewhere for oil. If they decide to keep their mining equipment up there, have their team 'disappear',"

"Yes sir," The man replied.

People were too curious nowadays, he reflected. He had no doubt it was the influence of those things that shouldn't be known, the things he had seen firsthand, so many hundreds of years ago. That night, deep within the depths, their ship had stumbled upon something impossible, with thousands of stitched together arms and hands and legs. The largest eye they had ever seen opened up upon that impossible dark.

His life had changed, from that moment on. For whatever reason, when he woke up once more, his entire crew was dead, bodies scattered all about, organs trailing across the floor. But he had become immortal, and nigh impossible to kill.

After that moment, he had one mission, and one mission alone. He swore to let no one, not a single soul, venture too deep into those depths, or awaken a single being that awaited down there.
