**The Kingpin**

I must admit, when I was younger, I could never quite gleam the weakness within the human mind. Each individual I met was a complex machine, something I simply could not work around. I started, as every criminal might, hustling drugs for someone that lorded power above me. 

When I began within this great industry, I began as all others do. The difference, however, is the power that I took. Whilst others were content with the money that they made, I needed more. It was simply a difference in how prepared we were, within the world we chose to enter. I came in with a simple desire, something I would not allow myself to fail, no matter how little I truly knew. 

You, however, started with the belief that you are merely a cog to the system, something to '*help it along*'. It's people like you that utterly *disgust* me, believing that your actions ever truly change the circumstances that you enter into. You act merely as maggots across the floor, taking whatever little inklings you can, only to give yourself this false sense of importance. You claim intuition as if you truly understand the world that you're working within. Yet you place constraints upon yourself that limit any true opportunity.

I wasn't always intuitive. Unlike your false knowledge, I admit it. I saw the world as a simple beacon of cogs, in much the same way that you view it. I failed, then, to understand that machines are made for breaking. *That* is what makes us different. I was not afraid to break things, to arise to the point that I now stand at. This is why your death was all but assured, why I rose into my position, where you sit here, blindfold across your eyes, and gun upon your forehead. Do You Understand?
