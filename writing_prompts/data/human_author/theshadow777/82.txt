It certainly isn't what one expects. I was walking through the forest close to my apartment building, holding a stick because I still like acting like I'm a child. Yet there was one moment, in that walk through the forest, where my stick *flickered.* It's hard to explain, exactly, but it looked like a sword, with a blue hilt, and a strange marking on it. You see, I tried my best to ignore it, rubbing my eyes and walking along, but it lingered somewhere in the back of my mind.

Along with my walk I went nonetheless, passing through the trees, and looking towards the familiar sights. That was, of course, until the sights became no longer familiar. I went from looking at trees that I had travelled past for more than five years, and then found myself looking towards a completely different territory, one beyond my own remembrance.

There within this bizarre forest, I slowly came to a careful realization. It was one that I was loathsome to admit, but one that had become painfully obvious as I looked around at all the unfamiliar wildlife. i wasn't home anymore.

I took a gentle breath then, trying my best to compose myself. I mean, what is one supposed to do in a situation like that? I certainly wasn't about to take it lying down. When I looked down towards my hand, I lightly noted the fact that it had turned into that flickering sword I'd seen, and then, with all the strength and stamina I could muster, I started running.

My feet took me to a small cavern, upon which a lake was running. There, I found a rather bizarre, overly large man. I walked into the clearing, and he turned to look at me. His eyes widened slightly, but other than that, he did not show much emotion.

"It is good to see you Link," The man said in a tone that clearly conveyed it was not good to see me.

"I...I'm not Link,"

Again, the man's eyes widened, "No? No, the young warrior never speaks. Who might you be then?"

"I..Umm...I'm Mark. Nice to meet you?"

"Ah, well, hello Mark. I will not say the same, but if I might ask, where did you get that sword?"

"I woke up with it, I guess. Listen, can you tell me how to get to North Street? I really wanna get out of these woods,"

"North street? I suppose I could tell you how to get back to...There, if you do something for me..."
