I would be the first to admit, that when I scribbled my signature upon a piece of paper for the first time in my life, I didn't expect another version of me to appear. My entire life, I'd always been particular about my writing; it Had to look nice, y'know? But when it came time for me to write my signature upon my debit card, I just didn't have the energy to bother.

As soon as I finished my signature, words appeared over my vision 'Congratulations, you've unlocked your Superpower: Lazy Writing'. From that day onwards, I've had the ability to create things with my words. Yet, if my words aren't legible enough to be understood, anything could happen. So far as I know, this ability has no limits.
