Walking through the streets of Larndam, people would often give me the strangest looks, especially on the days when my parents were with me. My mom would bend the water around her body, so that it was easier for her to move with us, and my father would stomp, ten heads above everyone else.

I looked just like the elves, or more appropriately, just like the humans, and as far as everyone else knew, I didn't have any traits that my parent's had. I didn't have the furry body of my father, and there weren't really any scales sticking out of my legs. I looked just like they would, and I assumed in some part, I felt just like they would.

There had been a couple of visits to the doctors over the years, of course. My body doesn't work like a human's would, and I have a lot of bodily organs that aren't exactly primed for a human body, but other than that, I seemed to be in the best shape that I could. The doctors often said it was a medical marvel for me to have even survived this long, considering that I seem to be an entire opposite of what would be helpful for me.

Although, I've often been able to do things that most of the people that look like me would never be able to do. Surprisingly, even without a body ten feet high, I've always had a strength stronger than most. My muscles aren't ever going to be like my fathers, but imagine being able to balance five boxes on each arm. That, primed with the *mind* of a mermaid, allowing me to assess my situation about ten times faster than most people would be capable of, it does lead to a couple of questions.

I'm not quite like either of my parents, and even if my body seems to give me a disadvantage in some cases, I've also managed a lot of cool quirks too. I just hope I live past the point when my half-liver starts to tear.
