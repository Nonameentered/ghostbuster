Jerry stared across the bed at his partner, an old priest by the name of Michael. They'd been working together for at least five years, and he refused to believe that the man didn't know what he was doing. Every, time, the exact same exasperated tone. If he didn't, he was the least observant, most trusting person on planet Earth.

He knew that the old man was hearing voices, every night, the ones from the demons all crawling down his skin. He'd seen the lacerations across the man's back. Yet one thing stayed consistent; he never died. It was as if the man was stuck on this Earth to torment him, bring his plague of demons along for the ride. They never left the clutches of his skin, Jerry made damn well sure of that, but the man kept moving, kept *existing*, in the face of this. If he were to be entirely honest, Jerry was scared, terrified even. The man before him was gripping onto life with an entire *hoard* of demonic activity around him.

Sighing, he replied, "Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. I'll try better next time," 

Michael nodded at him, "See that you do,"

Michael stared across the room at the man before him. He'd been with the monastery for quite a few years now. Inside, he couldn't help but laugh. All of the demons inside of his body were constantly screaming, and it felt *good*, the power and rage that they fed him was all but a blessing. Perhaps his father would be proud, but he wouldn't know. He was sent to this world for a reason after all, he was the counter. 

Jerry was a rather good servant though, feeding him as many demons as he needed. He could, however, see the turmoil behind the man's eyes. Perhaps he was hoping that he would die; which wasn't going to happen, of course. 

Carefully, he tasted the flames of this new demon, they were quite weak compared to the others. This one could be thrown to the wolves, let his army believe him to be a merciful leader. The judgement day was coming, and the Antichrist's army needed to be strong and trusting, after all.
