I stared silently towards the man in-front of me. He was wearing a typical suit, looking as if he had just gotten off of work, but his hair was frazzled and greasy, unkempt in all standards. He was begging for my help, with some sort of monster that was apparently tearing up a city. 

From what the man said, it sounded as if the monster should be a good thing. No matter where it went, good things happened. People's arguments stopped immediately, and innocent conversations were abound. Everything that it did helped in one way or another. Yet, from the viewpoint the man gave, it most clearly was not.

The humans that felt under the reign of this monster became subservient, only capable of saying nice things to other people. You could physically see the looks of pain that went over the eyes whenever they tried to speak, as if something within them was constricting and exploding all at once. So I thought about it for a moment, before steadily raising one of my hands. Upon that hand, at least five years ago, I'd tattooed a large Y. 

My heart was beating out of my chest, at what felt like five hundred beats per-minute. There was a woman with a bag of groceries, smiling kindly towards everyone that looked at her in a way that seemed almost painful. Slowly, with lead in my legs and ten ton weights, I walked up to her.

"Here, let me help you with that,"

"Oh it's quite alright, thank you," She replied; the first voice that had ever sounded genuinely polite when aimed at me, for just a moment, I worried that this wouldn't work.

"But I insist,"

"I said no you infected gangly fuck!" She practically screeched at me, before her eyes widened, and she fully comprehended what she'd just said.

"I'm so sorr-"

I smiled broadly, "You're welcome," Then looked over to my 'assistant'.

"We suggest that you go into hiding for the next couple of days, at least until the city is cured,"

The next person that I met, was a short and rotund men that hadn't sat up in over five hours. His foot was tapping upon the ground, and it really didn't seem like he wanted to be here. I approached with as much confidence as I could, and sat down in-front of him.

"So what brings you here?" 

The man seemed to choke for a moment, but otherwise said nothing.

"Personally I like the atmosphere, what with the pa-"

"I couldn't give half of a fuck about what you like about this place. Leave me the hell alone!" 

"Will do," I replied with a light smile, before jerking my thumb towards the man behind me.

Over the next couple of days, there were many different cases like this. Over that time, I started to notice that the man I was working with seemed entirely immune to whatever effect had taken over my life. One day, just before we were to go on a mission, I asked him about this.

"There are three of us," He replied after a moment, "The negative, the positive, and the Neutral. All I know for certain, is that we are reincarnations; although I do not know of what,"

I nodded mildly towards that, before I went about the next stage of our plan.

"Today I'm here with Miss Eleanor of the Mid-light show! I'd like to proudly proclaim that, no matter what, any individual in this city can come to me for help. I will be here to service your needs in whatever way possible," A broad smile lifted itself onto my lips; for once, my help would be useful.
