I was not awakened when the last star near me died. Nor did my eyes open for the crying of my brethren. Neither was I aware when the last of the ancient spirits fell. Through all of these and more, I laid dormant, in the one place where none could find me. Through the annals of ancient history, my name was forgotten, and my legacy had faded.

But then, a light towered through my resting place. This light, was not so bright, and was instead a pinprick, so much smaller than all I had seen. What carried was a being just as small, and perhaps even more fragile. It took me what felt like millennia to grapple with what I saw before me. This was a being I knew not of, twas also a being that ignored the wards I had placed, that walked passed the words of languages known only to my kind.

My eyes are those that can see into any being. What I looked upon had me shivering in fear. Not for myself, of course, but for it. How could a child of the stars be so fragile? With even a sight of my true self, the small creature would go mad! How small it was, that the wards had simply ignored it, seeing it as of no consequence.

Quickly, before it could truly see me, I changed myself to match the form of that it endeared most. I became a creature of fur and fangs, but without the suit that would be customary. When the creature finally came down, I was patted upon the head, as if I were a pet to it.

Such fragile things these humans were. I was so scared that any movement I made might break them. But I knew there were things out there worst than I. So I vowed to protect them, to lead them away from the threats that would consume them. More than that, however, I began my largest scheme. With each year that passed, I altered these small creatures. Soon, and hopefully soon enough, they would be powerful enough to no longer need my help.
