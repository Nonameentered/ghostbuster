I couldn't have possibly understood it then. He moved like a madman, throwing things into place, spilling water across the floor. All I could do was watch as he moved across the base.

His eyes were crazed, glinting with a kind of madness that no one but he understood. Each action was like watching a man being pulled by the strings of fate, ordained with an understanding that time is soon to run short.

Finally, his eyes landed upon me, and something akin to stone overcame his expression, "We have to kill them,"

"W-what, who? Is there an evading monster?"

"No, we have to kill Them, the others. You won't understand now, but if you have ever trusted me, then trust me on This. The entirety of Cerulea, Angartha, hell, the entirety of Earth will fall if we don't do this,"

The man before me was someone I'd been friends with my entire life. We had fought together, almost entirely alone, the day Earth learned it wasn't the only sentience. So how could I possibly say that I wouldn't? 

There is a fire within the heart of humanity, an eternal energy that rages  throughout all of us. It is that that my power ascends from. Yet today, it felt oh so difficult to call upon.

Our old friends arose, their bodies hardly seeming their own. He insisted that there wasn't a way to save them, that we had tried over a thousand times. So one by one, we killed them. Each speck of blood left my heart devastated.

In the end, we were both left staring towards a sky that no longer looked like our own. There was red coating the stars in all directions, as if something massive had spread its blood against everything in the universe.

"Did it ever truly end?" I could still remember those fights, jamming our hands into impossible entities, dreaming of the day when we'd get to stop fighting.

"No. They were vying their time, waiting. I wish I could've told you, b-but everytime I did, I had to start from the beginning, all the way back to when we were kids,"

Humanity still lived; I forced myself to believe that that was the only thing that matters.
