The history books will say differently, of that much I am sure. I can already see the witch crafting lies within my presence. She writes books about how everyone loved her, how she was the most beautiful of us all. She has even changed certain transcripts, making me her 'sister', so that she might have more leverage within her stories. She says my parents died upon a great shipwreck, but I know her lies, I know them more acutely than everyone else.

Every night, she plays a game. Crystals are summoned across my dark room, as I try desperately to stay within wakefulness. The crystals, one by one, move closer and closer to my heart. They always sit just a fraction above it by the end of the night. She knows I am weak, that I cannot move as I wish I could. It has been a condition since birth, coughing, sometimes spewing up blood, desperately searching for doctors, and always failing to find one that can heal me. We even went to see the trolls once, the ones that ripped half of our population to shreds thousands of years back. They refused to help.

Last night was my first real scare. She did something different, something far more horrifying. She wrapped the ice around the edges of my skin, slowly slinking it closer, and closer, to my heart. I was forced to look as that cold freezed over the rest of me. Near immediately, my heart started to beat faster than it should, faster than most of the doctors recommended. I started to hurt, ache, deep within the center of that frozen lining. My breath chilled when she made a dramatically shaped heart around the true shape of what my heart would be.

Here she sits in front of me, writing within the history book she wishes to create. She says we're going on a voyage to meet her people. The horrifying abomination of a snowman she created after the siege of last year is looking over her. Its eyes are nothing more than protruding rain droplets. She's looking towards it with a half-smile. Its changing shape, becoming even larger. The larger she makes it, the more its form begins the crackle. The voice it used to have changes into something else, something darker, something even the depths of madness surely would be incapable of conjuring.

She looks towards me with a smile similar to the entity, before walking across the room.

"You might want to bundle up, my dear Ana, I wouldn't want you to freeze yourself." She says with a laugh, before walking out of the room with the beast.
