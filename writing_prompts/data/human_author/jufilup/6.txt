Grug received his meal last and sat away from the other families in the village. He set his leaf with his chunks of meat and greens on his stone table before sitting on his tree stump chair. He picked up bits and pieces of his brethren's conversation, and, closing his eyes, imagined himself sitting among them, enjoying their company. He'd join in on their gossip. He'd engage with their grief, their joy, their hunger, their pain, and their time.

His meal was cold, as he received it last. The scraps of meat consisted of fat and gristle. Even the greens were bordering rotten.

Oko, Chilo, and Kranchy had now finished their servings, including their leaf-plates, and, after bowing to their parents, left to make evening preparations.

The Ceremony would occur at sundown. Oko, Chilo, and Kranchy, along with a few other young men and women, would perform the rituals passed down from their ancestors, and join the others in manhood or womanhood.

Grug felt the pang in his heart as he sucked on a particularly fatty piece of beef, remembering his own ceremony. The darkness, the fear and confusion, the laughing and pointing, his father's fists and mother's face turning away.

Returning to his dwelling, for none of his fellow villagers invited him to their after-dinner festivities, Grug sat in his little mud hut with its straw roof.

He rocked back and forth in his only item of value: his parents' old rocking chair, painstakingly handcrafted by Grug's grandpappy. He recalled his mother's caress on his cheek as he sat in her lap.

He regarded their empty home, their little mounds of earth outside, the twigs above shaped into ornamental symbols to signify each grave.

Grug remembered his brother, Krug's ceremony. Krug's ceremony had been tailored to his goal, which had been actually attainable. He merely had to father two children, a task of infinite ease when one of the few free comforts of the world is copulation.

His ceremony passed with ease, with much dancing and fornication, with booze and meat and laughter.

Grug's ceremony had merely confused the village, not understanding how to help him attain 'intergalactic space travel', and several of them refused to even attempt to pronounce the heresy. His ceremony had been cut abruptly short, his father screaming at him when they arrived home for the embarrassment.

And Grug was embarrassed. He had not even tried. He had not put an iota of effort in and resented himself for it. He imagined himself mining new and important rocks, manipulating them and creating something new, and leaving this Earth, whatever that all meant, and he despised himself for not putting in the time and effort he must to achieve these goals. Grug had tried to explain to the men and women around him as much as he understood. He recalled the dreams he had, as everyone had about their Goal.

The stars, the spaceships (as the man in the dream called them), the sun and the moon and the earth (and that is what we are on!). Grug had spewed all and more excitedly. Dad was not excited. These 'new ways' as Dad quickly termed them were *not* following our culture, or in fact, with reality itself, and Grug was talking outright insanity to believe these things such as the Sun or the Moon or something as ridiculous as Space Ships. At this Grug exasperatedly pointed at the sun, blazing down brightly, causing sweat to bead up on Grug's face.

Dad interpreted the exasperation as insolence, and swiftly backhanded him. The look of disbelief that flashed on Grug's face earned him another blow. The talk of the fake world of "space" and "the sun" and "the moon" and "rockets" was forgotten.

Grug could hardly remember it now, decades and centuries later. Why was he still here? What must he do? Men and women seemed to come and go in an instant, sprouting up like bamboo shoots only to be rapidly chopped down again.

Grug sat alone in his hut, next to the rocking chair that had long decayed.

Unfortunately, he had not the skills to fix it.
