Clyde wiped the seafoam from his trousers, the sun glinting off the water on his bare, tan skin. He lit a cigarette, observing the chopping of the waves, squinting as he looked towards the west, towards the setting sun. The light reflected off the moving waves as a smashed mirror, Clyde looked away, remembering the tales of those lost at sea, oft becoming blind from the rays.

Justin joined Clyde for the second cigarette. The boys stood in silence. A breeze flitted through Clyde's sandy curls and gently swept Justin's shoulder-length black stringy hair to his left side.

Justin brushed a bundle of strands aside, bringing his cigarette to his lungs. The outside air smelled of salt. Justin turned his back to Clyde, taking a long piss into the infinite puddle.

The third cigarette was rushed, with occasional glances made toward their watches. Nineteen hundred hours neared. The men flicked the butts into the trashcan, and watched them for a moment, slowly drifting away, lapping up and down in the waves.

The stale air of below once again filled their nostrils. The heavy metal clank of the porthole sounded, and Justin twisted it shut with an effort.

Before long the light of the evening was forgotten.

The world consisted of a lovely, tiny bubble. A cone of perhaps 30 meters, probably less. The headlight shone brightly forward, an enormous ice cream cone plunging into the future, guiding them bravely.

The men looked with little to no interest; the infinity of space never captures you until you are there to experience it. The first days, sure, were terror. Not even of the enemy, Justin remembered with a minor chuckle, but of sea life. He again smiled at the absurdity, remembering how he first gasped when seeing a large jellyfish.

Justin now rather enjoyed targeting them; they were not marine biologists. The metal vehicle was plastered in many shades of sea life, most rotting or actively decaying.

For what else was there to do with the time, other than these idle pleasures?

The air stank of two men in close quarters. The military rations, though filling, only provided existence. The purified salt water went tepidly down the throat. Justin struggled to swallow.

The cigarettes, to be sure, helped. Justin felt the clawing in his mind. He should have hustled through his second and third, such that he could cram in a fourth.

He'd have to wait four long hours.

Four hours of following the ice cream cone, observing the nothingness. The same path with the same scenery.

A very simple route, truly. From the tip of New Guinea, as close to Japan as they could while feeling safe (they would get very close, now, never having seen a Jap sub), to the Philippines, then back to New Guinea, refueling at various spots, though fuel never seemed to run low. Justin couldn't remember the last time they had to refuel, the last time they needed to get out of this infinite abyss.

The fuel meter stood stolidly on full.

Just now they were between New Guinea and the lowest Islands that the West would recognize Japan owned.

Justin settled in for a nap.
