Luther took a long draw of coffee as he reread the newspaper for the day of October seventeenth, two thousand and twenty one.

He spent the most time on the funnies. Garfield was upset it was Monday. The young ones in The Family Circus were up to no good. That little girl pulled the football from Charlie Brown again.

After his coffee and breakfast of two hard boiled eggs, a fat sliced piece of toast, and a good thick slice of honey roasted ham, Luther set of to the day’s chores.

He tidied up the old barn he called his home. Then he went to the well and took six trips with the buckets until his water tank was about a quarter full, and that was enough for today, dammit. Luther splashed his face and shaved with his sharpened knife, long having established the technique to spare his face any cuts.

Then came the animals, feeding the chickens, goats, hogs, cows and more. Some were self sufficient, but the routine took about two hours of Luther’s day, and those hours must be taken.

Idle hands lead to trouble. Luther experienced enough trouble before he established his long standing routine.

And before Luther knew it, his chores took him past dinner, which he enjoyed in the front yard with his flock.

After he cleaned his dish of bacon grease, he changed clothes into his nice old work attire, to once again pay respect to Pat.

Pat’s grave sat beneath his pride an joy, a nearly elderly apple tree.

Luther said a long prayer, and when his words ran out, he slipped into the Lord’s Prayer, or Hail Marys, or occasional hymns. By the end his eyes shone and he knew Pat knew and understood his gratitude.

Luther finished the evening with a large glass of scotch, as always. It helped cloud the memories, helped him feel justified.

It sometimes couldn’t keep the memories away, though, of Luther bludgeoning Pat with his own fire poker, followed by Pat’s wife and children.
