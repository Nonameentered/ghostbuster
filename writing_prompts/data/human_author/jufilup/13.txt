"Oh, I've got it!" Clyde announced triumphantly, alternating his gaze between the two Heathers before him. "I'll ask a question only the *real* Heather would know!"

Left Heather brought her palm quickly into her forehead, leaving a small pink imprint. Right Heather sighed loudly and rolled her eyes at Clyde's ignorance.

"We have the same memories." Right Heather spoke plainly. "There's nothing you could ask."

At this, silence lapsed once again, Clyde wracking his brain. What were the options? Testing their memory? Looking for birthmarks or other physical signs? Clyde felt his mind run directly into a dead end; what else was there? What could Clyde check? How could he know?

They looked perfectly identical. He scrutinized them. The same set of long legs rose up into the same curved hips, the same inward curve of their belly, and the same outward curve of their breasts.

He wondered for a brief instant if he could initiate a threesome before pushing the thought aside, feeling slightly ashamed.

Clyde was still fingering the idea of the threesome, wondering how he may try to initiate it while simultaneously feeling repulsed by himself, trying to take advantage of his friend's plight.

He could think of no way to casually bring the matter up and began thinking again of how to discern the two women. Abruptly, Right Heather's head snapped up from the spot on the ground she had been intently staring at.

She had grasped the reality just a moment before Left Heather, and that made all the difference.

There could only be one Heather.

Right Heather grasped a pair of kitchen scissors from the coffee table and injected the blade into Left Heather in one rapid movement. Left Heather's eyes widened in shock, her hands flying upwards far too slowly. With the same rapidity, the scissors were retracted and emphatically replaced into her neck, perhaps ten more times.

Clyde had already fled before Right Heather sat back, chest heaving, red and glistening with blood.

"It is me," Heather mumbled to herself, praying she was correct. "I'm me."

Heather suddenly regarded the thing leaking blood onto her floor with the greatest disgust. This monster tried to usurp her, to steal her entire life.

She kicked the monster's head as hard as she could muster, letting out a strangled cry as the skull crunched into her boot.
