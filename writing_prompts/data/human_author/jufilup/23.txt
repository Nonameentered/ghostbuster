The golden sun turned her hair from a gentle brown to a brilliant burnt orange The heat brought color to her pale cheeks. Tiny wisps of cotton curled off of her grey turtleneck, which clung tightly to her neck, the slope of her breasts, and her stomach. Her buttocks bulged outward, forming rolling hills contained by thin black yoga pants.

Truth be told, it was the body of any woman on the street, simply dressed for the brisk fall weather.

I noticed some dust sputtering softly onto her left breast, beginning to smudge her perfect grey turtleneck. Then things moved too fast to comprehend, though those words sound hollow even in my absent ears.

Somehow no sound was made, or it was far too high to hear. A decent helping of dust and clumps of dirt preceded the enormous boulder by a mere instant.

She probably didn't even feel the little gust of wind that was me trying to push her over, though the effort left me bedridden for months.

Her left leg remained just a foot from where she stood, the rest of her corpse had followed the boulder down into the canyon.

And so it goes.

I settled in for a long day.

Water flung to both sides as she fixed her hair, emerging from the ocean. She wore a purple and white vertically striped bikini over ginger-pale skin, sporting a nice round rump and modest boobs. Blonde streaks flowed through her red hair, though it looked red-brown wet. She often carried around a book, and I imagined it to be a romance novel, and perhaps I imagined quite a lot about that romance.

I leaned back on my crossed arms, my back to the mountains, long in the distance.
