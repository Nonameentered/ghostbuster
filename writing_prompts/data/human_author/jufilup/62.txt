"Name?"

"Barnabas Gladson, at your service."

"Not on the list, next!"

"Whoa, excuse me! I know I had a reservation for today. Can you check my aliases?" Barnabas rattled off sixty-seven names before one of the ones he made up matched a guest, and astonishingly, they allowed him in.

He took off his clothes in the locker room, preferring to enter the sauna in the nude; there may be babes today, and he was a shower rather than a grower.

Steam flowed steadily from the room as Barny opened the door and crammed himself in with the rest of the spirits. Though lacking true physical forms, the space was still crowded. Barny could feel the thoughts and feelings of the men and women closest to him.

One of the women nearest him was being eaten out by a rather enthusiastic young man, and the feeling hardened Barny. He respectfully put his towel on his lap, though he hoped a young sexy spirit would notice the tent he was pitching.

Barny took his time though in finding a mate. Instead, he sat back, closed his eyes, and enjoyed the passive orgasms from the hundreds of surrounding spirits.

The young man so delicately licking the woman's clitoris stopped, and half of the spirits in the room booed, Barny among them; he had been so close. The young man clearly had somewhere to be, but several spirits pushed him back over to the woman. As he began again, the room settled down, and Barny jerked himself as he felt the woman's clit stimulated vigorously.

All of a sudden, the large, overweight naked human in the middle of the room stood up, let out an enormous fart, and moved to leave the room.

Several spirits began sobbing, and countless others attempted to barricade to wall, though the man simply opened the physical door.

Barny had been just on the brink of finishing when the door shut, sucking the warmness and life from the sauna. The remaining spirits eyed each other slightly uncomfortably.

Barny covered himself fully with his towel, much like a child playing ghost with his sheets. Then he finished jacking himself off.
