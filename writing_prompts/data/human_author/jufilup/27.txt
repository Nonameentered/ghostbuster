In the few moments that Jessica has to ascertain the situation, to make a potentially life and death situation, she noticed the man's brilliant blue eyes, very similar to her father's own bright, icy blue eyes.

And that was enough.

And it *shouldn't* have been enough! Jessica thought lazily, drifting off to sleep with the man on her couch, cuddling as they watched the ball game on the tube. Yet that thought clawed at her mind gently as she snuggled more deeply into her convict visitor's warm, soft chest. The warm wine sat happily in her belly, filling her chest with cozy warmth.

She never woke again. Her house was looted of all valuables and her corpse was found months later at the bottom of a lake a few hundred miles away.
