Her engorged belly glowed a brilliant blue-green. The theatre audience grumbled at the light interrupting the soap opera’s climax.

The orb grew more brilliant, surrounding the baby’s ashy silhouette, before erupting upwards, splitting the woman from crotch to breast.

Ashley quit therapy years ago. Her sleep was still fitful, and falling asleep was particularly difficult, but she found counseling did not help. She simply could not slowly deflate the balloon, no matter how hard she try to just barely, the teeniest, tiniest, bit let go of the rope.

So she gave up and continued to hold tight. Disability did not provide a glamorous lifestyle, but Ashley got by.

It has been a particularly uneventful day. Ashley had gotten lunch with a work acquaintance. She followed work by a trip to the gym, and because she wanted to have a truly dead and relaxed weekend, Ashley decided to round the day up by a trip the bank.

The building exploded with enormous energy, sending huge chunks of shrapnel into the surrounding city streets.

The tellers and customers were disintegrated, despite a few of the magically inclined forming brief force fields.

The concussion stalled cars in neighboring towns, and caused three planes to stall out mid flight, crashing into the ground in a sad arch.

Approximately a mile radius of crunched concrete surrounded the scene.

Ashley alone stood hunching, wobbling forward favoring her left leg. She looked for a couch, and took a much needed lie down.
