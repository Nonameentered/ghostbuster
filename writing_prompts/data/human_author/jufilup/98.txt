Charlie Oxford clawed at his alarm clock, pressing every button other than the snooze. Rolling over, Charlie yanked the cord out of the wall. Charlie went about his morning routine, clothing, eating, and just as he was about to head to work, Charlie grabbed his driving sunglasses, ready to go to another boring day in the office.

Charlie's head erupted as he puts on the glasses, as years of memories crashed into his mind. As always, he nearly fainted, and instinctively reached his hand out to the guard rail he had installed years ago, after one of his mornings resulted in fainting and cracking his head open on the fireplace banister. 

After several minutes, Charlie pieced himself together, remembered where he ought to be, and set off to the resistance HQ, occasionally eyeing the small picture clipped to the top left of his glasses.

An image of his sister, he had been filming her for a silly internet video just as a magic drive by occurred. The picture captured her midway between transformation from a human into a butterfly.

Tiny wings were erupting from her back, her spine, arms and legs collapsed at odd angles, the witch who cast the spell and her drinking friends erupted in laughter. Charlie's sister, Nina's expression was that of utter agony.

Charlie arrived last, as always.

"There's the lout, late as always. Need to change up your morning routine, Charles, put on the glasses first thing in the morning, and you'll get here on time."

Charles has the grace to look apologetic. "I try, Nick. I promise I try. I just never remember."

The rest of the members worked on various tasks, operating phones, researching magical headquarters, trying to connect CEO's and large businesses to magical assassinations and lobbying.

Charlie strode to his chair when Nick's daughter Amy decided to play a fun joke by tripping him. Charlie sprawled to the ground, scraping the palms of his hands on the rough cement floor.

Charlie felt assaulted by a vacuum. His entire life sucked away, and he was left alone again, with a sister passed long ago from cancer, and no other family to speak of. He thumbed a butterfly ring on his pointer finger, a nervous tick from long ago.

"Hey, you need to watch your step, young lady." Charles said. "I'm late for work."

And with a curt nod to the fellows standing around him, Charles walked away.

Shouts behind him told him to stop, but Charlie carried forward quickly, not wanting to upset his boss anymore.

"Don't! They're outside!!" Amanda screamed.

Charlie shouldered the heavy metal door open to see a small child holding a toy stick, probably a souvenir from Harry Potter World.

The world shrank, Charles felt brief immense pain before settling in.

A beautiful flowering aster plant caught Charles' attention, and he slowly fluttered over to it, eager for a little snack.
