There were Joe, Christy, Angel, Jesus (hay-soos), Clive, and Winston. They formed an arrow, pointing into large oblivion. Steven never could quite figure out a good way to map the quadrants of the sky; the ship seemed to rotate unpredictably. Eventually, he gave up trying.

Instead, he looked for landmarks, just as he once used the McDonald's sign to find his way home from just about anywhere in his ramshackle little town. For the first years, that was all Steven thought of, primarily his mom and kid sister. Now, a faint ring around his eye was the only proof that he tried. He truly tried.

Some nights he would reinforce the mark, pressing his telescope into his eye. He imagined when his ma would see him, he'd shove his finger towards his right eye, and she'd be proud. She'd know his effort, she'd hug him, swaddle him, rock him, maybe forgive him.

Steven shook his head - he would not entertain such folly.

His eyes crept to where they often did: a clear box made of reinforced glass containing several framed photos.

A hammer, a happily married couple with their child, a woman in a pink, lacy dress, half of her face mashing and mixing with the concrete, Steven holding a number under his face, his eyes pouring into the camera lens. 

Details of the event were written below each picture. In the first week, Steven nicked his finger and coated the entire case with blood, yet over the years the hardened brown streaks hid less and less.

Steven wondered if this would be the rest of his life, as he often did.

Steven took a deep gulp of water and turned again to look back at the woman, at the pink lace of her mini dress.

That dumb woman. She'll fuck that man, but not Steven. Steven ground his teeth, his eyes drilling into the woman's ass.
