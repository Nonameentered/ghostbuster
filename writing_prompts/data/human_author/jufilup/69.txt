“Look, Asmodeus, things will never change! I’m gonna stay this way until I’m 30, or 40! Or fucking dead! Fuck!” Larry balled his fists, smashing them into his temples.

Asmodeus floated in his glass orb, allowing Larry to tire himself out.

“And it’s all their fucking fault. Why was I born into this world? With the Chads and Stacies running everything? Why was I born into such a bullshit caste based system? Fucking bullshit!” Larry paced the room, gesticulating emphatically with his hands. 

“Look, Larry, I know this is hard. But have you considered that maybe you’re looking at it wrong? Maybe Amber isn’t actually being a Stacy, maybe the best way to ask her out wasn’t by texting ‘*sneaks up behind you and hugs you. hides behind bush while blushing*’. I understand you’re frustrated, buddy, but maybe you should try joining a club or something, I don’t think having me smite Amber will fix things.”

Larry regarded Asmodius with considerable anger.

“Fuck you, Asmodius. Fucking do it.”

A bolt of lighting pierced the roof of Amber’s family’s home. It grazed the dog on the second floor, before burrowing deep into Amber’s skull on the first.
