Arthur downed the glass of high shelf scotch. Fluffy cushions pressed gently as the dancer gyrated. Arthur stole a few touches "for stability" as he reached to his side table to grab another drink. Celeste focused on the music; Arthur tipped well.

Pink, blue, and red lights shown on the leathery skin that tickled the men, that gave them blue balls most nights and hasty blow jobs for extra from the girls who had families to feed, who still had a youngin waiting for their cereal, or peanut butter and jelly, or ramen noodles.

The little numbers lit the dank room as well, a soft golden glow emanating, turning downright blinding in enormous crowds; most performers began wearing sunglasses or prescription shaded contacts in the years following the numbering years ago.

Of course, the hysteria had been pure. The capitalizing on the fear, the genuine true fear.

The kids now simply don't understand how it used to be, and how hysteria always has been. My own children never understood the true terror we experienced after the second world war. You have to understand, the fear was merely a catalyst, or the spark to set off the fire.

The spark never was set; no nukes were ever set off, at least not in the great US of A. Well other than in testing.

The same hysteria hit when the numbers arrived. The suspicion of the unknown trickled into every corner of society.

Politicians came out with mass reassurances. The old classics, just as helpful as the famous "The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself!", which came so famously at a time when the American economy was firmly in the toilet, when feeding your small family was an enormous privilege.

Yet the hysteria of course passed, and the numbers merged with culture like sushi once did. Theories formed and fell as no conclusive patterns were formed, save from very niche patterns found via algorithm.

The fear of death escalated the research in the early year, especially when a prominent billionaire fell into the single digits.

Yet when a ninety year old hobbling woman displayed a number of four hundred and sixty eight million, the link between health and number quantity was dismissed.

Arthur made another grab at Celeste's chest as he moved to grab his flask, her hips gyrating inches above his lap, often grazing his crotch.

The VIP lounge maintained only the best men and women, the cream of the crop. Arthur sported a number well into the trillions, and had truly drank the koolaid of his invincibility.

The first slight came long before, a simple barfight that Arthur won with a single punch after stepping outside. The other kid went down hard, and Arthur curb stomped his fat, balding head four times before running the opposite way from his home in panic.

The next slight the violence came easier and he ran slower, almost welcoming twelve to come, packing a little Glock to welcome the opportunity.

In this lounge, it only took a man giving Arthur a hard look, merely the resting face of a drug dealer specializing in snow.

The man noticed Arthur's face contort in anger and responded in turn, raising his pistol and landing a bullet between Arthur's eyes.

His brain splattered the wall, and the brilliant light emanating from the six hundred trillion above his head spazzed before deflating, as if it had caught its last greedy moth.
