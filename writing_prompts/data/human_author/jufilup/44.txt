Alkazmata turned his mind inward to the enormous dusty library within. What would take an average humans millennia to pour through took the godly being only a fraction of an instant. He felt and knew events as they flitted in front of his mind, as if he was merely dusting off old snow globes from his dank garage.

Until he finally found the correct globe, and dusting it off revealed another timeline, where his nemesis somehow managed to save the "world" (actually his little town in Florida, called Gilley's Ford).

His nemesis pathetically didn't even win in that multiverse. Alkazmata simply never existed due to a misunderstanding between his ancient, ethereal parents. They ended up making love fourteen hours later than in Alkazmata's universe, and a different sperm smashed into his mother's egg. That version of Alkazmata spent his eons floating among the stars and planets, not bothering with this small town of Gilley's Ford.

Alkazmata didn't bother to educate to protagonist on this. Instead sending an arching bolt of lightning from fourteen miles over the horizon.

Alkazmata enjoyed the crispy delicacy of fried human, before taking a fat shit on Gilley's Ford for the crime of making him question if he was living his best life.
