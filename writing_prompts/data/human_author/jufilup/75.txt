The statue of Helen stood eight feet tall, a masterpiece of dried mud, long dead leaves, flowers, and a large sapling carved to look like a magical staff. She was shaped to look pregnant, as she was the beginner of the entire community.

Today the festivities would begin at dawn. It would begin with the tale of Helen and her family's journey, on a little road trip through the forests of Arkansas. It was the first time Helen had left Oklahoma, and she was excited to see more of the great US of A.

Her, Frank, and her bun in the oven filled up the tank, munched on taquitos from QuikTrip, and settled into their mini van with the road map; GPS was for pansies.

Frank saw what looked like a great shortcut, yet took the wrong turn about six miles into the eighteen mile county road. One mistake turned into many more. Frank finally buckled, pulling out his phone to see his location, to see no signal.

And so a new Journey began, and in the tale, Helen wore the pants.

Despite being six months pregnant, Helen had been a girl scout. They conserved the remaining gasoline, and traveled a straight direction, towards where they thought a road was.

Then they found The Cabin, and were saved. Sources differ on what happened to Helen, some say she changed appearance drastically, from a short, beautiful, brunette, petite woman to a tall, long legged, still beautiful, blonde woman.

And she lived on, bearing all of the children that would come to make up this community, that would celebrate the festival of Her.

Helen descended from her palanquin, surrounded by her royal subjects, her children and family.

She took her seat at the head of the table, picked up her silverware, and began to eat. The rest of her family stopped waiting, and dug into the roast duck, mashed potatoes and gravy, and green bean casserole. With Helen at the head of the table sat several of her favorite great-great-great-however-many-times granddaughters and grandsons.

They wore elegant dresses and suits, several wore pristine white gloves, daintily eating with their silverware like fine nobility.

The table stretched for nearly a football field, the gradient of your importance based on your proximity to Helen.

Much of it was based on looks, though minor accolades were awarded for certain talents, such as singing, or skills, such as providing via hunting. After the beautiful golden grand-grandchildren, came the very talented and very skilled, often adorned with patches to designate their special skill or talent, making sure to remind Helen they belonged.

Then of course came commoners, not exceptionally beautiful, witty, intelligent, educated, or talented. Honestly, the bunch had a great time. They were mostly stoners, and several of them hosted DnD nights or LAN parties.

Then, the slightly and not so slightly ugly. Helen preferred not to be reminded of her failures. They were nearly eighty yards from her.

And finally, Helen nearly excluded them from the table, just as she nearly had tied them in garbage bags and thrown them in the river after their bloody births.

The inbred genetic rejects and failures. The, as Helen would put it back in her day, "retards".

Helen looked out to her crops, to her folk, her cattle, and her sin, she felt a fierce pride. She did more for these people than the real Helen ever could have. She started a community, a full family with Helen's child, rest in peace his soul.

She only wished they'd be a little more grateful for her sacrifice.
