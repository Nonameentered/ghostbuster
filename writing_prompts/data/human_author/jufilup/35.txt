Piles of corpses smattered the football field. Burning rubble accented university buildings, now dashed in a bright cherry red that would surely melt to brick if it is not cleaned sooner.

The cafeteria was obliterated. The students actively feasting on their burgers and their chickens and their fish tacos lay smashed under the weight of a tantruming giant.

And yet that was not enough. I of course planted bombs in all of the surrounding meat factories or plants dedicated to the processing of animal products.

By the time I finished, nearly the full city lay waste (I don’t use small bombs, kind of wasteful).

“Man, even for a vegan, this seems a little extreme..” My sidekick said to me as we watched explosions on the horizon.

I looked at him with a grim expression. “It is what we must do. We are saving the world.”

I hefted my pipe bombs, on my way to blow up a free range chicken farm.
