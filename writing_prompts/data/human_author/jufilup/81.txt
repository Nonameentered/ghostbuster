Back when Joe and me were just tall enough to ride The Black Sun, I chickened out. It came from my ma, she’d always worry, popping her head outside every moment or two. “Making sure everything was okay.” 

It was okay. 

But right when I was ready to jump off the swing and fly so high I could land on the roof, my mama ran outside. “Edgar Albert Jones don’t you dare!”.

I didn’t dare then. I don’t dare now.

So when Colonel Angus asks for volunteers, my hands stays clutched at my fist. Arnold gets chosen, and doesn’t look at me. Goodbye, brother. Hope to see you tomorrow.

Among my other chosen brothers were Sean, Langston, China (one of the few women), and Clive.

The Chosen gear up. I smoke a cigarette hunched in the bunker, listening to Trevor tell the same story about catching some fish in Florida.

We all convene at the gate to bid farewell to our brothers in arms. Arnold still doesn’t meet my eyes. I grip Clive’s hand, wishing him a farewell, promising to do good by his wife and children if the unspeakable occurs.

And The Chosen are strolling through the imposing gate, it’s harsh metal hinges whining as it slams shut, and they’re off.

I share a few moments with fellow brothers, some cowards, some merely not chosen. 

Perhaps they will be next time.
