"And why did you mutter that to yourself anyway, Sherlock Holmes? You with your shining armor and your pride face and straight back, were you gonna bury him if he was dead? Oh, no! Oh course not! Too busy 'protecting the land'. Poking and prodding and getting into other people's business. You know, one of you folk barged in on me mum and dad, they was just enjoying a cuppa. Yous said you'd had reports in the area of a suspicious lookin troll and you needed to search my pappies. The brute felt up me mum and punched around me pop and you're gonna come around here now, sporting the same family crest, pretending you're doing anyone any fucking good. Well, I'm here to tell you you aren't going to play detective like this is some board game. Show some respect to a fallen brother, asshole."

The troll stood a bit above three feet, somewhat egg shaped. He paced circles around his buddy, keeping his eyes and chest directed at Knight Edgar Olfact, alternating between sidesteps and forward and backward walking.

The pit in Edgar's stomach grew, growing deeper as he realized his dad most likely had fondled a trolls tits, though it also gave Edgar some comfort; he was only human. He was forgivable. He had long held deep shame for groping a curvy goblin, even sharing a kiss.

Edgar lifted the visor on his full helm and ascertained the surroundings before removing the helm altogether. He attached the helm to the loop on his horse's saddle before taking a respectful, thoughtful, deliberate three steps forward in front of the fallen troll.

Edgar's sword sang as it left its sheath. Edgar swished the metal in a figure eight to signify infinity, ending with the sword pointed straight vertically, Edgar then methodically replaced the sword in its scabbard.

"And that's about fucking right, innit, cunt! That's about the thanks the chap gets, slaving in this forest his whole life. Lotta good it did. Thanks for your service." The troll spat the last line, scrunching his face in anger as it glared at Edgar.

Edgar knelt on both knees in front of the troll's corpse, prepared to send him to the other side. Regardless of the species of soul, a peaceful departure was necessary and was usually eased along via a kind prayer after its death.

Edgar cleared his throat. "What's his name, son?"

The troll came running with the speed of a limping chihuahua and battered Edgar with fists as powerful as his cousin's toddler. "*Her* name was Rose!" He squealed, punctuating each word with a blow that stung like cotton candy.

Edgar bowed his head and clasped his hands between his knees.

"From the rivers to the oceans we remember Rose. From the mountains to the canyons we treasure our time with Rose. From the caves to the prairies we give Rose our goodwill, so we may stead her on her journey towards You and Everyone Else. Through Your work, and the work of Us All, thy will be done. Amen." It was a simple blessing, taught to school children.

The little troll accepted Edgar's offer of a hankey and honked his nose loudly.

"Thanks." The word came with huge effort, like forcing a rock through his throat. The gratitude was lost in the wind; the hero strolled on.
