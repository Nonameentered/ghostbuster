Ashton Harbuckle's pant legs were caked in the mud up to about his mid thigh. He had long lost his energy, and was leaning back on the ground in exhaustion. He was visible from about above his knees, and was naked above his knees; he had thought removing his clothes would help him become unstuck (maybe it was just stuck to his pants, Sean had said).

That was a few days ago, and Ashton had stopped joking entirely, now simply asking for the mercy he deserved, yet no one had the courage to end their friend.

The captain and the rest of the crew fought starvation and dehydration, having accepted that none would escape this demise and none wanted to end like Ashton.

The captain would carefully descend the ladder every approximately eight hours to change the bandage around Ashton's torso; right when he first got stuck, the men had wrapped a rope beneath his shoulders around his arms, and situated it on a pulley so the men could combine their weights and rescue him.

The pop of Ashton's shoulders out of their sockets was drowned out by Ashton's screaming, which was drowned out by the yelling and heaving of the pulling men. The rope burn required serious bandaging, and Ashton somehow ended up lower than before.

And then was the ship, sinking about an inch a day according to the sharpie marks on the keel.

The crew could last a few years at the rate of sinkage, but only a few more weeks with their provisions of food and water.

The captain knew these hard truths, and tried to shove them from his mind as he sliced his serving of ham in half, smothered it in hashbrowns, and took a fat bite.
