This is just so ridiculous that you view these writing prompts as attacks on christianity and not people just wanting to flex their creative muscles.

I find the god and satan prompts slightly annoying by their repetitiveness, but it is very understandable that people make prompts about them so often: they're stock characters with understood feelings about things and it's interesting for a lot of people to imagine how they may interact.

Like the whole reason people make the prompt of "heaven is actually shitty" or "hell is actually good" is because it *subverts* the commonly understood belief that the opposite is true. It is an interesting thing to think about and write about and the whole prompts can be sometimes like inside jokes for religious people too.

Cry more, snowflake, geez.
