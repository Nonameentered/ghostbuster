The streets were composed of clean, white, marble. Delicately shaped lampposts slanted upwards, twisting into odd, asymmetric poses. The street scrubbers passed on their hourly journey, keeping a sharp eye on the sidewalks for any stray piece of lint, or hair, or unfortunate dog or cat dander.

These bits were identified if possible, the owner properly fined, and the pieces of rubble were disposed of. Every hour on the hour, night and day, the scrubbers made their paths, through every city on the planet. It was necessary, the only way to contain the filth, the contamination.

A booming woosh of air came from the east, accompanied by a roar. A rocket careened into the sky, growing fainter in the distance, its once bulky mass reduced to a mere speck. The daily shipment of garbage would be out of the solar system within approximately forty years, to its destination dumpster planet within around four hundred years.

"Bravo, Alpha, four, eight, Vincent. Go."

Four men gripped the battering rams, appearing enormous in their bullet-proof vests and heavy slacks. The door only withstood two blows, cheap wood crackling, folding easily in two.

A repulsive stench emanated from the abode, and surrounding pedestrians clenched their nostrils. The army men wore nose plugs.

Piles of trash mounted to form a sort of carpet, which the men plunged through with grim expressions.

The oaf tried to hide behind a particularly large pile of garbage, nearly eight feet tall. Among the excrement were multiple large wooden furniture items: a desk, wardrobe, precariously balanced.

A mustachioed man with dark eyes and slick black hair found the hiding fool, and grinning with childish delight, pushed the enormous pile of this lout's sins into him.

The crunch was satisfying. The men laughed, shook hands, and congratulated each other.

The pathetic swine began bleating, mewling a pathetic, reedy wail. Even apologizing, as if the time for that had not been years ago, or even decades ago, in the man's childhood. Or even before that, in his conception, or even the moments before, in the forming of his soul, of the very essence of his being. That essence had been rotten, maladapted, ill-formed.

It had gone on to form a crater of a being, an antichrist that could and *would* take down others with his filth, with his slanderous ideas and treasonous ways.

The men took their time cleaning the room, relishing the pathetic wretch's whimpering.
