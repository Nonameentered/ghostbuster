"..can honestly say she was my best friend and to try to do justice right here in this short eulogy will be impossible. She dedicated her life to family and making sure we were supported in whatever we did and that we never felt anything other than loved..." Charlotte continued, reading scribbled words on a paper she repeatedly crumped and uncrumpled.

A small hole had been dug specifically for the urn, and Charlotte lowered it into the grave with extreme care. She touched her little sister for the final time, and shoveled a single pile of dirt onto the urn before stepping back for the rest of the family to shovel their pile on.

Little Tiffany struggled to pick up the heavy shovel, and began sobbing loudly worrying she would upset her now gone mommy. Snot dribbled into her lip and she tasted the gross saltiness as she babbled in grief.

Tiff had dreamt of the event just last night, or her mother erupting in a pillar of fire as a dragon flew overhead. Tiff had ran off the trail to chase a brown fluffy little rabbit with white paws, ears, and a white poof ball tail.

Her mommy had been reduced to ashes; the little poof ball bunny was less-or-more fortunate, surviving with a deep burn to the entire left side of its little body.

Charlotte found Tiff a few hours later, still sobbing in the ashes of her mother, the dead bunny sitting on her lap.

And this was not unique, or surprising, or uncommon. Ogres, orcs, dragons, skeletons, zombies, vampires, ghouls, goblins, imps, and countless other monsters held dominion over the meek and normal humans.

Charlotte reminded herself she was fortunate to even be alive as she helped Tiffany scoop her pile of dirt onto the urn, while supporting the full weight of the spade.
