King Bentley crept through the forest with the rest of his army. The sky was clear this blessed night; the stars and moon glowed, sprinkling grey light through the tree's leaves. Bentley walked in the tracks of one of the catapults, his feet smooshing in the softened dirt.

"Sire, the town has become aware of our presence." General Mackoy spoke quietly.

Bentley looked towards the city wall, about one hundred yards from the forest's cover.

"Alert the men. Stealth is no longer the highest priority. Continue setting up the siege engines." Bentley turned on his heel, continuing in the tracks of the catapult.

Sweat prickled Bentley's neck, his heart raced as he practiced his poker face. He had deuce-seven, but had to maintain a casual pocket aces face. The enormity of the city was truly hitting him for the first time. His men looked so huge in their cave strongholds in the nearby mountain. His measly three thousand could not hope to surround a city that housed millions.

Bentley followed the catapult; the only way was forward.

\---

The city had formed a proper defense by the time Bentley's force set up their engines: one hundred siege engines for a city of eighteen million men, women, and children.

The archers were told to loose, and in the first volley the resistance lost four hundred and sixty two men. General Mackoy took one arrow through his left calf, and a second in the left eye, lodging itself in the back of his skull.

Bentley was spared in the volley, and scrambled backwards on the same catapult trail. He hollered for a fallback.

The rearguard saw and obeyed, and a couple hundred retreated.

The men in the vanguard and their backup galloped to glory.

Volley after volley fell, claiming most of the men and all but eight horses. Boiling oil felled the few men who made it to the wall.

The men who had their senses routed, zig zagging like an ant looking for food to avoid the rain of arrows.

Bentley accepted the tactical retreat, abandoned the equipment, and began scheming his next attack on His City, His Birthright.
