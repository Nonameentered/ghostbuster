Sally's hand clenched around two of Death's fingers as they finish their travels. They stood together on a river bank with murky, red-brown water flowing quite slowly. A number of barges float along. Death keeps his eyes peeled for his ship.

Sally felt tears well up. Emotions swirl within her torso and belly, and she felt very happy and incredibly sad in bursts. The cycle coincided with nausea, entering along with anxiety, and leaving as the elation returned.

"Daddy?" Sally turned to Death. "Daddy, where's Mommy?"

Death barely moved his eyes from the river. He turned his head a few degrees toward her, and regarded her with pity.

"My child, I am sorry. Your mommy and daddy have not yet moved on. They're still waiting on their boat to sail." Death spoke gently, still making sure to keep an eye out for Sally's barge.

"Stop! Frank, please! Please stop!" Olivia screamed at Sally's father.

Sally felt her daddy's hard hands burying into her ribs as he angrily yanked her into the air.

"How could you, Olivia?" Frank spat so loudly the neighbors easily heard. "After all these years? I slaved for you. For both of you! And this is how you repay me? What a waste of my fucking life! Fuck!"

Frank held the object of his anger, a small three year old girl still wearing her yogi bear pajamas. He glared deep into her eyes, hoping to see himself, and yet only seeing another man's sperm.

Sally's last memory was of a filled bathtub.

Death gently tapped Sally on the shoulder.

"It will be time very soon, my child."

Sally wrapped her arms around Death's legs, giving him a good long hug.

"Okay!" Sally burbled happily. "I am going to miss you, daddy. Will you come visit?"

"Yes, my child. I will come. I'll try to bring mommy." The lie rang hollowly from Death's skeleton, yet Sally lapped it up.

"Great!" Sally released her hug and turned to her boat, a simple little rowboat with an orange tabby cat and a corgi with a long tail.

The cat still had the dent in its head from the iron Frank smashed its skull with, and the corgi still had a bullet hole running through its side, its entrails slightly dribbling out of its belly; Sally either didn't notice or didn't mind, and settled in between the two, breathing in the stinky sweetness of her puppy's breath while she stroked her lil kitten.
