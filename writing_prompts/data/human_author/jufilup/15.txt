The dark gray color of the walls blended well with the dark gray color of the threadbare sheets covering the stark white mattress beneath. The dark gray blindfold covering Prisoner 14376 camouflaged effectively with the dark gray of the middle-aged man's jumpsuit, its only personality the rolled up and frayed left sleeve.

The thick padding that surrounded the room bore a deep black hue, aiding in the permanent silence. The "floor", such as it was, consisted of a fluid-like material, several feet deep, that caused the man to float, giving him a weightless feeling. He was caressed by a ghost and swaddled in its loving arms.

Patrick nodded at the doorman on the way to his shift. He tipped his cap with the hand not holding his coffee, and let out his little customary sigh that accompanied these twelve-hour guard shifts.

Patrick sat in his recliner with his coffee and donut in hand, ready to wait out his twelve hours.

The long vegetable prisoner lay on his back, his mighty lungs fighting to provide oxygen to a long unresponsive noggin.

Patrick asked the customary questions, the only lapse in the sensory deprivation: identification questions, then if he'd like to be released.

The cucumber did not answer. A thick glob of drool piled by his jaw, slowly mixing with the floor's fluid as the days meander on.

Having finished the questions, and thus, the work for his shift, Patrick kicked his feet up on his desk and leaned back, getting settled in good and comfy for his nap.
