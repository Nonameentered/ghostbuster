John, along with Trevor and George, grunted as they heaved the thin tree trunk upright. They lifted it in the air for a moment, John struggling to see where the post hole was dug, before slamming the wood deep into the earth.

John took his spot to the side of the stage, and George and Trevor rejoined the audience.

George and Trevor busied themselves with dinner, pulling out little sandwiches wrapped in parchment paper, small bags of crisps and bottles of cold Coca Cola, still sweating from their stay in the cold river.

George and Trevor made small talk, laughing along with their friends as they prepared for the event. George finished quickly; Trevor licked his fingers clean as the show began.

John cleared his throat on stage, and began going through the traditions. Long speech after long speech was given, ended with a common prayer, and then several more prayers.

John steadily crescendoed through the entire meeting, until by the end he was screeching, his face beet red, his hands clenched into tight fists.

And then they brought her out, comically adorned in a white gown, as if she was off to her wedding. She had clearly been crying, her puffy face blotchy red.

She looked at the ground in resignation, keeping her eyeballs trained at the point between her feet. She barely felt the shackles around her wrists and ankles.

John moved along with critical precision, the John Wayne of his own movie. He aided in fastening the woman to the thin tree trunk, aided in praying with her (she stayed silent), helped pile the brindle and sticks, poured on a little precious lighter fluid.

John finished his speech to the tune of raucous applause, many audience members screaming prayers, staying far away from the woman so that the devil rubbed off on them less.

John looked at the praise, and felt truly exalted, one of Godâ€™s chosen few, brought to bring justice to the wicked.

John lit a ceremonial torch, and howling into the night, dipped the torch into her body.
