Old Pat Harknuckle picked up the meal tray and began the long trek. He descended the forty-three levels, used his key card, finger prints, and eyeballs at various checkpoints, as the lukewarm meal chilled.

Pat's retirement age had long passed, but he kept puttering on, with calm persistence making his way throughout the concrete structure. Upon arrival to the single cell, Pat rang the dinner bell, a sort of joke that began with one of the last ones, and silently slid the meal tray through the reinforced metal slot.

The thing did not turn to regard Pat.

"Pat Elroy Harknuckle, look at what you've done!" Pat's mother rose her voice, tears welling up in her eyes. The little runty cat that hung around their garage had a large gash in it's forehead, a rock sat nearby with a dash of red. The cat lay limp.

Pat's mother gave Pat a funny look before a very mean look. Her eyes twitched, her lips pursed to nearly a line, she looked ready to yell and scream and hit him.

Pat made water, beginning to burble, tears streaking down his little fat face.

Pat's mother turned away, leaving him to clean himself up.

Pat tried to pull himself back. Why was he here? What was his task. The tray. Bring the tray, the thing must eat. It must eat some food, some tasty food. But where? Where is its food? Oh, right, the food must be on my keychain, not this key, or this one, but this one! One big tasty key coming up, right on the tray, sprinkled with love! Haha, no really, enjoy your din-

A fist with terrible force crumpled Old Pat's face, he slammed into the wall beside him, and crumpled to the ground like a bag of broken sticks.

And It emerged, picking up Pat's eyes, card, and fingers, and continuing. It's beautiful horn sprouted from its forehead, it's elegant tail fluttered in the breeze, it's hooved and horse like body strangely erotic.

It broke into a gallop. It longed to return home.
