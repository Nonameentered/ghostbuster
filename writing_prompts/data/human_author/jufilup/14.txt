“In purgatory, souls must be cleansed of their sins before moving into the grace of God. We must be cleaned before we can be presented before Our Father.”

If that was the case, Ian thought, how is this atonement?

Ian regarded his duplicate, who was also sitting cross legged on the milky floor.

And if it was atonement, who was atoning? The Other felt just as certain that his soul was being cleansed and he would surely enter Eternity.

“Hi.” The other said.

“Uh, hi.” Ian spoke to himself.

“Um..” the clone looked awkwardly at Ian before focusing his gaze on the ground. He spoke to Ian like he was a broken, lost puppy. He spoke as if he was trying to figure out the exact right words to say so he could move on to his Lord.

He couldn’t think of what to say, and faltered for a while to think before lapsing into a very long silence.
