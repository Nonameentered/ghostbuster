"-and thanks again for sharing with us, Mr. Jefferson. Do we have anyone next? Mm, hmm, oh, um, you, sir, come on up here." The opaque specter bowed very slightly before taking his leave of the podium, sitting in a chair on the side of the stage, sipping his water bottle.

"Thanks, Ray. Well, I don't really have a lot to say. Just the same things again. I miss Martha. I honestly can't believe that she slipped through, and James too! Really, how could they? They're on Wikipedia, for God's sake! Someone must have had them on their mind. Someone must have." George heard a little throat clearing in the audience, simply a man with a dry larynx. George reined himself up. "Oh, I'm sure you've all heard this quite enough. I don't want to bore you any longer."

George walked haughtily to the exit, glaring down his nose at the throat-clearing menace, who looked quite stunned by the abrupt exit.

"That is not all!" George barged back in, the metal doors squeaking inwards. "I just want to say that this is so God damned unfair. How has this happened to *us*? Particularly us and not the historic men and women of the past, before we could write it all. Look at that, right over there! That man is who we all will be, in a few thousand years, just absolutely batshit. Or nonexistent. Truly a lesser of two evils here."

George finished his speech behind the podium again, yet now seemed content to take a seat in the theater audience and finish off the weekly meeting.

The man George beckoned did not indicate being acknowledged. Tutankhamun curled in the fetal position, his one muscular frame and straight back reduced to a twisted mass of no more than one hundred pounds. Drool dripped into a steadily growing puddle. His snow globe eyes gaze into his future, always hanging at a downturned angle.

"Okay, so who would like to go next?" A few hands raised in the air.
