The rats scurried around the corner just in time, such that Angela could only glimpse a flicker of movement, a wormy wave of shade as their tails dipped out of sight.

The gentleman (or woman) in the dark suit continued gently nocking, though Angela somehow knew his (or her) patience was waning. Angela abruptly deeply inhaled lavender, very briefly recalling her university's garden, the lavender, gardenias, tulips, and daisies.

Angela whirled around to face the man she felt gripping her left shoulder. The room stood empty, though the ghostly imprints of touch lingered. She patted her shoulder, reminding herself of baseline tactile sensations.

The gentle knocking continued.

"Hello, ma'am? Just a few questions for ya." The man, Jessica was now certain, had a positively golden aura about him. Silky, chocolatey, sweetness dripped from his lips, slowly rolling down his crisp black suit, leaving red-brown streaks down the fabric.

The empty medicine bottle on the counter made a little joke, some little quip Angela could not quite make out but was certain was targeted at her. Her heart rate escalated, and the cyclical thoughts spun.

Why are they making fun of me? Why are they laughing at me? Who are they? Why are they out to get me? Occasional creeping thoughts of their reality creep in, only to be shoved down in the frantic fit of the present, of this fear and anxiety and this deep knowing that you are being watched. Judged. Observed. Scrutinized. Picked apart and put back together, again and again.

The knocking, though still gentle, escalated in pace.

"No," Angela spoke the single word and began her process.

Five deep breaths, four counts on each step, eyes closed (trying to ignore the little squigglies in your mind, the little faces that form and disappear, tip: don't focus on them: stare straight ahead). She felt herself stop careening. Her left hand lunged out, gripping the handrail, and she stopped plunging downward into the infinite staircase.

Angela opened her eyes, her heart rate approaching standard levels.

The medicine seemed to apologize for his earlier snide comment. The knocking became more and more gentle, farther and farther away, until it stopped.

Yet, the bastion lasts for only a moment.

Angela whipped her head to the left, barely missing the rats, seeing their tail's shadows flickering from behind the corner, hearing their chirps and squeaks.

A gentle knock at the door sounded.

"Hullo, ma'am." The voice spoke softly. "A word with ya, if ya don't mind ma'am?"
