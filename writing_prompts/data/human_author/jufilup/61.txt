The cockroach skittered between potential meals: some cheetoh crumbs, some old dried salsa, several sugary drink spills. The roach was joined by a few friends as they combed the great lands for sustenance to feed their progeny.

Matt snorted and coughed in his sleep, though the apnea did not wake him. Gold coins interlaced within his mattress dug into his leathery flesh. Aside from the treasure hidden within his mattress, Matt had a number of personal affects that would be worth a sizeable quantity to any interested collector: half a dozen boxes of old pizza, eight jars of high grade dragon-human piss, piles of empty mountain dew two liters, a mountain of take out trash, primarily from Panda Express, though with a small smattering of many fast food joints.

Matt took care of his treasures, occasionally dusting off the old pizza slices. He appreciated the scavengers who picked the treasures clean of their rot.

The alarm clock went off with a harsh breep, and Matt turned it off in one swift motion. Matt snoozed as the roaches crawling across his belly finished their meals. Several ate a long swipe of cheetoh crumbs, when Matt had been too lazy to wash his hands. A few more tried to slurp some sugar from a doctor pepper spill near Matt's lapel.

A gentle knock came from the door: bum, bum, badum, bum.

Matt struggled to sit up in his reclining chair, the damn thing was practically broken.

Matt opened the door to protests from the hinges.

"Hello, sir. How are you today?" The pizza delivery boy's face looked funny, and he kept stealing glances at Matt's belly, to his army of cockroaches scurrying around looking for food. The boy stifled gags as the apartment smell flooded from the room: a pungent aroma consisting of old cats and rotting food.

"Doing fine."

"Signature, please, sir." His outstretched hand held a receipt.

Matt stiffed the boy before taking his pizza.

After his shift, the pizza boy called adult protective services on Matt, concerned for his wellbeing, certain he was being neglected by his family in his old age.

Matt bellowed in anger when the social worker showed up, expecting a potentially mentally disabled old man and instead getting a thirty-something half dragon-man.

"It's okay, sonny. We have resources to help." The stupid old bag had said, and Matt seethed.

"I don't need help! This is me! This is how I am supposed to be!" Matt had screamed at the stupid cunt before slamming the door shut.

Matt sat down on his couch, ready to settle back into Always Sunny. He watched the cockroaches on his belly, and imagined them as Mac and Dennis and Charlie, just some boys up to their hijinks.

Matt smiled as he sat in his fortress.
