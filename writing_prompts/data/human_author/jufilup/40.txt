Justin took off his airpods as he heard the muttering.

"Please wake up. Let us go from your dream." Jessica was mumbling, looking over her left shoulder as her hands continued typing on her laptop.

The chorus was taken up by the other students, some of them speaking aloud normally, some whispering, all peering towards the same door.

Justin saw in his periphery his study mate, Brad was also mumbling and staring. Feeling like a trapped child, Justin kept his gaze fixed firmly on the wall in front of him, certain if he looked at Brad, Brad would snap. He'd bar his teeth, revealing long, thick fangs, and bury them deep into Justin's supple neck.

Justin put back in his airpods and headed to the direction of the exit, avoiding eye contact while he turned up Cristofori's Dream, one of his favorite study numbers.

Justin passed a number of students staring in the direction he continued in. The wind itself pushed him, as if an explosion occurred miles away, and the rush of hot, compressed air was gently urging him to safety.

They led him to the men's room, where the air grew distinctly cooler. A student stared towards the solitary sink, currently running hot water.

Justin approached the sink and dipped his hands in the water automatically, reaching to the soap dispenser to grab a squirt.

He lathered between his fingers in a wringing motion, before looking up into the mirror above the sink.

Suddenly, he felt his lips contort, felt them move slowly as he stared at his own bloodshot eyes, sick bags of coal dragging the skin beneath his hollow sockets.

"Please wake up. Let us go from your dream." Justin could not hear over his airpods, yet he grabbed at his mouth with his still soapy hands, wrenching his body back into his own control.

His mouth continued contorting and fighting, speaking the words it must speak. In the commotion of gripping his lips and jaw as he continued his new speech, Justin casually snipped the tip of one of his pointer fingers at the last joint.

Justin turned a few digits shorter to see his classmates, several teachers, and the principal standing in the doorway, staring at him.

"Please wake up. Let us go from your dream."

Justin felt his own lips move along with them, felt the words echo through his jaw bones to the flesh near his ear and into his brain, where it was processed rapidly, where Justin understood, and tried as hard as he could.

Justin collapsed against the wall, sitting with his knees pulled right up to his chest.

His peers continued their chant. Please. Please wake up. Please let us go.

I'm trying. Justin thought as he chanted. I promise I'm trying.
