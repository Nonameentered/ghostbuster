A bolt of lightning abruptly spiked down on top of Tim’s head, frying him. Luther turned his eyes too late, and the flash briefly blinded him.

Then the hail, bowling ball sized rocks that bludgeoned without a care.

Luther witnessed several men smashed to bits as he ran towards his home, to save his wife.

Luther took a quick shower and headed to clean up a local hotel.
