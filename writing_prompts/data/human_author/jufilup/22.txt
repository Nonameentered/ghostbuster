"Okay, everyone's finally here, even Clyde." Sean lowered his voice while cracking a small smile toward Clyde, in a not-serious-but-serious kind of way. Just rude to make your friends wait half an hour. "Anyway, let's settle in!" 

Sean bustled around, playing the gracious host. He grabbed everyone a fresh beer, and a round of six sthpocks filled the room as he removed the bottle caps. He topped off the table with a few bowls of chips, some small tins of dip, and some pizza and wings.

And finally, Sean took his seat at the head of the table in front of all of the dungeon master material while Clyde took the only other empty seat, making small talk with Anthony, Emily, Melanie, and Andrew.

The quest continued where it had been, where it had always been, in a way.

Of course, first, the notes of the last session were read so that the team could remember the gist of the situation, most food eating occurred during this segment. Then, as is tradition, a few minutes of arguing about the minutia of how the session would continue today ensued.

Last week had ended on a cliffhanger where Anthony and Emily were in a precarious position. They had tried to steal some treasure from a dragon. The dragon woke up. Their position was that Sean should be generous.

"Bro, I've had Murphy Poopface since I was eight years old. Please, go easy on him. He's grandfathered in." Anthony made a few compelling arguments. Emily didn't care much either way; she talked with Melanie about some neighborhood drama.

Sean was honestly joking around. It wasn't supposed to be a big deal.

Sean's mind leaped back to his youth, creeping down in his pajamas that clung to his toes to see what the yelling was about.

Daddy was yelling. Loud. Daddy was yelling and stumbling, his collar upturned, his sleeves rolled up, his belt hanging around his neck. He opened and closed his fists, occasionally laughing at what he said, for he had some witty cantor.

The energy rises to a boil, a fist lashes out, and mama is on the ground screaming. Screaming like cornered prey suddenly conscious of the locked doors in this home. Her heart fluttered with fear.

The look in her eye must have been enough; daddy stopped. He took several stuttering deep breaths as he came to comfort her, but the dumb bitch kicked and slapped his helping hands away. She eventually stopped struggling as he embraced her tightly in a bear hug, whispering in a chocolatey sweet tone "I was just joking, baby. Come on. I was just joking."

It had never been a joke. It never was a joke.

And it wasn't a joke to Anthony when Sean did not go easy on them. The dragon had been slated to be nearly an instakill to anyone unlucky enough to be caught. They had been warned at the cave entrance.

As he explained this to Anthony, Sean felt a childlike glimmer in his eyes, that little glow achieved from toying with another's mind. 

Anthony rolled a sixty-four. The dragon burnt him to a crisp.

Piles of papers fluttered throughout the room, plastic figurines clattered to the floor, stacks of dice rolled to form a number with incalculable odds, the folding card table was upturned, bowls of snacks flew upwards like confetti, pizza boxes fell to the ground with a cardboard thunk, Anthony continued rioting throughout the living room, mourning the loss of Murphy Poopface, and mourning more.

Mourning his mom, his pops, Shannon and her warmth, her touch. Mourning his dogs and cats, the coworkers he liked, and the ones he didn't. Mourning his friends, as Andrew lay in his cot by the side of the table, letting shuddering wheezes squeeze out of his body, knowing he was not long for this world.

Sean also mourned his other friends, those he used to play dungeons and dragons with, along with Andrew. Sean mourned Emily and Melanie, with their constant gossip. Sean so badly missed Clyde, and he knew there would be many sleepless nights spent thinking about Andrew after he finishes rotting away.

Sean even missed Anthony, even though he threw a big tantrum last time they played. Sean remembered he needed to call him to make him clean up this mess, as he looked around his demolished living room, Andrew wheezed his final wheezes on his cot.

The smell of freshly dug earth filled Sean's nostrils.

"Here." Andrew handed Sean a water bottle chilled from the nearby river. Andrew began gulping his bottle, leaning on his spade.

They finished piling the dirt into the hole in silence.

Sean felt like he should say something more, but he didn't know what to say.

"I'll miss you, Anthony." Sean clenched his fist. Andrew nodded quietly at the sentiment and they stood together a few more minutes before leaving.

Sean blinked, remembering. Andrew lay in his cot, a sickly yellow color, wheezing his constant groan.

Tears filled Sean's eyes as he crouched by Andrew's bed, laying his head on his chest, the rivers flowed.

"I miss them so bad, Andrew." Sean whimpered. "I really do, man. I can't take this shit."

Andrew wheezed assent.

Sean fell asleep in Andrew's lap after crying himself out.
