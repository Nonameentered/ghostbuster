Neil took off the flour-caked apron and hung it on the same hook his pappy before him hung his upon. He washed his hands, the flour clinging to his fingers like a lover, which he peeled off in thick clumps that fell to the bottom of the bason, clouding the water.

The babes were long in bed, Helen surely along with them.

Neil felt the cold ache in the heart that accompanies loneliness on a late night. Often, when that ache came, that little nausea in the pit of his stomach, he'd struggle not to wake Helen.

What would he say? *Hey, hon. I'm just feeling down, for no reason in particular.*

Oh, honey. I'm sorry. She'd pat his back. What has got your goat, babe?

*Oh, I don't know. I'm just having a rough go at it right now.*

And the conversation would fizzle out and Helen would go back to bed, feeling annoyed. There needs to be a reason, in particular, to wake a woman at two in the morning.

So instead Neil lay in bed next to her, staying at the ceiling in the dark, his arm resting on her thigh, or sometimes her rump. And he gazed deeply into his heart, his mind, hoping to find an answer to the cold ache.

Why did he feel incomplete? Why did he feel a small sadness at night when all the cards were dealt in his favor?

A loving family, a well-paid career that he didn't mind too much, and of course, that was enough. Who expected to love their career?

Then what itched his brain? What clawed his dopamine, making him feel as displaced as a brick among cobblestone from a particularly lazy repairman?

Where could he recover it? What could repair his happiness?

He gently slapped his face, grinning a sly grin.

No more questions for today, Neil. He told himself. We've spoken to ourself enough. We will learn these things. We will get better. For now, we must prepare.

Neil popped the top off a bottle of beer and put on a long, heavy woolen coat.

He strode outside to do a few hours of preparatory work. Hell's winter was mere days away.

Neil had much the same conversation the next day, when Helen and the babes fell asleep early again.
