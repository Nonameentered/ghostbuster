It was all Jay could do to not erupt as he slowly trudged forward in the line. Elijah and Kaitlyn were running around the line divider, each trying to be the fastest. They’d occasionally glance back at their mom and dad, who’d give a brief smile or utterly ignore them respectively.

“Here you go, sir. God bless.” A Hispanic woman said to Jay, pushing a burlap sack full of grocery staples into his hands, as the line continued to snake on.

Jay’s wife, Deborah, Elijah, and Kaitlyn had the gall to act excited on the way home, spitting on Jay’s efforts as a provider. It was just never enough. Kaitlyn burbled about finally eating chocolate, the first time in weeks. Jay clenched the steering wheel tighter, his eyes burrowing a hole into Kaitlyn’s skull. 

A note was left on the coffee table: “That farmer named Harper from down the road felled some trees, and is sharing the spoils. Your share is under the tarp in the back.”

Deborah grinned, fighting tears back as she read the note of generosity. Jay ground his teeth.

Deb hastily prepared a lovely meal with the borrowed wood, food, and some candles to set the mood as the sun set.

Deb, Kaitlyn, and Elijah smiled, laughed, and ate, occasionally trying to get Jay to join in and eat.

Jay sat in silence, staring at his food and ruminating on how the house is split 60/40 in Deb’s favor due to her greater contribution, and he was being taken for a ride.
