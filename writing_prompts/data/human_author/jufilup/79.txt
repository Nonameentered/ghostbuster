Charlie perspired compulsively, thick globs of sweat trickling from his receding hairline down his back to his plumbers ass. He picked up his glass of water, taking a tiny sip, setting it down, glancing towards the door nervously, and repeating the dance.

Thirty minutes after seven, Charlie pulls out tinder, making sure he organized the time right.

“Sorry, Charlie, something came up tonight. I can’t make it. We’ll have to meet up some other time!” Charlie stared at his phone in disbelief. This bitch texted him at 6:58, two minutes before she was to arrive.

“Fuck!” Charlie hissed, pulling out his booklets of info. The quest was for a party of four, with him of course playing dungeon master. This stupid bitch ruined it, Charlie went through his notes in a flurry, changing lines to reference four people into referencing three people. He practiced many major key speeches again.

He didn’t look up from his practice until about 8:30, when he was surprised to still sit alone.

Charlie wisely packed up his kit, and mosied on home.
