A bucket sat in the corner of the dank cell. A cobweb adorned the left corner of the cell, by the cell door.

The floor was composed of concrete with a layer of dirt and then hay on top. Early on, Angus piled the hay in a corner, disgusted by the bugs among the brambles.

The next morning, his back spoke otherwise, and now the hay sits in a mound, approximately mattress shape.

Other than that, Angus has only his thoughts, and those decrease daily.

Angus tracked his time via the wall, 1 tally for each “day”. His feeding seemed erratic; he guessed every 2-3 meals was 1 day, but truly had no idea.

And yet, this is what it takes. This is what will save the world.

Angus grimaced, turning forty five degrees to look at one of his favorite cracks in the wall. He had scratched it out over the years, into the logo that once represented him.

A large A with three claw marks dragging vertically down the vowel. That mark symbolized Angus, and was still branded to his left ass cheek.

Angus admired the symbol, later that evening sleeping on his little hay mat.

And it all began again the next day.
