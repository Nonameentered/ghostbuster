"Psst," The smoke whispered. "Psst. Hey, kid! Over here."

Samantha Curly skipped over to the vase shaped like an S. S for Samantha. She was excited to inherit it from her daddy some day.

"You wanna play a game, Sammy?" The smoke spoke in a high pitched squeak.

Sammy glanced quickly around the room, then out into the hallway. She silently closed the hallway door, and returned to her smoke.

"Sure!" Sammy said, giving a little giggle.

Sammy's eyes clamped closed, along with her mouth and nose. Stitches interlaced her orifices and she collapsed to the floor, her legs uncurling like ribbons. Her fingertips and toes grew fat until they exploded, spewing pus. The smoky vase gave large, room shaking cracks, as Sammy's father pounded on the door.

Daddy split the door with an X of white hot flame, which ignited a large collection of tomes on the far side of the office.

Sammy's father entered the room just as Sammy rose again, her eyes blood red caverns.

"Nice of you to join us, Hector." Sammy's voice reverberated in Hector's chest, deep, middle toned, and high pitched at the same time, as if she were speaking with multiple octaves.

Hector raised his staff in his right hand, gripped his magical orb in his left hand, drawing the energy from it to aid in his cast.

A cascade of natural disasters rained on Sammy, each more harrowing than the last. A tsunami was followed by a wildfire, which was followed by a plague, then a famine. Sammy's body withered and adapted to the times, standing stoic with its blood red eyes.

Eventually, Sammy lifted a single finger, and Hector's head popped like a water balloon, the contents falling to the floor with a droopy, slow sadness.
