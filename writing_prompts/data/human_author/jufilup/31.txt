"Hey, bro, isn't that Lucy?"

George squinted across the bar, peering through the strobing red, yellow, blue, and green lights at the woman sitting at the bar with her girlies.

*I'll promise to love you always. I'm your forever girl, right?*

George felt the hot bile of anger flush up his throat as he turned to the bartender to order another drink, slamming the shot fast, hoping the watery feeling eases the pain.

*Forever and ever, George. I can already imagine us dying together, one of us in the other's arms, in a little retirement home, or still in our family home.*

During their several-year relationship, George held onto these feelings too, utterly certain they'd make it through the entire marathon to the finish line. But feelings seem so fickle.

Abruptly, years seemed to fly by as George went to work and returned home, and somehow Lucy slowly, gradually, like sand through an hourglass, slipped away.

And George could not turn over the hourglass; he could not try again.

*Look, George. I'm sorry. I really think we need to move on. You can do better than me, and I think we both need some time to grow as individuals.*

George didn't understand then, didn't understand the fear in Lucy's mind. He didn't understand the constant ticking inside her brain, the constant worry of things going wrong, of alternate realities that could conflict, where she needed to have certainty of the future.

George seemed unable to convince her of that certainty. The conversation sputtered out like a rusty beater.

So Lucy moved on, yet she still maintained the same childhood friend group.

The injustice of it all propelled George away from most women, stricken badly by trust issues for the rest of his life.

He eventually met a new Lucy, another woman he could spend his life with.

Instead, he didn't give her the time of day, certain she was fucking with him.
