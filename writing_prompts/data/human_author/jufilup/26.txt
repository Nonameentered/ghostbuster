The lab geeks were having an incredibly rough day.

Their superior, Urk-Zonoth, abruptly warped into their work quarters and set them with the task of calculating when the full moon would turn their seven units of werewolves into their true form. This information was of the utmost importance and secrecy, as it was essential to choose a proper battle time.

The headaches began quickly. Middle management assured the geeks that their desire for several weeks to months was first impossible, and second not needed, and they better figure this shit out if they want to go home tonight.

So, the team crunched numbers but with so much to account for.

First, the moon becomes full approximately every month (between twenty-nine and thirty days). That is all well and good on Earth, where you can simply look up at the sky, take a drag of your cigarette, and nod to your buddy as you acknowledge that it is a full moon, before going back to more important things, like browsing your phone.

So a team of geeks began working out how to manage Earth time when you are not on Earth.

Which led to more problems that deal with the structure of time itself.

How does one calculate between different timescales formed via different gravitational spheres?

Of course, as all of the geeks knew, when gravity is stronger, spacetime is curved more, which causes time itself to slow down (in comparison to areas of weaker gravity). This time dilation must be accounted for, as the battle would likely occur far from any stars, where the gravity pulls at you with the gentleness of a lover's caress.

Urk-Zonoth's eyes glazed over early on in this description. He barked to the geeks to hurry up and turned on his heels (actually a collection of four tentacles, but the movement was similar) before sliming away.

Urk-Zonoth didn't even make it for one of the most confounding variables: velocity. The velocity of an object affects its experience of time. As many of us know, no object can exceed the speed of light (relative to another object, or relative to space itself). An object experiences time slower as the object goes faster (See: Lightyear).

Interestingly, even objects relative to each other *cannot* exceed the speed of light, which takes the geeks several days to factor into the calculations.

You see, boss, if objects go too close to the speed of light, we have to throw out the regular equations and instead use the special equations we use when dealing with huge speeds.

You see, boss, even if one spaceship is traveling upward (what is up in space, Urk-Zonoth thinks), and the other travels downward, both going three-quarters the speed of light, they won't be moving relative to each other at one and a half speed of lights, they will instead move relative to each other at--

Urk-Zonoth only has the patience of any average man.

The seven werewolf units are canned. Urk-Zonoth is unfortunately demoted for budget wastage.
