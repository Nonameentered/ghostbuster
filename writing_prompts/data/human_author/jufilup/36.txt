The little boys and girls still took a fieldtrip to where Edgar Ellen Chancey was defeated. They'd stand atop his grave and read the inscription, still etched into solid copper, oxidized to now be a blue-green like The Statue of Liberty.

The Ceremony, now four hundred years ago, took place at dawn, as the first light of the sun scratched through the tree branches. The small prison carriage turned from a dim gray to a pale red as the sun lit the scene. The cart had several miles more to travel. Horses plodded through the sand with a clomping desperation; though somewhat adapted for the dunes, each footfall sent sand sprinting away in all directions.

At the site of the Ceremony, the copper plinth had already been risen and inscribed, marking the crimes and deeds of Edgar Ellen Chancey, and why he must perish.

The morning of the event had challenged Edgar's version with a kafka-esque force. Edgar questioned if he was going crazy. Many times along the journey, and now, even, as he languishes, Edgar closes his eyes, praying to wake up, thinking in his brain he is ready now.

Someone posited humans repeat about ninety five percent of their thoughts. By now, deep in the folds of Edgar's brain nearly into his skull, the feeling of his eyes trying to open etched itself, along with the lucid dreaming effect of knowing you are dreaming, of knowing you must awaken.

The police had broken in around three in the morning. Edgar had been sleeping with his corgi, Luci.

The police put a single bullet in Luci, though she only moved to look at the men as they stormed in, mild mannered to the end.

Edgar had been booked and to see his lawyer before six a.m. The lawyer had little good advice in the four minute meeting.

The trial occurred at six-thirty, the judge made his final gavel slam by six forty-two.

And he was chained into the prison carriage.

And that was when it happened, when suddenly he just knew, as you always knew in a dream.

He knew he was immortal. He understood he was not going to his death, but to his life. He was approaching eternal life.

Then the struggling began, first physically, marring his wrists with deep cuts from the metal shackles around his wrists.

After understanding the true futility, and realizing that he was not on his way to the gallows or the guillotine, came the old mantra.

He promised himself this must be a dream, how else could he know he was immortal? How would any of this at all make sense?

Edgar stopped struggling and focused, peering deep into his skull. He reached for his eye muscles, trying to feel his real eye muscles and open those; not these fake eyes, these eyes that only see a small wooden coffin scraping up a desert.

His real eyes for some reason would not open. He simply couldn't manage it, though the ethereal, lucid dreamy feeling continued.

Edgar tried to summon things. Thinking of lucid dreams of his past, he attempted to summon Annie Cartwright, one of the hotties from English class, wearing only her cheerleader outfit.

Annie didn't appear. Only the understanding that this was a dream served as evidence for Edgar. Only the firm understanding and belief that Edgar must hold onto as desperately as a man to a life preserver would sustain him, would help him go forward, certain that it must end.

Edgar would awaken soon. He must. It would be morning, mommy would be ready to take him to seventh grade. He'd see his daddy and sister. His little corgi's stinky breath would fill his face, and he'd clench him tight, tearing up as he remembered this scary dream.

Edgar was still holding onto these blessed hopes, these treasures which helped him pass through the nights and days and nights as the little boys and girls read the inscription of his crimes above.
