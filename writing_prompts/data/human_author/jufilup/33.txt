Ted Donahue was the eighth person to go missing in Shoyo, Indiana in half as many weeks.

Hunched over so as to not spill his barbeque sauce, George (hor-hay) ate sloppily at Ted's calf and thigh, slathered in his homemade barbeque after slow roasting outside.

He stopped midway through to secure the bandage holding his faux skin to his leathery corpse; he'd have to change the entire set shortly. Thankfully his diet requires him to acquire large quantities of skin.

*Give me a call, mijo.* His mother's tranquil voice punched through the sweet and spicy flavor of the barbeque sauce, and he suddenly felt sick.

George arrived at the bathroom just in time to dry heave in front of the toilet for the next minute or so (who knew zombies couldn't puke, guess the muscles just didn't work).

After, George ran his hand up his chest, feeling the caverns between his ribs, the full lack of nutrition, of life in his flesh. The old set of skin cracked like sandpaper, and George promised himself to moisturize with this new set of skin, just after he finished dinner.

So weak.. no energy. Must consume something.

*But what if they find you?*

George whipped his head around, fear mounting in his chest. His heart pounded as he prepared to confront the demon who had entered the room, the dark, creeping force that sets your hair on ends, that sucks the warmth from the air, and creates a light, harmless static before crashing down with lightning sent by the fury of God, himself.

The room was empty.

*And who will be next? We knew Ted, man. Who is next?*

"I did *not* know Ted Donahue!" George screamed at no one and everyone.

*Well, sure, not* know *know. But you knew him; saw him around. Had algebra with him in eighth grade, both such bright fucking students, hmm?* It taunted George, jeering at the freak.

"I didn't know him.." George sobbed as he stared at the floor, having fallen to his knees.

He very slowly crawled to Ted's still warm thigh, hoping It wouldn't notice.

It didn't seem to notice, George slopped up most of the remains of Ted's left calf. He polished off the night with a long, long, very, extra, long drag of a vodka bottle, followed by an entire blunt, just to himself.

The voices quieted, yet George's night had already been poisoned.

He made the slow creeping walk into the cellar and approached the fridge still holding most of Ted.

Four days, if you're patient, Georgie. Maybe three.

Then *We* must go out again. We must... hunt.

*Who will be next?* The question held less jaunt, it now felt like a pleasant ice breaker, like an inside joke to another prisoner of the human mind.

"Where would you like to eat?" George asked Jessica as she entered his car.

"Surprise me." Jessica winked.

Her body stripped itself in front of George. The clothes flew apart, followed by the skin, slipping off with the satisfying smack of a doctor's glove. Next the bones, muscles, and tissues separated and divided into a beautiful spread, the most prime charcuterie board in the known world.

George blinked and she reappeared, still giving him the same playful grin. George salivated.

"You got it." George winked back.
