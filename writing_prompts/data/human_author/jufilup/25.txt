Wood splintered as the gate cracked and shuddered under the consistent blows of the battering ram that crunched the aged crisscrossed layers of oak wood planks.

Body parts flew overhead, flung by catapults crafted specifically for the battle. The arms, legs, hands, fingers, eyeballs, teeth, flesh, and inner organs scattered the few kilometers nearest the city's walls, where the slum, Dustpot Alley lay.

The inner rings of the city had thinner walls of separation from Dustpot Alley; the beggars, the sick and infirm, the elderly and the feeble, the weak of mind and the grotesques would be the first to fall. They'd have the pleasure of being the first men, women, and children to experience the horror of mass looting.

Many of the poorest would drink blood ale with their family if the city fell, a much more merciful fate than the sword or a brazen, frothing at the mouth man.

In the next inner ring, tucked safely behind a separate wall, well separated from the gore of the flung bodies, King Claude sat and sipped his tea.

Claude had exchanged some of his remaining copper coins for the hot cup of brown which went down tasting of mud, gritty on his tongue and teeth. He schlopped his tongue through his mouth for the next several minutes, like his dog used to when given peanut oil.

He checked occasionally for the canteen of blood ale at his hip, never wanting to be caught unawares.

It was a reassurance, a little nod, an acknowledgment.

*Yup, it is still there. I will be safe. I will not be tortured for this little rebellion.* The tears dripped down his nose abruptly. *I'll see Kaitlyn again.*

At that realization, Claude quickly grasped his hip flask and undid the cork.

Half of the fluid was down his gullet before he realized his mistake.

*Kaitlyn wouldn't have wanted this. She wouldn't want me to abandon my people. To let my flock suffer the fate of rabid warriors.*

He stopped guzzling too late, and though his liver fought the good fight, he slowly turned a sickly yellow, his breath fading to a soft rattle.

His corpse was not given a second glance. Merely another suicide victim piled into the mass grave the new King ordered dug for cowards.

The bodies were burned, which forbade their souls from entering The Green Beyond.

Claude never saw Kaitlyn again.
