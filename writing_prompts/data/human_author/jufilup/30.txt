The curve of her breast led Clyde’s eyes gently down the small plump of her stomach, over her soft, rounded hips where they stayed, fixated on the spot between her thighs.

The brief moment gone, Clyde turned back to collecting the village’s garbage as she turned away. Clyde watched her hips sway sweetly in his periphery, though no one would have seen him stare, and oh how he wanted to stare.

The days, weeks, months crawl by. Clyde stealing peaking glances of this goddess with her breasts. With her eyes, and her soft, warm, tan skin, her eyebrows. Her hands. He dreamt of how it would feel, to touch a woman. To be touched by a woman.

His route revolved primarily around her, making sure to drop by her house several times a day.

Surely she would notice him too, soon. She’d approach and say something, probably about how she had been thinking much the same thoughts. They’d start a family of pointy ear little babies.

Clyde held onto those thoughts as he changed the village trash each day, never vocalizing the desire.

He died at the age of sixty-seven, still alone, blaming women for being bitches who only get with guys who treat them like shit.
