"The rules are simple. Win condition: survive, make a family, be happy, pursue hobbies, eat good food, exist. Lose condition: die. The time limit on the game: two years."

The proclamation became a common meme in the two years that followed, with the younger generations marking on their calendar when the day would be so they could josh them like they joshed the Mayans.

And yet, when the day finally came, the host continued the charade, though with a darker tone this time.

"Game number two. The rule are simple. Win condition: kill six living beings with a heartbeat; plants do not count. Lose condition: die. The time limit on the game: one month."

Timothy stared at the ground, his face reddening as his mother berated him. Bile gradually filled the bottom of his throat as his mother continued screaming, lambasting the ridiculousness of this internet fad.

The little duckling sat at Timothy's feet, a red smashed pile of flesh interlaced with bright yellow plumage.

"I fucking told you, Frank!" Tim's mom, Heather, spat. "I told you we needed to take this seriously! This is everywhere, all over the news and at his school, and you've seen the videos! You've seen the people torturing cats, or selling live kittens, rodents, bunnies! I mean, fuck, did you see pet sales of mice skyrocketed after the 'game' was announced!"

Frank's flushed face was still as he stared at Heather's top lip, quivering with anger as she dressed him down. Frank personally had hunted at least six animals this month, yet he could not keep the contempt from showing on his face as he regarded Timothy.

He couldn't meet heather's eyes as he ushered Timothy aside to wash the crimson stains away. He gave Timothy a little talk about hunting and respecting life. Timothy nodded along at the right moments, and Frank gave the little boy a pat on the head, praying this would all blow over.

"Thirty minutes remaining before the game concludes." The speakers blared over the entire world.

The next half hour sped in a blur. Riots, mass murders, animal slaughters, even insect farms demolished (no one knew if insects counted, though).

An enormous ding sounded as the game concluded.

Heather's head detonated with an innocuous little beep.

She fell headless into the tomato garden.

Frank discovered her four minutes later when he noticed she had not returned from picking two tomatoes for dinner. The shock and grief came in waves, first crashing overhead with tons of force very rapidly. Then smaller waves came, and spread farther apart. Frank would find an instant, even a moment to breath before the next wave crashed back down. In these moments, he managed to gather her up and bury her in the backyard, though it took the better part of the day.

In Frank's grief he missed the announcement for the next game.

"Congratulations to the remaining three-hundred and ninety million players. Game three will now commence. Win condition: travel eight hundred miles from your current location. Lose condition: die. Time limit: eight days."

Frank and Timothy lived out the next eight days as shambling ghosts, still bogged down in the waves. Their dreams brought remembrance of happiness, pure nostalgia. Frank would get on one knee, and put an engagement ring on a young, beautiful Heather's finger. Timothy would be invited to a picnic with his mommy and daddy. He'd lay his head in his mommy's lap as she played with his blonde curls.

The last thing either of them heard was an innocuous little beep.
