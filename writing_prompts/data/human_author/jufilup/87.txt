Clay pulled his hood up, keeping his eyes on the concrete lines beneath his feet as he walked along with the sea of people. Thankfully in the New York winter Clay wouldn’t look out of place with his shades, ball cap, hoodie, long pants, and different skin colored gloves (he decided to be slightly tanner today).

Time square’s video footage blared overhead, a myriad of super heroes endorsing various products: Buy Sprite, it’s what Super Sonic Speed uses!

Clay hurried on his way, the briefcase clutched tightly in his left fist. He knew he had only minutes, that any of the core group of heroes could find him instantly. He picked up his pace.

An enormous boom sounded in a straight line as The Bomber broke the sound barrier, surely searching the crowd for Clay. Clay ducked his head even further.

The resistance HQ peaked over the horizon, and Clay had to stop himself from sprinting. When Clay was only a first down away, the sound barrier shattered again.

Suddenly a smatter of blood, as Clay’s torso spun three sixties midair, spraying blood in an almost tranquil sprinkler effect.

His legs stood alone for less than a second before crumbling.

The Bomber flew back to the hero’s observatory; all in a good days work.
