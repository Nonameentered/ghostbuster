"..and, to reiterate what the good people of the great US of A have posited: busy hands are required for the intelligent. Ever since the fixation of nitrogen was achieved in the early 2000's, the need for human labor, for humans to toil in factories, has ceased. Truly, underconsumption was and still is seen as a horrific crime, for why should one not consume what is readily plentiful, when we know that the gears of economy turn via buying and using." The flags with their logos blazed behind the speaker. He drank a Coca-Cola. He wore a baseball cap with a Dr. Pepper logo on it. He enjoyed playing the field.

"Thus, we have set forward, to be voted on by the good men and women in this chamber, the idea of a perpetual caste of illiterate, stupid, wretches, who can live their lives happily, contentedly going from one activity to the next. They'll go from breakfast to rocket basketball to lunch to watch a matinee to the arcade to dinner to another entertainment, perhaps a late-night show, all to be repeated again the next day. The country will flourish. Small, mom-and-pop shops will flourish.

"And this will even benefit the average man! The average working-class man and woman will be subsidizing these wretches, yes, but, and this is important, the superiority felt by the workers will make up for the lost money. We will tax them to pay for the ill-minded, yet they will be *happy* to give us a percentage of their checks! They'll hold their noses up, kicking the stupid boys and girls as they see them in the street. Caste lines will be drawn more and more firmly, we already have the Director of Education distributing material to educate the next generation, to instill superiority from birth!"

The great man paused to take a long, fizzy drink of Coca-Cola. He finished the liter bottle, pulled out a second bottle from under his podium, popped it open with a bottle opener on his keychain (it was one of the Mexican Coke glass bottles), and guzzled a few mouthfuls.

"Not only will this benefit the average working class man and woman, they will benefit us! No longer will we need to parade around like peacocks, displaying our dazzling tails, dancing roudily in the hopes of copulation." The great man's voice held cold fury. He shook a Fanta Orange flag to his left. He longed to rip the pins and sewn on badges from his jacket, the sodas, the snack brands, sports teams, military production companies, airlines, banks, his doctor, dentist, his child's orthodontist. "We would be free from the fetters and chains that constrain us, that leave us slaves to this system, indeed, even more slaves than the actual slaves! What are we, what personality can any of us have? We, the walking advertisements of the new century."

The great man ripped off his jacket, revealing underneath a simple undershirt, dazzling, blazing white without its pins and patches, without its bright, gaudy logos and advertisements.

The crowd erupted in applause.
