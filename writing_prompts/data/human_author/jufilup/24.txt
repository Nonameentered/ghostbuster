“You always said you’d never become one of them,” she said. “And then…you became one of them. What happened?”

Matt sputtered, trying to hold onto his thoughts as they whirled through his mind. He wished he didn't have his dab pen resting against his left leg. He wished he didn't have his third beer on the side table. He wished the thought of her upsetness, of her understandable frustration, wouldn't raise his heart rate, making the ideas in his mind so much harder to parse out into suitable rows and columns.

Clara sat in silence as Matt thought, and he interpreted her patience for further frustration. The thoughts whirled faster, the tornado threatening to suck him away.

"Look, I'm sorry. Would you mind repeating the main issue, so I can try to address that?" Matt interpreted a small sigh of annoyance from Clara as a life-threatening earthquake. His heart rate further escalated. He prepared to fight for his life or maybe jump from an airplane.

"I'm just trying to express a minor concern, Matt." Clara said patiently, giving Matt a small smile as she reached out to take his hand. "What I'm trying to say is that I'm worried that I'm seeing your dad in you, and I know these things seem like little, small, tiny things. But, honestly, I thought the things with your dad were little things too until enough little things piled up into a really big thing. You know what I'm saying, Matt?"

Matt thankfully no longer needed to go toe-to-toe with a tiger, he needed to chase a raccoon from his trashcans instead.

"I understand." Matt gripped his thoughts like wet floss, both regretting the weed and wanting to take another hit. "I get it. I really do."

Matt tried desperately to cling to something a little more substantial than the soggy old cereal he plopped on Clara's plate. He managed to grasp a small thread.

"It's just hard in the moment, you know?" Matt spoke fast, not wanting to lose his place, the 'you knows' accentuated with a little gesticulation of his left hand. "In the moment it's so hard for me to remember we have talked about this, you know? We've both had the same education, and I know logically that my dad's backward ass views are wrong. It's just hard in the moment sometimes, because little inklings sometimes saturate the back of the mind, just waiting for a moment of emptiness, of which there are plenty!" Matt gave a small huff of laughter. "And in that moment of emptiness, my dad whispers into my eighth-grade ears. And I believed him, for so long, even with all the bullying."

The thoughts drifted to the bullying, and once again he felt the need to save his family from a burning building. Matt also remembered Patty Turner's fat, stupid fuck face, and felt revulsion as he recalled never hitting her, never putting that stupid bitch in her place. His face flushed as he remembered all of the imagined conversations he had in the shower, thinking of all of the witty ways he'd smash her.

The talks of course never happened.

"I get it, honey. I know it's a process." Clara moved closer, wrapping her arms around Matt as he took a hit of his weed pen. "I just want to make sure you're acknowledging it. It just scares me sometimes, baby."

They cuddled for a while, Clara scooting closer to Matt, grinding her tush on his crotch.

He didn't take the hint and fell asleep on the couch watching Toy Story 4.

Clara masturbated in bed alone.
