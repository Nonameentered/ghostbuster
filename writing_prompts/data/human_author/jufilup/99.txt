Old Tom Havinger boots clicked against the pavement as he walked, old leather cowboy boots with metal tips and heels, bringing disjointed clanking along with his gait; Tom couldn't sneak up on a elderly farm animal, though the boots had little to do with that. He'd notice himself too if he routinely stole his own family members, later smelling the crispness of bacon, the oil still sizzling and crackling.

In Tom's left hand sat the crumpled note, his most damning piece of evidence. Only another couple miles, maybe one or two more breaks, and Tom could hand the note to the police chief, a smug look on his face. Tom would insist on no reward, simply the reward of knowing his fellow man was safe was enough. No no, truly, it was no bother at all, just a short walk down the road. The police chief would realize he lived in town, miles away, and be impressed by his constitution and fortitude. Clapping him on the back, the police chief told him good job, son, I'm proud of you.

In his kindness, the police chief even offered to drive Tom home, anything for the hero! Imagine the privilege, being able to drive home the lucky sap who saved our little town in Idaho!

Tom's mom answered the door, a funny look on her face. The police chief said a few quick words, and Tom's mom burst into cheers. Her little man had saved the town! She'd shortly take him to get nuggets and fries, and told Tom to go get ready for the trip, change clothes, and to make sure to brush his teeth and comb his hair first.

Tom changed a few clothing items, keeping his metal tipped cowboy boots. All of a sudden, Tom had a creepy feeling he was being watched, seeing a figure in his peripheral. Stumbling backward, Tom screamed as he saw a battered old man in a cowboy outfit, staring at him in his own room. Tom's mom came rushing upstairs, and realizing the danger, hurried him outside to the car.

Nuggets, Tommy! Aren't you excited, baby boy? Tom bubbled and burbled, mumbling along with Billy Joel on the radio.

Tom's mother tried to maintain a light attitude, praying for the hours to pass faster, waiting for the blissful 36 minute break she'll get between Frank arriving home and her going to work. She looked at Tom in the back seat, his beard caked in ketchup, happily, innocently chomping away on his nuggies.

Tom's mom's knuckles were pressed a solid white as she practiced her breathing strategies, trying to remove the red tinge from her vision.

Tom's mother forced a smile, turned to look at Tom and ask if he was ready to go back home, CyberChase should be on by 3pm after all.
