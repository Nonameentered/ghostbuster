Stewie poured a bowl of raisin bran before soaking it in milk. Classical piano music jaunted softly as evening snacks were prepared.

Mini kolaches, finger sandwiches, his bowl of raisin bran, a jug of orange juice, a few family sized bags of chips, several bottles of water, a lovely charcuterie board with various meats and cheeses, and to top if off a bottle of Chateau Lafite's 1869.

Stewie settled into his cozy, leather, green recliner and took a quick couple puffs from his pipe, stuffed a few small kolaches into his gullet, and downed a full bottle of water. Nourished, Stewie leaned back in his chair, focusing his energy to that dark corner of his mind, hoping he wasn't late for the day's event.

Oliver was mid-speech when Stewie arrived.

"..never had a united front! Look at us, we are four-hundred million men, women, and children strong, and what have we to show for it?" Oliver paused for an audience applause, one man sneezed. The other two politicians openly laughed at their podiums. "I'm glad you think this is a laughing matter. This will reflect poorly on all of us at the centennial ceremony."

Mentioning the ceremony had a profound effect, and Stewie hissed and roared along with the other minds. The hundred year ceremony would determine their next hundred years; Stewie hoped they could be ranked higher among the hives and gain the VIP status that came with the privilege.

Oliver continued on, perspiration dripping slowly down his spine to soak his pants. His airs stood on end as he continued, occasionally slamming his fist on his podium as his pits gradually wetted.

Many minds wandered. Stewie took a break to use the restroom and eat a few more mini kolaches. He also slurped up his very soggy raisin bran, just the way he likes it.

Delving back into the deeper recesses of Stewie's mind, he reentered Oliver's rather tedious speech.

As Oliver continued on about the logistical steps that could be taken to perhaps increase their hive mind ranking, Stewie felt a sharp tug to his left, towards the stairs that led up to the stage.

An enormous man cloaked in a shimmering black and red cloak mounted the stage, throwing his cape over his left shoulder with a grim confidence.

The mountain's essence reached towards the audience and politicians, sucking their minds, hearts, and souls into his.

Stewie abruptly felt his legs and arms jerking about. He, along with approximately four hundred million other men, women, and children, climbed to the highest building within a ten mile radius of their current location, and took a blessed leap into heaven.
