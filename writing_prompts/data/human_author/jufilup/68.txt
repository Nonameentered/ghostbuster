"The red car came sputtering slow down Henderson, just past the intersection of Henderson and Donald street." Hank spat on the ground before continuing. "I had just gotten my cuppa, and was sitting outside talking to Edgar Johnson and Riley Tunick. They both had a cuppa and Edgar was finishing up his everything bagel.

"The car creeped down the road, moving sort of in a zig zag, before running into the ditch by the Quik Trip. Edgar and I hurried down, thinking he was just a classic midday drunk; lots of those around these parts." Hank turned and spat again, this time landing his dip in the tin, a loud clang ringing out. His voice lowered a little bit. "Then the smell hit us, just like when my old farm cat Leroy died. We didn't find him for a week or so, probably. That outhouse had to air out for months before we could use it comfortably again."

A few audience members side eyed each other, a few throats were cleared. Yet this man had been at ground zero; the audience somewhat patiently listened to a little recollecting.

"The driver's face was mostly swollen, his forehead bulged into nearly a second head. Edgar swore loud and ran off; he had had a bad experience with a conjoined twin at the Fort Worth oddities and freakshow back in 1956. Riley gave him a little razzing, asking him if he was scared of a stupid drunk." Hank had to spit again, and found it helped him to fall into the pattern of the story.

"That was a beautiful summer, all back then. Edgar, Riley and me were starting elementary school. I'd help my ma pack lunch; there was an apple tree in the back yard." Hank nodded thoughtfully, really getting into the rhythm of things. "Right, an apple tree. And there was also a pear and an orange tree, I do believe."

Hank spat into the tin. Clang.

"So Edgar and Riley and me, we'd go to lunch together, and I'd be Big Hoss. I'd have apples, or maybe pears, or even oranges. They'd ask me what I picked over the weekend, and we'd sometimes do homework together, and.." Hank spit into the tin again, the saliva building at a rapid rate.

He looked down at the notes in front of him, written in a broken chicken scratch. Some of these people looked mean, tapping their feet and staring at him, or quietly talking to each other. He knew they were here to hear a message. Maybe he was supposed to introduce someone.

Riley and Edgar would probably be coming over soon, and Edgar and Riley and Hank could go play, maybe poke an anthill with a stick or throw rocks at the train.

Hank gave a humble bow to the audience, and turned to walk off the stage, hoping that Edgar and Riley would wait up for him; he'd bring apple slices!
