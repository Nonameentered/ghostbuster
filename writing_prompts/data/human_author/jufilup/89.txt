Charlie crept down the dark hallways of the long abandoned library. At the far end sat a pedestal with a old tome sat upon it, surprisingly lacking any dust, as if it was waiting for a long lost professor to continue teaching his students.

Charlie took the place of the professor, suddenly imagining where chairs had once been, where intellectuals gathered in dark, cramped spaces and shared forbidden knowledge.

Unfortunately, Charlie could not read the language, yet found himself pouring over the page anyway, the script reminded him of some prior symbols he had seen, maybe Arabic.

Charlie focused on a line, the letters suddenly glowing as he stared at them, urging him to continue reading. He heard voices in his mind, in some beautiful tongue as he gazed at the words, and before Charlie knew it, he had completed the page, and the next, and hurried through the rest of the book, entranced by the whispered poetry.

Charlie flung his eyes open, his alarm clock bleating next to his face. Clamping his hand on the machine, he stopped the alert, and with great effort sat up to begin his day.

Charlie yanked his head to the right, staring at his empty room. He was certain he had heard a voice in a tongue he didn't recognize. After staring for another few moments, and convincing himself he was crazy, he finished his routine and hurried to his car for work.

Instead, a blizzard took place right outside his doorstep. Charlie bundled up, taking in the view of his mountainside home; He stood atop an enormous peak, that seemed to steep down at at best a forty five degree angle and at worst a nearly ninety degree angle.

Charlie scratched his head, unsure how he usually got down, as his car would never be able to break in time.

Several days later, Charlie still wondered what to do, the sharp pain in his chest increasingly concerning. He told himself it was anxiety, and realistically it probably was; his food was running out, and he had been eating snow for water since arriving at this new house, cut off from electric, plumbing, even warm showers.

In a desperate attempt, Charlie made his own makeshift ice picks, hoping to painstakingly climb down the monolith of a mountain, to whatever terrain lied below blocked by clouds.

Charlie slipped in his first handful of steps, cartwheeling down the mountain much like a spider in the desert. The snow cushioned his fall, until it didn't, and he lay a heap of smashed flesh upon the rocky floor.
