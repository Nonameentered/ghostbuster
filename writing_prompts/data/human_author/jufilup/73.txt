“Wait a second, so what was my life, then?”

“Why, my child, your life was one of these stories as well. In universe 876B42C a one Melissa Brown wrote the story of your life as a fan fiction for a popular young adult romance series. In fact, you were Melissa’s brother, and you thought my gift was a joke the first time. You had made fun of the manuscript slightly before your untimely passing. Yet now, my child, you have a second opportunity. You can even take your time now; I have writing supplies, you can write your own future, your own perfect vision.”

I took what I imagined was months of ethereal time, carefully hand crafting my future, writing the elaborate details of my future wife, children, even my future high school fling that would help me lose my virginity and more.

I finished the tome and regarded what I assumed was God carefully.

I wished to join my story, and the nothing and everything smiled, and with sweet honey dripping from their voice, wished me well on my travels.

I appeared in the story as a side character nerd I bullied in middle school. A bigger, meaner kid smacked my school lunch tray on the ground and walked away, laughing with his friends.

I picked up the bits that looked okay and ate my meal alone.
