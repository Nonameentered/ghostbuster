After four consecutive days of work, Murphy succumbed to rote trial and error, manipulating the words in a predictable algorithm that should try all patterns within another three weeks or so with minimal breaks.

The students came at dawn daily and left at dusk, paying good money to get their education in the magical arts, until Bosco fucked it all up.

Bosco tried to cast a disentangling spell at Angela's robe. He missed from four yards away, instead hitting the ancient scroll on Wizard Murphy's desk, one he was borrowing from a colleague to study an old form of marlomancy.

The letters of the words developed an instant attraction for each other, engaging in a raucous orgy before combining into new families forevermore.

Murphy took great pride in his memory, and relied on that for the first four days. Defeat was admitted, however, and he began the magical algorithm to solve the puzzle.

The students stared in utter boredom, all punished for Bosco's perverted actions.

And when it all ended eighteen days later, Murphy screamed in pride, beating his chest like his ape ancestors. He turned to glare at his students, particularly Bosco; he had done it. He had fixed the goddamn scroll!

He spent the rest of the day explaining why a particular for loop was required for the magical chant to work, though he had checked over the program millions of times, and had never seen where the for loop was being utilized.
