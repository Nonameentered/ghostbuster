I looked into the dastardly Kevin Johnson's face as my heart rate rose steadily. Moments like these came only very occasionally; most of the villains I fight are more careful than to goad me. Most know my track record.

My first bullet tore through Kevin's left arm, just next to the elbow joint. His arm drooped sadly to the side after that, swinging wildly as he scrambled. My second bullet landed just to the left of his lips. It knocked out about half of his teeth, and left a gaping hole through his jaw and skull. My third bullet missed; his body fell quicker than I expected.

I made sure to stop the recording on my bodycam; no need to waste footage.

The public praised me, knowing I of course could not set the precedent that I was fully a pacifistic hero.

Once home, I placed the recording on a DVD with the name Kevin Johnson carefully written in sharpy on the front. I gently set the video in its case, and put it on the shelf with the rest of my beauties.

I browsed for a few minutes, before selecting a DVD with the name Sarah Morris on the front. I inserted the disc into the player before grabbing a fresh bottle of lotion and a box of tissues.
