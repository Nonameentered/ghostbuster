Arthur's horse sprouted sixteen more legs and caught up to the train at breakneck speeds.

The train reminded Arthur of dreams he used to have of flying cities. The ordinary subway now consisted of a towering cacophony of various architectures, reaching well into the clouds. Victorian style stained glass rose windows morphed into dirty saloon shades which turned into ugly square windows with bug catchers in front of them.

Arthur tried to pierce the Veil with various spells, yet could not see the true form of the train behind the wizard's camouflage.

Arthur pulled out his revolver and began taking pot shots at various weak points, trying to see where the true physical train ended and the mirage began.

Most of the bullets sailed directly through the fakery without even a clang, yet some of the more centrally fired bullets screamed on metal. Arthur heard some women screeching, and chose this time to put in earplugs.

The civilians were always so annoying while they were being saved.

No longer playing around, Arthur pulled out his AR-15 and then his RPG and bazooka. Several clips of ammo later and several magical missiles later, the sad subway cart lay in a charred, smoking heap.

The hostages were all saved from the wizard, as they lay on the ground crispy as bacon.
