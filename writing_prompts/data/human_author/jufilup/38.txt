It basically turned into an Am I the Asshole post halfway through (I've been binging a lil too much lol)

Basically Clara organized a fun kinda fake lynching where they can kinda hurt the people they're lynching but not until the end (it was unclear and I wasn't sure how to write that part)

Her brother fucked it up by getting too excited and hurting one of the participants basically.

Clara got super pissed at Albert about that and thankfully August only suffered a mild concussion though i get the confusion because the implication is that August would be killed anyway but maybe he was gonna be killed later and Albert ruined the ceremony, idk.

I kinda lost the plot during it but it was fun to write.
