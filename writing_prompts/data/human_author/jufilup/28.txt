There are occasional glimpses of time where the world glows white. Little, sweet moments that fully encapsulate the mind, that garter new decisions, that leads to little notes being scribbled down, resolving to change, to propel forward to the future.

These notes, little jots of penmanship clutter a well-maintained journal of ideas without actions.

And the moments of whiteness collapse, returning the world to its normal golden-tan embrace. A concerned countenance covers your face, and you try to remember.

What were we trying to do? What did we want to accomplish? We made decisions. We made concrete resolutions in a moment when we were able.

And we left a record!

Yet, upon peering into our phone, or shoddy notebook of ideas, we still do not act.

We quickly acknowledge. A quick nod of the head. A quick scroll to the bottom of the notepad that speaks a few things that may progress life: a counseling appointment, looking for a better career, painting a quick canvas, maybe filling a page with words of any sort.

And that is enough.

The deed has been done, and the note accomplished. We have fulfilled our purpose.

We close the notepad and open Reddit.

And oddly it still goes this way, even as we live on the brink, with the end of the world so in sight, with the comet in sight, while we pour buckets of sweat, while we ignore our shame.

Despite all of this, we delicately thumb between our notepad and Reddit, occasionally getting bored of the Reddit threads on Home, having scrolled all the way to the bottom of anything remotely interesting.

And we continue with our little list of self-improvement goals as the comet hurtles closer and closer.

Maybe we should play the piano, we could walk over and practice for a few minutes.

Better write it down in a notepad, first.
