Cynthia looked so pretty today. She stood proud and true, her firm, hard structure tightly pressed against mine. Her core pressed deeply into mine. She'd twist, almost a full three-sixty, and I'd swing open, and the fleshy things would enter.

This morning, she whispered hello, before corkscrewing, several levers clicking locks out of place, allowing us to swing open. Strangely, many many fleshy ones entered, much more than could realistically fit. Then came the food, and water, gadgets and electronics, cloths in weird shapes, stuffed floor to ceiling, several friends were hidden.

Joshua was crushed underneath tons of supplies, we could hear him sobbing occasionally for a while, before his strength gave out. Cynthia and I pray for him.

Several comrades were torn apart before being ruthlessly pieced together in different ways, piecing together torsos with different arms, different legs, alien brains, and alien heads. Some would try to talk, most had only noises but no words.

Yet, Cynthia and I had each other. Cynthia was sure a lot quieter; her brother and several cousins had been torn apart and repieced into clunky zombies.

Then the weird crunchy noises, and the shaking. The screams of pain grew louder, as our entire community crunched together under what could only be a great giant thundering above us. Several relatives' bodies were cracking apart, and the fleshy ones were hysteric, though they still sat comfy.

The earthquake continued, the shaking and vibration only escalating, as if the giant was jumping directly up and down, or swinging a massive sledgehammer.

And maybe he was, maybe the sledgehammer swung without a swinger, maybe it was simply force.

Cynthia and I crumbled under a blow, yet the giant rioted on.
