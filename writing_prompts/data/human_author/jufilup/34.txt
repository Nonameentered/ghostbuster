Jessie felt the clawing in his heart, the slight raise of his heart rate that always accompanied the thoughts.

He felt the dark smokey tendrils reach from his crotch to his brain, pickling it, easing his consciousness into a puddle on the ground.

*It is too late for you. You can't be helped.*

Jessie clung to the hatred, to the isolation, to the loneliness, to the otherness. Since high-school, no, before really. Since birth, or even his conception, as his mother held her belly and feared, feared what the wet between her legs could fester into.

Scared of the troubles of motherhood, of the ease of neglect.

Yet by child numero dos, the fear had eased. The family had more money and time for their new piece of pottery, and Jessie fell by the wayside.

And with each passing day, the hatred of humanity piled up. Not specifically at his mother or father or sister, Angela, but at humans, for allowing this to occur. For allowing this sham of an existence for him.

For allowing his parents to buy Angela a car for her sixteenth, yet nothing for Jessie.

Jessie's father gave him a look that clearly spoke don't ask about the injustice, do not question this existence.

Jessie never questioned.

He hated instead.

Most things. People, crowds, surfing, the hot sun and the cold sun, his family, Angela, the Chads and Stacies at school, the people who laughed at him, who he could feel looking at him, thinking about him as he goes about his life, feeling so much fucking better than him as he stands the line at the grocery checkout.

Until Nathan reached back out to Jessie for the first time in a few years, and they met up at a bar.

Nathan gave his pitch, laying out a sob story about his manager hiring his fuck buddy and letting him go. 

Jessie was just getting ready to tell him to fuck off--

*What if we did? What if we let it go, forgave this once?*

Blood flushed to Jessie's face and he excused himself to the restroom.

Cold porcelain filled his hands as he leaned forward into the mirror.

The voice continued, almost logically.

*We could try to start again, I mean, at least to some degree. We could try to set it aside, we could help him. How big of a deal would it be to have him sleep on the couch a few weeks?*

*No! Fuck him! Fuck them all! Fuck Angela! Fuck Tim Halloway, Clyde Donahue, Sebastian Walker and all the rest of those bastard fucks! They wouldn't be your friends back then, they won't be your friend now; Nathan will use you. He will chew you up and spit you out. He will sleep on your couch, make two minutes of conversation a day, and leave in a few weeks, then never return a call again. Don't let him. Crawl out the window.*

*But we can't go on like this, Jessie, man we just can't. Imagine the future, man. We want a wife, maybe a few pink faced babes. How can we get there, if we can't forgive one single person? What are we if we can't exhibit one example of humanity?*

The moment felt drawn out for hours, despite occurring for no longer than one minute.

Jessie drew within leaping distance of forgiveness, of trying to accept that the way he viewed an entire huge chapter of his life was simply wrong, or at least not healthy. He may hate his parents. He may hate Angela. He may not be hateful to everyone he ever met, already seeking out their wrongs before even saying hullo.

Yet the leap across the cavern would require the will of another man; a man not so hooked in hatred, like a fish with a particularly nasty curve on the hook resting within its cheek.

Jessie climbed out of the bathroom window to freedom.
