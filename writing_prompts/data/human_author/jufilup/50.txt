The recliner caressed me as a lover, entangling me as I gradually sank further in. If I ever stood my body print would remain for at least several minutes. The living room flat screen TV blared Breaking Bad as I took copious puffs of my bong and polished off my third beer.

Luci was of course gone again, though I wasn't sure if he was just napping in his bedroom or out doing whatever it was he did.

Early on, I eavesdropped in on Luci, hoping that I'd be able to discern why he was living in a little two bedroom apartment in Philly. Yet, Luci was utterly ordinary, seemingly a recentish college graduate.

So, though I knew I was most likely rooming with Satan himself, I sank even further into my green leather lumpy recliner and watched a meth cook montage starring Walt and Jesse.
