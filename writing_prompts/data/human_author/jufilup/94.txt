Tyson's tight blonde curls dampened the pressure of his heavy crown, a solid gold band with inlaid jewels of diamond and ruby. He gripped his serpent head cane, tracing the lips of the reptile as he always did, mumbling his speech to himself.

Helping Tyson's arms into his suit coat, Caitlyn gripped his shoulders tightly, massaging them with her thumbs.

"Feel ready, my love?"

Tyson quickened his lip tracing, the green paint of the reptile's skin long gone. Friends bustled, lights shone bright, Tyson was jostled, a light pain sounded behind his eyes, sweat beaded on his brow.

"Honey?" Caitlyn asked, wiping Tyson's face with her kerchief before giving him an encouraging smile.

In the courtroom Tyson sat anxiously waiting to speak. Commonfolk filed in slowly, their eyes racing over him, clawing at him, forcing him to look back, smile, wave, say hullo.

Only minutes into this dance, this facade of interaction, Tyson had exhausted his reserves. He could not look at these insects, could not smile into their dim eyes, could not jest with a fucking milkmaid. The noise thundered in his ears, the dull aching in his eyes more pronounced by the minute.

And yet the farce continued, Tyson smiled, laughed, counting the hours until the court would close shortly after his speech.

Yet suddenly a fire burned in his belly. Tyson sat up straighter, setting the cane firmly in his hand, no longer stroking the snake's lips. He straightened his crown, and held a stern but loving expression that would have pleased any father.

The hours flew by, Tyson jested, laughed, cried, enjoyed the common folk's company. And he was loved, the only true thing he desired. Feeling the admiration of these ants lifted his heart, making him feel that he truly deserved to be king.

Of course the speech went amazingly. Sure, taxes were raised, and certain projects that would benefit the poor were waylaid, but the public understood. Several of them personally assured Tyson that it was not unfair, he was simply doing business.

He clapped them on their shoulder, saying thanks son, that means a lot. You know, we are just in a struggling time, with the recent weather problems and supply chain issues.

And of course they understood, nodding humbly before him. The common folk bobbed their heads in appreciation, saying they knew Tyson was doing his best; and he was! He finally felt the appreciation as they chanted his name.

"Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! Tyson!" Caitlyn gently snapped her fingers in front of his face. "Honey, we really need to get going, the common folk will soon be filing into the court room."
