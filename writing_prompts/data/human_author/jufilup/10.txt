Rays of white-gold light plunged through innumerable leaves, colliding with pastel, cartoonish flowers. A few species of birds flitted hither and thither, twittering their titillating tune. The golden spears reflected off the morning dew, creating a sparkling gold effect if one held their head quite right.

Apart from the pristine forest with its equally elegant seating area, consisting primarily of benches directly into the forest's largest trees.

The little blonde girl nuzzled into one of these benches, her tight corkscrew curls bouncing as she settled in. She had chosen her favorite tree-bench (as she called them in her mind), a tree shaped like a fat dwarf. Short and stout, she rested comfortably in the dwarf's belly, tilting her head to and fro to enjoy the yellow, gold, and orange shining from the dew.

Tears abruptly rose to the little one's eyes, though she suppressed the feeling with great force, letting only one tear make a hasty exit. She quickly dried her face.

She had promised herself to wait until home to feel sad. Or at least to try.

She was hoping to practice a lesson that she had only very recently discovered: your feelings are only your own. That is to say, only you feel your emotions, and if you happen to be alone, or with particularly uncaring people, they exist only to you, and are only to your benefit or downfall.

Thus, why would she feel sad here in this wonderful meadow, this splendid patch of vibrant green life? There was no one to impress, no one to make certain you were feeling "properly" about the "whole situation", as the therapist once put it.

The Whole Situation. The little girl's eyes once again teared up, too many memories bubbling to the surface. This time she was unsuccessful.

Still blubbering, her sleeves damp and streaked with mucus, she stumbled away from the old dwarf, whispering a little goodbye to the man.

She walked aimlessly as always, never knowing how to get home, or how she arrived here in the first place, or if she even had a home.

Through blurry eyes, she didn't notice the small rock around ankle height, bringing her shin into the hard grey surface.

Her left elbow hit the ground first, followed by the rest of her torso. The ringing through her arm went into her jaw. She cried out for her mother.

The tears came harder as she remembered and remembered. Though alone, this time she indulged. The waves of sorrow crashed over her.

A kind face, red lips stretched into a smile, tight blonde corkscrew curls, the smell of cinnamon, the softness and roughness of mommy's hands, her hazel eyes, the last time she said: I love you.
