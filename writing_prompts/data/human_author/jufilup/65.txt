Charlie lay uncomfortably, his ribs digging into the hard golden coins beneath him. His gaunt, frail body curled into the fetal position surrounding a small mound of gold and jewels.

The screams continued to haunt him. He could still taste their fear.

"Heeeeeeelp!" Charlie whipped his head around, using his enormous leathery wings for leverage. He got his legs beneath him, and listened to the cry echo throughout his cavern.

\*Please, ma'am. Please, you don't understand. I have no choice.\*

Charlie left his cavern, still unable to separate himself from his prey. The woman's voice sounded a lot like Ma's.

Charlie guarded the exit, yet could barely bring himself to feast. Their cries. The looks on their faces. The dreams. The dreams alone are enough. And the taste: the metallic scent never leaving Charlie's throat, regardless of how much water he guzzles.

And yet, Charlie feels the gurgles in his belly, and knows that time will not wait forever.

\*Maybe I should just get it over with.\*

Charlie lunged back into his cavern with great speed. He pounced directly through his main living area, over his golden treasures, into his pantry, where his little flock lived their little lives.

A woman with tan brown skin and grey eyes was breast feeding her baby. She hardly had time to react before Charlie's jaws collapsed around the man sitting behind her, massaging her shoulders.

She screamed mi amor though he was already gone, and only a red mist speckled the scene.

Charlie felt liquid gush through his jaws, gallons and gallons of thick juice sopped down his neck as he feasted on his treasure, back in his living room. He focused on managing his breathing, not allowing thoughts to creep into his mind.

\*Divertirse en la escuela, mi amor!\*

Charlie's mother passed him his sack lunch of papusas, chips and salsa, and a glass bottle of coke.

Charlie looked into her deep grey eyes, and smiled as she kissed him on his cheek.

Charlie could still hear the woman sobbing for her husband as he struggled fitfully to sleep.
