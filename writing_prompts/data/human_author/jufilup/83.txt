“Yellow, green, eight, six, four, green, you are cleared for landing. Approach landing zone ex, ell, see, two, eight, green.”

Plink grimaced as he hovered towards the wasteland. Despite his people’s best efforts, this land was truly spent. Remnants of past lives spread about the dunes, hundreds of thousands of miles of hardened rock trails, towers, rubble spires, more and less.

Plink felt confident this would be the land, as he put on his breathing equipment, this would be the land he would finish it all. He’d avenge Anch. He’d stop this infinite scavenger hunt.

Plink immediately sent out the drones to search for eyeberries. The humans stored most of the information of their world in these eyeberries. Plink would have the drones scan scores of these tomes, found deep within the eyeberries, before returning to base and studying.

“But wait, won’t you go out there, Plink? You’re going to stay on the ship?”

Plink whirled around, Linus was staring at him, tongue out, panting.

Plink blinked hard, before approaching Linus and stroking his tentacles then tickling him under his chin.

“Whose a good boy?” Plink forced the habit as Linus’ tentacles extended and retracted.

Fuck no. I won’t go out. Not again. Even with a rebreather, not again.

Plink saw Anch in his last moments, pleading with silent gasps, his face turning greener and greener.

With a sharp gasp Plink regained focus, shambling towards his bed quarters. He gripped a bottle before extracting two large capsules and shoving them into an entrance near his left elbow.

And he returned to the meadow of his growth. His mother turned to smile at him, beckoning Plink to join the picnic. Little Linus looked at him, slobbering all over his mom. Plink giggled and moved to hug Linus, Linus squirmed, trying to escape, and the game continued.


Plink’s mom and dad share a bottle of wine as they all nibble on meats, cheeses, and crackers. Plink leans against mom’s chest, cushioning his head with her left breast. His dad puts his arm on his back, absently mindedly stroking as they watched the sunset, Linus sprawled out over their laps.

“I love you, mom and dad.”

“I love you, too, Plink.”

“Back at you, son.” Plink’s father winked, his pale blue flesh beginning to bubble.

“Just make sure you get them.” Plink’s father gurgled, caving into itself like a molten lava cake. “Make sure you get those sumbitches.”

Plink’s parents rapidly deflated, their faces in choked agony as they reach into the universe for air, and find none.

The mirage collapses in puddles of blue, green, and purple piles of goop, with smatters of red mixed in. Their broken rebreather sat in front of Plink, and he choked back sobs.

The drones completed copying the eyeberries treasures to Plink’s terminal. Plink took a sip of his coffee and got to work.
