"And it looks like that will wrap up class for today. Remember your homework is due at midnight on Friday and the quiz will be open between noon and midnight on Saturday. Have a good weeke-"

An enormous boulder fell from above, not slowing as it crushed the sun baked roof shingles followed by the dingy criss cross cardboard white ceiling tiles and finally onto the top of Professor Hartley's head, her spine slinkying like a soda can ready for recycling.

The boulder oddly jolted upward before crashing down again, the long pillar of white concrete cutting into the sky.

In this six seconds, Tommy had begun wetting himself, frozen in his foldout theater chair. He still held the article he was hoping to get approved on a gaming website. Dr. Hartley kindly offered to edit the piece.

The long pillar of slick rock had jerked into the sky, leaving the crowded lecture room.

The large hole left by the boulder was filled with an enormous baby face with curly red brown hair. The huge being with stunted features moved slowly, its arms and legs much too small for its torso.

Then an adult found them.

His black sleek hair first entered the building as he bent over to look in. His cheeks were pulled back into a permanent grin, showing perfect, enormous white teeth.

His neck wrenched to the right, then left so rapidly that Joy didn't even manage to scream.

He grabbed her gently enough with his incisors, before shaking her like a dog does a chew toy.

The hysteria continued, though the misshapen baby giant blocked three of the four lecture room exits.

The adult understood, and planted his boulderlike leg in the way of the final exit, then crouched and took his time.

He'd reach out and pluck students with much the same delicacy as a child prodding an anthill with a stick. How many ants will come out? See how fast they run, mama? See how scared they get? See how quickly they rebuild their hill, mama? It'll be back tomorrow!

Then throwing down the stick as they climbed up, so that little Tommy doesn't get bit.

Or.. just swallowing the ants and giggling as you hum The Bear Necessities.
