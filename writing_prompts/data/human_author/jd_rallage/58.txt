"I dare you."

Listriva looked at the gang of kids who had gathered around her, and clutched her lunch tray like a shield. Not that it would offer much protection. 

"What's the matter?" Krilly said. "Too scared to eat with the Terrans?"

One minute she'd been in line at the school cafeteria, and the next she had been surrounded by Krilly Urzak and his cronies. The gang was a hodge-podge of alien races, but they all had one thing in common: they followed Krilly's lead in whatever nasty scheme he hatched. Unfortunately, most of their entertainment these days seemed to revolve around Listriva. The familiar sense of dread rose up in her stomach.

"I'm not scared," Listriva said. She tried not to let her voice waver.

"Well, go on then," Krilly said. He leaned forwards and yanked the empty lunch tray from her hands. "Prove it to us."

Listriva wanted to cry, but she knew from experience that it only made things worse. So instead she picked her chin up and marched over to a small part of the school cafeteria that was walled off from the rest. A sign on the door said, in large red letters, "WARNING: CARNIVOROUS AREA."

She remembered a story Jek had told her in the playground last week. "Did you know that when Terrans start to eat they devour anything that moves? That's why they are cordoned off. So that they don't eat us in their feeding frenzies."

She hesitated at the door, but she could feel the eyes of Krilly's gang on her back. If she backed out now... well, they'd never let her forget it. She would be little Listriva the Scaredy-pants forever. She pushed open the door and stepped inside.

There weren't more than twenty Terran kids at the school, and they all turned to look at her as soon as she walked in. Their eyes were hungry. Their mouths were filled with sharp, white teeth.

Listriva gulped. 

One of the Terrans stood up and came towards her. Listriva's knees began to shake. This was it. She was a goner. But she couldn't move. She couldn't reach for the door handle to flee back to the safety of Krilly Urzak's taunts. Her mouth was too dry to even scream for help.

The Terran stopped a few paces away. "Hey, kid. Are you okay? You look ill."

Something incoherent came out of Listriva's mouth.

"Are you sure you want to be in here?" the Terran asked. His voice was far kinder than Listriva had imagined a frenzied Terran would sound. "A lot of non-Terrans feel queasy when they see us eat."

Listriva finally managed to squeak out a few words. "Please don't eat me!"

The silence was banished by the sound of twenty Terrans bursting into peals of laughter. Finally the one who'd approached her said, "Don't worry, we don't eat meat."

Listriva frowned. "What?"

"Yeah," he said. As her panic subsided she recognized him as one of the prefects. His name was Tom, or something. "None of us have ever eaten meat. I mean, we were all born on this space station just like you. Where would we get meat from? We're ten parsecs from the nearest system."

Curiosity replaced her fear. "Then what do you eat?"

Tom waved his hand to a table of food, stacked with trays of steaming vegetables. The exact same dishes that were being served in the main cafeteria.

"Sorry to disappoint," Tom said. "Well, I guess you can go back to friends and tell them we're eating one of the Kindergarteners." He smiled, but there was a hint of sadness behind it too.

Listriva saw it, and suddenly didn't feel so scared. Besides, Krilly and pals would still be waiting outside, expecting her to come out in tears at any moment. "Actually, do you mind if I eat with you today?"

He blinked in surprise, but then he said, "Yeah. We'd like that."

He smiled again, and this time there was no sadness.
