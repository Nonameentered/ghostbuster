The rabbit and the fairy slipped through the forest with the same practiced effortlessness as beer down the throat of a drunkard. They talked almost incessantly, chattering, bickering, and occasionally chivying Robert along. The lawyer struggled after them as best as he could, limping along with the aid of a large branch that the rabbit had found, and trying to push the undergrowth aside with his briefcase.

“I need a break,” Robert said eventually. His ankle was starting to ache painfully despite the makeshift crutch.

“C’mon,” the fairy said. “We’re nearly there.”

“You said that fifteen minutes ago,” Robert said. He tossed his briefcase on the ground and sat down on it. If one of his paralegals had told him that morning that’s willingly have put the briefcase down in the mud, he’d have fired them. But the bespoke leather was already battered beyond recognition.

“Won’t do to keep the Queen waiting,” the rabbit said.

“Where is this Queen?” Robert asked. “My clients usually come to me, unless they’re in prison.”

“At the Fairy Court,” the fairy said.

“So she’s some kind of fairy queen?”

The rabbit’s ears shot up so fast that Robert glanced around to make sure they weren’t being followed. It growled, “Faerie. Not fairy.”

“Very important difference,” its winged companion agreed. “We don’t go around calling you a monkey.”

After they’d spelled out the two words for him, Robert said, “I can’t hear any difference.”

“Yes,” the rabbit said, “They sound the same but they’re said differently.”

Robert gave it a hard look.

“It’s easy, mister,” the fairy - or faerie - said. “Just picture the word in your mind when you say it.”

“And are you a-” Robert paused and tried to as he’d been instructed, “-a faerie?”

The rabbit snorted. “What, him? Nah, he’s just a common little sprite. You want to watch out for them, Mr Harris, or they’ll widdle in your coffee when you’re not looking.”

The sprite sniffed. “At least I’m not a common mammal, you overeducated fur ball-”

“Stop,” Robert said sharply. He’d listened to them arguing too much. To his surprise they both fell silent. “Do you have names?”

“Call me The Sound of Dew in the Spring,” the sprite said. “Or perhaps-”

“Oh do shut up,” the rabbit growled. “You can call him Robin, Mr Harris.”

“And you?”

The rabbit sniffed haughtily. “Nothing you’d be able to pronounce.”

“A rabbit with no name,” Robert said softly. He thought of offering Mr Flopsy as a stand in, but then he remembered the rabbit bite on his finger. It had only just stopped bleeding. Instead he asked, “How far away is the court of the fair- Faerie Queen?”

Robin said in a sing-song voice, “As far as your fingertip, Mister Harris, yet as close as a rainbow.”

“Pah,” said the rabbit. “What he means is it's a good few miles, and at the rate we're going we not going to get there until after midnight.”

Robert carefully rolled up the trouser on his bad leg. The ankle had swollen to twice its proper size.

“It's not happening,” Robert said. “If the Queen needs me so urgently then she can come here.”

The other two stared at him. Robin forgot to keep flapping his wings and tumbled several feet through the air, landing in a patch of nettles. The rabbit had the face of a mouse that has just been ordered to retrieve a cube of cheddar from a complicated contraption made of wire and wood.

Robin shot out of the nettles, wings buzzing like an angry bee. “You got a death wish, mister?

“Those are my terms,” Robert said firmly.

The rabbit and the sprite looked at each other. The rabbit said, “You'll get there quicker than me, pal.”

The sprite did a somersault and zipped off through the trees.

After a few moments, Robert rearranged the briefcase so that he could lean back against a tree and propped his swollen ankle up on a tree root. The rabbit watched him morosely. Robert ignored it, and stared around at the forest.

Ever since they'd begun walking, something about it had bothered him. This was odd, because the forest was more real than any forest had a right to be. Forests weren’t supposed to be this perfect. They didn’t have butterflies gliding out from behind every tree, rainbow patterned groves of wildflowers, or choirs of birds chirping in coordinated eight-part harmonies. They didn’t have clumps of red-capped toadstools with perfectly spherical white spots, like that patch that was growing between his feet. Like a brand-new bathroom, the forest shone in places that weren’t supposed to sparkle, and yet there was something wrong about it, as if the first guest had done something that left a bad smell.

Robert sat in silence, and listened to the rhythm of the light as it shone through the canopy and salsa’d across the fallen leaves, and heard the forest groan around him.

“What is that?” he asked. “That humming noise?”

“Best wait until the Queen gets here,” the rabbit said. “You must have the *cohones* of a minotaur, Mr Harris, making Her come to you like this.”

“Is she really that bad?” Robert asked.

“She had moods,” the rabbit said diplomatically.

“And I have two teenagers,” Robert said.

“Ah,” the rabbit said, “but could they turn you into an ass if you displease them?”

“Only on social media,” Robert said.

The rabbit stared at him blankly.

“It was a joke,” Robert muttered.

“Really?” the rabbit said. “In that case, don’t try being funny when the Queen gets here. And whatever she says, under no circumstances should you-”

The rest of its words were lost as a glowing light began to emanate from the trees around them. For a moment it grew so bright that Robert had to shield his eyes, and then it faded.

He looked up, straight into Her eyes.
