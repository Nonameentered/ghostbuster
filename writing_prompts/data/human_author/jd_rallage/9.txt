You get to be able to tell a piece of junk mail when it sneaks into your mailbox, trying to pass unnoticed between the bills and the birthday cards, stamped with messages that try to strike a balance between urgent and non-spammy. That's where the junk mailers go wrong. A genuine utility bill never looks quite as a appealing as a new credit card offer.

I nearly threw this particular letter - the first warning I had that my life was about to go (quite literally) to Hell - straight into the shredder, but something about it stopped me. 

Perhaps it was the paper the envelope was made of - heavy, good quality stuff, none of this 100% recycled stuff, but the sort of paper that makes you confident that a swathe of pristine tropical rainforest was decimated for the benefit of your current tactile pleasure. 

Or maybe it was the obviously fake address in the top right: "Attn: Collections Dept., PO Box 666, Good Intentions-paved Road, You Know Where". 

But I think what finally stayed my hand was the message stamped on the envelope in capital letters: NON-URGENT - CONSIDER NOT OPENING. IN FACT, WE SUGGEST YOU THROW THIS AWAY IMMEDIATELY. You only get all-caps messages like that on subscription offers for magazines you'll never find the time to read or from car insurance that swears it can beat your current rate, even though you don't currently open a car.

Still, I had to give the marketing department some credit. So they were trying reverse psychology now, were they? You had to give the buggers some credit for sheer desperate inventiveness. Fine, I'd open the damn thing, and at least give it a brief skim before tossing it in the trash.

Inside, was a single piece of paper, neatly folded.

> Dear Ms. Border
>
> This letter serves as notice that you, Madeline Amy Border (Soul Security Number: XXX-XX-0391), have been sent to Collections.
>
> An associate of our local collections agency franchise (Incubi and Spawn, LLC) will be with you immediately. You have the right to resist, but it is always futile.
>
> Please retain this letter for your records. If you wish to contest this case, please present a copy of this letter to the appropriate office. 
>
> Yours insincerely,
>
> Kreffing, Deputy Assistant Secretary to the Assistant Deputy Secretary to Hamophet, Archduke of Forfeit Souls

There was a signature at the bottom of the letter - weirdly curved sigils that hurt to focus on. Some kind of holographic ink, probably.

It was obviously some kind of prank, but at least they weren't trying to sell me something. I thought about keeping it, to show my friends, but the signature was really starting to get on my nerves.

The letter went into the shredder, which buzzed briefly and happily, while I went into the kitchen to make a pot of coffee.

While it was brewing, I checked the answering machine. One missed call, from the early hours of the morning. I must have slept through it. It was an unknown number - probably more junk. But to be on the safe side, I picked it up and listened, and heard a voice I'd not heard in an age, nor wanted to hear for another age to come.

"Hi sweetie. This is your mother. Listen, I've done something I shouldn't have. I've... well, I thought I should warn you that- hey, give that back! No, what do you mean my phone call is up, I-"

*Click.* Then the monotone of the answering machine.

I groaned. I'd gone no-contact with my mother for a reason, after one too many stunts in which I had to pick up the pieces (the last one involving stealing my identity to take out a bank loan). This was probably just another scam. But you don't grow up as the daughter of a con artist without learning to smell the stench of a hustle. And how had she gotten my phone number? It wasn't listed for a reason, that reason being her.

But before I could sink too far into gloom, there was a knock at the door. At this time of the morning? I wasn't expecting anyone. Joe from next door complaining about my dog again? Or those Mormon missionary kids back for round two?

The knock came again, louder this time. The whole house shook. My dog looked at me in faint alarm.

"Alright," I muttered. "I'm coming."
