"I'm going to kill you!"

The plate hurtled through the head-shaped void that had just been vacated by the noggin of yours truly, and smashed into the wall behind me.

"Better start trying then," I said, glancing at the deep indent in the plaster.

"You see? You *don't* take anything seriously. You never have. This was why I cursed you in the first place."

"Five-year olds don't take things seriously," I said. "You might say that is the definition of being five. Most older sisters don't doom their siblings to a live of ignominity."

"I was eight," she snapped. "I didn't know that I was a witch. I just..."

She trailed off, her glare challenging me to continue the argument. But we had covered this ground many times before. I held my tongue. You get pretty good at that, when your own words are your worst enemy, without fail, every time that you speak.

Frustrated, my sister Beatrice flung herself into an armchair, and sat, scowling up at me. I riposted with a smirk.

Her glower deepened. "I could have been leader of the coven," she muttered. "I was this close... But no, now my brethren think I'm some kind of dilettante."

"How tragic," I said.

"Oh, do be serious, Amos. Nevermind that I developed a side-effect-free love potion. Disregard entirely my contributions to the philosophical underpinnings of critical hag theory. And last year's article in *Scoparum Manubrio*, with all the advances I discovered for aerodynamic performance? Why, it might as well never have been published."

"If it's any consolation," I said, "the same might be said for every other article in that issue."

"It is not a consolation," she said, with a glare that had been known to turn princes into frogs, and frogs into... well, somethings are best not dwelled upon. "And all because my brother the bard got it into his little head to write a song about me."

"Songs, curses," I said. "Like pooping dogs, we all have our own unique ways of depositing gifts on the lawn of life."

This, dear reader, is where you are probably wondering why I don't simply suggest she remove the curse. Alas, I had tried that approach when she first cursed me a score of years ago. Ever since, she had regarded the idea of freeing me as laughable. That is the trouble with nothing you say being taken seriously. I had quickly learned to say the opposite of what I wanted, but by then, the damage had been done. I never mentioned lifting the curse to my sister again.

No, now I was playing the long game. Gently did it. You couldn't make a horse drink, but you could lead it to water, stake it down on a hot day, and then wait for it to die of thirst. With just the right pressure on the reins, I could lead her to coming to the idea on her own...

"Sometimes I wonder how you have never been pilloried for insubordination," she said. "With the things you said about the queen last year, and now this latest poem about the crown prince..."

"Nobody has ever taken my insults seriously," I said. "Nobody ever will. Such is my gift."

She frowned suddenly. "Yes, but..."

I had been scheming for this day for the better part of a decade. I had come close several times before, only to push too hard, or not quite enough.

"Of course, I would never dream of writing another verse about you," I said. "And I'm sure everything in the current song will be forgotten quickly enough."

"Amos," she said, a queer smile curling at the corner of her lips, "if I had known that you would continue to inflame the hearts and minds of the kingdom, I would never have lifted the curse from you."

"And as for your brethren- wait, what?"

"Oh yes," she said, her smile growing nastily now. One needs a good old nasty smile to be considered for Head Hag, and Beatrice's could be terrifying when she wanted it to. "Mother had been going on at me for years to lift the curse, and when I finally acquired enough power to do so... I did it on your birthday. I assumed you knew."

"Knew? You never told me! How would I possibly know?"

"Oh, perhaps from the sudden change in mannerisms of those around you. One of your rare serious pronouncements being taken at face value, perhaps?"

"I'm never serious," I said. "What's the point? If you're going to be taken lightly, best to make the best of it."

"Well, that is a pity," she said, smiling cheerfully. "And who says frogs can become princes? It's not the direction of transmutation that I put a lot of faith in, personally."

I stared at her, pieces suddenly clicking. Now that she mentioned it, there had been a few incidents. But after a lifetime of dismissal, I'd just assumed they were anomalies.

"Yes, a great pity," she said. "Especially now that the Prince has put out the word to his henchmen to find whoever wrote that poem."

My blood began to chill. "The Prince?"

"I hear he's quite angry," she said, casually inspecting her nails. "Something about drawing and quartering, but, really, my dear, you know how poorly sound travels through the bowl of water when one is scrying. Perhaps I misheard. In fact, I'm sure I did."

"This is on you," I said, my own anger rising as quickly as hers had apparently subsided. "You're a witch. There must be something you can do."

She sighed heavily, as if I had forced a concession out of her. "There is one thing, I suppose."

"What? Don't hold out on me, sis. Doesn't family count for something? Think about what Mother would say."

She looked up at me suddenly, and I caught the full force of a hag's smile and a sister's malevolence. It was hard to say which was worse. She said, very softly, "I suppose I could always place a curse on you, so that nobody takes the words you say seriously any more..."
