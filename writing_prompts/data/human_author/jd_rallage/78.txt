"You're a fool, Powerman - or should I say, Caleb Stone. You would never have defeated me."

Caleb Stone, aka Powerman, struggled against the manacles that bound him to the cliff face.

"Flail all you like, Mr. Stone," Professor Gregory said from the depths of his armchair. "However, do you remember that thorn you stepped on in the jungle outside my lair? That wasn't a natural thorn. It was part of my defences. You've been injected with a serum of my own devising, one that counteracts your superstrength."

So that was why Caleb felt so weak! Normally he would have ripped through these manacles like a tortilla chip through guacamole.

Professor Gregory sat in front of the chained superhero, stroking a fluffy, ill-faced looking cat, and cackled maniacally. "And now, thanks to your recklessness, Earth is defenseless. They'll never know of my master plan."

"Oh?" Caleb said. "And what's that?"

"Domination," the Professor said. "Complete power over everyone on this miserable planet. In five hours time, I will have finished hacking into the US, Russian, and Chinese satellite systems, and I'll begin broadcasting a signal that hypnotizes everyone on Earth."

"I'll stop you before then," Caleb said, but hearing himself speak, he realised he sounded tired, defeated.

"Unlikely," the Professor said. "You see, Mr. Stone, in five minute time one of my men will deliver me a syringe full of the same serum, a dose lethal enough to kill *even you*." He threw back his head and laughed once more, disturbing the cat in his lap, which picked itself up and hopped onto the spotless marble floor.

"Come back, Mr. Tibbles," the Professor said, suddenly irritated. 

But the cat stalked off, its tail held up like a flagpole, and left the room.

"I've never understood why all you villains insist on having cats," Caleb said. "Surely anyone interesting in dominating everyone else would prefer a dog."

"You wouldn't understand," the Professor sneered.

"Neither," said a silky, feline voice from behind him, "do you."

The Professor leaped up to face the intruder, and was hit by the full force a a stun gun going off in his face. His body toppled backwards, revealing a slim, lithe woman standing in the doorway.

"Catgirl," Caleb said. "You're a sight for sore eyes."

"Powerman," she replied, stalking across the floor towards him. "I wish I could say the same. But, no, you just had to come barging in like this, forcing my hand."

"What-," he spluttered. "What are you talking about? You would never have stopped the Professor by yourself. All you can do is turn into a cat."

She stopped next to him, and swept her long hair back to show a collar around her neck. "See this? It's a recording device. It transmits directly to the U.N. Security Council."

"You mean?"

"Yes," she said. "They're on their way here now to arrest the Professor. Unfortunately I had to blow my cover to arrest your sorry arse. You'd better hope that he doesn't remember me when he wakes up."

Caleb frowned. "Wait, last year... Razorwoman. She was arrested based on an anonymous tip off before any superhero could find her. Was... was that you too?"

Catgirl purred, but said nothing.

"And then there was Machete Man, The Vulture, Tobias the Otter..."

The purring grew louder.

"Well, let me out then," Caleb said. He felt suddenly irritated.

Catgirl leaned her face in towards him, so close that he could feel the warmth of her skin, and her breath on his neck. She waited like that for a moment that felt like forever, and then whispered, "Until next time, Powerman."

And she stalked away across the room and out the door, until all he could see was her tail, and, with a final flick, that too was gone.

He leaned back against the rock face that he was chained to, and sighed. He hated cats.
