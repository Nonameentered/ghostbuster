An unusual smell hung in the air of my apartment when I got back from the supermarket.

"Lilith?"

An exceptionally pretty head (if you ignored the horns) peered out of the kitchen.

"I've been expecting you, darling," she purred. She was wearing nothing except an apron, but at least that was more than usual.

"Are you cooking something?"

"I am." A tongue darted out and glided over her firm, red lips. "Would you like a taste?" 

"It smells..." I hesitated. There was a definite whiff of sulphur coming from the kitchen - perhaps that was an additional spice in Satanic cooking.

"The flesh of a fallen saint, sauteed in the blood of seven virgins," she said. "With a side of mashed potatoes."

My face must have betrayed me, because she quickly added, "It's my favourite. I know you'll love it too."

"I'm sure it tastes divine," I said, although it sure didn't smell that way. It was the wrong thing to say.

"Divine? Oh darling, how could you say something like that? I spent all afternoon slaving away in here to please you. Do you know how hard it is to find a single virgin these days, let alone seven?"

I was about to pat her on the shoulder when I realized what I was doing and caught myself. "Nice try, succubus," I said. "But I'm onto your game. First you tried to trap me with a night beyond mortal comprehension. Then it was a dozen roses from Satan's personal garden. And now this?" I waved at the vaguely cannibalistic meal she was preparing. "You just want to trap my soul."

"Yes. I mean, no, not like that-"

"Enough, demon," I said. "Don't forget the reason I summoned you in the first place."

A black cloud descended over the beautiful face. "It's not worth it, darling. If you summon the demon lord, he will take both your soul and your mother's. Come away with me instead. We can gambol on the banks of the Styx-"

"I said, ENOUGH! We all have to do what we must." I handed her the shopping bag. "Here are the components for the ritual."

She took it. "You're really going to go through with this, aren't you?"

I nodded. Ma had gone into the hospital alive, but even the best doctors there told me she wasn't coming out that way. Nobody misses their soul, but as sure as the fires of Hell are hot, everyone needs a mother.

Lilith looked at me for a long time. The red fires in her eyes dimmed slightly. Was that a tear? 

"Listen to me very carefully," she said. "I can't dissuade you from this, but I'm not going to let you burn for all eternity for it. However if the demon lord finds out I've been helping you, then we're both in for it, and even God won't be able to save your mother then. So follow these instructions very carefully, and maybe we'll make it to that vacation cottage by the Styx after all..."
