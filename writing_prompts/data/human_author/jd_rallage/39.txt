If we ever rebuild civilization - and I'm not optimistic about our chances - I intend to host a cooking show with a survival twist. 

Humor me for a moment. Picture a handful of would-be chefs foraging for ingredients - tree bark, wood lice, and mushrooms that may or may not be deadly - and then creating masterpieces from those motley baskets. Wow me with your maggot soufle, whipped up from the eggs of low nesting birds. Surprise me with a delicious new twist on rabbit dropping soup, and trust me, if it is delicious, I'll be surprised.

Bonus points to anyone who serves alligator steaks, although as Mrs. Beeton would say, "First catch your alligator."

The idea of alligators in England used to be laughable, but it's amazing how warm a winter can get when it's nuclear. I'm roasting snails over my campfire, and I'd trade several minor appendages for a good beer right now. I might even hand over a pinky toe for a Bud Light, if I had either of my pinky toes left. Say what you like about the apocalypse, but it does make you appreciate even watery beers.

Speaking of snails and survivalist cuisine, how about this new recipe that I like to call wilderness s'mores? Squish a snail between two dry leaves with a dollop of mud in lieu of chocolate, and tell me that doesn't tickle your taste buds. In fact, I'm going to try it right now. I'll let you know how it goes.

Okay, the recipe needs a little tweaking, I'll admit. But I've had worse.

According to the map, I'm one day from the ITV headquarters. I've crossed half the globe to get here, fought off cannibals and bears, eaten bears with the cannibals, and cannibals with the bears. They call this the Cinema at the End of the World, and I've heard whispered stories over campfires of men and women who made the pilgrimage here. I doubt there will be many stories about me, and if there are, it won't be me telling them. I've taken enough radiation on this trip to fry a moose, and I speak from experience when I tell you that mooses are great with wild garlic and mushrooms - assuming you don't use the deadly kind by mistake, but nobody makes that mistake twice.

No, I don't think I'll be leaving the Cinema after I get there. For one thing, I've got to find out who wins the last finale of the British Bakeoff. And once I'm done with that, I hear they have the uncut reels from the filming of the second season of Firefly.
