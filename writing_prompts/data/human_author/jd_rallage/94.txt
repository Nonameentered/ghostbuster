Hi /u/hpcisco7965

I read your story for the contest and wanted to leave some feedback.

First, well done. I thought it was well written and technically proficient, and probably the best in group F from these stand points. It was also funny and easy to read.

However, I had a few qualms which ultimately resulted in me not picking it as the group winner.

First, while the style of constant joking works well for flash fiction, it actually got a little grating by the end of 5000 words, and I think if this was a full novel I would be pretty sick of it by the end (but maybe that's just me).

This also didn't seem like a first chapter so much as a short story in its own right. This may have been what you were going for, but why should I come back and read the rest of the book based on this story? There was some vaguely hinted at king's business that they were supposed to be doing - is this the rest of the novel? If so, some more foreshadowing of it might help.

At times the plot felt like it was being driven by the humor, and several promising plot arcs/conflicts never really developed, or developed in ways at odds with the way you introduced them earlier in the story:

* D&L interactions vary wildly from fairly pointed insults to chummy banter
* D&L ignoring the King's important business to help the Floogans, but never bringing this up later in the chapter
* the nature and history of the Floogans relationship with humans: you make lots of jokes about Floogans being underestimated, but never really develop the background of this outside of the banter (speaking of which, why did Penny vote for the xenophobe mayor, but happily sleep with the human Dave?)
* the apparent conflict between 21st century social views and plumbing with an otherwise medieval fantasy setting

I think the larger point here is that humor is great, but in a longer story it cannot come at the expense of plot and consistency.

The characters seemed a little one dimensional. Obviously, one can only cover so many dimensions in the first chapter, but it would be good to see them become more developed, perhaps with more internal conflicts. For example, Luke comes across as the nerdy wizard, but what about Dave? What is he, apart from a "washed up merc" and ladies man? Did he have dreams and aspirations that were never realized, and that now drive him? Why is he so concerned about Luke's reputation, when Luke treats him with nothing but disdain?

Anyway, I hope this doesn't come across too critically, and that it's helpful if you decide to develop this further. And well done again for a great entry!
