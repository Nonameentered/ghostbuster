The elevator pinged, and opened onto an unlit floor. The light of the elevator spilled out and showed several shelves of books near by. They stretched off into the blackness, further than Kryvex could see. A musty smell wafted back into the elevator.

He took a tentative step out of the elevator. Immediately, motion-activated lights flickered on overhead, their fluorescent tubes creaking as they woke up from a long sleep.

The sickly yellow light radiated out from where Kryvex stood and he gasped.

He stood in a vast floor of books, far larger than any of the library's floors that were above the surface. Rows of books stretched off into the distance, and he couldn't see the far wall.

Kryvex took a few more steps and picked up the closest book. It was covered with a thick layer of dust, but he blew on the spine and read the letters that appeared. 

> The Storm Approaches: A First-hand Account of World War 3, Volume I by W.S. Churchill IX.

Kryvex rubbed his eyes and reread the words to make sure he wasn't dreaming. This was the kind of book he'd come to Earth to find. But why was it hidden on an unmarked floor?

He opened the book to the first page.

> **Introduction**

> It began as all wars do: with men. But it ended as none had before: with the end of the human race as we know it.

"Can I help you?"

Kryvex dropped the book and yelped, jumping five feet into the air and bumping his head on the low basement ceiling. Ouch. It wasn't the first time that his high gravity strength had been a disadvantage on this planet.

A Librarian regarded him impassively. It was an archaic model, far older than the sleek white Librarians that tended to the upper floors. This one had been yellow once, but what paint remained had faded to a grungy brown color, striped with dribbles of mechanical oil.

Its two camera eyes swiveled down to look at "The Storm Approaches", which had fallen open on the ground.

"Please handle the books with care, sir," the robot said. 

Kryvex's hearts were still racing fast, or he would have caught a dash of disapproval in its voice. He bent down and picked the book up, trying to smooth a crumpled page before the bot noticed.

"Sorry," he muttered. "Wasn't expecting company."

He glanced nervously back at the elevator, which was still open. "Can I check this book out?"

"Error: Action not allowed. Books from the restricted levels may not be removed from stacks."

Damn. Kryvex didn't want to linger here any longer than necessary. He was getting a bad feeling about this place. But the knowledge was so tantalizing...

"May I see your library card, sir?"

"Actually I think I should be going-"

"Error: Action not allowed. Visitors to the restricted level must present authorization. Or else."

*Or else?* That was a very unrobot-like comment. But Kryvex didn't have time for that now. 

The Librarian was between him and the elevator but it looked fairly old and slow. Kryvex felt his muscles coil, and then he leaped, flying over the little bot and landing on four legs. He sprinted into the elevator.

The little bot began to scurry after him. Kryvex mashed the button for the upper level.

A red light on the bot's head began to spin and flash. "Alert. Intruder. Level B10."

The elevator looked as ancient as the Librarian but finally the doors began to close. The Librarian shot forwards and scooted into the elevator just in time. The doors shut firmly behind it, and the elevator accelerated upwards.

A mechanical hand shot out latched onto one of Kryvex's ankles. The other arm reached upwards, hand open. "Give that book back," it growled fiercely. "Thief."

Kryvex reached over and yanked a wire out of the Librarian's control panel. The lights on the bot died instantly.
