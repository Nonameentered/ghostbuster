"I hate Sebastians," Sebastian said.

I nodded. Sebastians were the worst, present company excepted. Well, apart from Kylies, of course, but everyone knew that.

"You're lucky," she said to me. "You get to experience everything for the first time."

Luck, I suppose, was a matter of perspective. It didn't always feel lucky to be in a class of one, struggling to learn to write, or solve calculus problems, or research a history paper.

"If I miss an episode of TV," she said, "then it's ruined. Somewhere, another Sebastian has already started watching it, and I know what will happen. I never had the pleasure of watching The Italian Job for the first time and seeing the twist ending."

"You could watch the remake," I suggested.

"Pssh," Sebastian said. "Don't be daft. Even among 500 million Sebastians, nobody is that desperate."

"Have you ever seen the Grand Canyon?" she continued. "I wish I could see it for the first time, not knowing how amazing it is, and just be swept away by its beauty."

I had never seen the Grand Canyon. I'd seen a picture in a book once, a big gash in the ground, stretching for miles, lined with dry shrubs, carpeted by a trickling river-

Wait.

I had never known this much about the Grand Canyon.

Sebastian saw my panicked face. "What's wrong?"

"Somebody has taken my name," I growled. "Somebody else is called God."

If this continued, there was a danger that I would soon know everything.
