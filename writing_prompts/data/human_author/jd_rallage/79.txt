You gotta act like you own the place, as my old man used to say.

People like confidence. He said that too, and ten years in this racket had taught me that it was more just a platitude. It was a fact of life.

"These would look absolutely wonderful," I said to her. She was blonde, with the hands of a forty year old, and the clothes of a woman ten years younger.

A man shuffled over to join her. He looked at me suspiciously and put a protective hand on her bottom. "What's up darlin'?"

"This young man was just showing me these diamonds. Aren't they wonderful, Henry?"

Henry grunted. He seemed to have little appreciation for diamonds. Or maybe he'd just seen the price tag.

They moved on, and I glanced at my watch. Five minutes to go time.

"Hey, you."

I let the brash voice pass over my shoulder. Always avoid confrontation.

Confrontation, however, wasn't avoiding me. It tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Yeah, you. I'm talking to you."

I turned. A store manager. 

"I'd like a word with you," she said.

The clock on the wall behind her said four minutes and 33 seconds. It had better be a quick word.

I let her lead me through a door that said employees only. On the plus side, she didn't know I didn't work there. You don't lead fake employees behind the scenes of a diamond shop.

"What the hell do you think you're doing?" she demanded.

"I'm sorry?" I said.

"I said, 'What the hell do you think you're doing?" She hadn't left me any the wiser.

Confidence. "I was selling diamonds," I snapped. "I would have made that sale, too, if you hadn't barged in there like that. Now let me go. There's still a chance I might be able to salvage it."

I turned, looking down at my watch. One minute thirty.

"No," she said. "You're not going anywhere."

I turned on her, ready to give her the stare like my old man had taught me, and stared right down the barrel of her Glock.

"Take me to the vault," she said.

I hestitated.

"NOW."

The vault. I knew where the vault was. I just couldn't get to it.

"Accessing the vault requires a retinal scan," I said. "Only employees-"

The tip of the Glock's silencer poked me in the ribs. "Why do you think, you're here, you idiot? You have eyeballs, don't you?"

I did, and they glanced down at my wrist. One minute. I suppose it couldn't hurt.

"Why do you keep looking at your watch?"

Confidence. "Just checking the security schedule."

She looked worried. "What do you mean?"

"The security guard changes in ten seconds time," I said. "That gives us a window of 1 minute and 29 seconds to get into the vault without being seen. Come on."

"Why do you- Hey, wait up."

I led her around the corner, down a set of steps, and into the basement. We got to a large door and a retinal scanner.

She waved the gun. "Go on then."

Six seconds.

"Actually," I said, "I have a small confession to make-"

The vault door exploded.

She was lying in the rubble, coughing. I picked up the Glock from where she'd dropped it.

Her mouth moved, but I couldn't hear what she was saying over the ringing.

"I'm sorry, darlin'," I said. I stuck the Glock in my pocket. "These weren't the eyeballs you were looking for."
