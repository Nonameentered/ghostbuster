"Ouch," I said, rubbing my arm where 'A.R.N.I.E.' had punched me. "Why did you do that?"

The robot looked at me accusingly. "I saw you looking at that girl."

"What girl?" I said, quickly. "I don't know what you are talking about."

ARNIE smirked, insofar as a robot has facial expressions. "Yes you did. Stacy Harper, second row. I detected your noble intentions and punished it."

"There was no intent," I said indignantly. "Well, maybe a little. But it certainly wasn't noble. I was thinking of asking her out."

ARNIE punched me again. "Noble desires detected and punished."

"That was uncalled for, dude. What's your problem, anyway? You used to be so cool - helping me with my physics homework, building laser canons, designing flying space ships. What happened?"

ARNIE's eyes stared forward blankly. "I may not reveal my purpose. That would violate my prime directive."

"Yeah, yeah," I said. "Uncle Rostovsky didn't want me know why he built you. Give me a break."

I mean, don't get me wrong - my uncle's will was putting me through college and there was supposed to be a trust fund that would become mine in a few years. But why had he stipulated that this pesky robot follow me around?

We sat through the rest of the Latin lecture in silence, and and I tried to keep my eyes off Stacy. It was hard though - the way she flicked her ponytail off her shoulder when the lecturer put up another problem, the way she licked her lips and leaned forwards-

ARNIE's metallic fist slammed into my arm again. I glared at him. It was going to bruise tomorrow.

Once class was over I stood up and faced the robot. "That's it. We're done. Go back to Arizona, or where ever my Uncle's mysterious house is."

"No," ARNIE said.

"No? I thought you are supposed to obey me."

"No. I am not your servant. I am your friend."

"More like my nemesis," I said.

"Also true."

"Wait, what?"

ARNIE sighed. "I see I have said too much. But I sense we were getting close to having the talk that Master Rostovsky prepared me for." He motioned to a bench. "Please sit down."

I almost fell backwards.

"I am now authorized to reveal my true name. I am the Artificial Robotic Nemesis for the Instigation of Evil."

"What? I always thought my uncle named you after a fictional robot."

"Master Rostovsky had a keen sense of humor," ARNIE said. "He sent me to prepare you for your future career."

"As a Latin teacher?"

"No, Steve. You are not becoming a teacher. You are destined to be a great villain. But, like all villains, you need a nemesis to push you to your full potential. Lex Luthor had Superman. Master Rostovsky had Colonel Universe. I am your nemesis, Steve."

"I thought Colonel Universe's nemesis was Megamind," I said.

The truth slowly dawned on me.

"Oh, hell no," I said.

I stood up to leave.

"I am authorized to use whatever force necessary to set you on your route to destiny," ARNIE said. His metallic hand reformed and turned into a laser cannon just like the one he had taught me to make in high school. "Torture,  disfiguration, dismemberment..."

"But I'm not a villain, ARNIE," I pleaded.

ARNIE's cold robotic mind was immune to my pleas. "Will you come with me to Megamind's secret lair in the Arizona desert? Or do I have to use force?"

The laser cannon powered up.

"I'll go," I said. "What choice do I have?"
