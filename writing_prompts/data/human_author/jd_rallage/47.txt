The professor rolled his fingers on the thick sheath of papers in front of him, and regarded the graduate student through narrowed eyes. Each of his digits struck the front page with a sonorous thunder clap, that rolled threateningly off the walls of the small auditorium. The air became heavy and humid, as air does before a storm breaks.

Another bead of sweat rolled off the graduate student's face.

The professor's eyes flickered down to the title page of the thesis, and its title: *The Superiority of Monotheistic Beliefs in a Post-modernist Universe.* He sniffed disdainfully. It was time to teach this young whippersnapper a lesson.

"Tell me, Mr-" he paused, looking down at the title page, "-Jehovah, how long have you been in graduate school?"

"Um, two thousand and seventeen years, Professor Woden."

The professor rolled his fingers on the pages again. The oppressive tension in the air continued to build and another examiner pulled out a small umbrella and unfurled it above his head.

"2017 years," Woden repeated, not bothering to hide the disdain in his voice. "And this is what you have to show for it?"

The graduate student swallowed.

"Do you remember nothing from your statistics classes?" Woden asked, his voice dripping with disgust that he didn't bother to conceal. "Control groups? Hypothesis tests? Double blinds?"

The student opened his mouth, but the only thing that came out was a small squeak.

"And that's not all," Woden said. He prepared to reveal his trump card. He'd been saving it for the last round of questions, making the student sweat as much as possible. "I believe the data in this dissertation has been doctored. Manipulated and massaged into the desired result."

Gasps ran around the auditorium. Woden had a reputation as a difficult old graybeard, but this type of accusation was something else entirely.

The chair of the student's committee stood up and motioned for silence. "Do you have any proof of this?" he asked Woden.

"Proof?" Woden said. "Proof? By us Gods, look around you, Siddhartha. When was the last time you went down to Earth to do field work?"

"I'm a theoretician," Siddhartha said stiffly.

Woden snorted. "Well, if you'd come down off your cloud, you'd see that somebody has been meddling in the affairs of mortals they're supposed to be studying." He glared at the graduate student. "Encouraging them to give certain answers. Threatening them with damnation to get the result they wanted. That sort of behavior just isn't appropriate for a serious scholar in this day and age."

The graduate student finally found his voice. "You're just jealous, old man. You made your name with a theory that just doesn't cut it any more. And besides, I seem to remember plenty of meddling from you, back in the day."

"Enough," Professor Siddhartha said sternly. "I'm calling an end to this defense here, to give us time to look into these accusations. Mr Jehovah, you are placed on academic suspension until we reach a verdict."

The graduate student shot a venomous look at Woden, and stalked out of the hall. Woden leaned back in his chair, a smug smile on his face, but inside he felt an odd tightening. For all the young student's arrogance and hubris - *superiority of monotheistic beliefs, by Thor's arse* - the thesis hadn't been entirely without merit. Some of its contents had rattled Woden.

He had become comfortable, he realized. He hadn't kept up with the latest developments in the field. Perhaps it was time for a little excision back to Earth. He hadn't been on a field trip for a few centuries. Of course, he wouldn't meddle. That was reprehensible, a violation of academic integrity. 

But Woden began to smile. Meddling was such a loosely defined term.
