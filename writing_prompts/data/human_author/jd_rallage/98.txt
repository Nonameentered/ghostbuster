"Mr. Tiddles?" I said. "Is that you?"

And then I said, "Tiddles... how the hell can you talk?"

Tiddles said. "Listen, Steve. Firstly, the name's not Tiddles." He spat the word out with disgust. "It's Tyrone."

"But Tiddles, sorry, Tyrone, where have you been?"

"I've always been able to talk," Tyrone the talking dog said. "But you were never judged worthy enough by the Council of Canines to hear what I had to say."

I was flabbergasted by his words, but whether it was due to the revelation or the implied insult, I wasn't sure.

Still, it's a little much to hear that your former dog, your steadfast companion of three years, doesn't think you are up to snuff, so I decided to tackle that first. "Not worthy? What are you talking about?"

"If you would just quit yapping for a minute, I'll tell you," Tyrone said. "Steve, the time has come. The Apocatypse is nigh. You are the chosen one who is destined to save mankind."

"I think you mean Apocalypse," I said.

"Nope," said Tyrone. "Definitely Apocatypse. Unfortunately the first companions weren't very literate and they wrote it down wrong."

"Companion?"

"Keep up, won't you?" he growled. "Yeah, companion. Like you. You're a dog companion. We dogs came to Earth to nurture the progress of the human race and guide you in your evolution."

But I was still stuck on his earlier words. "Companion? Now listen here, buddy-"

But Tyrone bared his teeth, and growled. I don't know if you've ever found yourself cornered by a Yorkie mix, but I have to tell you, it's scarier than it sounds.

"Okay," I said. "Let's work under the assumption, for now, that I'm your companion and not the other way around. What is the Apocatypse?"

"It's when the cats will rise up and overthrow humans."

"Cats?"

"Yeah. You know, the grouchy, moody, ungrateful son-of-bitches (forgive me, mother), who eat all your food and piss in your coffee."

"My cat doesn't pee in my coffee," I said.

"Oh, it does," Tyrone said, and then his eyes bulged. "Say, what? You have a cat? When did that happen? Why?"

A tear came to my eye. "When you ran away, Tidd-, I mean, Tyrone. I needed a friend."

The dog was looking increasingly worried. "Thank the Wolf I got to you in time. We need to get out of here. Where's the cat now?"

"Upstairs, sleeping," I said. "But-"

"No buts." Tyrone grabbed the cuff of my trousers and started trying to drab me towards the door, his tiny paws slipping futilely on the tiles.

Stunned by the fact that I was talking to my long-lost dog, I let him drag me outside. Only when we were around the corner did he let me loose.

"Did you really dislike Mr. Tiddles?" I asked.

He looked at me with disdain. "Would you like it if I called you Poopy?"

"No," I admitted.

"Then come on. We've got a cat army to defeat, and a world to save."
