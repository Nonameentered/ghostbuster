I always bring my backpack on dates. 

Some chicks think that's weird and bail after the first drink, and I can't say I blame them. Would you go out with a grown-ass man in a Lion King backpack? Some of them roll their eyes when they think I'm not looking. A few find it cute, and those are the ones that, when I reach into the front pocket later in the evening, I'll find a little square packet holding a piece of latex.

A backpack can have its uses, even when it's sized for an eight-year old.

I've lost count of the number of times that little backpack has got me out of scrapes. I've had it since my first day at school, and when Billy Thornton and his gang demanded my lunch, I shakily handed over a stack of sandwiches that my mother definitely hadn't packed. I knew that she hadn't packed them for two reasons: mainly because my mother only ever made me salads, and also because Billy and his cronies spent that afternoon in the nurses's office unable to hold back their tears. Apparently some joker had put ghost peppers in their lunch.

A backpack can have it's uses even when it's plastered with the ugly mug of a cartoon warthog and his meerkat pal.

I was on another date tonight (Tinder, if you must know). My faithful backpack was at my side, and I was sipping a gin and tonic, but not through the straw.

She was late. Ten minutes late, and not a single text. It was looking like another bust, which was a shame, because her profile had looked so promising. Her pictures showed a woman far more attractive than I had any right to be matched with, mostly driving Aston Martins through hairpin turns in the Swiss Alps and sipping vodka martinis on beaches in the tropics. *International woman of mystery*, her profile read, and below that, *Jk.* You don't get a lot of those in a small town like this, even joking ones, so I'd swiped right on a whim and instantly matched.

"Meet tonight?" she messaged, almost instantly. "Not much time."

And yet despite that, she was blowing me off.

I reached inside the backpack. Sometimes it's contents are a useful clue to the future. The last time a date flaked out on me, I found a copy of 50 Shades of Grey. I found it rather disconcerting that the spine of the book showed signs of considerable use before it showed up in my bag.

Tonight, there was no trashy romance novel inside the little backpack, or even, as I'd secretly hoped, an unread Playboy.

There was the just the cold, unfamiliar handle of a gun.
