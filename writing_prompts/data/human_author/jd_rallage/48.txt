We'd picked Formian Health because they had the lowest premiums and the best reviews, and because the names of the other health insurance companies were even stranger.

I took my son over to their hospital a week later when he began complaining of a sore throat and a slight fever. The receptionist smiled when she saw us, revealing dimples that any human would die for, and handed me the paperwork for new patients. She gave a small lolly-pop to my son, acidic green in color, and then saw the look on my face and fished out a second.

We sat in the waiting room. My son opened his lolly-pop with the meticulous care of a bomb-disposal expert. I  started on the first form, using the attached ballpoint pen. It was made from a strange metal, darker than steel and shinier than gold.

The first line was simple enough. *First name. Family name. Middle initial.*

Then it got a little strange. *Brood name (if applicable)*. I hesitated, and then left that one blank. Must be some cultural thing that I was unaware of. Probably Asian, I thought. Then I felt a little guilty for that thought, and skipped onto the next line. 

Unfortunately, it didn't get any better.

*Planet.*

I frowned, and wrote 'Earth'.

Below that was a box titled 'Race', and half a page of names that I'd never heard of. *Formian. Xarty. Vexian. Wiirish...* Some of the other options were written in squiggles that weren't even an alphabet.

I glanced up at the the receptionist, but she was deeply engrossed in a phone conversation and I couldn't catch her eye.

So I checked the box next to *Other*, and in the blank space provided, I wrote *Human*. And then I put a question mark after it.

I turned to page 2, and a section titled Medical History. The first line read, *Have you ever had an allergic reaction to substances from the planet Formia?*

Next to me, my son made a choking sound. I turned to see a swollen little face, eyes puffy and red. The bright green lolly-pop had fallen to the floor, only lightly licked.

"Hey," I said, standing up, and then more loudly, "HEY!"

The receptionist looked up, and then she scuttled over to us in a flash of legs. "What-" she began, and then glanced at the half finished form in my hand. "Human?"

I looked at her uncertainly, and she sighed, and hit a button on the wall. In the distance, I heard a buzzer sound. Two nurses rushed out with a stretcher, and loaded my son on.

I tried not to let my panic take over. "What's happening to him?"

The receptionist caught my arm as my son was wheeled away, and then frowned at me. "The doctor will fix him," she said wearily. "But tell me - did you select 'Alien' when you enrolled on the Healthcare.gov website?"

"I thought it was a joke."

She rolled her eyes. "The Obamacare bill was over 2000 pages long. Did you really think that was necessary? Or was it just a lot of bureaucratic legalese to camouflage some... less well-known provisions?"
