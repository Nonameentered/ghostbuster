"What do you mean, 'You lost him'?" In the vast and infinite halls of heaven, the Archangel Ariel stared at the two cherubim in horror.

"Well, uh... perhaps misplaced would be a better phrase...," one of the cherubs said.

"Temporarily stored away for safe keeping," added the other.

"You know, until the End Times come," finished the first.

Ariel's gaze turned inwards, sightless yet all-seeing, and swept over the Earth below. Fires ravaged the land, their smoke joining other toxins to pollute the airs with pestilence. The seas roiled with increasing heat. Life was being constricted, squeezed like a ripe cherry tomato until-

*POP!*

Ariel was wrenched out of her trance. One of the cherubs was sucking a deflated piece of bubblegum back into it's mouth. She glared at it. It stared back at her defiantly. *What are you going to do about it, Archangel?*

"You fools," she muttered. "These are the End Times."

There was a whir of wings and then she was gone.

There was a large suburban house, teetering dangerously close to McMansion status, with a generously proportioned basement. The occupant of this basement referred to it as "The Man-Cave", or sometimes, usually to a member of the opposite of sex, as  "His Bachelor Pad"^1 . Nobody else referred to it as either of those things.

At this precise moment, the aforementioned occupant was engaged in saving the world. "Die, Toby2010," he said, and pulled the trigger. Or rather, hit the key on a controller. A moment later, on the screen in front of him, a pixelated character sublimated into rocket explosions and red mist.

A victory message flashed up on the screen. *Congratulations*, it said. *You have defeated the enemy.*

*Suck it, Toby2010," he said into his mic, and thought he heard a brief, prepubescent sob, before the game took him back to the lobby.

He took a swig of Cherry Coke, and bathed for a moment in the fleeting satisfaction of winning. The game was already connecting him for the next match.

There was a knock at the basement's outside door.

He frowned. Was the pizza here already? He'd only put the order in two minutes ago. With a groan of frustration, he lifted his bulk out of the gaming chair (which seemed to groan in relief as he left it), and lumbered over to the door.

"I gave specific instructions to deliver to the main house," he said as he opened the door. "I'm busy down here-" He froze.

On the doorstep stood the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She was... he struggled for an appropriate adjective... angelic.

She smiled at him. "Christian? Christian Watson?"

"Grngh... uh-hem, yes..."

"I have been looking for you. You were hard to find."

"Right. Well, you know, it's a twisty cul-de-sac. People get lost down here all the time."

"But I am here now."

"Yes, absolutely. Just leave the pies on the side here. I'll tip you of course." He began to fumble around for his wallet, first in one pocket, then in another. Heck, where was it? He was vaguely conscious that she was watching him, waiting. "Hey, I haven't seen you before. Are you new?"

She frowned. "New? No, Christian, I have been here since the very beginning." 

"Oh right. Look, I must have left my wallet inside somewhere. Can you hang on a second-"

"Can I come in?"

He goggled at her. Had she really just asked that?

"Er, yeah-" But she was already stepping into basement.

"Welcome," he said. "This is, um, my Bachelor Pad. Where I chill. With my homies and my hoes." He giggled a little nervously.

She glanced at him, with eyes that seemed to pierce into his soul. 

"That was a joke," he said quickly. "No hoes."

"I am glad to hear it," she said, with the faintest note of reproof in her voice.

"In fact," he added, feeling that this was perhaps a safer strategy, "you're the first woman who's ever been in here."

Now she smiled again. "Chastity is an admirable quality, Christian."

"I don't mean... I mean to say... well, I have had girlfriends... I mean, there was a girl once who... You know, I've done things." He trailed off. There was something about this woman.

She waved a hand, a little impatiently, he thought.

"Right, the tip. Hang on a second, where's the pizza?"

"Pizza?" she asked, puzzled.

"Yeah. I ordered two pies. A large pepperoni, extra cheese, and an extra large Supreme, no vegetables-"

"Christian!" she snapped. "This is not the time for gluttony. The fate of the world hangs in the balance."

Gluttony? What was this crazy b-

There was a hail of machine gun fire from the direction of his gaming rig, and then a young voice yelled, "Suck on that, SatanLoves69!"

Christian glanced over at the screen, and saw with dismay that the next match had already started while he'd been busy with pizza girl. A message popped up: *Slain by Toby2010*. Toby-*friggin'*-2010, that little punk.

"This is kind of important," he said to the woman. "Can you hang on a second?"

"Satan loves sixty-nine?" she said.

"Yeah. It's been my handle for a while now."

"You are Christian Watson, aged 33, born under conjunction of two comets?"

'Yeah... wait, comets?"

"Christian?" A shrill voice called his name from upstairs in the main house. "Christian, is there somebody down there with you?"

"It's ok, Pam," he yelled back.

"Christian, is that a woman down there with you? I'm sure I heard a woman's voice just now."

"Mother!" he cried in exasperation, glancing embarrassed at the pizza girl. "It's just a friend from online."

Feet began to shuffle overhead. "I'm coming down there, Christian."

"Oh, geez," he muttered. "Listen, I'm sorry about this, but you've got to go. If she finds you here..."

The woman did not budge. "Christian Watson. You were born under the conjunction of two comets. Nostradamus himself predicted your coming. It is foretold that only you can save mankind and deliver us from the evil that awakens. Already, demons reach for the light and the Leviathan stirs in the deep. I am come to you late, and for that I am sorry, but I, Ariel, Archangel of God and herald of Host, come to you now and ask for your help. I say, you do know how to wield a sword, don't you?"

Christian Watson stared at her in open disbelief. Eventually, he said, "Yeah, you've got to go."

"Christian, listen to me-"

"Look, lady, I don't know what you're selling, but I know crazy when I see it, and you're it."

A door slammed behind them, and a small woman entered the basement. She stopped short, staring at Ariel. "Christian, who is this?"

"Mother-"

"Is this your girlfriend? Christian, you know how I feel about you having girls over. You need to tell me and keep your door open at all times."

"Mother-"

Pam, mother of the Chosen Once, turned to Ariel. "Are you his girlfriend?" she asked directly. "I have to say, I am relieved. He's never had one before, have you Chrissy? I was starting to think he was gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that," she added quickly.

"I am not his girlfriend," Ariel said. "I am here... for a job interview."

Pam's eyes, which had briefly fallen, lit up again. "A job interview! Oh Christian, you sneaky little puss, you never said a word. After everything I'd been saying about getting a job, you finally listened. So, when does he start?"

Ariel looked from son to mother, and then back to the son. She made a decision. "I'm afraid we won't be making an offer. The firm has decided... the firm has decided that we will probably stand a better chance without your son's contributions." She turned to go.

"Now you wait here," Pam said. She was surprisingly fast, and was in the doorway blocking Ariel's exit. "You're not going anywhere, missy, until you tell me exactly why my little peanut isn't good enough for you."

"Your son," Ariel said in the most un-angelic voice she could muster, "shows no signs of education for the tasks that we require him to do."

"I'll have you know that he applied to Harvard," Pam said angrily. "And his medication for depression, anxiety, and everything else interferes with his motivation."

Ariel said nothing. She gave Pam the Hard Stare, the look that had famously quailed even Alexander and Napoleon.

Pam stared back just as hard. "Fine," she said. "I'll do it for it for him. Out with it, what exactly does this job entail?"

Ariel stared at her. A moment ago she had been despairing. All hope for humanity had seemed lost, without a champion who would not give up the fight even when all was obviously lost. But now, she wondered, maybe, just maybe... was there a chance after all?
