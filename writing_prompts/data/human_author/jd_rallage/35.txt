This is pretty awesome! Let me know when you've written a story about this!

Are the mutants being created as a side-effect of the magic (i.e. is it altering DNA like radiation), or is this just a natural part of the evolutionary process? Can a normal adult become a resistant mutant, or are you born one?

> Even wars are rendered pointless. If your armies are able to be siphoned at a moments notice, then what's the point?

Presumably each wizard has to maintain their own "army" of thralls to use as a power source. Otherwise you'd be vulnerable to another wizard who has more people to draw on. Also, you'd want to use your thralls for all day-to-day magic, so you don't expend any of your own life.

> Thus, mage thralls become a very prevalent thing. Instead of Wizards being the minority, they are the majority.

??? Wouldn't wizards be the minority? Because it would make sense to have huge thrall-breeding programs, so that you could have as many thralls as possible, and be more powerful than the other archmagisters.

Also, in such a system, I would imagine that any wizard with dreams of world domination would want to find a way to harness his thralls only to himself, so that they couldn't be stolen by another wizard. Such a mechanism may or may not be possible, depending on your preference, but would vastly alter the dynamics if it could be discovered. (If it exists, it might be reverse engineered by the non-mutant thralls to make them immune to siphoning by *any* wizard).
