Lights.

They flashed blue and red behind me from the cop car. In the rear-view mirror I could see the faint outline of the driver, the faint line of his mustache, and the glint of white knuckles on the steering wheel. How old fashioned. I didn't even have to put my hands on the wheel of this Tesla. I put my foot on the brake and prepared to swing over to the side of the road.

The car didn't slow.

Shit, shit, shit! A thousand self-recriminations ran through my mind. Why did I have to be first on the waiting list for the new Tesla? Why hadn't I waited for them to iron out the kinks first? Why was I being pulled over for doing 25 in a 30 zone? Why-

And then my foot hit the brake's rear stop, and the car began to respond. Unwillingly at first, and then like a petulant teenager, it stopped all at once and the police car screeched to sudden halt behind me.

I sat in a fog of fear and burnt rubber, and waited as the cop got out of his car and began to plod toward me with the methodical steps of an oncoming freight train. In a flash of inspiration I reached over and switched my dashcam to high quality. You couldn't be too careful with cops these days. One heard all sorts of stories.

"Ma'am." The cop was at my window.

"Officer," I said, giving him my sweetest smile. I wondered if it would have helped to undo another button on my blouse and, well, you know, perk things up a bit. It was too late now, of course. His blue eyes were burning down over the mustache at me.

"Do you know why I pulled you over, ma'am?"

It was a question I'd been thinking about since the car had come it's reluctant halt. It couldn't be speeding. I'd been doing five under. I thought guiltily of the text I'd sent a few minutes earlier at the red light, but he hadn't seen that. And besides, the car could drive itself - I should be able to text as much as I wanted. Maybe my tail light was out? 

It was then that I noticed that his hand was near his hip, and loitering with intent.

"Er," I said.

"Step out of the car, please, ma'am," the cop said. At least he was polite. "Put your hands on the roof."

"What's going on?" I asked.

"Your plates are flagged in the system," he said. "Where were you last night, ma'am?"

"I was-" I hesitated. "That's a very personal question, officer. May I ask why?"

"This car was involved in a hit and run," the cop said quietly.

I almost turned to stare at him, but then I remembered his gun. "But... but that's impossible. I was home all night."

"Got anyone who can confirm that?"

"Well," I said. I realized that I was blushing. He *was* quite good looking, despite the mustache. "Unfortunately, no. I was home alone."

"We're going to wait for back up, ma'am," he said. "Then we'll get all this straightened out."

Camera.

"Camera," I said. "The dash cam. It will show that I was home."

"It was recording then?" he asked skeptically.

"Yeah," I said. "The new Tesla, you know. It's always on. It's a security feature. Look-"

"Don't move," he said. "I'll get it." He reached into the car, and came out with the dash cam. When he emerged, he said grudgingly, "It's a nice ride. Pretty expensive, these babies."

"Yes," I said. I could afford it, though. Maybe if I couldn't, I'd have had the time to have more of a life and wouldn't have been alone the previous night. Then I realized that he was looking at me funny. "Oh. I meant, yes, it's a nice ride. Not that it's expensive. Although they are. But I wasn't trying to brag. You know," I finished lamely. 

The blue eyes stared at me. I couldn't tell if they were laughing or judging, or both. They turned to the dashcam.

I waited while he rewound it to the previous night. He operated the camera in silence, and eventually looked up at me.

"I'll need to cuff you, ma'am," he said.

"What? But there's nothing there."

"I'm afraid it's all here, ma'am. Just as the report said."

"But that's impossible! Wait, look at the reverse camera. I won't be there."

He gave me a dirty look - there was no laughter in the blue eyes now - but he looked. Then the blue eyes widened.

"Where's the driver?" he said.

The acorn of a thought, a dark, rotten acorn, began to sprout in my mind.

"It's a self-driving car..." I said slowly.

There was a low grumble of discontent. Thunder? The cop's stomach? Oh God, my stomach?

Action.

The car started suddenly under my hands, and then jerked forwards. Gravel and dirt spun up under the wheels as it sped off in a racing start to make Steve McQueen jealous. Say what you like about electric, but these newest models can get some sweet torque.

The car executed a perfect handbrake turn, and stopped to face us, forty yards away. I got the feeling that it wanted to rev its engine threateningly, but it was electric. It threatened in peaceful silence.

"Run," I screamed at the cop. He was staring at the car in disbelief.

The Tesla began to accelerate towards us, orange blinkers flashing like a bat out of hell.
