"Rectal probing," my immediate neighbor said. "I saw it on the History Channel. They did it to Tutankamun, and all them other pharaohs. That's how all those mummies were made."

"And I suppose all the babies were delivered by stork-shaped UFOs," the woman across from us sneered. She struggled again in another attempt to break free of her restraints, and was, once again, unsuccessful.

I had given up fighting against the restraints some time ago, after the first futile minutes of panic upon waking up in a strange dark room. It was impossible to tell how long we had been in here since then. Hours? Days? Hunger had come and gone, and come again. Thirst, too.

We had come to the conclusion that there were twenty of us in the room - ten men and ten women. If there were others, they were either still unconscious, or dead. All of us could feel hard metal restraints fastened around our limbs and torsos, and the prick of strange needles in our veins.

Many theories had been propounded by my companions as to the reason for our unexplained captivity. Kidnapping by drug cartels, detention by the CIA, or imprisonment by a deranged psychopath. The merits of all had been debated and discarded as implausible. What was being injected into our veins? Nourishment or poison? All we really knew is that each off us had been going about our daily lives in one moment, and then had woken up in the dark.

Some of us, however, had stronger opinions about the cause of our plight. "When aliens abduct you," my neighbor continued with authority, "it's for experiential purposes."

"Experiential?" I asked.

"Yeah," he said. "You know, doing stuff to you. Giving you drugs. Poking you. Seeing how you work."

"You mean experimental," I said. "Experimental purposes."

"That's what I said," he said.

"Don't humor him," the woman across from us muttered to me.

"Now I ain't claiming to be an expert," my neighbor continued (he had decided some time ago that the woman was a hopeless unbeliever, and ignored her ever since), "but I knows what I knows. When it comes to aliens, the one thing to remember is-"

"Oh, do shut up," the woman said.

I was growing tired of trying to keep the peace between them. Each of us were dealing with the captivity in our own ways, but while the others in the room with us had long ago fallen into dejected silence, my neighbor was a talker. Worse, he spoke with the cheerful gloom of one who derived a secret pleasure from our misfortune.

Personally, I would have like to fall asleep, but out restraints held us upright in a standing position, and it was too uncomfortable to slip back into blissful unconsciousness. My nerves were fraying from fear, fatigue, and hunger.

I opened my mouth, about to lose my temper and snap at them, when the faint hum of the room suddenly changed.

"Did you hear that?" "Did you feel that?" "What was that?"

The hum grew louder. The room began to shake slightly.

Somebody in the darkness began to pray loudly.

For about five minutes the room shook, and then as suddenly as it had began, it stopped.

"We've arrived at the alien mothership," my neighbor announced. "Next they'll be back with the probes-"

"Shut up," multiple voices chorused in unison, mine among them.

Twenty sets of restraints clicked open simultaneously. The needle in my arm retracted with a prick of pain. I stumbled forwards, unprepared for my sudden freedom and bumped into somebody. "Argh..." It was the woman who'd been held opposite me. We held onto each other for a brief moment in the darkness, seeking momentary reassurance from the touch of another human, and then recoiled as if we'd burnt each other.

Something whirred and clanked, and then the darkness of the room was split by a vertical line of light. After so long in the blackness, it was blinding, and it took a few moments to for me to realize that a pair of doors were sliding open.

Several people rushed for the new exit immediately. As soon as they were outside, I heard whoops, sobs, and other sounds of relief. Others followed.

I was the last one out. I had a sinking feeling that whatever the next stage of this misadventure was, our apparent freedom was misleading.

We were outside, standing on blackened earth, but surrounded by greenery and trees. There were twenty of us, but, glancing around, no sign of any captors. Behind us was a strange metal tube that had been our prison. It had a unique design, as if created by a mad architect trying to blend the gothic and the futuristic, and failing at it.

"We're free," somebody said.

You could feel the sudden uptick of spirits. Twenty souls, all suddenly daring to hope.

"We can't be that far from home," somebody else said, but I knew that had to be wrong. During our time in the darkness, we'd got to know a little bit about each other, and discovered that we had been kidnapped from all over the world. Several people didn't even speak a shared language. The woman who'd been held across from me was from Australia. My alien tour-guide neighbor was from England.

I looked at them both now. She was tall, with short hair and a tan that would have made me think 'surfer' if that hadn't been too much of a stereotype. He was middle aged, pot-bellied, and bald. Hell, they were both stereotypes.

"We will be home soon," the woman said, with the conviction of the desperate. She glanced around. "Where in the world are we?"

The Englishman was looking up at the sky. I caught his gaze briefly, and he nodded upwards.

I looked up with him. The sky was blue, the sun was bright, and the moons were both up early. It was a beautiful day to be mysteriously kidnapped.

The pit of my stomach lurched suddenly. 

Moons. 

There were two of them.

The Englishman looked at me and grinned with the glee of a much-maligned man who'd unexpectedly found himself proved right. He said, sounding as if he could barely believe it himself, "We're not on our world."

He was right. I looked down at the grass - it was the wrong shade of green. I looked up the trees - their branches grew in odd, unnatural shapes. I looked around at my fellow travellers, who were now starting to notice the moons in growing horror.

"Where ever we are," I said, "I don't think we're getting home any time soon."
