"Oh, I don't know," I said. I hoped that my voice sounded as nonchalant to her as it did in my head. "Now seems like a pretty good time."

"Really?" She let out a low, braying moan. How I hated that sound. "We're tied up, about to die, and you want to talk about last night? Honestly, Steve, do you really need *me* to tell you why we're divorcing?"

I ignored the sarcasm in her voice. "I'd rather not meet my maker with this business unresolved."

She snorted. "Don't you think we'll have plenty of time in heaven?"

"Certainly," I said. "But I don't expect you to be there with me."

That earned me a furious wriggle. We were tied back-to-back, with an ominously tickling box between us. The cable ties around our arms and wrists didn't allow us much freedom. It was the first fight we'd had in years where nothing had been smashed. It was a shame. I really felt like throwing a vase at Linda right now.

A wire ran from the box to a rudimentary dial that ticked down the seconds in demoniacally glowing red LCDs. The dial of the clock was the only light in the little room our kidnappers had deposited us in apart from the blinking light of a CCTV camera on the wall. Whoever the assholes were who'd stolen us from our hotel beds that morning, they wanted to watch us suffer.

The counter hit the ten minute mark.

"To get back to my original question," I continued once I'd steadied my nerves, "what I don't understand is why you waited until we were on vacation to ask for a divorce. Wouldn't it have been easier back home?"

"Hey, this vacation wasn't my idea," she snapped. "Blame our marriage counsellor, why don't you? But no, you were the one who had to flash your wallet every time a pretty local girl came near you. You know, that's probably why we got kidnapped. Somebody wanted your money."

"I doubt it. I still have my wallet and they never asked for a ransom."

"Do you have a better idea?"

"I do," I said. "Where were you last night?"

"None of your business."

"Oh ho, I think it is. You're still my wife. For another nine minutes, anyway."

"Fine. I couldn't bear to be in the same room as you after I asked for a divorce, so I asked the hotel for a different room."

"With a view of the water." It wasn't a question.

"How do you know-. Oh."

"Yes," I said. "'Oh'. I saw you gallivanting about on the balcony last night. But did my eyes deceive me, or was there a second figure up there with you. Perhaps that pool attendant you were so fixated on all day."

She tried to lash out at me with her leg, but the ropes holding us together were too tight. She settled for, "You bastard. I might have known you'd poke your nose into my business."

"I may be a bastard," I said. "But at least I'm no whore."

"Did your secretary tell you that before or after she fucked you?" She was screaming now. God, I loved to wind her up. If these were the last nine minutes of my life, at least I'd get as much entertainment out of them as possible.

"Well, my dear, it may have escaped your notice but adultery is illegal here. Perhaps this is the local way of telling us to take our Western immorality back where we came from."

"So you're blaming me for this?"

"My, your remarkably bright this morning. Did you forget to take any of those pills you're so fond of?"

In hindsight I was lucky she was tied up. As it was she thrashed like a crocodile's prey trying to get at me and, like the prey, it didn't do her much good.

When she'd stopped struggling, she slumped back against me, and began to heave giant sobs. 

"Don't cry, honey," I said. "Think of all the money we'll save on the divorce."

Before she could respond, the door of our little prison opened, and a shadowy figure came in. A disgusted, but familiar, voice said, "Ok, that's quite enough. Untie them."

I squinted towards the woman. "Madeline?"

"Yes, Mr. Harley. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you'll be spending quite a lot on that divorce after all. Mrs. Harley, it's ok. This was just an exercise."

My wife began to scream. "An exercise? AN EXERCISE? I'll have our lawyers on you so hard you'll wish you were... you were... Don't just stand there Steve, help me out!"

"Actually," Madeline James, America's most famous (and expensive) marriage counsellor, said, "you won't. Do you remember that little contract you signed when you started your sessions with me? You gave me permission to use any means I deemed necessary."

As hands loosened the ropes that bound me, I found my voice at last. "You mean... this whole vacation was a set-up?"

"I'm afraid so, Mr. Harley. I often prescribe vacations to the clients that I counsel. Perhaps you remember the moonlit elephant ride that I planned, which was supposed to rekindle your romance. Until you lost your temper at the driver in a drunken rage, and were thrown off. Or the private cruise on the yacht, that accidentally left you stranded on the island? You were supposed to bond over that, not threaten to cannibalize your wife."

"And this was a bonding experience too?"

The marriage counsellor sighed. "I've used it as a last resort on seven couples before you too. In each case, they were able to work together to escape and overcome their differences through the experience. It even worked on that famous Hollywood couple who were always in the news until they hired me. But you two..."

She shook her head. "If that had been a real bomb, I don't think either of you needs to worry about ending up in Heaven." And before I could have the satisfaction of firing her, she added, "Consider this a termination of our arrangement. When you get home you'll find my final bill in the mail."
