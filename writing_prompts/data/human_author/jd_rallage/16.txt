It was a night without a moon, and even the stars had hidden underneath their cloudy covers. It was a whisperless night, when even the katydids cowered in their cocoons. It was the graveyard shift, but even the dead did not turn in their graves tonight.

It was a night for monsters. It was 2:03am in Jacksonville.

In the patrol car on 12th, the call came over the police frequency, loud in the silent night. "10-92 on Ellis. Requesting back up."

In the passenger seat, The Rookie looked over at his supervisor. "That's just around the corner." He reached for the mic.

Ramirez caught his hand. "Easy there, kid." She reached into her pocket and pulled out a phone. It was a cheap flip-phone, barely used.

"Sergeant," the Rookie said, more urgently. "They called for back up."

The phone in Ramirez's calloused hand buzzed once. She clicked open the text, read it once, and then tossed the phone out the window. It skidded half-heartedly across the road until it landed in a pile of discarded Big Mac wrappers and mostly empty Jose Cuervo bottles in the opposite gutter.

"First day?" Ramirez said. She put the patrol car into drive and did a leisurely U-turn.

"Sarge, Ellis is the other way."

"Relax, kid. We're not going to Ellis."

"But, sergeant-"

"Listen, Rookie, the first thing you gotta learn about this job is that the radio ain't where its at. He's listening to the radio. We've had to adapt."

The Rookie just stared at her. Ramirez sighed. "You ever wonder why this town is the way it is? I mean, we got just as many cops as any other place. Hell, we got more cops that Tampa, and they don't have half our problems. Mostly, they don't have our Problem, capital P."

"I don't understand," the Rookie said, glancing back over his shoulder to where the turn onto Ellis was disappearing into the greasy darkness of the night.

"The people think we don't care," Ramirez said, launching into the practiced patter of a cop who'd been a training officer for a while. "Think we don't show up when there's a crime, or when we do we're too slow. But we gotta be subtle. Gotta get the situation under control without alerting him, or everything goes to hell. You remember that bridge collapse last month?" The Rookie opened his mouth but Ramirez didn't wait for a response. "Some kid like you fresh out of the academy was fool enough to put out a genuine 10-92 on the radio. A 10-92, Rookie, you know what that is? Yeah, some idiot parked in the wrong place. But two minutes later he's there, and now the Hart Bridge is in two pieces."

The patrol car cruised off into the night, and made an unhurried right turn onto Melson.

As it disappeared into view, the Rookie's voice could be faintly heard saying, "So that text was the real deal?"

"You're a quick learner, kid. The real... 10-94 on..."

All sound receded, but only for a second. Moments later the silence was - well, if not shattered, then at least lightly dented - by the faint hum of an electric motor. A golf buggy did a sharp turn onto 12th Street from Ellis, with barely enough speed to rock briefly onto two wheels.

The buggy had a single occupant. What hair remained on his head dyed brown up to half an inch from the roots, where it changed to grey. He drove with only one hand - the other balanced a beer can on a protruding belly that seemed designed to hold a drink.

The man peered both ways down the street, and then crumpled the beer can in disgust and flung it away. It clattered angrily across the street before knocking against something in the gutter.

It took a moment for the unusual sound to register with the man, but when it did he spun the golf buggy after it. The beer can was resting against a discarded flip phone, its screen still glowing. He picked it up and squinted at the screen. Then he fumbled through a series of pockets, before patting them all again a second time, and then finally finding a pair of reading glasses perched on top of his head.

He replaced an orange mask with the spectacles, and peered through them at the flip phone. "'10-94 near Memorial Park. Urgent assistance requested.' So that's how those buggers are doing it."

He flipped the phone shut. "Sometimes I wonder who the real villains are in this city. Well, you can't keep a good hero down for long."

He replaced the orange mask, and was about drive off when he noticed something else in the gutter. A smile twitched the corner of his lips below mask, and he reached down and picked up the mostly empty bottle of tequila. 

Bottle safely in hand, he floored the accelerator and the buggy puttered slowly off in the same direction that the police patrol car had recently headed. Before the night settled its soiled blanket of sinister calm back over 12th Street, his voice drifted back on the hot air, "Jose Cuervo, eh?" A pause, and a flash of a reflected street light off raised glass. "Can't let the good stuff go to waste. Now that *would* be a crime."
