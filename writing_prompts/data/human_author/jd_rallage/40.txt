"The game is no limits Shire hold'em," the hobbit said. A golden name badge pinned to his waistcoat read "Fidelius Took VIII".

He cut the deck with a practiced swipe, and began to flick cards out across the green felt table to each of the four players.

A round wooden token rested in front of the player who sat on the dealer's left. With each of that player's breaths, a rush of hot air pumped out over the table and the edges of the token were already beginning to smoulder. Fidelius sighed. Typical that the boss would let dragons in, but not pay for nonflammable upholstery. One bad night for a dragon would fund any casino for a year, assuming, of course, that the dragon didn't burn down the house in a fit of pique.

On the other side of the dragon, leaving a generous gap between them, hovered a small winged humanoid. The fairy pushed a gold coin forward from its stack to make the little blind. Fidelius had heard rumors that one of the Fey Folk had come to town, apparently something of a well-known player in Fairy country, but he was surprised when the creature had shown up at his table. 

The player opposite Fidelius matched the fairy reluctantly, pushing two coins out onto the table. The hobbit could see the her eyes narrow at the perceived injustice of forking out the big blind, when she didn't even know if her hand would be any good. The hobbit suppressed a sigh. Orcs made for terrible card players. Still, at least they didn't cheat like goblins.

The last player didn't take his eyes from the dragon, except for a brief flicker down to peek at the corner of his cards. The man hadn't even changed out of his armor, which bore the crest of Gondor. Tacky, very tacky. He would probably have kept his sword if it wasn't against the rules of the house. From the way the knight glared at the dragon, Fidelius wasn't sure that would keep him from causing trouble if an excuse for a fight arose. The hobbit had already signaled the pit boss to have the trolls on standby in case things got ugly.

A scantily clad lady hobbit, well proportioned in all the right places and a few of the wrong ones, swept up with a tray of drinks. Ales for the orc and knight, Fire Whiskey for the dragon, and a Mordor Iced Tea for the fairy. An ambitious choice, Fidelius thought, smelling the alcohol from the other side of the table, but fairies could hold their liquor.

Still, the wooden token was getting blacker by the second, and a few onlookers had drifted over to watch. It was time Fidelius raked the blinds into the middle of the table.

"Gentlemen," he announced, and then hastily added to the orc, "and lady. Shall we begin?"
