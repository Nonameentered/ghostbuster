I was staring down the barrel of a gun when I heard his voice.

I mean this metaphorically, of course. I had the muzzle of the old family revolver pressed up against the roof of my mouth, below the lowest level of my eyes, which were closed anyway.

"Hi?" The voice was tentative, young.

I almost blew my brains out in shock, which would be a much more disappointing way to go than from despair.

"Hi?" the voice said more loudly, as if speaking to someone partially deaf. "Is anyone there?"

I lowered the gun enough to say, "What the fuck?"

"Oh, hey! It worked."

"Are you an angel?" I asked. I looked down at the gun in my hand, but it definitely hadn't been fired.

There was a chuckle. "Goodness, no. Those chaps don't speak to us unless we're dead. And... I say, you are alive, aren't you?"

"I'm alive, kid," I said. "For now."

"That's great," the voice said. "That's awesome. 'Cos we're soulmates, you know."

"Soulmates?"

"Yeah," the voice said, as if this were a perfectly natural thing to be. "Soulmates. You know, connected over space and time. I did a spell so that we could find each other."

"A spell?" I looked down at the cold metal of the revolver for reassurance. Had I shot myself after all? Or was I just mad? "Listen, kid, I don't know what you think you're doing but-"

"I can explain," the voice said hastily. "Just give me a moment."

"No," I said. "I don't talk to voices in my head. That way lies madness."

"In person then," he said. "How about if we met up? Where do you live?"

"I'm not going to tell a stranger where I live," I said.

"If I'm just a voice in your head, then what's the harm?" it said. "And if we really are soulmates... wouldn't you want to meet?"

I thought about this for a moment. Then I told him.

"Oh," the voice said, a little crestfallen. "That's kind of far. But I suppose it's worth it. I say..." here the voice hesitated, "I say, are you a, er, a girl?"

Oh, kid. "I'm a girl."

"Oh, that's great," the voice said. "That's just awesome. Don't go anywhere. I'm going to take the first flight I can get, and I'll be there tomorrow."

He wasn't there tomorrow, but he did arrive the day after that, and I didn't go anywhere, not that I could've even if I wanted to, which I did. I didn't shoot myself either, but I didn't want to do that any more.

The doorbell rang at thirteen minutes past ten, and the kid was standing on the doorstep. He was young enough to still have a few pimples, and old enough to know better.

"Hi," I said. "You must be Mark. I suppose you'd better come in." I wheeled back to allow him space to step in.

He didn't move, just stared at me. "You're..."

"Old enough to be your great grandmother?" I suggested. "True. In a wheel chair? Also true. But I'm dying, and it's cold out there, and I don't intend to spend my last day on this world freezing my butt off. Get in."

He stepped in, but he didn't stop staring at me.

"But I thought..."

"You thought that your soulmate would be younger and prettier," I said. "I know. I thought the same thing too, a long time ago."

He blinked, finally, breaking his stare. "What?"

"You're not the first one to try that spell," I said. "How'd you find it? A dusty grimoire in a mysterious shop that had vanished when you returned?"

"No," he said, "it was on the internet. But- but, you're a wizard?"

"Yeah," I said. "But not for much longer. Cancer's a bitch, you know. So take your coat off and come on in to the kitchen. I'll fix you up a cup of coffee, and then I'll tell you what you need to know if you're going to survive to my age in this business."
