Hi /u/0_fox_are_given

Good first chapter, well written, with an interesting setting and intriguing characters.

I have a few comments, mainly relating to the plot, and consistency.

First, you hint that Pride is going out on important business that is, presumably, related to his dreams of success. Yet he ends up going to a bakery, and then goes home. Is the bakery really the business that he bragged to Arabella about, or is there something else that he didn't get to because of the bullies?

And related to that, if there was other business, why did he just go back to the orphanage after the incident? There is a potential for some good conflict here, if whatever task he was supposed to do now goes undone because he tried to stand up to the bullies.

However, I don't see why he would necessarily go straight home afterwards - Pride seems like a fairly resilient little tyke who wouldn't let an incident like that through him. Instead, this seems like a slightly forced direction to take the story so that you can get Pride back to the orphanage.

Pride voluntarily confessing to the matron also seems unlikely given how you introduced his character. He's perfectly happy to play truant and torment the matron, but he won't tell a little white lie to save their skins? I'm not saying you shouldn't have the confrontation with the matron, but you could have her catching him lying and forcing the confession out of him, which has the additional benefit of increasing the drama and conflict in the story.

Hopefully these thoughts help, and I also hope that you continue on with the story. I'd love to read the whole thing when it's finished.
