The Greek delegation had arrived in Rome, and the citizens of the center of the universe could talk of nothing else. These Greeks were something else. So many wonders, so much knowledge. Cassius had even overheard suggestions that Rome should become more like Greece. 

But today, the delegation would come before the Senate and the Emperor to offer their tribute and swear their fealty. Cassius snorted. *Greek superiority, indeed.* The mere suggestion was absurd. If they were so superior, how come they were now vassals of Rome?

Cassius bowed in front of his household shrine, and offered a brief prayer. *Guide me, ancestors, as I go about my business, and Rome's.*

He was about to straighten up, when he heard a voice in his head. *Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.*

Cassius frowned at the shrine, and waited, listening. The candle burnt steadily. Had he really heard a voice, or was it just his imagination? But there was nothing else, and after a few minutes, he stood up, straightened his toga, and left for the Senate.

The Senate was packed. No Senator would be absent on a day like this. The Emperor sat at the head of the room, awaiting the Greek delegation.

Three men entered the room. The came up to the Emperor and bowed. One stepped forward and offered a small box.

"Hail, Caesar," he said. "I am Alexander. We come bearing your tribute."

The Emperor frowned at the small box. Rumors had been flying around the city about what the tribute would be. The delegation was small, and had travelled light. Too light to bring gold, and the most popular theory was gemstones. But this box was so small that even if it was filled with gemstones, it would not be enough to pay their tribute.

The Emperor took the box and opened it. As the Senate craned their necks for a better look, he put his hand inside and withdrew a strange, metallic object.

"And this is?" the Emperor asked. He did not attempt to keep the displeasure from his voice.

"An object of power and magic," the delegate called Alexander said. "A gift from the Gods themselves. If Caesar will permit me to demonstrate?"

Cassius could see that the Emperor was furious. But the Greeks were too popular to strike against without risking a backlash of popular wrath. Instead the Emperor forced himself to hand the object back to Alexander.

Alexander gripped one end, and pointed the other at the Emperor.

*Beware,* the voice shrieked in Cassius's head. *Beware Greeks bearing gifts!*

He started to rise, started to shout. "No! It's a weapon-"

There was a loud noise. Cassius watched in horror, and the anger of the Gods crashed down onto the Senate of Rome with thunder, smoke, and light.
