**Part 2.**

Somebody was shaking his shoulder.

"Master Wayne. Can you hear me? Master Wayne!"

Bruce Wayne blinked up at Alfred. He groaned as the pain of a score of wounds and bruises flooded back over him. "Argh."

"If you'll permit me the liberty of saying so, Master Wayne, you look terrible."

Growing up, Bruce had often thought that Alfred was unflappable. But now he could hear genuine concern in the old butler's voice.

"Get the medical kit," he managed to say.

"You should have called me as soon as you got in," Alfred said, and Bruce realized that he was already in the process of cleaning and bandaging his wounds.

Bruce tried to remember the previous night. Memories came back in a haze: crawling back to the Batmobile, trying to maintain conciousness as he drove home through the warren of Gotham City's back streets, and then... the last thing he remembered was half-climbing, half-falling out of the car in the Batcave. He looked around at the cave ceiling above him. He must have passed out almost immediately afterwards.

"It can't have been The Penguin," Alfred was saying. "He's still in the pokey, from what I hear. Is Bane back?"

"No," Bruce said between clenched teeth. "Somebody new."

Alfred sighed. "That's not good. Did you get his name?"

"Her's," Bruce said. "She called herself Sonja Van Helsing."

For a moment - just a moment - Alfred seemed to pause. "Van Helsing?"

"Yeah. Heard it before?"

"Just... stories," Alfred said. "Tales from when I was a boy, about an old family of heroes who hunted villains in Europe."

"Sounds like they weren't just stories- ouch!"

"Hold still," Alfred said. "This is a nasty head wound. Did you drop your guard? This must have been a nasty punch."

"It was a bullet," Bruce said.

Alfred froze. "A bullet?"

"Helmet stopped it."

"Barely," Alfred said, examining the cracked Bat helmet where it had fallen next to Bruce's body the previous night. There was a large crack down one side, and one of the bat wings had been severed.

"Lucky shot," Bruce said. "For me, I mean. Must have glanced off."

"It did not glance off," Alfred said grimly. "It was a perfect shot, and the bullet is still embedded in the helmet." He peered closer. "But it's a soft metal... silver! The deformation of the slug must have absorbed a lot of the force. If it had been a regular bullet..."

"Silver," Bruce said. "Yes, she mentioned something about that."

Alfred helped him to sit up. "I would chastise you to be more careful, but I've observerd in the past that such advice only makes you take even greater risks. But you won't always be this lucky. What happened? Did you have to retreat?"

"No," Bruce said. His memories of the night were fuzzy, but they were starting to come back into focus. He could remember the cold patter of raindrops on his cheek as he'd lain in the alley, staring up at his death. "Somebody else came along. Another new player."

"Who?"

"No name," Bruce said. He felt tired. He wanted to go to bed and get another night of sleep all over again. "Alfred, do you remember that time when a bat flew into my room when I was a boy?"

The old man furrowed his brow. "Yes, Master Wayne. I remember being quite impressed with the way you handled it. But what-"

"It had black eyes."

"Not terribly unsual," Alfred said. "Many animal eyes look black in the dark."

"It was more than that. They were completely black. No iris, no whites. Just black orbs."

"I assume there is a reason for this sudden journey down memory lane?"

Bruce thought of the second stranger from the night before, and shivered again involuntarily. Alfred looked at him with concern.

"They had the same eyes," Bruce said. "Completely black. And it wasn't just the night. Also..." He trailed off. It sounded ridiculous.

"Yes?"

"I think whoever it was turned into a bat and flew off."

Alfred was looking extremely grave. "And left you, even though you were covered in blood?"

"Yes. They mentioned my blood, now that you remind me."

"Oh, Master Wayne."

"What is it, Alfred."

"In the stories... in the stories, the Van Helsing's hunted all sorts of monsters. But, in particular, they hunted vampires."

"I'm not a vampire," Bruce pointed out.

Alfred looked around at the Batcave, the Batmobile, the broken bat helmet, and a hundred other bat-themed pieces of iconography.

"No," he agreed. "But it would be an easy mistake to make."
