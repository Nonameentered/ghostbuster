It will surprise almost none of you to learn that cheer teams frequently summon demons. 

The cheerleaders are usually surprised, of course, although they should have thought of that before they jumped around chanting and waving their hands in patterns that bear an unfortunate resemblance to arcane runes.

The surprise is usually short lived, and the survivors rarely have the mental capacity to speak of the horrors that they witnessed. We were just lucky that the first time it happened, Mary Sue was standing next to the hula hoop that she'd accidentally taken to church that Sunday. The demon was almost as shocked at finding itself contained as the preacher was when the entire cheer team turned up to hear his next sermon (hula hoops conveniently left just inside the door of the church).

Demons, we learned, have their uses, from a bit of genteel sabotage of opposing cheer teams, to punishing boys who stand a girl up at Arbee's on a Friday night (let's just say that he'll think twice before he dips his mozzarella sticks in somebody's marinara sauce again, if you catch my drift).

It was all going devilishly until I summoned the imp Lubiz, who popped into existence inside the hallowed gold circle (we had moved on from hula hoops by this point), blinked once, and immediately began to grin.
 
"Awesome," it whispered. "This is the mortal realm, isn't it?"

"Demon," I began. "I conjure and bind thee to this plane. Shoulds't thou wish to return to the planes of hell, you must-"

"Pssht," Lubiz said. "Why would I want to go back there?"

I hesitated. "Um, demons always want to go back there. It's warmer there, and they're always talking about the open bar after work."

"Well, that's alright for the higher demons," Lubiz said. "But somebody's got to serve those drinks, and do you think you any of those rakshasas, djinn, or incubi volunteer for that? Oh, no. It's 'Lubiz, bring me another mimosa', or 'Lubiz, where is that strawberry daiquiri that I ordered, and Lubiz, don't forget the little umbrella this time or I'll have you take over from Sisyphus for the next millenium.'"

"If you complete the task I have for thee, I shall let you return," I said desperately. "I need you to retrieve the answers to tomorrow's test from Ms. Starell's office."

Lubiz pouted. "I have a better idea. Let's go out. Now that I'm here, I want to see some of this world. What do you girls usually get up to on a-" it pulled out a battered flip phone and looked at the date, "-Tuesday night?"

I glanced around at my team mates. They were looking back in horror. 

"I have your number programmed in here," Lubiz was saying. "We can go and get dressed up, and then meet up at, say, 7? How about Arbee's? Everyone in hell has heard about that one, and I've been *dying* to see it."

The squad captain mouthed two words at me: "Banish it."

"You are banished," I said desperately, and made the shape of the rune in the air.

There was an unhappy squeak, cut off half way through, and then the imp popped out of existence.

"I guess we'll have actually to study for tomorrow's test," one of the other girls said finally.

In my pocket, my own phone buzzed. It was an unknown number, from whatever place in the world has the +666 country code.

> If 7 is too early, how about 8? Chocolate shakes on me?
