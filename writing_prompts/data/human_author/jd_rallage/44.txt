"What's this?" the old man asked. He eyed the mug of dark liquid suspiciously.

"It's called coffee, Gramps," the kid said.

"Never heard of it," the old man said. "Where the Hell is my mead, boy?"

The kid sighed. "Just try it, Gramps, please. I know you'll like it."

The old man took a cautious, tentative sip, and then his eyes brightened and he smacked his lips appreciatively. "This is good stuff. Fit for a God." He chuckled, and downed the rest of the mug in a single gulp.

The kid smiled politely, as if it wasn't the first time he'd heard that line. "Carefully now, Gramps..."

But the old man slammed the empty mug down on the table with a force that shook the room, and the kid winced. "Bring me another mug of this nectar, boy. It makes me feel alive."

"Right-oh, Gramps."

"And where's that mother of yours?"

"She, er, she just popped out to the shop," the kid said.

But the old man caught the hesitation, and his cloudy blue eyes cleared and fixed the kid with an electric gaze. "Don't lie to me, boy," he said softly. "Where'd she go?"

"She'll be back soon," the kid said. He took a step backwards towards the kitchen. "I'll just grab you that coffee-"

The old man waved his hand, and froze the kid in mid-step. Only the boy's eyes were able to move, and they darted nervously towards the door. The old man struggled out of his armchair, and hobbled over to the kid. As he walked, he made heavy use of a cane, and his breath came out in a rattle. He touched a mottled hand to the kid's brow, and his face took on a distant look.

The old man's mouth began to twitch, quietly muttering words under his breath. "You're my grandson... you look after me because I'm ill... no, no, that can't be right. Tell me about your mother, the Goddess... ah, there she is... wait-"

The wheezing breaths became louder and more agitated. "What is she doing... NO!"

The old man staggered back. Whatever force had frozen the kid was released, and the boy jumped forwards to steady the old man. "It's OK, Gramps. Here, let me help you back to your chair. There you go."

"My daughter," the old man said. "My kingdom. My throne. She stole it..." A note of anger had crept into his voice, and sparks began to crackle in the air around him. 

"No, no," the boy said quickly. "Ma's just looking after it for you. Just until you get better, Gramps. We all want you back."

"Am I getting better?" the old man said. 

"Oh, yes," the kid said. "Definitely. Here, turn the TV on and I'll fetch another coffee for you."

The news flashed onto the TV screen, the volume several notches too loud. The breaking news banner at the bottom of the screen announced that a huge earthquake had struck the west coast just a few minutes earlier, and a weatherman was discussing the unexpected buildup of a thunderstorm of unusual strength over the midwest.

The kid came back with a steaming mug, and placed it down next to the old man. "Here you go, Gramps."

The old man eyed the dark liquid suspiciously. "What's this?" he asked.
