"It's been wonderful having you," my host mother said. I called her Ma. I'd managed to learn the basics of Alpha Centaurian, but I'd never got my tongue around the all the vowel-less syllables in her name.

"You must be looking forwards to having your daughter back though," I said.

Ma nodded. "Of course. I've missed R- very much. But it's been great to have you. To think, a year ago our civilizations were on the brink of warfare, but now everyone here thinks humans are simply wonderful."

Pa came in. I couldn't say his name either. In fact, I hadn't really managed anyone's names. But they'd all been very nice about it.

"I've got your spaceship ready," he said. "Are you sure you'll manage the journey by yourself? You've never done such a long hop before."

"Yes, thanks," I said. "You've done a great job of teaching me how the warp drive technology works. I should be just fine."

They saw me off with great fanfare. The event was televised planet-wide, and I found out much later that nearly 3 billion Alpha Centaurians had watched my departure.

As it turned out, however, the voyage did not go 'just fine'.

I popped out of hyperspace in the middle of my own solar system, half way between Mars and Earth. Or rather, where Earth should have been.

In the distance beyond was Venus, but in the spot formerly occupied by Earth was a large wall floating in space.

There was one small door in the wall. As I tentatively approached it, a large cannon emerged from a port hole and trained on my ship. It was laughably primitive technology, and probably wouldn't have been able to hit the Centaurian ship even if I'd come to a dead halt, but it was worrying none the less.

"Halt and identify yourself." The angry voice came over the ship's loudhailer. It was the first English I'd heard in a year.

"Bob Jones," I said. "Returning from Alpha Centauri."

"Who?"

"Bob Jones," I repeated. Had they forgotten me that quickly? "I was the exchange student sent as part of the peace treaty. An Alpha Centaurian, R-, stayed here with my family."

"Oh," the voice said. "Her."

There was a long static-filled pause, and then the voice returned. "Prepare to be boarded for inspection."

"What-" I began, but the hull of my ship shook and I heard the side door open.

A man came into the pilot room. He wore a uniform that said Alien Registration and Security Enforcement. I was unfamiliar with the name, but I was pretty certain about two other things. He looked human and he definitely had a gun.

"Come with me, Alpha Centaurian" he said, waggling the gun.

"I'm not-" but he waggled more threateningly, and I stopped protesting.

They transported me to the door in their own ship, and frog marched me down a series of bleak concrete corridors, finally depositing me into a small room. It was empty apart from two chairs, one on each side of a scratched and dented table. I sat down in one of the chairs.

On the wall of room, somebody had graffitied the letters "M.~~A~~E.G.A."
