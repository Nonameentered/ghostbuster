"-your ten-eighteen is Mr. Parks from accounting, and your ten-thirty-two is Ms. Hollywell from the Asian investment division."

My secretary paused for breath, an unspeakable offence when listing my day's routine.

"Then?" I snapped.

Her face became panicked, but she knew better than to try and apologize. "Then at eleven-oh-one your driver will take you to the golf course to meet James Gold of Gold and Sons."

I grunted. "That'll do, Simpson." My secretary scuttled quickly over to the door, eager to flee the scene.

I caught her before she could reach her freedom. "Simpson?"

"Sir?"

"Who was that strange looking fellow sitting outside?"

"He said he was here to see you, sir, he said-"

"Does he have an appointment?"

"Um... no, sir."

He had given me the most peculiar smile when I walked in. It had been completely unnerving, and even I had been a little shaken. You could tell, because I didn't reprimand my secretary for um-ing. I detest verbal tics. Very inefficient. "Then get rid of him, girl."

She vanished, and I took a sip of the fresh espresso that had been placed on my desk.

When I turned around, he was standing there. The coffee reputed from my mouth, and a fleck landed on his starched white collar. He pulled out a handkerchief and dabbed at it distastefully.

“That was a little unnecessary, don't you think?” he said. His voice was as soft as silk and as sharp as a razor.

“I'll tell you what's unnecessary,” I said, the words exploding out almost as violently as the coffee. “You. SECURITY!”

He took a seat in the chair opposite my desk, a seat designed especially to make my guests uncomfortable while I interrogated them, and he relaxed into it as if he were going to take a nap.

“SECURITY!”

“They can't hear you, you know.”

I rounded back on him. “Who the devil are you, and where the hell are you from?”

“An apt choice of words, Mr. Jones,” the man said. A lit cigarette appeared in his hands. He'd obviously missed the plethora of no-smoking signs plastered throughout the building. “Tell me: if your lunch with Mr Gold goes well today, what will happen?”

“How do you know about that?” I said.

“Humor me,” he commanded, taking a long drag of the cigarette. I felt an urge to ask him for one, even though I hadn't smoked in decades.

“Well,” I began hesitantly, although a part of me screamed that I should say no more. He had to be corporate espionage, or something like that. “If all goes well, we will acquire Gold & Son's.”

“The food conglomerate,” he said, although we both knew it already. “And then you'll restructure, laying off thousands.”

“They'll be cuts,” I said defensively. “But that's just good business.”

He tapped his fingers on the desk, and regarded me thoughtfully. I thought I saw a flap of something white and feathered behind his back, just for a moment.

“Who are you?” I asked again, but the words came out as a whisper. “Are you an angel?”
 
“Some might have said so once,” he said. “Me, I prefer to think of myself as a facilitator. Come.”

He extended his hand.

I recoiled, but it didn't matter. In the time it had taken me to blink, my 48th floor Manhattan suite had become somewhere else, something far less pleasant. I gagged on the smell.

“Where is this?” I asked.

“I thought we'd do a site visit to a meat packing plant,” he said. “So you could see what you're acquiring. After all, that's just good business, no?”

“Take me back,” I muttered. “Whatever you want, money, women, they're yours.”

“Oh, I'm afraid it's too late for that,” the man said. “I don't think they would even let you in the front door of your office building, Mr-” he reached over and lifted the name tag on my overalls, “-Lopez. Mr Juan Lopez.”

I looked down at my hands, the hands of a stranger, scarred and calloused.

“What…” But I was too stunned to finish the sentence.

The man looked down at his watch. “The real Mr Lopez is about to enter a meeting with Mr Parks from accounting. A very competent man, if I may say so. I wonder why you've not given him a raise in three years.”

“But-”

“24 hours, Mr Jones, or should I say, Mr Lopez. 24 hours to meet the man you once were, or this will become your life.”

And, just like that, he was gone, leaving me alone in the filth and the stench. He wasn't an angel. He couldn't be. Because this sure as hell wasn't heaven.
