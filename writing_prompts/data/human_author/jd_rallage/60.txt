> What gets you in the door with a movie or book?

With a book, it's really good writing that grabs me from the first paragraph, not so much the idea. With a movie, I pick more based on the high concept idea. That said, I appreciate a good internal journey once I'm inside.

> What internal conflict fits with your main character? How can you lay the groundwork for this internal conflict?

Kirin, the lowly thief, is on a personal vendetta against the Imperial aristocracy. She gets magically blackmailed into stealing from the Emperor's cousin as part of a plot to destroy the Empire, but ends up liking/falling in love with the man. She's now torn: she's caught up in a plot that will destroy the Empire, which she hates... but if she succeeds, she will cause the death of the man she's developing feelings for.

At least, that's now it plays out in my head. I'm going back through the first draft now and trying to tease this conflict out more satisfactorily.
