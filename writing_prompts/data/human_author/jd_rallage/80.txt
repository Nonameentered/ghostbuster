"Nurse..."

The word was dragged up from the bowels of the dying man's lungs by the shear force of his will. 

"Save me. Please..."

Nurse Agnes Harricot let herself turn towards the soldier. His uniform, once green and neatly pressed, was now in bloody brown tatters. Shrapnel from a German bomb had ripped through his clothes and then his abdomen.

She cast an expert eye over the man's wounds. Lethal, yes - he had no more than a few hours - but far from incapacitating. Nurse Harricot had long believed that stomachs were an overrated organ.

She bent down to the man's head and whispered, "Say that again."

"Please, nurse, save me." 

That was good enough for Nurse Harricot. It was such a nuisance that necromancy required the subject's permission. Fortunately, permission was an ill-defined concept in these modern times.

"Very well," she said, and she plunged her fist into the hole in his stomach.

The man screamed before he died, but what was one more voice in a tent full of the dying, in a world full of shelling and machine guns? Nothing, that's what it was. The other nurses were too busy to even look up.

Nurse Harricot withdrew her blood-soaked hand from the soldier, and reached into her pocket for a stick of wood about a foot long. She rested the tip of the stick on the man's forehead and began to mutter.

"Dona mihi potestas-"

As she spoke, her eyes rolled back in her head and a single bead of sweat began to gather on her brow. The air around the corpse's body began to crackle with static energy, making a loose strand of Nurse Harricot's hair that had escaped her bun leap to attention.

"-Animari!"

A spark of electricity popped out of the stick and vanished into the forehead of the corpse.

The dead man's eyes opened, and he sat up on the bed.

Dead lips opened and moved. "I am yours to command, Mistress."

"Go to the forest ten miles west of here," Harricot said. "Find the others. Await my further instructions."

The corpse nodded and got up from his death bed. Something fell from his stomach onto the muddy floor with a splat, but he shambled off uncaring.

"Nurse Harricot," an exhausted voice said behind her, "do you have Bed 38 ready- Oh!" The doctor looked down at the empty cot. "What happened?"

"He got better, sir," Harricot said. "I sent him back out to join his army."

The doctor shook his head. "You're a real medical marvel, Nurse. When this is all over..." He winked, and she felt a pinch on her bottom before he scurried off to another patient.

*When this is all over, Doctor, you will be the first to feel the wrath of General Harricot's army.*

Nurse Harricot picked up the section of intestine that had fallen out of the dead man as he left, and tossed it into a bucket spilling over with organs from other soldiers. 

It would not be long now.
