"We have identified a likely specimen," Krynkos said. "He appears to be a male of the species."

"Is he defenseless?" the captain asked.

"He is wandering alone in the woods," Jethryk said. "This planet is so inhospitable that these aliens usually cover themselves with artificial protective coatings. However, this specimen is not wearing any protective coverings on the top half of his body."

The captain nodded. "OK, green light for abduction."

Krynkos snuck through the stationary green lifeforms that covered most of the planet. They had tried abducting one of these a few days prior. However, the creature had proved unresponsive to interrogation, and rapidly withered to an even less responsive brown husk.

Then they had tried to abduct one of the small brown many-legged critters that infested most of the planet. The persistence and indestructibleness of these creatures had persuaded the Lugonians that these must be the dominant lifeform on the planet. Unfortunately that had proved wrong. Even more unfortunately, one had apparently escaped and now the ship appeared to be infested with them. No poison that the Lugonians knew about had been successful at eradicating these pests.

"Let's abduct one of the jiggly pink things," Krynkos had suggested. "They seem to be at war with the little brown aliens. Maybe they can help us."

The captain had agreed, and ordered him to find a promising target.

Krynkos was creeping up on that poor, unsuspecting soul right now. Jethryk was keeping the shuttle's engines running so that they could make a quick evacuation once the target was acquired.

Krynkos pulled out his laser taser and set it to stun. He raised the weapon towards the alien's back and -

Bzzzz!

The taser fired, but the man rolled out of the way with the reflexes of Pwetyrian assassin and lunged towards Krynkos like a Caniu bear. 

Krynkos was knocked the ground, and his arms pinned back. The alien pulled out a syringe and stuck it into Krynkos. Krynkos felt a stab of pain, and the sky began to cloud.

The alien leaned close, and Krynkos caught a whiff of a pungent, highly toxic chemical on the man's breath. *They consume that poison*, he thought in terror. *Who are these people?*

"In Mother Russia," the man whispered into Krynkos's ear, just as the world went black, "we abduct you."
