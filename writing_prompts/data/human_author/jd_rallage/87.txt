"Ten minutes until planet-fall," First Lieutenant Bridget O'Hara said.

The vibrations of the ship hummed under her feet, massaging her soles with a gentle intensity that she had grown to ignore over the past two years. Just two years, but it felt like a lifetime since they had last stood on the solid ground of Earth. O'Hara could barely remember what an unmoving surface felt like. Once, six months into the trip, the vibrations had stopped for a few tense hours. O'Hara had thought that was it: the end. Too many lightyears from Earth to get an SOS off, and parsecs from the nearest system, which was uninhabitable anyway.

Captain Aurelio had been calm then, leading the engineers to fix the light-speed drive before the systems failed, and the trivial matter of reaching their destination was not going to disturb his composure either. "Prepare a shuttle for departure. Lieutenant. You're leading the first landing party."

O'Hara nodded. "Aye, aye, sir."

She was in the shuttle bay supervising the shuttle's diagnostics check when she felt it. They all did. The vibrations fell away as the light-speed drive shut down and handed power over to the orbital engines.

"We've arrived," Jansen said. O'Hara could see the glint in the Midshipman's eyes. It was all exciting to these kids, especially after the long journey.

The captain's voice came over the ship-wide coms. "I'm pleased to announce that we have arrived safely at XE13." Once the cheers had died down, he continued, "Scanners indicate that the atmosphere is high in oxygen, surprisingly, as when we left Earth, long range sensors indicated the atmosphere was mostly carbon dioxide. Despite this, there is no sign of photosynthesis. Toxic gases are confined largely to areas of volcanic activity, but most of the landmass appears habitable."

And then over O'Hara's personal coms, Aurelio added, "You are clear for take-off, Lieutenant. Good luck."

As the shuttle hurtled down through the atmosphere, flames licking up past the heat shield and dancing across the viewing ports, O'Hara mentally rehearsed proper protocol for landing on a planet. It came instinctively, as it should do to a person who had practised the procedures over and over in the simulation rooms.

"All right, folks," she said, as the shuttle's thrusters kicked in, and the sudden deceleration pushed them down into their seats. "You know the drill."

The three crew members nodded. It wasn't much of a pep talk, but it didn't need to be. They had practised the landing alongside her every day of the two year space hop.

The shuttle came to a rest on the rocky surface. It was barren, so unlike Earth.

O'Hara quadruple checked one final time to make sure that everyone's suit was on and sealed. The scanners may have read an Earth-like atmosphere, but there was no reason for unnecessary risks.

"Pressurization complete," Janson said, looking at her expectantly.

She nodded, and he flicked a switch, opening the shuttle's side door.

O'Hara stepped out onto XE13.

The rocky surface of the planet slammed into her foot, and she staggered. Gravity. Mustn't forget it would be stronger here than the artificial gravity generated on the ship. 

"This is one small step for a woman," she said into the coms, knowing that most of the ship would be listening in, "but one huge step for humankind."

She heard Jansen let out an unnecessary whoop. 

Something reflected off the glass of the visor, something green.

Green? This was supposed to be a dead planet.

She turned. Something tall and green was loping towards her, with long legs carrying it easily over the boulder strewn floor of the planet.

"Jansen," she yelled into her coms. She activated the laser cutter built into one hand of the suit. It wasn't supposed to be a weapon, but over drinks one evening they'd discussed, jokingly, the best way to defeat any aliens on XE13.

But the green thing stopped, thirty metres from her, and then got down on it's hands and prostrated itself on the ground.

"I don't think it's dangerous, Lieutenant," a voice said, Jansen's she thought but it was hard to tell over the nervousness. She noticed that she was alone. The other three lingered in the safety of the shuttle.

The thing shuffled closer, and she got a better look at it. It was human-like, but yet not human.

"My god," it said. "Thou hast returned as the legends did foretell, raining down from the sky in a cocoon of metal and fire. Welcome. Welcome to Earth."
