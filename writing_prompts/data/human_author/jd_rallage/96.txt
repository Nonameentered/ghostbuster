“I was undercover,” Tyrone said, as if this explained everything.

I waited for him to elaborate, but he did not. “That’s it?”

“You thought I was going to spill Top Secret information to a human? Some agent I’d be if I did that.”

“But you weren’t undercover when you were with me?”

“Sort of,” the dog said. “But the stakes are lower with you. Or they were, four years ago, before we knew you were the one.”

“I’m lost,” I said. “So what does an undercover dog do exactly?”

“You’re familiar with the famous dogs of history? Blondi? Laika? No? Well, how about Bo?”

“Bo the former President’s dog?” I asked.

“That’s the one,” Tyrone said. “A good friend of mine, actually. Invited me to dine at the White House on more than one occasion. A real gent.”

“I fail to see the significance of the President having a dog,” I said. “Apart from at photoshoots.”

“Who do you think got that big healthcare law through Congress?” Tyrone asked, incredulously. “Any rational human would have given up long before the Bill got voted on. No, only through Bo’s constant encouragement and nurturing did the President stick with it. Of course, there’s only so much a single pooch can do, so we got Sunny in their as well a few years later. Their second dog,” he added, seeing my blank look.

“The current President doesn’t have a dog,” I observed.

“No,” Tyrone said darkly. This was obviously a sore topic. “Need I say more?”

“Can’t you get a dog in there?”

“Oh, we’re trying. Children are ofter the best way in, so his son has been seeing an unusually high number of cute puppies recently. But it hasn’t had much effect. The Prez is more of a cat person. *They* got to him first.”

“Are cat’s really that bad?” I said. “Sure, they can be a little finicky, but-”

“Stop right there,” Tyrone said. “Cat’s are the worst. Just think about it. If you’re unlucky in love, and you reach reach the later stages of life jaded and cynical, what happens? You get a cat, of course! Or more than one in the most severe cases. Those moggies feed off despair and hopelessness.”

A thousand disparate shards of my universe were beginning to fall into place. It all made so much sense. “What about those other dogs you mentioned earlier?”

“Which one? There was Blondi, a real legend. Adolf Hitler’s dog. Managed to drive him insane before he plunged the western world into tyranny and destroy the seeds of democracy that we spent so long watering. Sacrificed himself for the cause.” Tyrone threw his head back and let out a little howl in Blondi’s memory.

“Who was the other? Oh, Laika. You don’t know that name? Shocking. Another hero. When the Soviet space program was in its infancy, she volunteered to go into a rocket to show that it was safe.”

“Did she survive?”

“Oh no. She knew she'd be boiled alive when she volunteered. But it kept the Soviets hopeful about getting to the moon, and that’s what mattered.”

“I didn’t know dogs were so interested in space travel,” I said.

“Interested? It’s the most important thing. It’s what you need to achieve to become a fully fledged member of the galaxy.”

It was my turn to stop in my tracks. “Wait. You’re from another planet?”

“Didn’t I mention that earlier? It's been a lot to take in, I suppose. Yeah, we’re pretty close neighbors. It’s how we got lumped with mentoring you lot by the Galactic Government. You might have heard of our sun - it's the star you call Sirius. In the Canis Major system.”

He paused for a reaction, but I was still processing the information.

“Canis? No? I guess it was funnier back then. There wasn’t much to do back in the old days, so dogs back then liked to mess with humans a little. Come on, we need to get a move on.”

I looked around at our surroundings. I had been so wrapped up in our conversation that I had paid no attention to where Tyrone was leading me. We had ended up in a posh suburban street.

“Is this where the Canine thing is?” I asked.

“The Council of Canines,” he corrected me. “And no. We need to pick somebody up first. A mutual friend.”

And he smiled, a sadistic wolf-like grin.
