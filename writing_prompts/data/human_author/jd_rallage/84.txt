"It's seen a little use, I'll grant you," the alien said, "but it's as good as new. It'll get you to Alpha Centauri and back in time for supper."

The President looked at the gleaming cylinder of strange purple gas, and said, "What do you want for it?"

The alien - the President couldn't pronounce his name - picked up his untouched cup of coffee and gave it a tentative sniff. He tried a sip, and spat it back out into the cup. "Well, not whatever this drink is made from. What else have you got?"

The President glanced at his National Security Advisor, and said, "Mr Fwqp- er, sir, we have a number of advanced technologies in development ourselves."

"Such as?"

The President began, "We've recently begun work on a plasma reactor-"

"Ha!"

"I'm sorry?" the President said.

"You said plasma reactor. I said Ha! With an exclamation point. I believe that denotes additional emphasis in your language. Plasma reactors are a neat idea, but... well, you'll find out eventually I suppose."

The President exchanged another glance with his advisor, this time more worried. "We've also created a quantum computer. It's still classified beyond Top Secret, but it's enabled a number of significant cryptographic breakthroughs."

"Pssh." The alien waved his hand dismissively. "Come back when you've developed a hyperquantum computer. That's where the real money is these days."

The alien looked at the two humans, sitting dumbfounded on the couch in the oval shaped room, and said, "That's it?"

When neither man said anything, the alien rose and sighed. "I had thought you would be a little further along, given the amount of infra-red radiation your planet is emitting, but I see I was mistaken. I'll be back in a couple of cent-"

A tiny little ball of fluff shot into the office from the garden, and skidded to a halt in front of the alien, yapping loudly.

The alien stared at it. "Is this what I think it is?"

"Um, what do you think it is?" the President said.

The alien gave him a funny look. "A dog, of course, what else would it be?"

The President nodded.

"Dogs are real?" the alien said incredulously.

"Yes," the National Security Advisor said. "Why wouldn't they be?"

"I've seen some of the things that go on in those communications you call movies," the alien said. "Giant apes swinging from skyscrapers. Bringing extinct animals back to life from mosquitos. Ships going across oceans without enough lifeboats. We just assumed dogs were another figment of your imaginations."

"You've seen our movies?"

"Don't take that tone with me," the alien said. "If you don't like it, don't broadcast them into space for anyone to watch. Anyway, I'll take one."

"A dog? In exchange for an FTL warp drive?"

"Yes," the alien said. Seeing the look on the faces of the two men, it added, "Don't look so surprised. My kids have seen that movie... what was it called... 101 Maldations, or something, and they've been pestering me for a puppy ever since."

"We can get you a puppy," the National Security Advisor said quickly. "We can get you several."

"Oh no," the alien said. "Don't you start as well. You sound just like my youngest. One pet will be quite enough until they've learned to take care of it. I think I'll just take this one."

He scooped up the little fluff ball that was still yapping at his feet.

The President hesitated. His kids loved that thing. On the other hand... he glanced at the FTL drive lying on the coffee table between them.

Then he glanced at his newest pair of slippers, which had been torn to shred just like all the others, and the multiple dark stains on the carpet where Fido had... done what Fido did best.

He stood up and offered out his hand to the alien.

"It's seen a little use, I'll grant you," he said, pointing to the dog, "but it's as good as new."
