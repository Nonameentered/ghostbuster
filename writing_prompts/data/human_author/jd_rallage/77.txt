It had eyes of gold - irresistible and deadly when boiling.

"Can we keep it?" Kelly asked. I'd lost track of how many days she'd been wearing the same pair of pink pajamas, and I now measured time by how many stains they had gathered.

I sat down next to her on the bed, exactly where I'd left her at 8:30 that morning. "Honey, it's... it's a tiger."

She pouted. "I knew you'd say that. But look, James, look at it's little paws. Isn't it cute?"

In a wishful attempt to stem the inevitable tears, I looked. They were indeed cute little paws, soft and fluffy and serrated with tiny claws that would one day slice through jugulars like butter.

"It's adorable, but it's a wild animal, babe. I know how much you, we... well, we can keep trying."

She nodded, sadly, and pushed the little cub across the sheets towards me. It flopped onto it's side helplessly, and stuck out a tongue that was the same the color that Kelly's pajamas had once been.

"I mean," I said, "I'm sure they made a mistake..." But Kelly had already rolled away, and was staring back out the window at the featureless brick wall across the street.

I picked the cub up, and carried it out of the bedroom. The phone number of the delivery service was stuck to the fridge door with a magnet in the shape of a smiling toddler, but the flyer behind it was so soaked with tears that the number was almost illegible.

"You've reached the Stork Brothers, your one-stop call for all baby delivery needs. I'm Trish. How can I help you?"

"Hi Trish," I said, looking straight into the golden eyes. "I'd like to-"

"You cut out there, sir. Can you repeat that?"

I hesitated for a second, but only one. It's eyes were very gold. "We'd like to cancel our subscription," I said.

"I'm sorry to hear that, sir. You've been one of our longest customers. May I ask why?"

"I... we've managed to have a baby," I said.

I went back into the bedroom. Kelly did not even acknowledge my entrance, but continued to stare out the window. A pool of tears had formed in the hollow of her pillow. I walked around the bed so that I was firmly between her and brick wall, and placed the cub on the bed.

Its lips opened in a mew that drowned out Kelly's silent sobs. 

"They, er, they must have made a mistake," I said. "But it will need a good home. Who knows what will happen to it if we return it? You do hear awful stories on the news."

Kelly's hand snuck out from below the blanket, and touched the soft fur of the tiger cub's belly. 

"I love him already," she said. And she smiled for the first time since she'd put on the pajamas and begun staring out the window.
