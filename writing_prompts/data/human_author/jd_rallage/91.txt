There was already a large queue of people waiting outside the gates, which were locked shut with a chunky golden chain.

I gave the gate a rattle. There was no answer.

"It's no use," said one of the others. "They're closed."

"Closed?" I said. "How can heaven be closed? It's eternal."

He shrugged, and went back to chewing on a blade of imaginary grass and staring into the void.

A small sign caught my eye.

*Please use other door.*

I looked around, but there was no other door. Just a large pair of pearly gates rearing up out of the nothingness.

I poked the soul who had spoken to me earlier. "Where's the other door?"

He shrugged again. "Damned if I know. I've looked for it. We all have. But there doesn't seem to be another way in."

"Well, how long have you been waiting?"

He pulled a face. "Hard to say, mate. Time doesn't pass here. We just... exist."

I rattled the pearly gates again. I yelled. I stomped my foot. I cried. I took the Lord's name in vain.

None of it had any effect.

"I was supposed to go to heaven," I said. "They told me I would!"

But the other soul had floated off into the void, just lying there and waiting.

There was a small pop, and a little... thing appeared. It wasn't human. Humans don't have horns and red eyes. But it did have a impeccably fitting suit and slicked back hair and a perfect row of gnashers that sparkled whiter than the pearly gates themselves.

"Hi," it said. It looked down at the clipboard. "Bob Evans? Sorry I'm late. Had to catch up on a few emails."

"You're not an angel," I said.

"Goodness gracious, no," it said. "I'm Kreffing. Tormenter of the 63rd Sub-Level of Hell, among other things. I'm here with a fabulous offer."

My eyes narrowed suspiciously.

"Really," the thing called Kreffing reassured me. "It truly is once in a lifetime. People die for this kind of deal."

He smiled. His teeth gleamed. Trust me, they said, nobody with teeth this white would lie to you.

"You're lying to me," I said. "You look like a second hand car salesman."

Kreffing sniffed and drew himself up to his full diminutive height. "I'll have you know I've taken seminars," he said. "One of them was taught by Napoleon Hill!"

I rolled my eyes.

Kreffing must have sensed he was getting off to a rocky start. He cleared his throat. "Anyway, I've come to offer you a place in Hell. Your own luxury torment. A private demon to see to your every nightmare. We even have free Pizza Wednesdays. It really is a fabulous deal."

"Pizza Wednesdays?"

"Yes. We waft in the smell of pizza until you are insatiably ravenous."

"Thanks," I said. "But I think I'll wait for the Pearly Gates to reopen."

Kreffing sighed. "Your funeral," he said. "Don't say we didn't make you an offer."

"What do you mean?"

The demon was muttering to himself. "Oh yes, they always come running back after a few centuries. 'We're bored, Kreffing,' they say. But like I told you, it's a one time offer."

He was floating off into the void. "Hey," I said. "Do you know where the other door is?"

He looked at me with exasperation. "Idiot," he muttered. "*This* was the 'other door'."

"What do you mean," I cried. "Where am I?"

Kreffing smiled nastily. His teeth were no longer white, but stained and pointed. "You fool," he said softly. "You're stuck between heaven and hell. Where do you think you are?"

He popped out of existence, leaving behind only a cackle that drifted off into the nothingness that surrounded me.

Suddenly I knew where I was. I was in Purgatory.
