Hey, great first chapter.

I really enjoyed it, and I hope you continue the story, as I really want to know what happens next.

I also have a few constructive criticisms:

* We never learn much about Darren. There's the brief flashback where you mention that he's divorced with kids, but you never integrate these parts of his character into the rest of the chapter. When he is waiting with dread, is he worried about his children? Has he tried to cross town to make sure they are OK?

* It was hard initially to follow why he was scared. Later in the chapter you cut to a flashback about missiles, which was still a little hard to follow, but you never really integrate this missile crisis with the abduction narrative. Obviously, you want to leave unanswered questions about this mysterious event so that the reader gets hooked, but you don't want to confuse the reader so much that they quit before they get hooked.

Hope these are of some help if you decide to carry on with the story, and best of luck in the competition!
