The sheriff's car lounged on the side of Route 32, the road into Walhalla from the north, from Canada.

Route 32 was a quiet road at the best of times, and it wasn't the best of times no more, not in this weary, Godforsaken part of the country. So the sheriff sat in his car, hand holding a cigarette out the open window, feeling the spring sun beat down on his bare skin. The tobacco smoke drifted lazily up into the lazy air. It was a quiet day, and the sheriff liked it that way. Sooner or later, someone would come up the road. Perhaps they'd be going a tad over the limit, and the sheriff, if his cigarette was nearly finished, would drop the butt onto the dry ground and turn on his lights.

Then they came, down from the North.

The first man was on horseback. He was wrapped in a huge bearskin like a wannabe action flick hero, with a tall sharp spear in one hand, an eyepatch over his left eye, and a raven perched on the opposite shoulder. A man's man, the sheriff thought approvingly, even if he was riding around with a stuffed bird. Still, it took all sorts to make a world.

The man rode on down the road towards Walhalla, not even glancing at the sheriff's car. The cigarette burned a little shorter.

The first the sheriff saw of them was the dust. Some kind of storm, he thought, until he saw the people marching under it. As they came closer, he watched in curiosity, then bemusement, and finally in shock.

They were Men, great bearded men with iron breast plates and scarlet cloaks. There were women too, marching in their midst, with polished swords and strange fake wings strapped to their backs.

The sheriff watched them all pass. The cigarette in his hands burned down to a stump and fell, unheeded, to the dry spring earth.

After the dust had settled, the sheriff rubbed his jaw, and blinked to clear his head. Canadians, he thought. Had to be. Probably come down from Winnipeg. You got some strange folks in the big cities these days. He'd seen his share of oddities in this job, but this was definitely up there. 

He lit a fresh cigarette, and exhaled its smoke out the car window.

It hung in the air, lazily, and then dissipated. Except it didn't. There was still smoke in the air, in the distance, rising less and less lazily over Walhalla. The sheriff could see flames too, crawling up over the houses on the outskirts of Walhalla.

The cigarette fell to the ground, almost untouched, and the light's on the sheriff's car came on. The car skidded out of the mud in a squeal of tires, and hurtled back down Route 32.

Not in my town, the sheriff thought. These punks had come to town to start a fight? He'd give them a fight.
