Another explosion rocked the side of the English classroom, sending a web of cracks running through the wall.

Flakes of plaster drifted down from the ceiling and settled on the blood stained floor like snowflakes on a poppy field.

Ingrid looked up from her notebook to check that their barricades were still intact, and that nobody else was hurt. Most of the remaining students were huddled under their desks. They clutched each other for comfort, waiting for the end. Someone was crying.

She bent back over the page and tried to write faster. They were running out of time. One more explosion, and the Chemists would be through the wall.

A few of the boys had gone out earlier to hold off the Mathematicians, armed with broken table legs and Ms. Kell's cane. That was over an hour ago, and they hadn't come back. Now it was all down to Ingrid.

Why had she agreed to let her parents sent her here? She'd been perfectly happy at Smallville High, but then a letter had come for Mr. and Mrs. Watts, offering their only daughter a scholarship to a prestigious school in the mountains. A successful career was guaranteed - *"All our graduates achieve the highest distinctions in their fields.* - and a list of luminaries followed, many of whom Ingrid knew by just their first names. She'd weakened, even though the school had no website, not even a facebook page. None of its alumni even mentioned it in interviews. That should have been a good clue of what was in store.

The chanting started again on the far side of the school. That was the Physical Education class. She'd seen them battling their way across the main courtyard earlier, with lacrosse sticks and cricket bats, leaving a bloody trail in their wake. They'd be coming back soon, perhaps joining forces with the chemists to finish off the besieged English class for good.

Ingrid scratched a final line on the page, and put down the pen. Her hand was cramped from writing so fast. She could only hope that it would be enough.

She remembered Ms. Kell's final words, just before she'd left. "Good luck, class. You're going to need it. An English class has never triumphed in the End-Of-Year exam before." And then their teacher had left, and the madness had begun.

The glass window had been shattered by a Physics rocket earlier that morning, and Ingrid stepped up to the frame and gazed out at the wreckage of the courtyard, and the bodies of the students strewn across the lawn.

An arrow from the Woodworking class clattered off the bricks to one side of her. At least they'd never been given archery lessons.

"Listen, friends," she began, but her voice was choked with fear, and she stumbled.

She cleared her throat.

"Listen, friends, for I have a fable to tell you of two brothers whose parents set them against each other..."

As she spoke, a quietness fell over the school. The battle chants ceased. The crying student's tears dried up. Even a blackbird stopped its song to listen. Ingrid read the words she'd written and they poured over the school like honey, a sweetness that enveloped the listeners and soothed the angry buzz of war.
