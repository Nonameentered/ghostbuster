I was in the pub. I usually am these days. What else is a retirement check good for?

The television was showing a human sport called 'soccer', which, if you're not familiar with it, involves a lot of running around after a ball, frequent pretense of minor injury, and occasional altercations. In other words, an unremarkable sport by galactic standards, with a remarkable following on this little blue planet.

In general, I tried not to watch soccer games. They reminded me too much of Anna, who had been a promising goalkeeper once upon a time. On this particular morning, however, a big match was on, and the televisions in the pub showed nothing else. I focused on my ten o'clock beer, and tried to ignore everything else.

The screens all flickered simultaneously, and a groan passed around the bar.

"Typical," someone shouted. "Just as the penalties were about to start."

And the screens all came back, but there was no grass, no stadium, no ball. There was just one person now on the screen, one player in a very different game.

"Greetings, Earth," she said.

I stared at the face. I hadn't seen it in eight years, but I recognized it. I'd know it anywhere. You don't forget that kind of face.

"I speak to you on behalf of the Zartarigan Empire. For too long your planet has lurked in the galactic shadows, a haven for pirates and smugglers, a refuge for those who flee Imperial Law. That ends today. From now on you are under the authority of the Zartarigan."

I had to admit, I was impressed. I knew she'd got off the planet somehow, but to make it into the Starfleet and rise to command of a cruiser in less than a decade. Hell, that was almost as good as me. That was a Captain's uniform she was wearing. I felt a twinge of pride, and I suppressed it.

"I have one further request. You will immediately turn over the galactic criminal Zorian Hass, who is wanted for extortion, terrorism, and treason."

Dave the barman's face tore itself away from the screen to look in my direction.

I slid a twenty onto the bar counter. "Keep the change," I said, and left the pub.

I'd known that I couldn't retire to Earth forever. The Empire would come for me eventually. But I had contingency plans.

I just hadn't expected that they would send my own daughter after me.
