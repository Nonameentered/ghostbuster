"Are you *drunk*?" the eagle door knocker asked. It's voice was disapproving, in the superior manner that only an eagle could pull off.

"Perhapsh," Balthazar said. "Had a few Butterbeersh down in Hogshmeade."

The door knocker sniffed. "Alcohol severely diminishes the mental faculties. Reasoning, logic, restraint - all go out the window."

"You'll go out the window if you keep this up," Balthazar growled.

The eagle stiffened, and its eyes gleamed at him. It said coldly, "Very well, let's play it that way. If it's entrance that you seek, then these answers you must speak. Listen closely, Master Grey.

"So fat that her wand is a slim jim. So fat that her boggart is a treadmill. So fat that her patronus is a cake. So fat that her horcrux is the Burger King crown."

Balthazar stared at the eagle. Dimly his brain tried to make partial sense of the words. "What?"

"Don't make me repeat it," the eagle snapped. "I feel dirty having said it just once."

*Fat*, Balthazar thought. *A fat woman.* "The Fat Lady," he said. "The Gryffindor portrait."

"Ha," the eagle said. The answer seemed to humor it, but then it said, "No, not her."

Balthazar's butterbeer-clouded brain tried to process the riddle, but finally froze up. "I don't know," he groaned.

To his surprise, the eagle seemed a little disappointed. "Then you'll be sleeping in the corridor tonight."

"Please no," Balthazar said. "I wasn't supposed to be out on the town this late. If one of the Professors catches me..."

"Then justice will be swiftly meted out," the eagle said, sounding a little happier. "And thoroughly deserved it will be, too. That will teach you to threaten to throw me out a window."

Balthazar slumped back against the far side of the corridor and sighed. "Oh, Mama..."

"What was that?" the eagle snapped. The door to Ravenclaw Tower twitched, as if it wanted to open.

"I said-" Balthazar began, but then he stopped as his brain caught up with his mouth. "Mama! Yo mama!"

"No," the eagle growled. "*Your* mama." But the door swung open to let the drunken student into Ravenclaw Tower.

Half-way in, Balthazar stopped. "A 'Yo Mama' joke? Really?"

"Give me a break," the eagle said. "Do you know what time it is? Besides," it added snarkily, "I match the riddle to the riddlee. Yo momma really is so ugly that she turned Dumbledore gay."

Balthazar rolled his eyes. "I wonder what the other magical inhabitants of Hogwarts will think when they hear of this? The Ravenclaw guardian, stooping to this level."

"You wouldn't," the eagle squeaked, but two spots appeared on its cheeks.

"Better let me in automatically next time I come home late," Balthazar said, and he pulled the door closed behind him before the knocker could say anything.

He snuck into his dorm and got into bed without waking any of the others. After he lay down, his head began to spin dizzyingly. As he drifted off to sleep, the last line of the riddle stuck in his subconscious. The eagle had mentioned something Balthazar had never heard of before. What, he wondered, was a horcrux?
