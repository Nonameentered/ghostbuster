Grief counseling was mandatory. We had all lost everything.

We sat in a circle, in a grey room on grey plastic chairs. By day it was the cafeteria where I now worked, just as I had done in life. By night it was our meeting place.

"I miss my wife," Guilbert de Vries said. He had said the same thing every night, at every meeting, but the circle nodded sympathetically. It was not our place to judge. Only you were allowed to judge yourself now - or so we now had to train ourselves to think.

"We know you do," Angelica said kindly. She was our appointed grief counselor, who led each of our sessions. "But dig deep, Guilbert. Why?"

Guilbert only shook his head.

He was an enigma, Guilbert. He wore the clothes of an earlier age, a doublet that had a rent in over his left breast. He would sometimes pick at the tear, especially after he had finished speaking of his wife. Shortly after my death - or my rebirth, as Angelica liked us to all it - I had asked her about our clothes: why Guilbert always wore a torn doublet and why I always wore the t-shirt with my name on it, and she'd explained that we would remain in the clothes from our pre-life that embodied our decisions during that time. As I'd never owned a t-shirt with my name on it, this puzzled me.

We met every night, the same group of ten of us. My hands would be aching from ladling soup all day in the cafeteria. It was much harder that the school cafeteria, where at least the kids had eventually finished up and gone outside to play. But there was no playtime here, just our daily work and the grief counseling, rinse and repeat.

I had a mailbox outside my quarters (a small, windowless room), supposedly to receive any token of remembrance left for us in our former lives. There had been a bouquet of white lilies when I arrived, apparently the ones the funeral home had picked out, but nothing since then. That was the trouble with a childless existence. Memories are useless if nobody has them.

It was not how I'd imagined the afterlife. I'd always thought there would be something else, something better. But if you'd told me I would spend 30 years persuading kids to pick the salad instead of the chips, listening to their complaints, chiding, consoling, encouraging, only to be stuck in a ghoulish cafeteria for eternity serving those whom fast food could no longer harm, then I- well, I don't know. Maybe I would have done something different. Maybe not. At the time, there hadn't seemed like much else that I could do.

Angelica was speaking to me now. "What about you, Hope? How are you holding up?"

"I'm fine," I said.

She looked at me steadily, for a long time, but a lifetime of dealing with kids meant that I could play the waiting game too. Eventually she moved onto the next poor soul, who was grieving over her many cats, which were too numerous for any of us except Angelica to keep track of.

After the meeting broke up, I trudged the passages back to my quarters. Other souls flitted by, down the dark corridors. I reached for the handle of my room and then stopped and reached for the lid of the mailbox, out of a new habit rather than any expectation of finding anything.

There was an envelope inside, stiff with a stack of photographs. Each one showed a statue, a small figurine of me placed in somebody's house. There was a candle lit next to every statue, and the orange glow illuminated faces that were older than when I'd last seen them in the lunch line. Many were still in Chicago, but some had scattered all over the world.

"How are you holding up, Hope?" Angelica had apparently followed me back to my quarters. Now she held my arm to steady me.

I blinked at her through tears. They were welling up fast, blurring my vision so that she almost seemed to have sprouted wings.

"They remembered... I didn't think..."

"You touched a lot of people," Angelica said.

I wiped the tears away. She was just a normal woman. No wings - those must have been a trick of the light.

I turned back to the door to my quarters. The handle was warm and I dropped it in shock. Nothing in this place was warm.

Angelica was smiling at me encouragingly, just as I had smiled at so many children, little dream-lets of potential.

"Go on," she said.

"Those aren't my quarters behind that door, are they? At least, not like they were?"

"Life is not a single thing," Angelica said. "It is a series of roads, each leading to the next. The afterlife is one of those roads, but it is not the last."

I touched the handle again and began to open the door. A blast of warm air came through bringing the crash of ocean rollers and the cries of seagulls. I paused and looked back at Angelica one last time.

"What about the others? What about Guilbert? He must have been here for centuries. Why didn't he meet up with his wife here when she died? And that hole in his doublet looks like a knife-"

"We are all the architects of our own fates, Hope," Angelica said quietly. "We must do what we can with what we have, and carry those consequences with us on the rest of our journeys."

It was all the answer I was going to get. She said, "Good luck, Hope, and Godspeed," and I walked through the next door.
