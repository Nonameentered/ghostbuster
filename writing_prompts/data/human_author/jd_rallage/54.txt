"This might be the biggest regret of my life," James Harrison said, and he meant it more than the visitors would ever know.

His cane tapped across the floor of the workshop, sending up little puffs of dust and wood shavings. The tour group followed behind him, picking their way through benches laden with the tools of a life-long inventor and an assortment of half-built creations.

Harrison stopped next to a large metal contraption, about the size of a coffin. The top of the box was a door that was hinged to swing open, and there was a panel of glass at the top. Once you would have been able to look through the glass to whatever was inside, but now it was covered with a thick layer of dust and grime that made the glass opaque. Tubes and wires stretched out of the back of the machine, but the power cord lay unplugged below a socket in the wall, as if somebody had pulled it out in a hurry and left it there.

"What is it?" one of the visitors asked. Their voice was quiet, respectful. It was a rare honor to be granted a tour of the famous Dr. Harrison's workshop - the very place where he had created so many great things: the pocket plasma reactor, the light drive, and the ButlerBot^TM.

Harrison stared at the young woman who had asked the question, and his face took on a distant expression. She had auburn hair, blue eyes deeper than the Pacific Ocean, and a slender figure. A badge pinned to her lapel read 'Kate Smith'.

"Dr. Harrison?" Kate said. The old inventor was staring at her face without seeing Kate. "Dr. Harrison?"

Harrison's eyes blinked, once, twice, and then snapped open. The haze of whatever ancient memory that had clouded those eyes was burned away by a bright, piercing look. "This? This is a Cryo Chamber. Freezes the body and preserves it."

Another of the visitor's whistled appreciatively. "That doesn't sound like something to regret, Dr. Harrison. Humanity has been trying to figure out cryogenesis for the past century. Why, the potential! Think of all the people with incurable diseases who we could preserve until we can heal them."

"Yes," Harrison said, a little testily. "Well, good luck to them, I say. It can't be done. You can't keep somebody alive in a freezer. The body just isn't built to stand up to that."

"So this doesn't work?" Kate asked.

"Don't know," Harrison growled. "Never finished it." He turned and began to limp away across the workshop to the next item on the tour.

He was a strange old man, Kate thought, stranger even than the stories made him out to be. An eccentric billionaire who'd given away his entire fortune to cancer research after the disease stole his wife, and now lived in this crumbling house that he couldn't afford to maintain, surrounded by the ghosts of stillborn inventions.

She realized suddenly that she was alone. Harrison had led the tour around a corner, and she could hear his voice in the distance. The metal Cryo Chamber suddenly seemed very large.

On an impulse, she reached forwards, and wiped the grime off the glass panel to get a look inside.

The inside of the glass was scratched, as if something had tried to get out. Kate peered closer, barely daring to breathe. She could just make out a head rest at the back of the box, with leather straps to hold the occupant down. Something glinted on it, a flash of color in the gloom. It was a single strand of long auburn hair.

Kate shuddered suddenly and uncontrollably, and pulled back from the machine. The mark of her fingers on the dirty glass had left an unerasable trail of her snooping, one that Harrison must notice next time he came that way.

Kate turned, and fled back to the rest of the group. The inventor's workshop, the famous lace of marvels that she had been so thrilled to visit, had lost its lustre, and she couldn't wait for the tour to end so that she could leave.
