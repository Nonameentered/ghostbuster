It was, all things considered, a terrible idea, but terrible ideas were the Cobble Street gang's *modus operandi*.

Fat Billy, who had outgrown his namesake two years earlier, looked down at the grave doubtfully. "Are you sure this is wise, guys?" His voice broke between the thin, reedy whine of his youth and what would someday be a pleasant baritone, assuming they survived this night.

A chorus of hissed *shushes* chased his caution back into that dark place where sensibility goes to die. Of course this was a good idea. It was Katy's idea, and Katy's ideas were always good. But Tim "Tim-idy" Turner glanced anxiously around the dark church to make sure they hadn't been overheard, just in case.

"Did you get it?" Katy whispered fiercely, her flashing eyes letting Fat Billy know that he would be in for it later.

Fat Billy hesitated, as if weighing whether he wanted any further part of her latest scheme. The day when Katy was bigger than the boys had long since passed, but she still seemed to tower over them. Perhaps it was the fact that she was the only girl, and they were all just starting to notice that fact and realize what it meant. More likely it was due to the accumulated trauma of a decade of black eyes and bruises.

But then he reached into the pocket of his wind-breaker, and pulled out a small, sparkling stone no bigger than a pin head.

The gang looked at it in silence.

Then Katy said, a little critically, "Is that it?"

"Yeah," Fat Billy said. "A diamond soaked in men's tears."

"How'dya know that?" Arnold said. Arnold was the Cobble Street gang's boffin-in-residence. He'd earned that place because he got top marks in all their science classes, and because he was the only one who wore glasses. 

It was Arnold who Katy had appointed to be the Master of Ceremonies on this dark night. It was Arnold had the privilege of reading from the self-published instruction book that Katy had bought on Amazon with her mother's credit card. And it was Arnold who'd had to sneak into the computer lab to print off the book while the IT teacher was on his lunch break.

Katy had glasses too, but she never wore them. "Yeah, the Doc's right. How do you know?"

"I heard my mum telling my dad," Fat Billy said. "Back before they... well, any way, she said it was a blood diamond or somethin'. People died to get it. I figure they must have cried if they was dying."

Arnold still looked sceptical, but Katy nodded her approval. She hesitated, uncharacteristically sensitive about the question she wanted to ask, but her natural inclinations eventually won out. "How'd you get it?"

Fat Billy looked even more uncomfortable. In a very quiet voice, he said, "It don't matter."

No one said anything for a few moments.

"Come on, guys," Tim 'Tim-idy' Turner said eventually, who'd been so busy looking over his shoulder that he'd barely noticed the awkward silence. "Someone else is going to come along soon. I mean, this is the night when everyone else is going to be doing this, too, or they'll have to wait 'til next year."

Katy nodded. "Timidy's right. Let's get on with it. Besides, we need the answer for English class tomorrow."

"I still think it would have been easier for you just to do your homework," Fat Billy said. "The play's not that bad, not really."

"Shut up," Katy said. "And give me that."

She snatched the diamond from his hand. "What next, Doc?"

"Say here to bury it in the soil of the grave," Arnold said. He looked doubtfully at the massive granite floor of the church. "I guess you can just lay it on the ground."

Katy did as he said.

Arnold looked back down at the instruction manual. "Now I say, *Irethru dolzi maxiklo*."

The gang waited, barely daring to breathe, but church stayed silent, as graves are supposed to do, even two hours after midnight on Halloween's eve.

"Well?" Katy asked eventually.

Arnold rubbed his glasses and squinted back down at the instructions. "That's it."

"It didn't work," Fat Billy said dourly.

"It didn't work," Tim 'Tim-idy' Turner repeated, much more cheerfully.

"It didn't work," Katy growled. She rounded on the three boys. "This is your faults. All of you."

Fat Billy looked at her anxiously. Tim 'Tim-idy' Turner took a step backwards. Arnold clutched the instruction manual more tightly, in the vain hope that it might deflect Katy's wrath.

*"The fault, dear Katy, is not in our stars, But in ourselves."*

The fifth voice was new, as young as fresh cut grass, but also mellow with age, like a dusty wine cellar.

A translucent figure had risen from the spot on the granite where the diamond lay. In the darkly lit church it was hard to make out more of it's shape, but it appeared to be an old man.

The Cobble Street gang stared at him in horror.

There was hard thud as someone at the back - probably Tim 'Tim-idy' Turner - hit the hard granite floor.

Fat Billy's mouth fell open. Arnold blinked, and one of his hands strayed to his glasses, as if to double check that they were working properly.

Katy said, "Mr. Shakespeare, our homework is due tomorrow, and I have a question for you."
