The face that stared back at me from the mirror had hair at odd angles, deep bags under each eye, and something dark and unpleasant stuck between its teeth from last night's dinner.

It wasn't my face. I didn't have that much hair, that many eyes, or teeth that sharp.

"Well, I don't see why it's my fault-" Kreffing said, a little huffily.

"Dude, she's a normal girl. She just-"

"I mean, if somebody said to me, 'Kreffing, the milk in your fridge went bad last night, why don't you pop into the corner store on your way home and get some more', well, I'd be chuffed-"

"Yeah, but she wasn't expecting bloody handwriting-"

"And Dr Martins is the best gynecologist in town-"

"What?"

"Thought the poor girl could use a check up after last night-" and here all nine of his eyes twinkled at me wickedly, "-didn't think she'd react quite so-"

"Kreffing, what did you do?"

"-after all, I was just trying to help the poor girl catch it early. I don't see why our Deal should ruin her life-"

"Kreffing! Catch what?"

"My dear boy, a casanova as successful as you spreads more than just love-"

"But... I mean, I haven't had any illnesses..."

"Of course not. I'm not going to let a few minor diseases wipe out my investment in you-"

"But Kreffing, she was the one. The One, dude. She's never coming back now."

The demon sniffed haughtily. "Her loss, if you ask me. Before she started screaming, I was just about to tell her the questions she'll be asked in tomorrow's job interview-"

"Damn it, Kreffing, you're supposed to help me get girls. She's never coming near me again! This wasn't part of the Deal."

The demon's eyes narrowed. "My dear boy, this was exactly our deal. 'Give unto me any woman I should desire, Kreffing,' you said. 'Take my soul to sate my loins, Kreffing.' I paraphrase, of course. As I recall, you didn't say it quite so eloquently." He leaned towards me, his voice a low hiss that fogged up the wrong side of the mirror. "And if I recall the Deal correctly - and trust me, I always do - you never mentioned anything about keeping them afterwards."
