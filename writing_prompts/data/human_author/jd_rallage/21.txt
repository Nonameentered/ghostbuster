Most people think that Valentine's Day is Cupid's busiest day of the year.

This is a common misconception. Valentine's Day is Cupid's day off.

A bowstring goes...

*Twang.*

Tim has slipped a Valentine's card through the narrow gap between the base of the dorm room door and the beaten down carpet that has seen a few too many college parties. 'Erica' is scrawled on the envelope. Tim had to buy a second envelope for the card, because his hand was shaking so badly on the first one.

Tim straightens up, face flustered. He's done it, finally. As he turns to go, something buzzes in his pocket. A text. From Erica. A group message, of course.

>`OMG, guys! You'll never guess who asked me out!! Only Brian!!! As in lacrosse captain Brian!!!!`**üî•üî•** ‚û° **üçÜ**

Tim lunges down and swipes at the corner of the card still poking out from under the dorm room door. The arrow whizzes through the air over his left shoulder, a bolt of pure blackness and misery, and thuds into the door frame. Something scarlet trickles down the splintered wood, and for a moment it seems as if the whole building emits a tortured sigh.

Perched on the window sill, the angel of heartbreak scowls, and mutters something in a very old language. If the Babylonians had made day-time TV shows, this would have been bleeped out.

"Missed," Cupid observes.

"Screw you," says the angel.

*Twang.*

A couple sit in the coffee shop, or as it prefers to think of itself, an organic meeting place for enlightened souls with great better chi and incidental drinks. 

He ordered an espresso. She got a cherry frappachino, unnaturally pink, iced, and with almond milk. The Valentine's Day special. They've both been drinking as if the huge china cups (this organic meeting place does not do paper) were spiked with absinthe.

"So," she says.

"So," he agrees.

"This was fun," she says, at least with her lips.

"Let's do it again some time," he says.

They get up awkwardly. She's already on her phone. He sees a glimpse of the screen. The Tinder logo. He can't tell which way she's swiping, only that she's swiping a lot.

The bolt of pure darkness whistles harmlessly over the chair she'd been sitting in and fatally skewers a gluten- and dairy-free kale scone on display at the counter. The scone seems to shrivel, and stares wistfully across at a neighboring slice of vegan chocolate cake (WARNING: contains nuts).

"God damn it," the angel of heartbreak says, and then hastily crosses herself.

They're sitting two tables over. Or rather, she's sitting, an untouched filter coffee on the table in front of her, and Cupid is floating in the air with an empty cherry frappachino cup, trying to slurp the last up the whipped cream up through the straw.

"Zero for two," he says, not looking up from his prey.

The angel of heartbreak glowers over at him. "Aren't you supposed to be on vacation?"

Cupid slurps triumphantly, and the final blob of whipped cream falls victim to the straw. He grins at her, displaying teeth stained an unnatural pink. "Hey, that was actually pretty good."

"Millenials," the angel of heartbreak mutters, and stalks out. Cupid flutters after her, but at the door he pauses, and notches a golden arrow into a little bow.

That's the trouble with the modern gig economy, you know. Even on your day off they expect you to be working.

In the coffee shop that prefers to think of itself as an organic meeting place, the young man sits back down. He orders another espresso, a single again, and another cherry frappachino. 

He waits ten minutes.

A young woman walks in. Not the same one as before. Her eyes light up when she sees the young man.

"Brian!"

"Erica. I ordered us drinks already. I hope you like cherry."

*Twang*.

An old man sits next to a hospital bed with an old woman. The old woman seems to be sleeping. The old man seems to be crying, although he doesn't have any tears left. There are no children in the room, because there are no children in the world, not for them.

The old man brushes a stray strand of hair away from her face. It's difficult for his stiff joints to move like that, but he doesn't seem to notice the effort.

"Not tonight," he whispers. "Not on Valentine's Day. Please God, no."

A hand reaches out of the lonely hospital room and arrests the blackest arrow in its flight, stopping it just an inch from the old man's chest.

The angel of heartbreak yells in frustration, but she puts the arrow back in the quiver. What a waste of a trip. And on her busiest day of the year, too. They really need to get better at scheduling back at HQ. When she clocks in tomorrow she's going to have a word with her manager.

*Twang.*

The angel of heartbreak looks around in surprise. "What? But I didn't..."

A small golden bolt is sticking out of her chest.

"You didn't," she says.

Cupid lowers his bow. "It seemed like the right thing to do"

The golden bolt has dissolved into a shimmer of warmth that flows into her chest. "Don't you know what day it is today? How many people have set themselves up for disappointment. Most of them, I might add, because of your meddling."

"I called in a favor," Cupid says. "Got you the day off as well."

"I'll break your heart one day," the angel says. "It's who I am. It's what I do."

Cupid shrugs. The angel supposes that if anyone knows anything about her, it's probably him.

The angel of heartbreak sighs and gestures down to where Cupid's arrow had hit her. "You know in many countries it would be illegal to drug a woman like this."

"How about coffee?" Cupid says. "Come on, Valentine. I know a place that does a great cherry frappachino..."
