It was dangerous for a Tithyan to be out so late. Dangerous, even though both moons gleamed fully in the sky, bathing the planet in their reflections of the sun. It was still too dark for a Tithyan to see well.

Such worries did not stop Ost. A man in love thinks little of his own safety.

Ost scrambled over the rocky terrain with the practised ease of one who had come this way many times before. The moonlight of Herule, the larger of the two moons, was blue-white, and carressed the planet's surface with a soft touch. Lepton was harsher, redder, angrier. When Herule disappeared behind clouds, as it did frequently tonight, Lepton became dominant, and the rocky landscape shifted to a hues of orange and blood.

Ost scarcely noticed these ill-omens. It would have done him little good anyhow - the Nest was a good half hour behind him. This was Vul territory, although they rarely patrolled this patch. They preferred the darkness of the forests, where one could retreat under a mat of fallen moss, and hide from Tithyan eyes.

The meeting place was up ahead. Ost picked up his pace, drawing energy from the song in his heart. She would be waiting for him there. She didn't let him come any other time, insisting that it wasn't safe for a Tithyan to venture out under the light of just one moon. Nor could she bear the full force of the sun. So instead they met in secret every Two Moon.

She was waiting for him tonight. He spied her form from the rim of the crater, and began to run down the rubble strewn slope, skidding on the loose stones and careless of tripping and breaking an ankle.

As Ost got closer, he could see her face. It was so different from his - in color, shape, and contour - and yet so beautiful in each of those. He got closer still, and saw that something was wrong. Her eyes shone with the light of the moons, tears glinting.

"Vi, what's wrong?"

He stopped in front of her, and reached out to take her hand.

Her mouth opened a fraction, just enough to hiss a whisper. "Run, Ost, run!"

"Vi?"

There was a clatter on the slopes of the meteor crater behind Ost, and he whirled around. Forms slipped from the shadows of boulders as a Vul patrol revealed themselves.

"Drop the Princess's hand," one of them said.

"Don't hurt him," Vi said. Her voice was desperate. They must have forced her to set this trap.

Ost turned to look at her. "Nobody can ever hurt me while your love protects me," he said. 

It was just the two of them, under the light of the two moons and the stars of distant galaxies. He felt her hand squeeze his more tightly. It was just the two of them, but they were not alone.
