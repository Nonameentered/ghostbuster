Bobby disappeared into the mist. White tentacles snaked down over her shoulders and arms, and over the gas mask that was now held uselessly in her hand. Too late, she started to raise it, trying to put it back on, trying to undo what had already been done. Then her struggling form was obscured from me by the billowing clouds, only a shock of red hair left burning against the fog, until it extinguished that too.

They must have detected our presence. I'd been prepared for that. What I wasn't ready for was my partner being caught without her mask.

I was alone now in the mist that crashed soundlessly against the visor of my gas mask, unable to see more than a few inches in front of my face. I reached forwards, searching for Bobby, seized by a notion that I could help her with her gas mask.

But I stopped myself. No sense in both of us getting incapacitated.

We both knew what the gas would do to us - in my case, from first hand experience. A surfeit of love towards everyone. Deep and passionate desires. And a blissful contentment with everything that was wrong with the world: the overcrowding, the heat, the disease, the- well, all the problems that the aerosol medicated away for us.

I'd been cured by the aerosol myself, back in the day. I'd loved it. And then Bobby had forced herself into my life, forced a gas mask on my face, and rendered my prismatic, acrylic world into a charcoal sketch of black and white. I'd hated her for it, until I'd fallen in love with her. But it was a different sort of love, frail next to the overwhelming love dictated by the aerosol, but oddly pure.

I'd seen others cured of their concerns rip the gas masks off Rebels trying to help them. And I'd never seen the aerosol dense enough to form a mist, so there was no telling what it would do to Bobby. My Bobby, raised away from the Surface, with a gas mask on her face since birth, who had never developed any tolerance for Agent L.

So I took a step back, and waited. I tried not to breathe too deeply. The gas masks weren't perfect.

After half a minute the gas stopped hissing and hung sullenly in the air of the circular room. I strained my ears for any sound of Bobby.

And then there was a voice, the first voice I'd heard since I'd put on the gas mask of the Rebellion.

*Welcome, intruder,* it said. It was echoed soundlessly in my head, but it did not disturb the swirling mists.

*So glad you could make it,* it said. It was in my head, speaking to me in my own voice. What madness was this?

Feeling slightly silly, I thought back, *What is this? Who are you?*

*You need not concern yourself with such matters,* it said. *You have more pressing issues.*

The mist around me was thinning.

*Your Agent L will not affect me,* I thought.

*My dear,* it said, *of course not. But I don't believe your friend will be so lucky. And anyway, this isn't Agent L, as you so quaintly call it. Quite the opposite, in fact.*

The voice disappeared along with the remaining mists.

Bobby was standing in the middle of the room, gas mask lying forgotten at her feet. All the softness had gone from her face, leaving only the hard which had crystallized into razor-edged shards of hate. The red hair roared back to life with vengeance.

She leaped towards me, hands curled into tiny talons. I took one last look into those green eyes, once bottomless pools of love, now replaced with nothing but venom.
