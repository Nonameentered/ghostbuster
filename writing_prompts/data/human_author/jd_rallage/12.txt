There's a aphorism that I've grown up to dislike which claims that "You can't pick your family". I suppose a regular girl rebelling against a normal upbringing might find such words to be balm for her rebellious spirit.

The much less frequently mentioned corollary is that your family can decide *not* to pick you, such by giving you up for adoption, or, as happens to some of us, by sacrificing you to unspeakable entities for the promise of otherworldly power. 

But regardless of who you end up with, I suppose that every kid begins life thinking their version of family is normal. Suckled by a she-wolf? Romulus and Remus probably thought that was what every baby did, until Faustulus took them in. I'm sure the other kids bullied them mercilessly for it later.

It's that slow, dreadful realization in the developing brain that something about your family is just a little different from everyone else's that causes so much present shame and future grief. Take poor old Remus, for example, done in by his own brother over which hill had a better view. And consider their neighbors - it's no wonder the Greek gods are such a dysfunctional bunch. Eaten by your own father? It's enough to turn anyone into an adulterous, jealous, and violent adult.

I can remember the precise day when I realized that something about my own family was a little different from all the others. It's one of my earliest memories, brutally etched forever into my psyche, and one which, despite a lot of therapy, still wakes me up in the lonely hours of the night. 

It was my first year of school, and for reasons that are lost to the passage of time, the headmistress had thought to pick me as the only kid from my year group to have a non-chorus part. Insofar as it was a part. I was the dove, released from the ark after 40-something days had passed. I had to run off the stage and return with an olive branch, which was really just a stick from the chestnut tree in the school playground.

Innocuous, right?

On the morning of our performance, my father told me that he would not be coming to see the play. I cried for the better part of an hour and was late for first period. As we were getting into our costumes after school, I was the most lifeless dove you have ever seen. If Noah had thrown me over the side, I would have plummeted straight into the water and sunk like a stone, receding waters be damned.

But, as the school lined up alongside the stage, I looked out over the assembled audience and saw him sitting in the front row, smiling at me. I was so happy that he had changed his mind about coming that two aspects of his attendance escaped my notice until much later. The first was that, despite the hall being packed to the point of overflowing, there was a ring of empty chairs around him. The second thing was that he looked... *different* to all the other parents. I was so used to him that I had always accepted his appearance as normal, but alongside the other parents, he was very obviously unusual.

Almost immediately the play began to derail from the simple structure that the headmistress had drilled into us so carefully. Whereas is the previous day's dress rehearsal, we had mimed rain and water, this time when the kid playing God waved his hands, I saw my father frown and then there was an almighty thunderclap over the school and the windows were battered by wind and rain. Some of the parents applauded, while others exchanged uneasy glances.

By the time we had rushed through forty days and nights of rain, water was beginning to flood into the hall under the doors, and several parents raised their feet up onto their chairs. Fortunately, Noah, yelling his lines over the gale outside, announced that the rain had stopped, and the storm miraculously eased off. There was no applause this time.

When I was released, my father stood up and applauded, but when I came back on stage with my stick, I felt it wriggle in my hands, and suddenly I was holding a branch laden with olives and cut so freshly that it still oozed sap. Noah looked at it a little dubiously, but the poor kid was only a couple of years older that me, and decided to just go with it.

I could see the relief on the headmistress's face as we launched into the final act. She began to the majority of the second and third year students who kitted out in pairs as a very lopsided sample of Earth's taxonomic diversity. Unfortunately for her, the school only had one lion costume, and so a single male lion brought up the rear of the parade of animals disembarking two-by-two to the applause of the watching parents.

Then there was a scream, and a snarl.

A very confused and irate female lion - this one not in a costume - appeared from behind the ark, close on the heels of the boy in wearing the lion mane. He turned around, saw her, and fell backwards off the stage. The lioness glanced down at him.

He was saved by the eruption of pandemonium in the hall, as two hundred parents simultaneously began scrambling over their seats, half towards the doors and half towards their offspring. The commotion distracted the lioness, and she took a half-step back, crouching in a ready-to-pounce pose.

Thirty seconds later, the hall was empty, except for the three of us. Me still on the stage (a trampled olive branch discarded at my feet), my father (the only... thing... to remain seated throughout the whole affair), and the lioness now purring at his feet as he tickled her chin.

I began to cry for the second time that day.

Instantly I felt my father wrap himself around me. Trust me when I say that my dad gives better hugs than yours - your dad only has two arms.

"What's wrong, pumpkin?" he pronounced.

"I- I didn't get to take my bow," I sniffed. I have no idea why that, of all things, was what upset me most, but it was. "We were supposed to bow at the end of the play."

"Then bow," my father proclaimed, and as always it was hard to tell whether he was asking or telling.

Without seeming to move, he was back in his seat. The lion had mysteriously vanished. I gave a little bow, and he sprang up. Thunderous applause shook the room. 

"Encore," he boomed, but thankfully that did not happen.

Even aged five, I felt a little foolish. "Stop," I said. "I want to go home."

He smiled at me - I was the only thing I had ever seen him smile at - and extended to me what passed for a hand. We went home, and not via a route or even a means that had to worry about school rush traffic.

What, you say. That's it? No doubt you are curious to know what became of the school and the headmistress, the kids and their parents, not to mention the lioness.

The school was closed the next day, and never reopened. I believe the official story was trafficking a rare animal. The town spent the next month on high alert for a loose lion, but the creature was never found. Despite her absence, I hear that local legend likes to blame mysterious disappearances on her. Of course, the real reason for those disappearances was the secretive cult that sprang up a short time later, whose membership comprised those of the parents who did not end up in insane asylums. Later studies by criminologists would detect an unusually high proportion of the town's children of that generation that became psychopaths, sociopaths, or an even worse flavor of -path, but science was never able to find a convincing explanation for this statistical anomaly. Within a decade the town was a hollowed husk of its former self, abandoned by most of it's residents, avoided by almost everyone else, and those few unwise enough to visit soon left with strange feelings of dread growing in their stomachs.

And me? Well, I went home, of course. The nightmares didn't start until I was a few years older and several centuries wiser. But as the school was now closed, my father decided that I might do better with a private tutor. He spent the next year searching his domain for a soul foolish enough to end up their but wise enough to be trusted to teach his little pumpkin. He did find one, eventually, albeit not without giving me a few more mental scars in the process. But that, as they say, is a tale for another time.
