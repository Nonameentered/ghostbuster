"Where are we going?" I asked Tyrone.

"To the Council of Canines," he replied. "If *They* managed to get a cat into your house, then *They* are further along than we feared."

"I don't see what Jasper could have-"

The dog froze in the street. "Jasper?"

"Yeah," I said. "Why, what's wrong?"

"You called me Mr. Tiddles, but the cat got Jasper? In what world is that fair?"

"He came with the name," I protested.

"And I came as Tyrone!" the dog said, his barks becoming even higher pitched that usual.

"Look, I'm sorry," I said, for the little dog looked mortally offended. "It wasn't really my idea, but Kelsey wanted to call you that."

"Oh, her," Tyrone said. "Whatever happened to her?"

"I broke up with her," I said.

The dog raised an eyebrow.

"Okay," I sighed. "She dumped me."

He made a little snorting sound that was suspiciously like a snigger.

"What?" I asked.

"We're going to need her," Tyrone said.

"What? No. No way. I'm never going near that crazy bi-, (sorry, no offence to your mother) woman, ever again."

"Too bad, buster," Tyrone said. "She's part of this whole she-bang. Why do you think I brought you guys together in the first place?"

"You brought us together?"

"Yeah," he said. "Don't you remember? Two days after I picked you out at the pound? I dragged you out for a walk, and ran up to a cute girl in the park. Gave her the old puppy eyes, licked her hand for good measure, and the rest is history."

"Actually, I think it was my witty conversation and good looks," I said.

The dog sniggered again. "Sure," he said.

I thought about it for a moment. Doubts began to seep into by mind. "You really engineered that whole thing?"

"Dude," he said. "Come on. She was way out of your league. By the way, what happened to you guys?"

"We had three good years," I said. "And then things just started to fall apart. More arguments, more fights. Then about six months after you left-. Wait. Our relationship went downhill after you left. This is all *your* fault. You ruined the best thing that ever happened to me."

"You mean I wasn't the best thing that ever happened to you?"

"Well, you were good too," I admitted. "But you didn't... you know."

"Oh, I know," the dog said. "I definitely knew."

I blushed, and changed the subject. "Where did you go for four years?"

"It's a long story," the dog said evasively.

"How far away is this Council place? I'm sure you have time. Besides, you broke up my relationship. You owe me."

"Call us even for Mr. Tiddles," Tyrone said.

"Please?"

"Oh, all right. Listen carefully. I know how bad your human ears are, and I'm only going to tell this story once."
