They met on the first day of spring, witnessed by the nosy necks of new daffodil shoots. She sat on a park bench by the large pond, running from everything but towards nothing, and he stepped into her way by sitting down beside her.

She would have risen, but he began to feed to the ducks with dark rye crusts and she watched, fascinated as the birds swarmed around their feet. He said nothing to her until the bag was empty, and then he gave her a green-eyed smile and the last crust. She watched him walk away until he disappeared around a bend in the path, and only then did she realize that the ducks were quacking angrily at the nibble of bread left in her hand. She ate it, hungrily.

She was there the next day when he returned with another bag of crusts, watched distrustfully by the ducks. He looked from the birds to her, and laughed a golden peel that made the daffodils jump up. This time he offered her first pick from the bag of crusts, and they fed the ducks together.

After a week of fattening water fowl together, he asked her name and she told him. She did not ask for his, but she greedily drank the coffee he brought her. After a month, he brought her a pastry as well, and the daffodils looked on with yellow jealousy, for he was a good looking man and it was a better looking croissant.

She declined dinner every time, until the day when the first duckling came up for a crust and climbed willingly into his hand. He offered the creature to her, and she was softened by the trusting touch of something so fragile. She agreed to go to dinner, just once, and the daffodils were too withered to roll their eyes.

That summer she grew fat on love and good wine and the happiness that can be found in a pair of green eyes. They began to meet outside the park, at coffee shops and restaurants and theatres, and one evening she went back to the small apartment that he kept above a corner shop and realized that cotton sheets can sometimes feel softer than the finest satin.

He never asked her for any other details after her name, but as the lazy days of summer hastened by, she began to tell him a little of herself. Eventually she told him of her father's decree, of the man she had been ordered to marry, sight unseen, of her flight from her home to the strange world of the city. He looked at her with eyes green with sorrow.

"Tell me of yourself," she said.

He stared out the window, out at the park where they'd first met, where the leaves were now turning red before their fall, and said only, "Tomorrow."

"Tell me your name, at least," she said.

"Tomorrow," he said again.

But tomorrow, waiting on the park bench, she looked up at the approaching footsteps and saw her father. His mouth spat flecks of wrath and he said, "Foolish girl, we have searched the wide world for you. Come home."

She said, for the first time, "No. This is my home now."

"Fool," her father said. "Did you think you could just fall in love with a mortal man? Do you not know who he is? Your own prince, who came after you when you ran?"

She felt the blow of his words more keenly than the stab of any knife, and did not resist when her father's retainers seized her arms and carried her, senseless, back to the faerie lands where she would once again be the daughter of a king.

He arrived at the bench not long after, and found the ducks pecking at a bag of bread that had fallen on the ground. She never came.

He returned to the bench every day, the trees stick bare around him, the ground wasted and frozen, the ducks thin and hungry for his crusts. She never came.

The winter became a waking nightmare that he walked, taunting him for his folly, punishing him for his decption. He had only wanted to see the faerie princess who had turned him down, and perhaps to wound her, as she had wounded him. Now he wanted only to protect her from it all, and from himself most of all. But she did not come.

He did not notice when the ground softened enough for the first daffodil shoot to peek up from the frost. He did not even reach into the bag of crusts, although the ducks clamoured around him. He did not realize that it was the first day of spring until the shadow of the woman fell on him, and she took his hand and drew him up and kissed him as she had done before, and the ducks and the daffodils cheered.
