The idiots had bought it sight unseen.

Sure, it's a hot property market. Sure, they were moving in from out of town. Sure, they were apparently young and impecunious.

But who sees a property that's sat unsold for three years at half the price of every other house in the neighborhood and thinks, *yeah, there's nothing wrong with that that I can't fix*?

Action at a distance is not impossible for the corporeally challenged (indeed, it's usually easier than plain old action when your hands pass through everything), but the distance is relative of course. And when your spirit is tied to the house in which it died, it's hard to reach out across space and time to a young family on the other side of the country.

I'd managed to materialize briefly, just as the family was sitting down to dinner, but it had been so faint that only the cat had sensed me and by the time they had calmed their spitting and snarling furball, I'd lost my grip on reality, and could only watch as they laughed at the antics of their precious Felix, and joked that maybe they didn't need to move to a new place to get a haunted house.

It's easier in our own house of course, because we are stronger there and because there are so many of us. We can be seen, in the corner of your vision as you glance over shadowy corners of a room, or as a door that slams shut behind you harder than it should have done. We are the flicker in the electric lights despite the new wiring, and the howl of wind in the upstairs hallway on even the most windless of days.

We are the reason why the locals say the house is haunted, but only after too much to drink and never in front of unwary out-of-towners who might be tempted to see for themselves.

After my first failed attempt, I'd possessed a raven and flown it through night and day, through lashing storm and burning sun, to land on the porch of the perfectly nice house on the other side of the country that was fronted with a "Sold" sign and a movers truck. I'd cawed three times loudly, as a witch had once told the Chairman was proper, and tapped thrice more on the window, and they'd come out and thrown down some old crusts for me to eat. Apparently they were cleaning out the refrigerator, and it was only going to be wasted otherwise.

That night, at the meeting of the Homeowner's Association, the expressions on everyone's faces had been even gloomier than one normally expects at a conversation of ghosts.

"You can't win them all," said Miss Brown sadly, who had been one of the earliest owners, and was now the Secretary.

"Ah, well," said Mr Grigg, with much less dismay. Mr Grigg, I suspected, derived some satisfaction from knowing that he was not the only one who'd been lured here, who'd let avarice get the better of sense. Mr Grigg was one of a vocal minority who thought that if you were going to be miserable, you might as well spread it around. Mr Grigg and friends did not believe in the mission of saving the worthy, not when it only emphasized your own shortcomings.

From the head of the table, a ghost so faded as to be almost featureless spoke. "One more attempt," said the ghost we knew only as the Chairman, the OG himself. "We will try once more. A third and final time, as a witch once told me we might." He looked at me. "You, as the current owner of the House, must try once more. That is your curse."

"That is our curse," we intoned back.

The Chairman had never explained how the curse had arisen. Perhaps, as he claimed, he genuinely did not know. Or, perhaps he had forgotten. I suspected that he did know and didn't want to tell us how he had hexed a house that had ensnared us all, whether through greed, or bravado, or desperation.

Because we had all bought this house in our day, despite the best attempts of those who had owned it before to warn us away. We had ignored the signs and the omens. And then, on the fifth day, the house had collapsed on each and every one of us.

We had thought that a haunted house was not that bad, that it needed a strong stomach, or a lick of paint, or a less imaginative mind. And perhaps we would have been right if all the house had been was haunted.

But as much as we haunted the house, the house haunted us, because this was not just a haunted house but a cursed house, and we were the souls of those it had damned.
