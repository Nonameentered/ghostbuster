"Harry, this is a terrible idea," Hermione said. "You know how dangerous time turners can be - don't meddle with settled history."

Harry pushed the glasses back up his nose. "But Hermione, don't you see what this shows? Hitler wasn't a muggle; he was a wizard! The greatest Dark Wizard in the history of magic."

"Yeah, it's pretty obvious," Ron said, agreeing with his best friend.

"Oh, do be quiet, Ron," Hermione said. "You're only siding with him because I was right about the Kirzleroots. There were digging up my lettuces."

Privately, Harry agreed with Hermione, but he wasn't going to say anything while Ron was his only ally.

"Well, I'm going back," he announced. "The wizarding community back then had no idea that Hitler was one of us. Only somebody from the future can save them."

"But what if you cause irreparable damage to the fabric of time," Hermione insisted. "You could... I don't know, accidentally kill Voldemort's dad or something."

"Hey, that's actually not a bad idea," Ron said. "Think of all the trouble we'd save ourselves. Basilisks, dragons, spiders-"

"The girl you were too afraid to ask out never falling in love with you," Hermione said pointedly.

Ron smirked. "Nah, I'm pretty sure that would still have happened."

His wife just rolled her eyes.

Harry pulled the Time Turner out of his robe and looped the chain around his neck. "So are you coming?"

"Yes," Ron said.

"No," Hermione said, glaring at Ron and tapping her foot.

"Er, no," Ron said, looking sheepishly at Harry. "Sorry mate, I forgot. The Heaney's are coming for dinner tonight and I have to-"

"Ron, it doesn't matter," Harry said. "I can have you back in a second's time."

"Yeah," Ron said, with a nervous glance at Hermione, "but you know how it is, mate. I mean, you didn't tell Ginny, did you?"

Harry felt a stab of guilt. "No," he admitted.

It looked like it was just him. Unable to bear the awkward domestic tension brewing between his two best friends, he hopped on his broom, set the Time Turner to 'Century' mode, and gave it a three-quarters twist.

The room dissolved, and Harry found himself standing in a field. The drone of propeller powered aircraft came from overhead, and in the distance he could hear the explosion of flak and bombs.

He Apparated, willing himself to Germany, and with a crack, found himself in the Reichstag building.

The Nazi's stared at the baby-faced man on a flying broomstick who had appeared in their midst. Except for Hitler.

The Fuhrer pulled off his military uniform, to reveal wizard's robes.

"Harry Potter," he said. "I have been expecting you."

The other Nazi's formed ranks behind him and also pulled out wands. In horror, Harry realized that the entire top tier of Nazi party members were wizards, and he had walked right into their trap.

Hitler raised his wand to cast the Killing Curse. "Prepare to die, Potter," he cackled.

Harry tried to get his wand out to defend himself, but an inhuman voice floated through the hall.

"Kfrewsdsp," it said.

And then, "Oops, sorry, wrong language. That was Alpha Centurian. I mean, STOP!"

Harry and Hitler turned to face the three green figures that had emerged out of nowhere.

"Who are you?" the two men said in unison.
