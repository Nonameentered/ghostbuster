**Memo: To all members of the Union of Transylvanian Laborers**

After several unfortunate events of late, I feel that it is necessary to remind all our members of the Three Cardinal Rules that we all agree to upon initiation into this fellowship.

First, lunch breaks are for Normies, not us. Just because a Norm pulls out a sandwich just not mean that it's acceptable for you to take the sedated virgin out of your car and chomp down on her neck. Save that stuff for home, folks! It's not currently considered appropriate workplace behavior, although our lobbying efforts to get B.I.T.E. bill through Congress are making steady progress.

Second, always carry your vial of emergency blood when you're at work. If you're halfway to work and realize that you've forgotten it, then TURN AROUND and go back. It's easier to explain why you're fifteen minutes late to you boss, that to explain to the police why said boss and all your co-workers are now bloodless corpses in the basement of a half-renovated row house. And, no, I'm not making this up. I wish I was - our legal fees this year might actually have been under budget for once.

Remember that the UTL recommends using a plastic squeezy bottle to hold your emergency blood rather than the traditional glass vial. As well as minimizing the chance of a breakage, this also allows for quick and easy consumption when the Blood Tremors hit.

Third, but by no means least, SAFETY GEAR. Yes, I know that a falling roof tile won't hurt you. Yes, I know that you can just dissolve into mist if a reversing forklift doesn't see you. And, yes, I know that flying woodchips will not affect your vision in the slightest if they bounce off your eyes. But we need to blend in, folks, or the Normies will get suspicious. So strap on your hard hat, zip up your safety vest, and please, please, please don't skip on the safety googles.

Due to the aforementioned recent misadventures, membership fees for next month will include a one-off "Miscellanea' charge of $57 to cover legal costs, wizards fees, and various bribes.

Thirstiest regards,

Your President.
