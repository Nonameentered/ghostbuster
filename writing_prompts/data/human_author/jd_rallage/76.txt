Don't hate the player. Hate the game.

"That's him?"

"That's him."

"But he's so cute! How could that be....?"

I stared up at the couple. They weren't the ones. You could tell, after a while.

They drifted on down the aisle, and even with my sensitive ears I could no longer hear what they were saying.

"Mummy, can we get this one?" The speaker was a little girl, no more than six, full of buttercups and sunbeams. She didn't know - none of the young ones did. They were my only real hope.

The girl's mother, however, took one look at the sign below my cage and dragged her daughter away, throwing me a dirty look for good measure. No doubt the child would get a stern lecture on associating with strange reborns when they got home, perhaps with a little bit of world history for good measure. Shame, she seemed like a good kid.

I mean, hey, we all get a bad reincarnation sometimes. Someone becomes the Yellowstone bear who develops a taste for human flesh. Someone becomes the wasp that lays it's eggs in the flesh of a living, paralyzed caterpillar, so that it's young can eat their way out when they hatch. Just my luck to get born as a mentally unstable megalomaniac with a charismatic twist.

Not that I remembered any of it, of course. Nobody does. But, people are suspicious. Who wants to snuggle up with a puppy that killed millions in a previous life? Hell, chew a single slipper, and I'd probably be taken to the vet be euthanized.

There was a sign in the pet shop window. I could just about read the letters backwards. They said, 'Closing down sale. All animals must go.'

The sign had gone up a week ago.

I didn't used to have this problem. Apparently, in my past three lives I'd been a cockroach, a grasshopper, and then a lizard. Not that I remembered any of those, of course, but I must have done something right. I mean, I'd become a puppy. This was supposed to be it! The easiest way to become a human, as long as you were good and faithful and loyal, just one step from a shot at enlightenment.

Behind me, the shop clerk started to turn off the back lights.

The few remaining customers began to drift towards the exit.

I pressed my nose against the glass, and tried to look cute.
