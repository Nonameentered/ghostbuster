/u/MNBrian you always give me so many ideas with these posts. I'm one chapter away from finishing the first draft of my FirstChapter entry, my list of notes in red ink is growing rapidly.

As it stands, the triggering event is:

> When the Southerner walks into her secret lair and asks her to steal a golden brooch **(Stakes)**, master thief Kirin **(Main character)** accepts the job even though it requires her to sign a binding magical contract **(choice)** or doesn't earn the huge reward that is offered **(stakes)**.

*Triggering event* 

This could be stronger. Kirin's secret hideout is, well, secret - the Southerner's entrance could be more forced (see below on *consequences*). A weaker triggering event? Perhaps Kirin is hunting for a new job, and asks the Southerner if he needs anything stolen.

*Main character*

Initially, Kirin is ideally suited for the theft, because she's (allegedly) the best thief on the Empire. However, when the job doesn't go as smoothly as she hoped, she gets swept up in aristocratic society which she doesn't know know how to handle.

A more competent main character might be an aristocrat, with more understanding of the history and intrigues of the Empire. A less competent character might be somebody with no skills as a thief, but who gets blackmailed into stealing despite that.

*Stakes*

Stronger: Kirin has to take the job because the Southerner is blackmailing her and will report her identity to the city watch.

Weaker: Kirin takes the job because she's bored.

Looking back on what I have so far, I think I need to rewrite the opening chapter to have a stronger trigger. Currently Kirin accepts the Southerner's job against her better instincts because she gets greedy. A stronger trigger is the Southerner figures out her secret identity, and threatens to reveal it unless she steals the item he wants.

Any thoughts, u/MNBrian ?
