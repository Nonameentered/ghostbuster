We'd made it into the disperser shafts, me and Bobby, following the old blueprints that she'd uncovered in the recesses of a decommissioned Government server in Tucson.

But we'd come to a fork that was as visible in life as it was absent from the map. They were old these plans, back from the days when the Government was the government, or really just a government. I supposed they'd updated the aerosol disperser since then.

I motioned to Bobby that we should take the right tunnel. I don't know why. I just had a feeling. It was the first time my instincts would let me down that day, but not the last.

She nodded her agreement, and signed that we should make haste. We only had twenty minutes to make it to the control center before the guard changed.

I couldn't see her face behind the gas mask that she wore. Sometimes, at night usually, when we lay together in the little bed in the hidden room off the Manhattan sewer, I would look at her sleeping, in her gas mask, and imagine her face. Sometimes it was a soft face, with a pert nose and lips like pillows that you could lose yourself in. Other times it was harder, the face of someone who'd spent their life in the Resistance fighting 'The Man' as the old news reels liked to say. But always she had those green eyes that shone through the visor of her mask.

And then usually, I'd wonder if she ever thought about my face behind my own gas mask, the faceless man she'd rescued from the surface world, and then fallen in love with. They say that in the old days, when a man and a woman courted-

But this was no time for reminisces of times past. There was a door ahead, at the end of the right fork that I'd chosen for us, a big metal airlock, corroded green from age, with a wheel for a handle.

This wasn't on the map either. But we were heading in the right direction.

I fought the wheel handle, and won. The airlock groaned open, letting a gasp of air out and letting us in. I closed it quickly. Rumors said that the air in the dispenser units was pure and filtered, free of Agent L. It had to be that way, so that the engineers could work without getting distracted.

We were in a circular chamber, with another airlock on the other side. We were in.

Bobby looked at the aerosol meter that she always carried. The needle had dropped to the red line that ended in a fat zero. I'd never seen zero contaminant even in the Refuge, where we filtered the air as best as we could.

Her hands trembled up to the corners of her mask. Before I could stop her, she'd pulled it off, and I saw her face for the first time in six years. She was just as beautiful as I'd imagined, both hard and soft.

She signed for me to take of my own mask.

But before I could grant her wish or tell her not to be such a damn fool, the airlocks on either side of the room clicked. A mist began to hiss out of tiny vents in the ceiling, enveloping both of us.
