Hey there! Welcome and thank you for all the detailed feedback on this week's post!

You are totally right that I have not included the process for nominating other writers on the subreddit post - a complete oversight. I will add it in on the next post, but until then:

The form I post for voting is shared on our discord server. We run our campfire (reading the stories aloud) sessions there, so I post it while we read through them. 

You can find the discord link all over our pages and feature posts, but for easy reference, [here it is!](https://discord.gg/writingprompts)
