A house now replete with weighty silence,   
A bed too cold to soothe.   
Dissent haunts with hushed riot -   
Pleading to reveal the truth.

A romantic love did once hold her here -   
A crown that matched her own!   
Guarded from her chilling fears,   
Connection ardently sown.

A heart defeated by an unfair break,   
A grudge beyond remove.   
Bitter bite a sinful taste.   
Frail flaw too tough to improve.

A lover lied to cover hurt and shame,   
An anger fed her fire.   
Fury did ignite a flame -   
Stole the aim of her desire.

An aura colored by sadness and regret,   
A pain too much to bear.   
Memories all she has left   
At the end of their affair.

An anticipation for new lovers.   
A poison in her soul.   
Her motive undiscovered,   
As her hatred takes its toll.

Yet another slaughter will go unsolved -   
A tally with the rest.   
And all from getting involved -   
Confusing love with *obsessed.*
