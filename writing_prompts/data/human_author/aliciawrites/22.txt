First of all, this is so immensely helpful, thank you!!! It was really difficult to think of all the tenses and I definitely didn't think of latin! I think this time around I'll allow it, but miiiight make clarifications if this makes it to next year's games! I will get you corrected on my sheet!

Second, that is a dang good excuse to take a break! I wish you all the luck with that project, it sounds horrifically exciting (the best kind) and we'll be right here where you left us when you're ready!
