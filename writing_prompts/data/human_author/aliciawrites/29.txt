Breach - WC 208

I fell before I saw the trap    
Enthralled by the chase    
Anxious for every loving scrap    
Longing for a single trace

But no one wins the waiting game    
And loss is tough to sell    
Fervent love replete with shame    
‘Til what remains is empty shell

The view from my window is getting quite grim    
I’m wasting away–    
I’m spread much too thin    
And safety’s a stranger with eyes of deceit    
That lock away secrets and untruths beneath,    
and   
Reality bends to the will of control   
So I put on my mask and I’ll play my role   

Beyond the portal, outside looking in,    
Illusion to me; a life free from sin:   
Where people can fail and choose to be better    
And happiness is reliably supplied    
And begging for crumbs isn’t the standard,   
Silence is quiet and still   
Talk doesn't cut like a knife   
And power means free will   

But,   
Things fall through the cracks and I   
Catch on to the secrets that everyone knows   

The black and white film is revealed   
And I’m not a damsel, certainly not in distress   
And I’m not the villain, or sidekick, or less   
And I’m not a devil or sinner or wretch   
In color, I’m the hero - concealed.
