I'm so sorry I let you down with the bonus points! It's definitely allowed, but if you plan on doing it again - gimme a poke on discord so I know I gotta put pedal to metal! I did start a piece so I might tag ya in a [PI] later!

Now, onto this story... just WOW. I am so impressed with what you did within the story and made the game work so well with it. This is exactly what I wanted when the constraints were suggested to me! Great job! Thank you for writing. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of your work :)
