Blake scanned the crowd. The massive glowing tank in the backdrop mesmerized her with playful frolicking fish. The ocean exhibit had always been her favorite when she went to the aquarium as a kid. She slid her phone out of her pocket and skimmed their last few texts.

Okay, sure. How will I know you when you’re in costume?

I will be Sandra Dee with my Pink Ladies jacket and a pink bandana around my neck.    
*I didn’t know you were so risque!*    
Lots more to learn about me, Cam! I’ll see you at the party Saturday night. ;)

She’d been dreading a typical first date since they first connected on Bumble. This time was different. There was a real connection and she was excited to meet him face to face. 

The sensation of thousands of tiny spiders crawled up Blake’s spine. Her head whipped around to find the source. 

There he was against the wall holding a red solo cup, watching her. The corners of her mouth tipped up into a slow, brilliantly blooming smile. 

He pushed off the wall and strode toward her and she took in everything about him, head to toe. Heat rose to blossom on her cheeks. His spicy scent captivated her as he lifted the sunglasses to rest on the top of his head.

“Blake? You’re one hell of a Pink Lady.” His mouth mirrored her grin. He handed her the cup he’d been holding. “I took the liberty of getting you some of the spiked punch.”

“Thanks. You make a helluva Tom Cruise! You wanna walk?” 

“Lead the way, hot stuff.” He slid his palm into her hand.

*It was definitely different this time.*
