LivelyFox! So good to see you again!

Just wanted to let you know that you're short at least one phrase to qualify for ranking (also in case you didn't see, the max wordcount is raised this week) and it's absolutely fine if you're not worried about it, but figured since there's still time before the deadline I'd let you know that you can still add some in!
