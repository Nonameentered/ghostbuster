New tasks:

> [1] 12-Month Review Questions:     
 * What's one thing you've learned that's improved your writing in the past 12 months?
 * What's your proudest writing achievement of the past year?
 * What's one thing you would have liked to have done better in the past 12 months?

 * I think the most important thing I've learned in the last year about my writing is that I need to be patient with myself. I have the motivation and I have the ideas, but when I put too much pressure on myself, I tend to wig out and run the other way. I kicked ass during word-off because I didn't need to show anyone my writing, just get the words down on the page. So a lot of my struggle is me getting in my own way and getting in my own head about the quality of the work I'm putting out. When I remember that I'm actually a pretty decent editor, I'm able to get the words out and work through the pieces slowly to make it pretty & polished.
 * Well, I guess I already mentioned this but I'll say it again. Word-Off kicked ass. (If y'all don't know what it is, please join the Discord server and get in on this! It's amazing!) I churned out more work in the one month of the competition than I had in years and years previous.
 * I would like to have a much more consistent writing habit, and I believe I'm on my way, but I'm not there yet.

> [2] Choose something out of your comfort zone and be okay that you will fail at it.

If anyone's interested or wants to throw ideas at me, I'm considering horror or mystery or maybe something dialogue-heavy. Yay?

> [3] Participate in 2 writing features.

> [4] Edit and publish two serial chapters.

Looking forward to seeing how everyone does this month! Great July everyone!!
