You are absolutely right about the near-rhyme. I was not super careful with rhyming lines while writing this because I was a *tiny* bit pressed for time, but I think I'll take a look at it before campfire and see if I can't come up with something at least a little closer. 

Thank you so much for the comment and for reading!
