Inside a solid oak, two story inn about 5 miles from the nearest town, a man sat going over his equipment. The air was stale but warmer than outside. Poor Bertha, the furnace, was in need of a good cleaning; however, with the war it had been impossible to get anyone to travel. Filters, sealers, and basic consumables were getting harder to come by.

The building used to be called Wandering Home long ago. Its name had changed with the times but always a play on those words. Amos, the man, had owned it for centuries. Sort of a hobby and escape. Always said that the organisation never had rights to his entire existence. This building was what was left of his soul.

He figured, well maintained wood is always worth protecting and while it had no one, save him, in it now he could still hear the patrons from long times long passed. Thousands of them. Never more than a dozen at a time, mind you, but they always came here with their own sort of purpose. Always reminded Amos of why he fought.

Teddy, a kid no more than five once snuck in and played underneath the tables. His dad thought it was a good laugh. Teddy though grew into Ted and, one day, came in with a girl that called him Theo. They had their wedding less than a mile away and celebrated here afterwards. Ted, who was sometimes called Theo, came in panicking once over the news he was to have a son of his own. He talked, was convinced of his courage, and agreed to name his son Theodore Junior. Amos found it easier to remember the lines like that. 

Amos had watched them, talked to them, and guided them. Junior however, grew into a lazy, fat man who his father couldn’t understand and his own son resented. Theo III was a hard man, strict with his own children who, in turn, turned into free spirits. Theo IV, years later, came in once with an old drawing of Teddy imagining all the adventures he had had.  Amos actually smiled seeing one of his drawings resurface.

Time meant very little to him; moments meant the world though. All those moments meant even more now when all the world could have less of them. Darkness, fear, and evil spread like the floods of old through the land. It had started long ago, not as long ago as Amos, mind you, but still long ago. They were immortals, like Amos but with desires unbecoming of ones who would claim that title. 

They, and Amos for that matter, were not invincible. Explosions, crushing, and beheadings work to stop them almost as well as silver. Blessings from the First Father that his metal worked as a poison against his creation. Amos used to ask the Kings for payment in the form of a sword made from it. Utterly useless thing but with that amount he could buy what he needed or make a good amount of daggers. Still carried a short sword of it with him though. Arrows were better and, when technology changed, bullets became a game breaker. Amos thought they would have ended it all with Colts.

No such thing as a safe silver sword to anyone though. They were just as useful against Amos as they were for him. Gabriel, Ki, and Viktor had all been destroyed with that explosion of silver shrapnel. Amos joked that it was the new holy hand grenade and used it extensively in the counter attack. 

Tonight wouldn’t be as difficult as then. Two targets had been seen moving east along the old interstate and were resting in a mansion south of town. Town was dangerous but Amos never touched those old steel monstrosities. Always looked too much like honey pots to Amos to want to modify. Tonight they were just that.

The path Amos took had once upon a time been the main road through the area. Actually before that it had been a train track laid just off the original road. The train had disappeared and the road had moved over. People forgot about the original but Amos walked it every once in a while. It was mostly surrounded by trees except for out by the ridge. 

You could see for miles at the lookout point. Once it was called Lovers Point and before that the Hangman's Spot. Amos was glad humans became better. He could still smell the moments though. The time he’d come here after a botched attempt on a lord and the smell of young love. Bastard Bob's final breaths were another one. Now it was just smoky and stale. Not sure how the wilderness ever can smell stale but there it was.

The mansion was the work of a granddaughter of a tech executive from long ago. She had wanted a stage and only a stage for her to be broadcasted on every moment of every day. Amos wasn’t sure if he had liked her or Bastard Bob less. Most of the celebrities from that era though went the same way. Started pure but narcissistic, did impure things, documented it extensively, documents then got released, and eventually the narcissist leaves. She did. She jumped from the top of her ego into obscurity within five years.

Tonight, two partied like she did, abused people like she did, and blasted her music like she did. It may have been art to hedonistic simpletons carried to greatness on the backs of their ancestors but to Amos it was the same garbage they were. Worse, tonight was, as the demons mocked her rise and fall as part of their game. Amos drank the elixirs that would easily kill any mortal before continuing.
