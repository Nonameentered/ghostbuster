“Time to die,” I maliciously stated to my screen before frowning to myself and adding in a frustrated little tone, “Well, again. Because, you know, zombies and.” I paused and shook my head, arguing with myself about the semantics was pointless. Laughing, I got back the malice and yelled. “Nah, you what? Time to Die!”

The first lob of the alchemist's fire was perfect. The mobs managed to randomly group together inside my zone just before the bottle landed and exploded. Stupid things. It was probably a more expensive explosion than I needed but it was fun. Well, it was supposed to be fun. 

The fifteen or so that I had attacked looked like they were hit but they all turned toward my character and screamed at me. That wasn’t good. A couple of ticks of fire damage and they should have been down. Well, a couple of ticks of fire damage was all the alchemist’s fire had in it as well so at least the effect should have ended. It didn’t. The zombies were made and very much still moving. They were moving very quickly.

“Ah! no. They’re 28 Day’s Later zombies!” I yelled at my screen, “No, no-no-no. I set them on fire! Why did I set them on fire?” I continued to yell as I got swarmed, “You were supposed to be Dead Rising zombies, not super fast, god mode zombies! Why aren’t you slow… and I’m dead.”

Sighing to myself, I got up and walked around my unkept apartment as the adrenaline wore off. Wasn’t this supposed to be relaxing? I thought I had signed up for something slow and simple. Well, at least I knew the new area was going to have crazy zombies in it. 

Sitting back down, I took a couple of deep breaths and entered the game again. I wasn’t going to let some D-Ranked quest beat me. There had to be some sort of trick to these things that I had missed. Granted I had missed most of the beginning of the quest by not reading it but usually, there was some sort of clue inside the quest box.

When I got back to the entrance to the crypt gates, I groaned as the text box changed to include a hint about trying to find a way around the zombies. I hate when the designers meant for me to die. Maybe I wasn’t but it always felt like it when those little hints appeared. 

Moving around the massive horde was an interesting task, the game boundaries didn’t let me go too far on either side. A large fence blocked my way to the left and the right had a collapsed stone wall blocking it. Searching the area, seemed to pick up something though and good old Mr. Murdermittens seemed to have left more than just a hand for me to pick up.

A couple of feet away from the quest node was a full sized body. Not reading the game dialogue, my character picked up the corpse and slowed my walking speed down to a crawl. I laughed, this was a stealth test. Walk through the horde without being noticed and we are good to go.

“Don’t you dare,” I muttered a couple of times as I slowly inched my way through the bumbling masses that I now knew could take off, sprinting, on a dime. 

One or two seemed to get unusually close to me as I moved, making me freeze in place and wait for them. Maybe it was the coffee but it was rather unnerving how loud the grunts and gurgles these things were making.

“Oh,” I had in relief when I finally made it to the entrance of the crypt on the other side of the field of zombies, “hopefully that was the fun part.”

Walking in though, there were torches already lit and writing on the walls. It looked like blood, scrawled out in some sort of heavy metal band font. Biting my tongue, I tried my best to read it but ended up having to write it down. It looked stretched, so tilting up my piece of paper I read the note as best I could.

“He’s watching from your window,” I muttered, “A twisting fate beyond the portal. He’s watching you from limbo. You should be careful what you say, mortal.”

I swallowed and tilted my head at that. It wasn’t great but it did leave me a bit on edge after the coffee and zombies. What was rather troublesome about it was there was no quest marker and dialogue with this. It was just written on some wall in the crypt. 

“Fun game,” I groaned, set my character into stealth mode, and got up, “probably just some joke about how if I have made it this far, I haven’t seen sunlight in a while.”

Breathing deep, I stretched a bit and went to the window to see if there was anything left of daylight still outside. Thankfully there was. It was only six in the evening and I realised I should probably get some food. Something healthy. Chinese food with vegetables this time would do the trick. 

“Hey,” I said into my phone after dialling. Ms. Cho always answered in the same upbeat, professional tone she always had, confirming who I was, “Yeah, it’s me.”

“It’s past your order time Erik,” Ms. Cho chided me, “I was worried.”

“I got caught up in something,” I muttered into the phone. She was more my mom than my mom was.

“University?” Ms. Cho asked but added with disappointment, “Or gaming?” 

“It’s Saturday, Ms. Cho,” I said with a laugh, “and I have my work done.”

“Sure, sure,” Ms. Cho mocked, “ You want your usual.” 

Yes please, same standard,” I confirmed but backtracked, “No wait, actually, could I get fried veggies instead of the spring rolls?”

“It’s extra,” Ms. Cho stated.

“Yup,” I laughed, “Price for eating healthy.”

“My food is tasty and good,” Ms. Cho scoffed, “You want to be healthy, have the soup.”

“I’m already boiling Ms. Cho,” I said into the phone and looked out my window again, “I’m not… what?”

Across the street and on a balcony of the adjacent condos, a black cat sat perched on the ledge of the railing staring straight at me. A large black cat. It just laying there but after the notice in the game and how the zombies acted, I was a little more stunned than I should have been.

“What is it now, Erik?” Ms. Cho asked, “You want spring rolls too?”

“Sorry, black cat across the street was staring at me,” I muttered into the phone, barely able to pry my eyes away from the intenseness of the slitted amber eyes, “Sorry, I have been playing too much.”

“You are twenty stories up?” Ms. Cho said as a question, “That building isn’t complete yet.”

“That’s what I thought,” I muttered into my phone and glanced out the window again, “But it’s there.”

“Well, black cat’s bad luck,” Ms. Cho said solemnly, “Don’t let it cross your path and whatever you do, don’t let it find you before you find it.”

“What?” I asked, holding my phone out and staring at it for a second.

“Don’t let it cross your path,” Ms. Cho repeated.

“No, the other thing,” I quickly said.

“What other thing?” Ms. Cho asked.

“Don’t let it find you before you find it?” I asked quickly, “What does that mean?”

“I didn’t say that,” Ms. Cho laughed, “Erik, you get too worked up. You know what, I’ll add a spring roll to your order. Should be up to you in twenty.”

“Umm,” I muttered, “Thank you?”

“You take care now dear,” Ms. Cho said before hanging up.

“You too,” I said to the dead line before looking up at the black cat out my window again.
