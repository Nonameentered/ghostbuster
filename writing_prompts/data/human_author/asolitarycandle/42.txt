Watching intently as the werewolf on their screen reached for the icon, both John and Tommy leaned forward on the couch and held their breath. A chime of a new inventory item rang out.

“Scent marker?” Tommy read out the title after opening the menu as John tilted his head.

“Hey, wait,” John laughed, “Do those look like your shorts?”

“A little,” Tommy admitted.

“Well, let's go find the little shit that stole them,” John said as he gave an evil grin to the screen, “It’ll make up for Darel taking yours.”

“Yeah.”

Tommy directed the hulking brute of a werewolf on a trail leading out of the thicket. A swirling red haze of vapour laid before them, leading them on. He passed a couple of old, run-down forts with newer toys that look familiar. Shaking his head at the idea, Tommy almost ran off the edge of a river before making a sharp left into farmland. 

A field of heat stubble on the other side of the barbed wire fence lay before them. On the other edge, a farmhouse. Old but well-tended wood panels decorated the walls but both boys looked at the rough edges of the shingled roof with an uncomfortable confused gaze.

“Man, am I nuts or does that look like?” John let the question hang.

“My house,” Tommy finished after the quiet in the dark room became too much.

“Try howling,” John chuckled, “That’ll scare whoever inside.”

Tommy gently clicked the right trigger down and listened to a long drawn-out howl come from the speakers. And from behind them. Possibly somewhere else in the house? It sounded like it came from the front door though. An echo?

“Maybe,” Tommy whispered, “I’m… going to… drop this quest.”

“Yeah… sure.”
