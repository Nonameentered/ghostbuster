Thank you! That's not a compliment that I normally get. I have been working pretty hard on that goal for a long time though so it's nice to hear. As a writer, I really appreciate this space for the ability to work on my skills and get feedback. However, as a reader, I do agree there is a very wide range of proficiencies present in any given prompt.
