“Ah!” I yelled, exhausted and very nearly dead but holding the last black scaled heart I needed, “Ha ha, I got it.”

“Finally,” Jerry monotonally, he had been with me for way too long, “I’m going to log off man. That was way too long.”

“Yeah, sorry,” I apologised, sifting through my potions and supplies, “two percent drops always suck.”

“Erik, no,” Jerry argued, “doing it on repeat until you achieve it sucks. I told you to try this over weeks, not days.”

“The price of this is going to fall fast,” I argued back, “the bots will get a hold of the spawn points and flood the market. You want the Keep. We need gold.”

“Whatever,” Jerry said with a sigh, “You owe me a weekend.”

With that, I heard the line go dead just as a chime went off indicating that Jerry had logged out. I really did owe him. We had spent almost, ew. Well, we had spent over seven hours farming these stupid lizards for their hearts just so that I could sell a top teir piece. On auction, I am hoping for at least three hundred thousand gold considering how new it was.

Crafting, customizing, and arranging the setup wasn’t hard as the guild had a guy that loved auctions so it was just giving it to him. Samson, I think was his real name, had to be taking something in business for the prices he gets. Not that I minded, talking to rando’s was weird in real life but inside an MMO, it was weirder. 

I wandered around aimlessly for a while, just taking in the sites of the new maps and a couple of the new cities. Being high-ranked was nice. I didn’t really have to trouble myself with the open PvP aspect of the game anymore. Very few could actually get me down quick enough to make the effort worth it and if someone actually decided to team up with me, my team was better. 

Stopping on the other side of the rather hard transition between the arid desert of the High Heaven’s Plain and the snow banks of White Dragon’s Peak, I grabbed a coffee and some chips in real life. My apartment was a mess but so was my life. This game provided enough of an escape that I could make it through. I needed an actual goal. I sort of meant in game but I guess it also applied to real life. Anyway, not wanting to start something new though I flipped through my quest list for something mundane. 

“Get twelve tusks, no. Kill thirty Mud Divers?” I muttered to myself as I read through, swearing everything was the same task regardless of where I was or what I was doing. Cursing to myself though, I muttered out, “Not doing another escort quest in Bad Lines Mine, delete.”

One of the problems with this game, well aside from the bugs and the lag, was the quest list was basically limitless. I think I had some sixty quests started in some way or another but could never seem to find out which ones were important unless I went online. There were addons for it, which I had a couple of, but even with them it was just about ranking and organised spatially.

“D-list, find my cat,” I muttered as I sipped my coffee, “That could be cute.”

It definitely wasn’t a be swarmed by murderous lizards, vultures, and worms while being debuffed continuously. Could be relaxing. The reward wasn’t really worth it but at least it was something to waste a couple of minutes with. 

“Accept,” I said to my screen as I warped to the closest portal, “Well Mr. Arkstone, I don’t remember picking this up but for some reason, you just got an S-Ranker to save your cat.”

Not that I hadn’t done stupider things than save a cat. There was this weird quest where I had to lead a donkey away from this castle for some reason. The captain said I wasn’t to speak of it to anyone or the mage’s guild would have a field day with them. The internet said they were going to turn it into some meme.

The cabin that Mr. Arkstone lived in was nice. Never seen a two-story cabin in game before but then again this was a newer area. Getting closer it changed a bit, I watched as a window disappeared and one of the arches got a little sharper until when I was at the door it was just a corner. Neat programming graphics, I thought, but rather forced and enough that I didn’t say anything out loud.

“Oh!” an old man yelled as he ran out from behind the cabin, “Adventurer, you have come!” 

“And this is going to be annoying,” I muttered out in real life.

Getting to me, the old man forced open a dialogue page with a solid page of backstory that I skipped through. Three months of playtime on a single character and I swear if I had to read another woe is me story I’d cancel my subscription. Not that the writings for this game weren’t good. It’s just after literally thousands of quests, I’m not sure if I could still be writing. 

“Yes, save the precious,” I muttered as I skipped through the dialogue and accepted the next section of the quest. Find Mr. Murdermittens. I hesitated reading that out loud and muttered, “Umm, okay. That’s a fun name.”

It is going to be a panther or some large cat. Totally calling it right now that this is some meme that the programmers think would be funny. I’m probably also going to have to kill it and get some dumb, morally grey decision tree dialogue options.

“I’m so sorry Mr. Arkstone,” I muttered to myself as I started toward the first marker, “Mr. Murdermittens went rabid… or just acted like a normal cat with murder mittens.”

Running into the mountains, I picked up Mr. Murdermittens trail as I passed the first quest marker. Pretty standard. It was just searching the area, looking for clues, and killing whatever wildlife got in my way. The massive spiders in this expansion always gave me the creeps but at least it was sort of helping me get over my fear of them. Nothing like being towered over by a glowing orb weaver that moves too quickly.

A couple of glowing bushes, a log climb and a fallen tree later I got to the second quest marker. Again, fairly standard. I sat and waited for my character to search the area for whatever Mr. Murdermittens had left behind. Probably going to be some mouse or something. I swear, if it’s another scat quest though I’m abandoning it.

“You have found a zombie's hand?” I had to say out loud when the dialogue popped up on my screen, “That’s different. Well, Mr. Murdermittens, it looks like you have been busy.”

Taking a sip of coffee in real life, I pocketed the hand in game and continued on. I was kind of hoping this was going to be a panther now. It would be kind of amazing if this thing was taking out the neighbouring enemies while the old man sat drinking shine or something. I could totally do that in retirement. Well, if this game had a retirement expansion.

Cresting a hill, I got sight of the next quest marker and a massive horde of zombies. Smiling to myself because there had to be at least two hundred of these mindless things wandering around, I prepared my spells and potion. This was going to be amazing. I loved the low hp mobs that were just splash damage mops and drops. Plus, I couldn’t remember the last good massive horde zombie game I played.
