“How about the hospital?” I yelled, looking down at the broken and bleeding man in front of me, “Evil government research lab? Any of your politician friends-“

“No,” he interrupted me with a whimper but turned it into a soft, high-pitched whine as he tensed up. Coughing softly into the ground, he turned back up and explained, “They’ll find me. They think I’m dead.”

“Why here man?” I asked, exhausted, “why me?”

“Because they’ll come for you next,” he said, spitting out a mouthful of blood into my bushes.

“They?” I asked, scoffing at him and sort of wishing to kick him for spitting on my plants. This place was supposed to be my sanctuary out in the middle of nowhere. How did he even get here?

“Oh,” the man groaned and wilted a bit but I just watched. He deserved no empathy and he’d get none from me. Slowly, he looked up and explained, “Your friend Stephan, I thought was actually my friend Petro. Ha. Always gave me enough to keep ahead of you but never enough to be noticed. Glasgow, Madrid, and New York. I knew what you were doing because of him.”

“That’s not true,” I seethed more in the fact that I had suspected that for some time rather than the accusation. 

“It’s not,” he tried to laugh but it turned into a cough, “He’s not Petro either. He’s not anyone. He’s one of us but he can hide. He can hide… it.”

“One of us?” I asked.

“Different,” the man in front of me said into the metal door frame, “We’re different. You heal, your speed, your strength, your energy, it’s not normal. I was hit by a train. End of the line and into a wall.”

“I’m not like you,” I stated, angrily.

“No, your not,” he quickly confirmed, “You have no idea how to get ahead-“

“No, I have a soul you horrendous waste of garbage,” I explained, too angry to make sense as I lifted his head up to face me with my foot, “I help people. All you do is start wars.”

“I start the wars that will happen before they can get out of hand,” he said slowly, breathing now even more raggedly, “I get paid to collapse potential catastrophe.”

“So noble,” I scoffed.

“That’s your thing,” the man actually had the gall to laugh at me, “I do what I’m good at and I get paid what I’m due. Unlike you.”

“So, again,” I growled, “Why come to me?”

“Because there is a war coming and I’m good at what I do,” he whimpered, “I don’t know where else to go. I don’t know who else can stop them. I’m sorry, if I had anywhere else I would… I can’t believe I’m here.”

“A man everyone thinks is dead is now in the woods and miles passed nowhere,” I muttered and pondered openly to myself, “Would be a shame if a bear came by and saw you like this.”

“The train broke my legs and I think my hip is fractured,” he laughed, “but a grizzly… I ripped one apart on the way here. It has been… It’s been a bit of a crappy walk.”

 “You got hit by a train within walking distance of here?” I asked quickly.

“No,” the man scoffed, “I stole a car and gave it to some drifter.”

“Super,” I stated, pressing my fist into my forehead I asked, “So does everyone know about this place?”

“You never even told Stephan about it,” the man said shaking his head, “I only found out because you came here directly after your whole savour act thing went bad last week.”

“Tracking device?” I asked.

“No,” the man laughed, “just video surveillance and receipts. Last thing you bought was gas for your rental outside Tillmans. You’re too honest.”

“Tillmans is three hundred miles from here,” I stated.

“And we live in a world that has satellite imagery,” the man explained, “I looked in the places I would build a retreat and here we are. I didn’t tell Petro. Didn’t tell my network. They sacrificed me before I could. They will find it though. If Petro is like us, he’ll find this place if he hasn’t already.”

“Well, if you're like me,” I muttered, stepping past the man but grabbing his collar and dragging him effortlessly behind me. I always hated when people screamed but he sounded about right. It was soothing. Unbelievably gut retching but somewhere in my head, it was making up for all the children I was too late to save. Coming up to what I called my healing chamber, I unfastened the chains, wrapped them around the man's broken wrists and asked, “You really sure you’re like me?”

“Yes,” he angrily spat out.

“Well let’s put that to the test then,” I chuckled, “I heal better in cold water.”

“What?” he asked, “Why?”

“No idea,” I admitted as I lifted him up over the ridge of the well, “Weird thing is I also can’t seem to drown so I’ll come get you in a couple hours.”

“Wait, no,” the man squirmed painfully, “What are you doing?”

“Helping?” I asked back but let him drop into the well before he could answer. 

He screamed all the way down and there was this sickening hollow splash at the end but the man had been sure. If he believed that he was like me then it would only take a week or two for even his bones to heal. Worst case though, I’ll come back and find that he had been wrong and I’d have to figure out Stephan on my own. Actually, wait, was that my worst-case scenario?
