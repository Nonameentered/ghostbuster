Fifteen years ago, Humanity discovered that Star Trek's non-interference directive was near-verbatim what the Sitlan System’s reason for never interacting with us was. We were new and young and they wanted to let us mature. A world full of resources and a clean atmosphere wasn’t worth a potential ally in the vastness of the universe. 

Our recklessness sort of messed that up. Turns out we were supposed to go to Mars first and that would give them time to clean up their automated mining equipment in the asteroid belt. We saw the same resources they did though and decided it would be better to send unmanned craft out first. It was a test to see if life support systems would hold up for a decade or two. There was this celebration when they did that quickly turned into a shock and awe moment when we discovered we weren’t alone.

That moment, on the Ovtan’s third moon, alarms and orders were quickly dispatched to anyone that was deemed important. A delegation was quickly assembled and launched from three of the five systems while the other two waited to see how they were received. Regardless of how it went, the two were more militaristic in nature and commented that it was better to be left out of a celebration than slaughtered at one.

Every year from that date of their arrival, humanity celebrates Visitors Day. Each delegation split in two and sent a team to each continent, one north and one south. They were treated incredibly differently to the point where it was recorded that humanity didn’t understand globalisation even though we had technically achieved it a century before. Notes were taken, comments were made, and the delegations tried their best to explain what usually happens millennia from that point.

At the point of contact, a blending of cultures and knowledge usually happened. Science and philosophy bloomed and with how advanced their AI was, most labour based jobs disappeared. They promised that some things would be difficult to let go of but when we saw the truths in the universe they had found it would be worth it.

Humanity shocked them. Of the five systems that were currently in the known vicinity and even the three that had destroyed themselves, no one had tried to convert them in one sentence and tried to sell them something in the next. If humanity was good at anything though, it was commoditization.

“Y’thod!” Robert boomed as one of his favourite mining executives walked into the hotel with his family. The grand entrance had been built to accommodate. Twenty-foot ceiling, IR and UV paint and decals, and an atmospheric control system that cost more than a landing pad. Robert bowed while waving in what was now the standard human greeting to offworlders and said, “I hope you brought your credits! I have an entirely redesigned menu for you to try.”

“Obe’t! Al’ays do!” Y’thod called back, “Al’ays love you’ food!”

“Come for the hospitality,” Robert announced, “Stay for the variety is humanity's motto.”

“Should be, stay because you can’t affo’d to leave!” Y’thod laughed back, coming close to Robert and giving him a pat on both shoulders. 

It was a sign of friendship but a clear indication that Y’thod was the superior of the two. Granted the man was eight feet tall, built stronger than a tank and had a stare that would curdle water. The deep red of Y’thod’s skin always made Robert a little less self-conscious of the constant red around his nose and eyes. The old Irish man had the dark brown hair of his father but the almost translucently white skin of his mother.

“Yeah well, I assume with the family you’ll be avoiding the tables this time,” Robert said quietly.

“Why?” Y’thod asked back, “I b’ought them he’e to expe’ience human cultu’e. Food, sin, and sa’vation.”

“Ah!” Robert said with a nod, “Well I can provide two of those. The third is a trip into the malls.”

“That’s the p’an,” Y’thod with a nod before turning back around and introducing the beings with him, “‘Obe’t, this is my clan. My Bishna, my Tilsa, and our spa’n.”

“Pleasure to meet you all,” Robert said with a bow and a wave.

The six in front of Robert were all red-skinned creatures and taller than he was but radically different fitness levels. Y’thod’s Bishna would be the closest that he had to a wife and was similar in build and structure to Y’thod. Bishna were an equal pillar to the household that Y’thod’s status as Kishna were but it was more a partnership than a relationship. Their Tilsa was more like a secretary and the thin male kept their household running. Robert had been told that with the spawn, two would be Y’thod’s for replacement and, as contracted, one of them would be the Tilsa’s. It was immediately evident which was which.

Regardless, they all greeted Robert the same as Y’thod did and treated him like the weakest among them. Robert had to admit that he technically was but he sort of assumed that the Tilsa and his spawn would treat him as a superior. Not that he would demand it. So long as they flew away with significantly fewer credits than they had arrived in, Robert would be happy.”

“When do we see the st’eet magician?” one of Y’thod’s spawn asked after they were done.

“Next lifting,” Y’thod explained, “We feast and sin on this setting.”

“Point of clarity,” Robert quickly added, knowing that Y’thod preferred the doom and gloom messaging of the humans with their bull horns and pamphlets, “They prefer preacher, not magician. Street magicians are something else.”

“What’s the diffe’ence,” Y’thod asked back.

“I honestly don’t know,” Robert quietly admitted, “Different types of sleight of hand tricks, I guess.”

“And to be clea’, ‘e don’t clap for them?” Y’thod asked quietly.

“No,” Robert said with a shake of his head, “they prefer you to take a pamphlet.”

“Why can’t we see them now?” the same spawn asked.

“Because ‘e get to feast!” Y’thod tried his best to excite his family group but whispered to Robert, “Spa’n never ‘ant ‘at’s promised, do they?”

“It’s the same with humans,” Robert chuckled as he admitted and grabbed his tablet out of his holster. He clicked through a couple of menus and then held it up for Y’thod to scan in. After Y’thod’s wrist chimed, Robert explained, “I have your room and your favourite table ready. My chef has a five-course meal of your favourite micro dishes with two fresh new designs.”

“And an order of those meaty nuggets to sha’e for the spa’n?” Y’thod asked.

“What’s a meal without chicken nuggets for the spawn?” Robert asked back as the eight of them walked toward the dining hall, “I have all the dipping sauces for them to try as well already prepared.”

“Good,” Y’thod confirmed before booming, “Let's feast and sin!”

“Let’s feast and sin!” a cheer went up behind Robert, making him smile.
