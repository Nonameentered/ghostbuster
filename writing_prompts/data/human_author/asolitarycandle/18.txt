Being locked into a large box store is nearly impossible. Due to fire regulations and just the sheer number of fire exits, I should have been golden once I found one. From memory, there was at least one or two on each side of the large Swedish box store that I found myself in. 

I mean, maybe it was odd for the first couple of hours and I did sort of make it a game of it after a while but overnighting was unnerving. The idea that I was able to wander around without notice is absurd. There I was though. No alarm sounded. I tried using my cell, the landlines, the internet to send messages, the windows to flag someone down and even, and I’m not proud of this, throwing a brick at one of them. It just bounced. 

After that, I got turned around. The cafeteria was nice and it was Ikea so I had any choice of mattress firmness I wanted after I got too tired to continue. I made myself some meatballs late at night and ate them near the stairs. Something about the seating area felt weird. It was just very dark.

The night passed into early morning. I waited patiently. Well, I tried to convince myself I was patient but, in truth, I was beyond scared. This wasn’t right. The lights came on in a dazzling flash and overpowered the sunlight coming in from somewhere else. I went back to the cafeteria, they would be starting up breakfast any time now before the store opened. I’d beg someone, plead with them if I had to, to let me out of this weirdly inviting nightmare.

I stopped before entering. Weren’t there floor-to-ceiling windows in every Ikea cafeteria? I tried my best to look out at the painted landscape on the concrete walls but it wasn’t right. There were supposed to be apartment buildings passed the highway. Wasn’t there? I got closer but couldn’t bring myself to stare at them for too long.

A churning, grinding sound from beside me had me jump. The ovens in the kitchen were on. The deep fryers were next in a whoosh of gas and turbine-like fans came alive.

“Hello!” I yelled, “Hey, is anyone there?”

No one responded.

“Hey, I need help!” I yelled again.

No one was there. 

The machines bubbled and churned as the day started and the store came alive but try as I could, there were no timers. Choking back tears I search hard for some, any soul that could help me. Back and forth I went. Nothing could be seen or found of another living person around me. 

“Please,” I whispered to the brightly lit, immaculately clean kitchen.

I don’t know why but I ended up grabbing a tray of meatballs from the freezer and running them through the oven. Munching on them as I waited, I tried to think of some sort of plan. There was nothing though. The store was alive and working but not a step or breath could be heard within these walls. 

I wandered again. Office supplies had scissors, I grabbed a sort of shield from the dining area, and then went back to the cafeteria for hope. There were phones there but they didn’t seem to work. Every time I dialled out, all they did was ring.

My cell was at full charge but I had zero bars. Who makes a solid Ikea? That can’t be right. I swear there were windows somewhere in this store. Maybe it wasn’t the cafeteria but there was light coming in from somewhere. Wasn’t there a glassed-in stairway somewhere?

“The other side of the bedrooms,” I gasped, got up, and jogged my way around the displays. A door, one of those solid metal ones with the bar caught my eye and I pushed my way through. 

It was internal? I was in office supplies again. Why hadn’t I seen this door before though? Turning around, I grimaced as a shiver ran from my ears and down my sides as I saw the painted back of the one-way door. It was hard to see even knowing it was there. 

“Why,” I whispered, swallowed hard and shook my head, “This isn’t happening. This is a weirdly vivid dream. I fell asleep in an Ikea by accident and now I’m having a meatball-infused nightmare.”

The world didn’t change though. Even as I said my hopes and fears to myself, I knew something else was wrong. Something was different about this place. It wasn’t like I hadn’t retraced my steps. I knew where the entrance and exits were to a point. Why wasn’t I able to find them? 

Downstairs, I had only navigated once. I turned and twisted in on itself and I ended up back at the potted plants and candles section. Only took turning left six times. I had to count that a couple of times but it was close to the beginning of this so I still felt like this was some sort of game. 

Maybe it was.

Was this a game? I stopped back at the stairway outside the cafeteria leading downstairs to the self-serve area. Looking around at the still empty chairs, the possibly self-cleaning appliances, and the now full display cases, I tried my best to think. How long had I been wandering around this bloody store? It was hard to tell time. Starting the stopwatch on my phone I shivered and whimpered, realising I was going nuts.

So wake me up when it’s all over

“AHHH!,” I yelled as my phone started ringing in my hand. “Ohhhh, kay. What? Beth!”

I recognised the number and in an instant answered the call and put my phone up to my ear.

“Beth!” I gasped, “Beth can you hear me?”

“Hey!” the slightly garbled but distinct voice of my friend came through, “Sort of. Where did you go yesterday? You-“

“I’m still at Ikea!” I basically yelled at the phone, interrupting Beth before shaking my head and then whispering, “I’m not able to leave.”

“Okay,” Beth laughed, “That’s not funny. Like I get you think it’s funny but we’ve talked about this-“

“It’s not funny,” I whispered, looking around and then back at my phone, “Look, I know this sounds insane but I’m literally still in the store. I slept here. I don’t know what is going on. No one’s here but the store sounds like it’s open.”

“The store is open,” Beth scoffed, “This is still not funny because I am here now. There’s a lot of people here.” 

“Where are you?” I asked, shaking.

“In the cafeteria,” Beth explained, “Where are you?”

“By the cafeteria stairs,” I explained getting up and looking around. There was nothing.

“No, Jesse,” Beth sounded exhausted, “There’s a family with a toddler inching their way down the stairs but no you.”

“Hey, umm, can you switch to video?” I asked, no shaking.

“You hate video,” Beth chuckled.

“I know,” I muttered, “Just here, I, I’ll do it. Just.”

I pulled my phone away from my ear and sent out a request for a video chat. My data wouldn’t last long but I needed to see this. I needed to see what she saw. I needed to know that this wasn’t just something in my head.

Boo-ding

“Hey,” Beth’s face loaded single frames onto the screen and then shifted in an instant to a frown, “Where are you?” 

“I keep telling you,” I explained as I switched the camera and pointed it out to the empty cafeteria, “I’m still here.”

“Jesse… What the?” Beth gasped at what I was showing her. Doing something on her side, I saw her face disappear and the space where I should be sitting came into view. I wasn’t there. Beth scoffed, “Jesse, I don’t know what you doing but this isn’t funny.”

“No, it’s really not,” I whimpered, “This isn’t funny at all. Beth, you are the first person I have talked to. You have to get help. You have to find. Please. Please, Beth. I don’t care how. I don’t care. Just find me.”

“You're serious?” Beth said with a garbled shudder. 

“Yes,” I whispered back.

“Okay,” Beth grunted and her phone shook but brought her face back into view, “Stay put. I’ll call the cops or something.”

“Kay,” I whispered, “Thank you.”

“I swear Jesse,” Beth seethed, “If this is some prank-“

“I wish it was, Beth,” I whimpered, “Please. Please help. Please.”

“Okay, stay safe” Beth groaned and hung up.

Hearing the line click dead was worse than I thought it would be. I was alone again. Was there something in here with me or was it just a nightmare in isolation? Lifting my phone away, I froze and whimpered hard into the nothingness around me. The timer was still going:

28:03:46.##

“Hmmmmm, what?” I asked the phone.

28:03:53.##

“That’s,” I whispered, “Don’t do that.”

28:03:52.##

“Wait? What?” I panicked, “No!”

28:03:51.00

28:03:50.00

28:03:49.00
