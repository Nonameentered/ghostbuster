“Praise the Light!” a chant rippled out from the Altar of Scales as the congregation in front of Father Sam echoed his call. Behind him, laying flat and ever watchful, their lord and protector, the Dragon, Al’santhor, blew a gust of warm air over them. Feeling its power, Father Sam lifted his arms to the sky and continued, “Praise the Light for it nourishes our souls.”

“Praise the Light!”

“Praise the Sky!” Father Sam sang out from the sunken amphitheater of bare stone from which he preached. Long had it taken to carve out of the earth even for the mighty dragon that watched above them. The grandfathers of every soul sitting here worked with their Protector to build this place of peace and worship. “For it holds no freedoms back!

“Praise the Light!”

“Praise the Clouds!” Father Sam sang for his grandfather had written of the vanquish of the shadow, the terror of the lands so long ago. A time of darkness and despair for all of those who claimed this land their home. ”For it cleans the earth we stand upon!”

“Praise the Light!”

“Praise our Protector Al’santhor!” Father Sam called to the heavens themselves for as their Protector had fought for them they would respond and cherish his glory over the evil that ruled these lands. “For he fought away the darkness and brought us back the light!

“Praise the Light! Praise Al’santhor!”

“Praise the Light,” Father Sam said quietly to himself as the people around him continued to chant.

“Eighty years since that day,” Father Sam started, seats of now empty stone in front of him as he picked his way through his notes. I hadn’t said anything since the celebration had started. The shame of this day was a burden my ageing wings had difficulty bearing. Not that I was old. Dragons don’t age the same as the little apes that seem to value me now. Finding what he was looking for, the little man continued, “Eighty years of peace you have brought us.”

“Would you know it from the battles you yourselves create?” I asked back.

“Our neighbours have brought conflict,” Father Sam insisted, irritated at the question no doubt but I wasn’t in a praising mood, “We responded, as you did and as you did we answered in kind to what was brought before us.”

“What is written and what was done are rarely the same,” I muttered, my deep voice carrying further than I ever wished. 

The years of praise for my deeds weighed heavily on my mind as the years grew stable. The little apes worked their tools, farmed the land, and raised their cattle but I only had to watch. Memories playing back as slivers of shame best forgotten.

“My forebearers wrote your words,” Father Sam scoffed as he turned and offered, “If there is any mistake in the telling, I am your servant to correct the tale and we shall all be glad to hear of your heroics in their true glory.”

“My words were true,” I argued, these creatures had difficulty with perspective, “Your praise, though flattering, is difficult not to disregard as its sweetness passes the borders of tolerable.”

“Was it not your lord that told the story of your triumph?” Father Sam asked.

“Yes,” I confirmed.

“And was it not by your will and might that the dragon Mal’zerob was vanquished?” Father Sam argued.

“He was,” I had never liked that phrasing but that is what I had said.

“So how would you describe this traitor from a distant land,” Father Sam said with the venom he always had for that creature, “What point are we missing? Was there a malicious of this creature that we do not understand?”

“Where am I from Samuel?” I asked, uncomfortable about what I was thinking.

“You are from the shining lands,” Father Sam beamed, “You flew here to save us.”

“And where are they?” I asked.

“Far beyond the horizon and over the sea,” Father Sam explained, trying to make sense of what I was asking.

“I am from distant lands Samuel,” I tried to explain but couldn’t seem to get the words out, “Do you understand? I am from distant lands.”

“He was your kin,” Father Sam confirmed, proudly but with an air of confusion at the simplicity of the question.

“More,” I said as I frowned at the little ape.

“He was your family?” Father Sam asked in shock. I had never told anyone what my connection to the Black Terror had ever been.

“More,” I muttered softly in shame.

“He was your brother?” Father Sam whispered. 

I frowned and the Samuel seemed to take that as confirmation. Turning quickly to his notes, the little ape played with his burnt stick and his tiny symbols as I watched, frozen solid as I tried to find the courage to continue speaking. The little thing seemed so happy in his discovery. A brother. What a great sacrifice their protector had made to save all their little lands from destruction. 

Closing his cowhide cover, he rushed to that little bundle of sticks and mud that he called his lair with an excitement that was hard to describe. A new story. A renewed faith in the one that they had called Protector. What a feast they would have. What a celebration they would build.

All but Al’santhor would sing to the high heavens for the dragon had one more clarification for Father Sam that the little ape wouldn’t hear. Only after the little door was shut and all the villagers had gone back to their tasks and their lives did the dragon let out a long sigh in frustration and shame. Only then did the blades of grass hear the final admission. One of shame. One of guilt.

“It was me.”
