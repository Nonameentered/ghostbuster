Violence, the type I can’t interfere with, is something well known to me. Any night of the week I see blood, sometimes bone, and on the rare occasion something even less appealing. That acrid, coppery smell is sometimes hard to get out of the wood but I manage. I have always managed. 

I’m just not used to my own. 

They knew that.

I came in early the next day, trying to work away the memory of that clown and his laugh. I didn’t want to think. When something went wrong I cleaned the bar, the kitchen, or the dining room. Usually in that order. They, not the ones who caused the mess but the spectators that watched the fights, fixed up the dining room so it was always last on my list.

Without sleep, the day came slowly. My teeth hurt, I could still taste blood and my cheek had swollen to become noticeable. They could see what had happened and the first early birds to my bar were confused but empathetic. Wanting quiet lives and a quiet drink before dark, they just listened to my retelling.

After dark though, the looks I started to get devolved from concern, to disbelief, into anger, and then into a common sense of wrath at the injustice in the world. If you look different, you are ostracized, ridiculed, and hated. If you are different, well, many of them hide for a reason. 

That first night passed with stories of what each of them would do if they found the meat sack that had hurt me. It felt weirdly nice to be so protected. Not that I liked learning how many of them had put any number of repelling spells on me without my knowledge let alone my consent. The only thing that had left a bitter taste in my mouth was that if spells were ineffective then it may have been one of their kind that did this.

That didn’t sit well with anyone.

I slept that night well regardless. Wizards, witches, a red mage, a woman that I’m pretty sure is actually a dragon, and a group of fae creatures that have an incredibly hard time with English were all willing to help. My face was healed, my teeth were straightened, or my jaw was corrected. Then they listed off a bunch of things I’m not sure if they were problems or not but they were done regardless. Oh well, such is living with magic.

The next morning, if one can call at eleven o'clock in the morning, the bar looked better than it had ever had before. Taking a deep breath, the old wood floors and tables smelt clean and cosy but with a hint of a forest in the spring. I loved it. My bar was solid, repaired and reinforced with magic that I couldn’t understand, and had the memories of every crazy night I had lived through. It even sounded better.

“And they screwed with my ears,” I muttered to myself as I let out a sigh, walked to the kitchen and turned out the now incredibly noisy oven. I had to get wings and the ribs started for tonight if the wolves were going to have their fill. Not that they were going to actually fill up at my bar. They usually came in for a snake first and then ate their fill somewhere else. Flipping on the burners, I shook my head and muttered, “Don’t ask where. Money’s not worth it.”

“The mess isn’t either,” a deep, cutting voice came from behind me. 

Snapping around, knife in hand because somehow a small, thin guy in his late thirties thought he was going to do something with it, I saw the last thing I wanted. His name, I’m not sure if it was actual name, was Marcus. He looked like me when he was near me. My dark curly hair had gotten longer than I thought it had but if Marcus was near me and only me then it was probably accurate. He was wearing the same cook's outfit I had on and was standing next to one of the large fridges in the back.

“Marcus,” I said and swallowed, “You know you aren’t supposed to be back here even when I am open.”

“As a customer,” Marcus agreed, not to the point I wanted but it was something, “I am not right now.”

“Okay?” I asked, backing up a bit.

“I am a friend,” he continued, pulling a large glowing glass container out from behind him and put it on my cutting board. Staring at the thing for a second, Marcus seemed to be satisfied with himself, turned to me and asked, “Do you know what this is?”

In the back of my head, I yelled, I don’t know what you are so how the nine hells am I supposed to know what this is? Was he a demon? Some sort of entity of darkness or evil or madness? I had no idea.

Marcus didn’t move unless he wanted to. His balance, his focus, and his attention were perfect. If one caught a glance of him, he looked like a statue when standing still and some sort of robot when moving. When he spoke, it was like he was calibrating what normal was but started from the lowest frequency and moved higher. The man, if he was that at all, only came in to have a shot of olive juice with a pickled clove of garlic saying that he didn’t like the taste of olives but liked the juice.

I never charged him for it but he always left me the weirdest tips.

“That is a jar,” I finally said out loud, much to my regret.

Looking at the thing again, Marcus let out a single, emotionless ha that he seemed disappointed in. 

“Accurate as always,” Marcus remarked, “Humourous.”

“Thank you?” I muttered.

“Inside this jar,” Marcus started but stopped to lift up the glowing jar and hold it perfectly still in front of him, “is the soul of the man who robbed you. I give it to you now as a way to balance your scales.”

“Oh, goodie,” I grimaced quietly. The idea of taking a soul in a jar from an unknown entity seemed like a bad idea on multiple levels. However, a thought quickly came to mind that not taking it may be worse. I had never not accepted what Marcus gave me as a tip even though most of it was basically what I figured I would find in a raven’s nest. 

Slowly inching my way forward, I reached out and rather panically noticed that even though the jar was glowing the light did not reflect off any surface. That couldn’t be a good sign. This had to be some sort of dark magic. 

The jar, as I had called it, was cold and heavy. Inside though, the light seemed to react to my touch and pressed itself against the edge of the glass nearest my hands. Gently lifting it away from Marcus, I lifted it up and looked at it. 

“Quick question,” I asked, rather uncomfortable with this line of thought, “Is the man dead?”

“No,” Marcus answered blankly, “Many living men are living happily without their souls.”

“Is he?” I asked.

“That will be up to you,” Marcus explained, tilting his head and looking at the soul, “Like any plant or pet you can choose their direction. You can validate their choices or violate them in ways they couldn’t imagine. In any case, he changed your path so it is only just that you get a chance to change his.”

“What?” I asked, terrified now.

“He changed your path,” Marcus explained slowly, “You can change his now.”

“No, I got that part,” I said quickly, “What if, not meaning to sound ungrateful, I just let him live his life?”

“That is your choice,” Marcus said, “Not a choice I would make but humans like you are far more anxious around fate than I am.”

“Can I just make him turn himself in or something then?” I asked, “It’s not like he got anything of value from me and my cards are already cancelled.”

“That is your choice,” Marcus said, staring at me blankly with my own eyes.

“Okay, umm, how do I?” I asked, “you know… direct him?”

“Simply open the jar, touch his soul and tell him,” Marcus explained.

And that was exactly what I was afraid of. I really didn’t want to touch this guy's soul but at the same time I really wanted Marcus to leave and Marcus wasn’t one to be directed. He would leave when he was done. 

The lid wasn’t tight and I lifted it off the light inside only swayed a little bit out of the way. Clasping it gently, I was filled with a cold sensation and a deep hunger that consumed me. I couldn’t speak. Somewhere in my back, my muscles knotted up and my spine hurt like I slept on the floor all night.

I realized I wasn’t tired. I had a moment where I realized all the sudden anger at the world wasn’t my own. Loss and abandonment that came to me but felt like old friends were the property of this soul. He didn’t understand how he had come to be but he was hungry. 

“There’s food out back of 5th and 17th,” I heard myself whisper knowing that I was going to throw out all my leftovers. 

“Humans and your empathy,” Marcus muttered before turning around and leaving without another word.
