“I’m out!” an overweight, heavily robed man yelled between gasps. His book fell to the ground as he tried to catch his breath at one end of the spell circle. A groan, a gasp, and a small fart left him as he tried to pick it up. A swear left him shortly after.

“I am too,” an extremely thin man on the other side of the circle yelled as he held his knee with one hand and his shoulder with the other. His book had been on the ground for a couple of minutes. He had been using mostly memorized shielding spells since then. He wasn’t nimble and knew it. If he went for the book he probably would have only ended up on the ground.

The two of them were standing in the middle of Grand Magnus El’thor’s Cathedral. 13th-century architecture that would have taken a century to build without the extensive use of magic. Gothic, dark wood arches and figures lined the walls. The floor was a mosaic of dark glass and over a hundred crystal accents. The typical ashen smell was now overpowered by burnt dust and a sickly sweet aroma that no one really wanted to place.

They weren’t alone. A crowd of about two dozen were standing around the circle, watching, writing, and commenting on the duel. This was a spectacle worth remembering and a day that would be talked about in these halls for at least a decade. The day that the masters finally agreed to a duel.

On one side sort of stood Master Felis Blackwood. A large man by anyone’s standards, he had always told his servants when and what he wanted to eat. He studied for a long time for a diet suitable for an athlete. Always intended to be an athlete but never seemed to get out of the planning phase of that one. He did stretch a lot and his hands were more precise than a surgeon’s.

On the other side stood Master Abdul-Aleem Bashir. He took a different approach to life than Master Blackwood had. Moderation, meditation, and prayer on top of study were the way in his mind. While not strong, or dexterous really, he was very flexible and his hands matched those of Master Blackwood.

“Well,” a stern woman at the top of the circle asked, “do either of you forfeit?”

“NO!” they both yelled back.

“Finish this any way you see fit then,” she almost scoffed at them, “get the other out of the circle and we’ll declare this over.”

“I’m going to win Bashir!” Master Blackwood yelled and started to run. Well, walk quickly. Not really in a straight path but it was straight enough. Master Bashir fast walked away from him, limping slightly. “Slow down Bashir!”

“Why?” Master Bashir asked, “so you can hit me?”

“Of course it’s so I can hit-” Master Blackwood started but ended up stopping and gagging a bit. He was completely out of breath.

Master Bashir, took his advantage and came up beside Master Blackwood and planted a solid haymaker across his side. Then with the momentum gave Blackwood an uppercut to the chin.

“What was that?” Master Blackwood asked. He hadn’t moved or reacted to either hit.

“A mighty blow!” Master Bashir yelled, it mostly turned into a cough afterward, “you overgrown paperweight!”

“I have hit myself with the door harder than that!” Master Blackwood yelled back, gagging once and spitting on the floor.

“A true opponent for you would be a door!” Master Bashir yelled. Master Blackwood gave him a small push and the thinner man went down. “That’s cheating! I can’t match your biscuit and lard strength any more than you can match my mind!”

“Mind?” Master Blackwood yelled, “Who was on the floor Tomeless less than ten minutes ago begging for me to stop arching lighting at your boney behind! The reason you aren’t out right now is that those twigs you call legs can actually move!”

“I dropped it on purpose!” Master Bashir yelled.

“Because you’re less than a door to me!” Master Blackwood yelled back and threw up his lunch on the ground with the effort.

“Okay,” the stern woman at the top of the circle announced, “this is getting sad. We'll call it a draw-”

“No we won’t!” both yelled at her.

“This featherless goose,” Master Bashir pointed at Master Blackwood and started to yell but stopped and sat down in a dizziness spell. Not a magic spell mind you. Eventually, he did continue and said in a more even tone, “will not win. I just need a minute.”

“Pathetic way of saying a decade more practice, Bashir!” Master Blackwood retorted, “I only need my lunch back and maybe some of the herbalist’s concoctions. Maybe some tea.”

“You need to prove you can best a door, Blackwood,” Master Bashir said, mostly through groaning, “A tea would be good though.”

“Okay, tea,” Master Blackwood started, “some lunch, one of Tilla’s concoctions, and then I’ll show you what’s what.”

“Deal,” Master Bashir groaned, “Tilla!”

“Tilla?” Master Blackwood asked when they got no answer but looking around it seemed like everyone had wandered off.
