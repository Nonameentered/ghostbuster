Growing up small, there was always a bonfire at the end of autumn where family, friends, foes, and other folk came together. The smell of basil and garlic filled the last warm air of the year. On that day we didn’t worry. Children dressed up as adults, parents treated them as though they were, and we celebrated with those that achieved their dreams. My wife always wanted to be a pilot. I dressed up as a doctor but somewhere in my soul, I knew what I wanted to be was a father.

When it came time to celebrate our own though, we seemed unworthy.

Years of genetic testing, experimentation, lab specialists, and uncomfortable appointments left me with nothing but debt and disappointment. We were told incubation or cloning were left but neither was covered. We weren’t even able to choose. All that was left was to be told that sometimes life makes decisions for us. 

We didn’t accept that. We couldn’t afford their path forward so we found our own. It was a different type of sacrifice. What we chose to do, many of our family would never speak to us again. However, we knew the path we had to follow.

I think it was her eyes, those large amber eyes that drew my heart to her as those fires did for so many years. There was this feeling, it started at the back of my neck, danced down my spine and warmed even my soul. I knew that she was my daughter at that moment. This wasn’t the life that I was planning but like that exhausted lab coat had told us, life makes decisions.

Home became the path we were following that day and we left a world of quiet comfort and security behind. There were other worlds. All of them were terraformed generations ago by those who deemed themselves worthy to say they understood the universe. In the shadow of such ego, the creatures of the night waited and watched as their servants pushed millennia forward.  

We could find other friends and other families once we got our feet underneath us. Kate became a mechanic and dreamed of the day she could fly the ships she maintained. I worked what I could. Taking care of little Elleria was my passion though. Her silvery furry face pierced my defences any moment that I wasn’t careful and her appetite for curious deconstruction was unstoppable. 

Many times, in our one-room cabin, I had to figure out how to punish, praise, and push a girl that knew more of the verse than I ever seemed to. I tried my best to make it work though. How many parents I had heard say that they were trying their best floated through my mind as I watched her grow. What I wouldn’t give for teenage angst or melancholy loneliness that I felt in my youth be given to her. 

Was she alone? We loved her, we cared for her, and she did have friends but they didn’t look like her. No doctor could ever give us a clear answer as to what was healthy for her or when she was sick what could relieve her pain. Government officials came calling as to where we had discovered her but all went away wanting. I just wished she wouldn’t be left feeling the same.

Two decades after we left our family farms and the cool winter air, we arrived back to a world that had forgotten us with our girl and our dreams intact. Home was in front of us. The creature that we had found and begged for weeks with was nowhere to be found though. The woods had been cut down. The farms had been expanded.

“Marshel?” a once familiar voice asked as we stared out into the cornfields of my youth. Turning, I saw the balding brown-haired head that I knew was Kate’s brother Dan. Smiling, hopeful at his tone, I nodded and stepped aside to let him see my family. In a softer tone, he almost shuddered, “Kate?”

“Been a long time,” Kate said hushedly as she pushed Elleria behind her.

“Yeah, we thought you two were dead,” Dan said hoarsely as he rushed his sister. The big man hugged Kate tightly for a couple of seconds before pushing away and giving his sister a good hard look. “What happened? That night there was a fire. We looked for days.”

“We left,” I explained, trying to stay calm, “Just needed to be somewhere else. What happened?”

“By the father, M’lord Marshel, you haven’t changed have you?” Dan chuckled but then caught a glance at Elleria and in a quick turn asked, “And who is this?”

“I’m Elle,” Elleria declared, pushing Kate aside and putting out her furred and to shake. Dwarfed next to Dan’s six foot three, two hundred plus pound frame, Elleria stood proud regardless. She was barely three feet tall and weighed no more than eighty pounds. “Mom and Dad call me Elleria though but that’s just because they picked it. I like Elle more.”

“Hello,” Dan said with a confused smile. He tilted his head up at Kate and asked, “So you adopted?”

“Yes they did,” Elleria answered for us, “And we are very happy.”

“Ah,” Dan said with a nod, shook Elleria’s hand, and then looked at the fur on his when she let go, “We’ll I guess that makes me your uncle Dan then. How old are you?”

“Twenty-seven,” Elleria stated making Dan’s already furrowed eyes scrunch up even more.

“She’s, umm,” I quickly tried to explain but couldn’t really quite make out the words.

“Different,” Dan said with a nod, “Well, you know, the natives are what they are.”

“Right,” I agreed, that was a rather insulting way of being inclusive but at least he didn’t question it much. 

“How’s Ma and Pa doing,” Kate asked.

“Good,” Dan explained, “Retired now so they just boss us around without helping. Look not to be, well not to be one of those people but you may want to go slow with everyone. When you left. I don’t want to be unkind but some people, not me mind you, said you summoned a demon and that’s what burned the woods down.”

“Who?” I asked carefully, remembering only Elleria’s eyes that night.

“Uncle Dale, Pastor Dave, and the other Pastor Dave,” Dan explained quickly, “They were the ones spreading rumours. Some might not take kindly to your girl.”

“At first,” Elleria stated, happy and confident.

“Got your attitude, sis,” Dan chuckled quietly to Kate and then looked down at the furry little girl, “You’ll need that here.”

“When do we get to see the bonfires?” Elleria turned and asked me.

“I don’t know sweetie,” I said honestly, our main goal was to talk to the creature we had summoned once upon a time.

“Harvest just started so it’ll be a month or two before we have autumnblot,” Dan explained.

“I wanted to see the fires though,” Elleria complained and gave Dan an overexerted pout.

“I’m sure we can set something on fire for you,” Dan laughed and took a quick look around, “Woods was cut down but we still bring in wood from New London.”

“Yay, thank you Uncle Dan!” Elleria beamed, grabbed his hand and started to pull him toward town. 

Kate and I just watched for a couple of seconds as Dan made some comment about her being stronger than he expected. Was this going to work? A glance between us said that we both had our suspicions but this was once home. Maybe it was supposed to be home again?

“Did we burn down the forest?” I asked in a hushed whisper when Dan was out of earshot.

“I don’t know,” Kate whispered back, “That night was such a blur. I can only really remember-“

“Her eyes,” we both said in unison.

Looking back to Dan, Kate and I made sure that we caught up quickly as we followed the path back home.
