If you have ever fallen down a flight of stairs and landed on your feet you know what a certain level of chaos feels like. To come out unscratched or not even sore is a startling experience. You may feel a bit dizzy but the overwhelming experience is just pure and utter shock. You eat a little more that day, sleep a bit more that night, and eventually, you put it down as something that may have happened.

If someone's watching you as it happens though the feeling is even worse. Fall down a flight of stairs onto your feet while someone is at the bottom watching you, bracing for you to hit them, and then just be left with nothing is mind-numbing. For both of you. It’s like being told you were about to be fired but then the boss looks up and sees the wrong person, apologizes, and moves on.

A similar thing happened to Robert today during one of the company's monthly staff meetings. He got up after Debra sat down. She had just given her presentation on the current state of the new office chair design. It was going well. Robert though was there for the marketing campaign for the back-to-school events. It was important. Actually, it was the most important thing Robert had done for the company since joining some six years ago. The only problem was the gentleman, dressed in a black robe and carrying a clipboard who entered just before Robert was to speak. That man was there to give Robert an aneurysm. Everything became very light and very dark for Robert moments later.

The hospital bed Robert woke up on some time later was cold, a sheet was over his face, and a large pile of wires were hanging off of him. The man Robert saw out of the corner of his eye in the meeting was standing at the foot of his bed, now frowning with a bit of a wide-eyed expression. He tapped his clipboard a couple of times with his pen as he looked over something.

“Excuse me?” Robert asked, discovering his voice was extremely horse, “Where am I?”

“Oh, bless me,” the man muttered and tucked his pen away before introducing himself, “I am reaper assistant number 4134. My sincere apologies for your untimely demise as you are not Roger. I have re-entered your termination at 7.88e+26 cerebral calculations from now but had to reset some of your information. You are in St. Margaret’s hospital. Do you have any other questions?”

“How long is that?” Robert muttered quietly, “exactly?”

“I don’t understand the question,” the gentleman answered, “anything else?”

“Roger?” Robert asked.

“Yes, your brother,” the man responded with a smile, “I had to hit him with a bus but he thankfully passed away at the moment he was meant to. Adequate handling on my part considering the situation.”

“He’s dead?” Robert choked out. He hadn’t seen his twin in quite some time but they were planning on going on a cruise together this summer. The family had fallen apart some time ago. After their graduation, their parents' resentment for having twins had become quite obvious and they both agreed they needed time alone.

“Correct,” the man said, “Quick but I do feel bad about the state I put his body in. The funeral thing you humans do will not be easy. He was dragged some ways.”

“Was I dead?” Robert gasped.

“I feel bad for that too,” the man frowned, “I’m saying that correctly, yes? We don’t feel feelings but it’s in the manual to say to you people. Third assignment and all. Anything else?”

Robert sat there in shock for a bit and mistaking the silence as acknowledgment the man turned with a smile and walked out into the ether. At least, Robert assumed it was something like that. It wasn’t through any real door but more like a veil leading into nowhere. He could still sort of see it and watched for a couple of minutes but Robert was now alone.

Eventually, he pushed the help button that was strapped to him. A nurse popped in quickly after a couple of seconds went by. She looked a little shocked and a little perturbed at him but couldn’t seem to get any words out. She called out for what Robert assumed was another nurse. One popped in behind her shortly afterward.

“I’m sorry Mr.” the nurse in the doorway started but let the word hang there.

“Robert Williamson,” he choked out. His throat was not liking this.

“Williamson?” the two looked at each other and whispered, “you were in for the… thing?”

“With Dr. Mills?” the other spoke up.

“I don’t think so,” Robert responded the best he could, “Why does my throat feel like this?”

“Sir, you were intubated,” the nurse explained, she looked shocked at the equipment around him, “were you crashing just a bit ago? I feel like I remember something.”

“Maybe?” Robert whispered.

“We’ll get you some medicine and pull your file,” the nurse said quickly and rushed out the door with the other in tow. They came back a couple of minutes later and did a full set of tests on him. He was shocked when he got back that he was in good health considering he was a type 2 diabetic this morning. Standing up he also felt like the knee Roger had kicked out when they were teens wasn’t as sore.

Looking out of his room though was a bit more than a panic. Outside there were so many of those robbed people looking in on things, playing with the monitors, and a group looked like they were evaluating someone. Little slips of a half-seen veil could be seen everywhere. 

“My apologies,” the man from earlier said from beside Robert, “I have to repair the filter in your visual cortex.”

“What?” Robert asked but in an instant, the man put a finger to his forehead and everything was mostly back to normal. At least when he stared at something square on it was normal. The filter had diminishing effects, it seemed, as it went out into his peripheral. A last brief glimpse of the man that killed him was all Robert was left with.

Robert stood there, frozen in the doorway, for quite some time.
