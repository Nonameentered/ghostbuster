“Good morning new hires!” an overtly chipper, well-toned and half-naked horned man announced to the board room of fairly confused-looking teenagers around me. 

I had no idea where I was. One minute I was riding passenger to an I-871 speeder and now I was here. The room was a Techno-Cutting brand and full featured. Holo-projectors, hypo-allergenic air, and my chair had massaging lumbar support. This would have been a dream if it wasn’t for the nightmare man in front of me.

With a devilish grin, he continued, “Please be aware, some of you may be feeling the after-effects of your travel. That will pass. What won’t pass is the endless shock of not being prepared. With that in mind, this will be your only onboarding session so please pay attention.”

“Are we dead?” someone asked in stunned disbelief.

“Technically,” the man answered.

“Is this hell?” another asked in a panic.

“Gosh no,” the man explained with a grin and clapped his hands together, “This is the Milky Bar branch of Recklemations Unlimited LLC. We process what’s left with a smile.”

“Milky Way?” I cautiously asked, “Or are we a Bar somewhere else?”

“AH-ha! R and D material that one,” the man exclaimed pointing at me before turning the projector on and muttering, “Good thing too, we are running out of new meat.”

“That’s not,” I whispered to myself and waited for an answer that never came. A chatter stared up behind me.

“Okay, new blood,” the man… ish thing piped up when the projector whirled to life, “You all will be the newest members of the Care and Curing Department. Most of you will be in charge of one or two members, and some of the lucky ones will be grouped with some of our senior staff. First off though, and probably what’s on all your little minds is why?”

The room was silent, whether it be stunned, scared, or stoic I had no idea. The Care and Curing Department didn’t sound all that bad in my head but the way he said it was unnerving. What were we supposed to do? Where were we going? Who are the members? Are we members?

“Chatty group,” the horned, body-builder noted to himself before clapping his hands together again and starting his lecture, “Why is important to us at Recklemations Unlimited and the Care and Curing Department is our pride and joy. Which means a big congratulations to all of you. Each of you has demonstrated in your time on the lower plane the ability to compromise, compose, and complete tasks far beneath your skill set. This makes you all uniquely qualified for an afterlife of satisfying, structured servitude.”

“We are in hell because we all worked retail?” a girl in the back screamed across the table.

“Again, not hell,” the horned, muscular, red Ken doll reassured, “and you aren’t a member of our organization. You are staff, with a benefits package and a wage.”

“Minimum probably,” I muttered at a memory, “but take heart, if you could give us less you, we would.”

“Nope,” a deep amusement couldn’t mask the simplicity of his statement. A quick glance around and I saw the room in disbelief. Thriftshop Thunderbolt didn’t seem to be interested in elaborating though. It continued, “As you all know, Teleportation, as your kind calls it, revolutionised space travel like the airplane did for a bygone era. What is a planet-to-planet visit when it can take only moments instead of years? Nothing? What was the price? More importantly, why didn’t any of you take up the opportunity?”

“I didn’t have anyone off-world I wanted to see,” I stated, “and flying was the only time I got to be with my Dad.”

“Precious,” Discount Diablo sweetly said with a smile before turning to the board and explaining, “Perfect for our organisation and a promising future for you. Unbeknownst to all but a few, Teleportation was actually more carbon copy than true transfer. Soul after soul now requires tending and we are having difficulty keeping up with demand.”

“Are we demons?” a quiet, middle-aged woman beside me asked quietly.

“Mythologies aside,” the Simple Satan brushed off. Or was it just Sam? I’m going to call him Sam. Pointing back at the hologram, Sam continued, “We will be working toward the antithesis of everything you once served.”

“Meaning?” I asked.

“The customers are always wrong,” Sam spoke simply, “And most of the miserable people that you had to serve teleported way too often. We have stadiums filled with certain of the well-to-but-never-dids.”

“So Karen Curing,” the woman beside me stated, a cheerful gleam now on her sharp face.

“No,” Sam stressed, “It’s the Care and Curing Department. HR may mean something different but they act the same here.”
