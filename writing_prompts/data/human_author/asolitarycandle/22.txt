The road was long, the weather had been getting much colder, and Vos spent many of his nights with his tail tucked to his chest as he lay close to the last burning embers of the campfire. He never trusted horses. They wouldn’t probably hurt him but there was something about Kobolds and horses that never seemed to get along. 

At the end of it though, deep in the mountains and through seemingly always dripping forest, they found the arch the necromancer had talked about. It was stone, solid and hard but carved and polished to the state of fabric. It flowed like silk down from its peak to nestle on the ground as though a cushion of air would blow it away. Vos touched it, expecting it to cushion his claws but found a barrier that would crush his bones on a whim. 

The men chatted about who would make such an arch. Vos had the same thought but where he heard whispers of anxiety, Vos only felt curiously mystified by the stone in front of him. It wasn’t cold. Vos felt the boulders around him to make sure the chill of winter was indeed within them but when he returned to the flowing stone he left as though it had been placed there on a midmorning in summer.

Deciding that they had travelled over a fortnight to find this place, the company moved on. Vos let himself get excited as he heard no noise come from ahead. His ears, he had learned to his credit, were a bit sharper than the beings he travelled with. Save elves. Elves could hear a pin drop across the ocean. Probably could see it too from what Vos had experienced.

The cave they found wasn’t deep but had in it a very similar jagged crystal to the one the necromancer had. A long-haired, sharp-smelling man that Vos tried to stay away from poked and prodded the pillar of glass that the crystal sat upon until the world around them twitched. 

Wavy, grey stone became impossibly square and the pine scent of the forest disappeared in an instant. The crystal on the glass pillar remained. The men drew their swords as a world of noise crashed into Vos’ ears and filled his mind with chaos. Opening the door that had replaced the entrance to the cave the company found themselves in downtown traffic. 

Worse than a siren's call at sea, the horns of these moving carriages crashed into Vos and laid him flat on the ground. The men charged. Something that Vos learned later was called a bus and was actually quite useful, had won that battle in a near instant. If Vos hadn't seen it, he wouldn’t have believed it. He did the only thing he was capable of at that moment, Vos ran and he ran hard.

Staying away from the horseless death things, Vos stayed in the shadows and out of the light from the upside-down magic candles. He wasn’t sure if they would see him or not but best not to mess with that sort of magic. A left down around a large chest of some sort, then passed a set of floating steps, Vos hid under a pile of impossibly thin linen and hid.

“What?” a gurgling growl came from beside him and Vos let out a meep by accident. 

The sudden movement was bad and the glare from those glassy eyes was worse but by far the thing Vos couldn’t handle was the smell. Letting go of the stale bread that he had eaten for breakfast, Vos got back up and away in a flash.

Door after door he tried. Metal, wooden, more than a couple that looked wooden but felt metal, and Vos was losing hope. It wasn't until an odd-looking warrior opened one that Vos was able to dash through and then shut behind him that he wished that he had never gone on this horrible adventure. There were necromancers here. Warriors had more metal embedded in their skin than on their body. Where would he find security now that he had to deal with these demons?

The clanking on the door stopped but Vos still held it as tightly shut as he could while he panted harder than he had had in years. Danger like this was common but he had always had others with him. What would he do? Where was that portal? How would he get home?

“Look kid,” a voice came from behind Vos and he turned, bringing his pack to put something between them and let out a desperate whimper. It was supposed to be a yell but it came out worse than a shaking warble. The warrior with metal embedded in him stood still, pondering the creature in front of him as many had done when Vos had first met them and tried to continue, “Look, I don’t care what trouble you're in but you can’t stay here. I play D&D too and that’s a kick-ass costume but we closed an hour ago.”

“Please,” Vos whimpered, “It killed them.”

“And, I’m spending the night talking to the cops,” the man muttered to himself as he sighed and closed his eyes. Rubbing his temple the man turned around and flicked on some sort of small leaver thing that Vos could only half see in his panic. 

That night had turned into one of the best nights that Vos had had in his life. Patrick, the man with all the metal embedded in his face, discovered an hour after Vos had entered that the scales that he had mistaken for a costume were in fact real. Geeking out over a real Kobold, Patrick had fed the little lizard a variety of leftover cakes and treats that Vos was only ever able to smell from a distance before. Vos worried that he had worried he had landed up in Hell only to discover that this was better than the Astral Plane itself.

A year later, a renamed and reimagined coffee shop was presented to the world with a happy little green lizard as its mascot. Vos was a significantly angrier-looking version of the one that sold car insurance so he was not worried about being mistaken. People, well they were mostly nerds, lined up outside to see Vos working away at his station and to try the Dragon’s special. 

Patrick was the owner of both the old coffee shop and the new one and Vos was paid well for his service. He had to be told, multiple times, that the linen that he was given was as good as gold was. Gold would have been better in Vos’ mind but after finding out how much gold was here the linen made sense. 

His company was a tragic loss and a horrendous insurance claim for the bus company but Vos didn’t think about them much after a couple of months had gone by. In a way, he was glad to be rid of them. Patrick was far nicer than Boss had ever been. His coworkers talked freely with him and the crowd that gave their little linen strips were happy to see him. 

Vos never found the crystal upon the pillar of glass again. The door that he had left seemed to be just a painting on a wall after he had gotten back to it. Not that that was the weirdest magic that Vos had found in this new place. Lights, music, and more than a kingdom of people were now around him and his pocket was a little metal key that protected his gigantic home. Vos could never stop smiling.
