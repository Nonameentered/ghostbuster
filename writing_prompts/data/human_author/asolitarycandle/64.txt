<Trigger Warnings: Death, Blood, and Suicide>

“No,” Alan let the word form as he took a sudden breath in. A couple of shuddering breaths later as he stood frozen in place he pleaded quietly to the creature in front of him, “No, please… no.”

She had tried to end it before he got there. Well, before he saw her like this. These creatures could bleed like nothing natural could and their basement floor was a testament to that fact now. Silver was supposed to be lethal but in reality, it was just sheer trauma that killed them. Damage their brain, their spine or their heart enough and they will lie down. Eventually. Eventually, that predatory focus dissolves.

Lynn was lying down but even as blood poured out of her neck and legs, Alan could feel that soul grasping focus catch him. She was a hunter. Alan knew that now she was a reckless weapon only capable of destroying what she touched without thought or purpose. All her training went from being a necessary evil to an exploitable force for good.

“No,” Alan whispered again as he shook. 

Trying to get his shotgun cocked again, he stumbled and dropped it. A loud metallic pang bounced off the iron walls as it bounced into one of the support pillars holding up the cabin above them. Alan didn’t mean to but he spit out a swear as he fumbled. The creature only watched. 

Lynn had always been quiet. They had met almost two decades ago at a hunter’s gathering in some flat Canadian plain that everyone had trouble pronouncing. Alan had been in his early twenties and had actually considered leaving the bar when he learned that Lynn was three years older than him. That arrogance had haunted him for a long time.

The two got married, in secret, after three years of what no one would call dating. Most of the time the two didn’t see each other and when they did they mostly fought. Alan had his missions and Lynn had her purpose. It didn’t matter how loud Alan got, he always felt her words cut deeper regardless of their strength. He learned to value the truth of her words though. 

He missed hearing her voice now. There was something in the last fifteen years that came suddenly crashing into him that he couldn’t handle. All those promises that he’d listen, that he’d learn now rang hollow. The progress that he had worked for and all the pain that they had gone through was now never going to be celebrated. 

“No,” Alan whimpered, tears now falling from him freely as he sat down on the far end of the basement.

They had found a pack of them a couple of months ago moving through the Rockies. Somewhere north there had to be a huge pack of them but out in the cold and dark of winter, no one had ever proved it. Alan had a plan though. If Lynn and he could follow this group maybe they would get wind of what they were up to. It wasn’t like these beasts were smart. 

Montana had come and gone with only a dozen deaths on either side. The pack was about fifty strong so an assault was out of the question without more hunters around. Lynn had been about to pick off one or two every other day when they rested or hunted alone. Alan had trapped a couple but he had always been more skilled up close than at a distance. 

Once they passed into Canada, both hunters sort of lost track of where they were. Straddling the border of Alberta and BC, they avoided the small mountain towns and villages when they could. Other hunters came and went. They protected their radius but didn’t travel with them. Not with that size of the pack and so few tagging along. 

“Why,” Alan whimpered quietly at the thought of how many could have helped them. 

Standing up, he tried his best to steady himself. He knew a single shot wouldn’t kill her and that he would have to unload most of what he had left. Even bleeding as bad as she was, Alan had seen them survive worse and in more dangerous places. Somewhere in the room was a knife but that didn’t matter. There was a risk she hadn’t done enough.

The beast’s focus had never left him but returning it now crippled Alan’s resolve. This was the person that he loved, that he hated, that he valued, and that he tried his best to be of value to. It had been. Alan tried his best to remember that the person he would have spent the rest of his life with was gone. 

“No,” Alan whimpered, lowering the shotgun and looking away from the beast in desperation. What could he do? Instinct took over and he raised the double-barrel back up as he whispered, “Your job.”

A long thirty seconds ticked by but Alan only stood there, desperate to do what he was trained to do. She was watching him though. He had hoped somewhere that she could just cut him with her words so that this would be easier. Lynn would have done it. Alan knew she would have had the strength to put him down.

He wasn’t sure how he had gotten on the floor again but he was so blinded by tears that nothing really made sense. The shotgun, now on his lap, felt like an anchor holding him down. How could he do this? How could he have let this happen? Alan searched his mind for something, anything to bring this to an end.

That day was really no help. They had woken up early to check their traps and scout but the pack had already been moving. Not that following four dozen werewolves was a difficult task when you had their path but they needed to know how close they were. If the pack had picked up their scent, they would come back for them. 

That must have been what happened. Alan tried his best not to let the idea that Lynn had been alone when some monster attacked her. This morning, he would have joked that he would have felt sorry for any beast that had gotten into that situation but apparently he was wrong. Maybe there was more than one.

When the pack had turned west for a while they contacted a friend and respected hunter to give her a heads up. Olivia lived out here as a ranger but had a basement like a hunter. Alan had jokingly said that it was like a butcher's paradise but Lynn had shut him up quickly with a glare. Even the beast in front of him couldn’t glare as she could.

“No,” Alan whispered as he looked down at the gun in his hands. He couldn’t do this. He knew he could do what he needed to. Olivia could. Alan made up his mind that Olivia would be able to finish this. A resolve flooded through Alan at the thought and he looked up at the beast and whispered, “I’m sorry.”

The gun, now light as a feather, seemed to move in his hands as he angled it so he could look down the barrel himself. He didn’t want to see Lynn’s eyes in that monster anymore. Alan knew how quick his role in this could all be over and that brought him some sense of comfort from the sheer amount of pain he was feeling. 

A furred, clawed hand grasping the barrel decided otherwise. The bleeding and broken body that Lynn had now had crawled over to Alan in whatever time Alan had lost. He stared at it. She must have been down there at least an hour for how dried some of the red flakes were. Alan wasn’t sure if that made this better or worse. He felt all that pain he had lost though return when the furred hand pulled the barrel down to herself and moved her head into its path.

“I,” Alan pleaded in a whimper, “I can’t.”

The beast only nodded at him. 

He knew somewhere in the creature, Lynn knew what needed to be done but it wasn’t in him. Alan pushed the shotgun away from both of them and did the only thing he could think of. If their vow was to the death then they would die together. Not by his hand though. 

Laying down, Alan carefully lifted Lynn’s arm up and put it over his side careful of her new claws but not caring about the blood. Lynn gave out a pitiful, gurgling little noise that Alan couldn’t understand. They stayed like that until Alan got up the courage to bring her head down and rest it against his chest. 

There the two lay. Hunter waiting to be devoured by the one he loved and the beast waiting to bleed out or be put down. Alan believed even if nothing happened that Olivia would see them like this and end them both without a thought. A hunter hunted and Alan accepted that he was a hunter, no longer. Neither of them were anymore. Their purpose was done and maybe they could actually rest.

“I’m so sorry,” Alan whimpered into the fur in front of him.

The beast only whimpered back.
