“Hail Satan!” one of the newcomers chanted loudly, standing firm with his fist raised.
  

  
“Pay up boys!” Daniels heartedly laughed as he slapped his knee, took off his hat and handed it to an exasperated vampire and his crew before I was even able to react. 
  

  
“No!” I scoffed and then let out a bit of a growl before turning to the newcomer and saying, “We… that’s not really something we do. I mean if you want to that’s fine but most of us have our own beliefs. Those… that part of sharing comes later.”
  

  
“But we are vampires,” he argued.
  

  
“Not all of us believe in Satan,” I explained quickly before turning my attention to Daniels, “And Daniel, I told you to stop betting on the new members.”
  

  
“It ain’t like it hurts ‘em,” Daniels called back as his hat filled with money, “And Markus ‘ere has lost, what? More than I can count.”
  

  
“It’s not that bad. It’s not like Syd can count very high,” Markus coldly explained, making a show of biting his tongue as he momentarily closed his mouth to think, “Thirty-five of fifty-seven.”
  

  
“Not the point you two,” I explained loudly, “This is a safe space.”
  

  
“Ain’t nothing safe about a room of strung out, bitter old vampires,” Sydney argued, “Now sit down before this touchy-feely bull becomes more trouble than it’s worth.”
  

  
“You want to go Syd,” I said, giving up and putting my hands up in the air as I sat down, “Go, I’m just trying to set the stage.”
  

  
“Set the stage?” Syd mocked before starting his shtick, “Hi I’m Sydney Couper, I’m not an actor, this is a shitty stage and I haven’t had blood in a week.”
  

  
The room went quiet.
  

  
“Shit Syd, you okay?” I asked. A quiet, miserable nod was all he gave me but I had to ask, “What happened?”
  

  
“Hiker,” he said started simply, “Alone and starving some three hundred miles north. I just didn’t want to be here. He shot me! Didn’t even think. Didn’t realise what happened till a couple of days later when the pain started hitting me. Again.”
  

  
At least it wasn’t close to town. North of here there was nothing but mountains, ice, and snow so if someone was out that far they would have just been assumed dead by the elements. Maybe someone would go looking but they wouldn’t find anything even if Syd hadn’t done what he did.
  

  
“The path takes a while to become-”
  

  
“I know that Pete!” Sydney yelled before letting out a long drawn-out sigh, “I’m sorry, I know that.”
  

  
“Okay, good,” I said with a nod, “You need anything?”
  

  
“Got my drops from your boy a couple of days ago,” he explained, “I’m good.”
  

  
“Okay,” I said with a huff, “Umm, if the new members need it, we provide microdoses to help with withdrawal symptoms. It doesn’t make it comfortable but it makes it more bearable.”
  

  
“Take it with Bab’s shine,” Sydney added, “Makes it actually bearable.”
  

  
“Traitor,” Daniels scoffed, “You’re ‘possed to be drinking my shit.”
  

  
“Drink Daniels’ shine,” Sydney laughed, “Only if you don’t need to do anything that week.”
  

  
“Good ole, One-Nintey Niners,” Daniels cheered, taking out his flask and raising it high.
  

  
“Actually, give me some,” Sydney said as he reached out. Daniels wasn’t greedy and let Sydney take a large swallow after which Sydney gave out a growl. 
  

  
“Pass it to New Satin next,” Daniels chuckled, referring to the newcomer before he took a hard look at Marcus, tapped his nose, and eagerly waited for Marcus. The old man only nodded with a sly grin.
  

  
“No don’t do that,” I scoffed into my hands.
  

  
New Satin, as Daniels had called him, didn’t even hesitate to take the same amount Sydney had. Huge mistake, he spit most of it out. One thing Daniels could make was a spirit to burn the soul out of you. Those in the know let out a chorus of laughter.
  

  
“What is that?” New Satin had a hard time asking.
  

  
“Ginger Shine!” Daniels howled in laughter as Markus put more money into Daniels’ cowboy hat, “One Ninety-Nine proof and the closest to hell th’t I can make it New Satin.”
  

  
“You know what,” I muttered as I pinched the bridge of my nose in exhaustion, “Daniels, if Sydney’s done, why don’t you go next?”
  

  
“I’m done,” Sydney spat out as he stretched out on his chair, “I just needed to say I used.”
  

  
“No weakness, no fault. Go ‘orward but understand yer back,” Daniels said before I could. Not that way of course but he got the message. Jumping up, Daniels announced, “I’m Daniels MacMeery and I ‘aven’t used in a couple of years or some shit but you can buy a bottle of Ole One-Ninety Niners from me for 45 bucks.”
  

  
“Is that with tax?” New Satin asked.
  

  
“It’s sixty then,” Daniels spat, “No tax out here but ‘at question will cost you.”
  

  
“Daniels, there’s tax out here,” I argued.
  

  
“Well, I ain’t ever paid it,” Daniels said with a laugh as he sat down. 
  

  
“Who wants to go next?” I asked, rubbing my eyes again. This was going about as well as it usually did.
