Sure? Writing your own scene in your world with your characters I wouldnâ€™t considered stealing. A witch owned tea shop offering divination services on the side is a pretty common thing even in real life. However, most of the ones I have been in do card readings not supernatural therapy sessions. At least, not to my knowledge. ;)
