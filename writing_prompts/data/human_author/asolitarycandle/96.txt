I bought Longswords Rest back in my forties from this 4th born lord’s son who wanted to turn it into the spot to be. Cheap land though, the town was suffering at the time and having this obnoxious full timber bar selling venison and elk for top dollar didn’t go along well with the locals. Wood was pristine. I bought it out for asking price with my stock pile, a lot more than it was worth but it’s best not to piss off the court, and started selling rations and stew with the locals stock.

The first year was harder than expected. A couple from the city tried to burn the place down after they saw I was ‘stealing’ the lordlings enterprise. Their words. They got a good flogging for that in the square. Second attempt got to understand how sharp Vipers tip actually was. I hated myself for that for months afterwards. Never wanted to use Ben’s sword but it was all I had. 

Good man, Ben was. Died at the Battle of Meadows Gate, some ten years before that. I think it’s getting onto sixteen now. He was buried there but he told us not to bury him with Viper. All agreed afterwards that I would take it with me. He had this belief that in the afterlife there was no use for swords and that a man's honour is what he used for his weapon, armour, and shield. I hope he’s doing well wherever he went to. Probably be happy that I used Viper for protection.

Bastard always makes it rain on me when I think of it.

Years pass though, a couple at least went by where the town came for dinner in my house. I hired a baker for the morning and a cook for the evening. Still served stew and rations but they added potatoes and bread to the mix. Never had much of a talent for spices myself so I trust them to do what they do. My gift was my stout. A deep brown and thick beer that was tended slowly and could sustain you indefinitely. Made a pale ale too but that wasn’t worth commenting on. 

“Allistor!” I heard from somewhere, “Another round!” 

“Water first!” I yelled back at the three sitting round the table closer to the fire. Drunks were already at three without food, “Food would bring another round faster as well.”

“Ahhh!” one argued, “you just want your pay.”

“If you’d prefer nothing,” I said and locked eyes with him, “pay your tab and be on your merry. Otherwise, water without the arguing.”

“Yes sir,” he muttered into his glass. No fights break out in my bar. No exceptions. Means though I have to manage them a little rougher than the city would. 

Longswords Rest, after the first year, has made a name for being a safe haven for the new adventures. Cook makes to-go-bags for treks and Phil, my baker, makes this really nice hard loaf. Stuff lasts for weeks somehow. It’s good. We have places to rest, to sit and eat, and have people that make sure everything is fair. Only ever had to use Cooks cast iron once to settle something. He did, at least; he looked happy about it.

Adventures then brought people in who were looking to hire them. Even have some of the Lord's men come by and put up notices for work. Brings in jobs for the town. Only town for miles with two blacksmiths. One for farming, tools, and trades and the other for armour and weapons. Both built like bulls. Both act like one.

“Mary,” I asked, she was my best. She was older than me, strong, and wittier than I had ever met. Knew everyone, hated most of them, but could charm a Lord into letting her have his seat at court. “What’s your thoughts tonight?”

“Those three,” she said and looked over at the idiots I put in place, “are still fish.” 

“Those three won’t ever not be,” I snorted.

“Other than them and our regulars,” she smiled and looked around, “We have two Dwarves down from the mountains over there, making their way back to the capital, offered them a place in our safe as per standard.”

“Did they want it?” I asked.

“Maybe?” she shrugged, “Dwarves, they’ll only talk to you about it. Those three are from the Church, keep them quiet and happy and they won’t be a bother. That one’s looking for a ride so I don’t go near him. The women over there are actually elves, again keeping quiet but wanting a ‘humans’ experience. I watered their beer down.”

“Did they ask you too?” I almost chided.

“They said it was ‘very strong’ even at a quarter strength,” Mary laughed, “They’ll wonder off after a while. Told ‘em their ales on me.”

“No, I’ll take it off spillage,” I told her firmly, “How much have they had together?”

“You're the boss, boss,” she said with a knowing smile, “Between the four of them they have had three rounds. So like a pint and a half of the pale ale.”

“Never know with Elves,” I said, trying my best to hold back a chuckle, “Do they know the Dwarves are here or vise versa?”

“No,” Mary snorted and waved a hand at it, “Don’t think they want to. Next up are those five. They are starting out with Matthews' needs out in the river valley. Should be simple for five.”

“Oh?” I said, “Something wrong with the loggers again?”

“As Matthew puts it,” Mary started, “A beast of a man is making trouble down by the river. Scarred more than anyone they had seen and they say he can transform into a bear. Pretty sure that’s just a bear. Right boss?”

“Locals,” I muttered but thought for a second. Not many shifters in the area since the purge and the only other ones were the followers of the old gods. Haven’t seen one in a long time. “Anything specific?”

“Other than becoming a bear boss?” Mary chuckled, “Long scar down ‘is face and neck, apparently. Probably got into a fight with a noble.”

“Hopefully,” I muttered and walked out from behind the bar. That’s too fecking close to Sein’s description for comfort.

“Boss?” 

“What’s this man look like?” I said, stern and low, to the table, “Specifics.”

“Uhh, hi Allistor,” Matthew, a rather small man, muttered but continued quickly when I bent down to look him in the eyes, “Right umm. Long brown hair, built like a bear, said to be able to transform into one, has a lot of scars, one down ‘is face is deep, has a brand on his side like a double ended tree, doesn’t carry a weapon-”

“Feck,” I said, punching the table. The entire room went quiet enough to hear a heartbeat. After a moment in thought I apologised and said, “alls good; start the music again.”

“Boss?” Mary said, concerned after the lone lutist in the corner hesitantly started up, “What’s up?” 

“That’s Sein,” I muttered quietly, “Sounds like Sein”

“Sein?” she asked, “the Sein? Seinham Sein?”

“That scar is from a fight with a dragon over Mount Ilse,” I explained, “it’s deep, it didn’t heal well even for a follower of the old paths.”

“Wait? No,” one of the adventures said quickly, “You said he was a vagabond making trouble.” 

“Thought he was,” Matthew muttered, “if it’s actually a shift-”

“He isn’t,” I cut him off, “Sein’s a good man and an extremely moral person.”

“Boss?” Mary asked, “Been sixteen years since you last saw any of ‘em. People change.”

“Not Sein,” I said, trying to build myself to do something I really didn’t want to, “Not ever.”

“We aren’t going after a Follower,” one of the other adventures said quietly. 

“No, you're coming with me to bring him back,” I said resolutely, “Matthew will pay you as per the contract.”

“Boss?” Mary asked in surprise.

“You got front till I’m back,” I told her, “Phil and Cook can handle the kitchen.”

“Old man’s going to go after a Follower who's a bear?” the first adventures asked, “No thanks.”

“Ad astra per aspera,” I chanted, holding my hand toward Viper, “veni ad me.”

Viper, in an instant, broke off the leather tying it to the wall and flew to my hand. Grabbing it, I broke off the movement spell, and held it in front of me. Still clean; still sharp. Those wards were worth learning. Got to love the Dwarves and their priorities.

“Up to you,” I said with a knowing smile.
