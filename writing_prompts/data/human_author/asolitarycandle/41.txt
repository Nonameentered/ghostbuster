Home. Standing in front of my apartment door it was hard to understand this was home. It felt wrong. I felt light, numb and scared. I tried to let a calming, deep breath out only to hear myself shake. 

What was I going to do? What were we going to do? The meeting this morning was supposed to be good news. Why wasn’t it good news? Did I do something wrong? Why was I here?

“Yeah,” I whispered as I nodded and opened the door. 

A rich, earthy, herb scent soothed me as I walked in. My husband and I had made it together this morning before everything had started. Is it bad to wonder if he knew? 

“Hey!” he called out from his desk near the slider as I put down my bags.

“Hey,” I tried to seem positive but grabbed the bottle I wanted out of one of the bags. Egg shells or razor blades, I don’t know if I would have known the difference. 

“That bad?” he asked, frowning more at the bottle than at my situation.

“They let me go,” I whispered.

“I’m so sorry honey,” he said, standing and walking over to me. 

The bottle in my hands was the only thing keeping my tears at bay.

“What do you need?” he asked quietly.

“I just need to be alone,” I whispered back, “I’m fine. I’m strong. I just need a night.”

“You are,” he whispered, words catching his breath, “You’re so strong. We’ll be okay. Like I said this morning, good or bad, we’ll be okay.”

“It doesn’t mean this won’t get harder,” I whispered bitterly, “Third job in four years. I’m pathetic.”

“You aren’t,” he said sharply, “You’re strong, I love you so much. Those morons don’t deserve you. They never did.”

“I just need a night,” I muttered, looking away. “I just need… I don’t know.”

“You’re allowed to feel pain. Strong people feel pain too,” he whispered, “Take tonight, we’ll try again when things are better.”

“Thank you,” I whimpered, I had fully expected him to take the bottle away.

“I love you,” he whispered into my ear.

“I love you too,” I let it out as a whine.

“If you need anything,” he started but hugged me tightly, “Anything to make the pain less, please, anything I can do, let me know.”

I only nodded. Releasing me, I watched the floor. Our balcony door whined harder than I had as I opened it but when the cool evening air hit my face, I relaxed. Tonight was about to be over. 

Sitting on the ground, I hesitated. I don’t know how long I sat there. I was going to break my streak. It wasn’t much. It was a couple of months, but it had been the longest I had been sober for years.

Standing up, I swallowed hard as I angrily tilted the bottle over the balcony.

I choose pain.

I’m strong enough to choose pain tonight.
