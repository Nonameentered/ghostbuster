Slowing before the trees open up into a clearing, something from your previous life screams at you. Smoke. Something was wrong. It had too much noise to it. It came with something sharp. Danger. What could be as dangerous as you though? In this state, your stomach pushes you forward. Pushes you back into a run. Pushes you into the clearing.

Bill.

That’s what that scent was.

That man needed to eat better. Even as a human he never smelt right but now it was painfully clear that it was his diet. He always sat in the office with those microwaved burritos with such a smile on his face. Cheese melting down his face. The memory makes you nauseated. It makes you angry.

“Eat Better!” you turn and yell at the two hiding in the trees before glancing at the struggling stag. Thinking they may take that as an invitation you add, “Mine.”

“Is that a bear?” you hear someone gasp.

“I’m not finding out,” Bill whispered as the overweight blob, bundled and over-burdened, got up and wobbled away as quick as he could.

“You aren’t supposed to run,” a horse, raspy whisper chased after Bill.

“I’m not being next,” Bill whispered back. Their voices were painfully clear to you even at this distance.

Whoever Bill was with didn’t need any more convincing. You heard him leave the little nest the two had built themselves and wabble away. Not wanting any surprises, you listen till the two round the hill and start huffing it down a deer tail.

“Mine,” you repeat to yourself before sinking your teeth into the petrified stag below you. A shudder ripples through you at the relief of your maw filling with such a sweet liquid. 

“Mine.”
