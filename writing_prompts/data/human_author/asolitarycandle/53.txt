“Okay, just going to enter the crazy portal just after the super high vampires were randomly spiked to death,” I announced to the empty room as I inched my character forward toward the now renewed quest marker. 

This was probably going to be bad. I did not understand how this was only a D-Ranked quest considering the bad guys that I had to face. Well, would have had to? Technically, in this entire run, I hadn’t actually killed anything. The entire world just seemed to kill them for me. 

The hall, or whatever one would call this now blood-soaked chamber, didn’t have any symbols on the walls or floor and I didn’t see anything that looked like it would come out and bite me. I had to note though that it was interesting that the four vampires were arranged around the portal. Four lines in the poem. No, the poem was something else, it was about the portal. 

“I guess, I’m going into limbo then?” I asked before pushing my character forward and popped out into a now brightly lit bright grey stone-ish looking room with wood for walls.

The room looked way more modern than the rest of the fantasy game was, which I had to admit was an interesting change of pace. The bright change was not going well for my headache though. The idea of limbo being more advanced was an amusing concept and at least it was well executed from a design perspective. It even sounded like a car alarm was going off in the background. Now if only it wasn’t harmonizing with the car alarm going off in real life.

With nothing around though, it was hard to look for clues. There was no quest marker yet and the text had gone back to, follow Mr. Murdermittens, which was incredibly unhelpful. Not like a cat in real life would leave so many clues. Bobby would probably say something about it but I wasn’t. I refused to. Looking around, I jumped up and down stairways until I found something in the corner of one of the rooms. 

“Ha ha!” I yelled in triumph as my character picked up another dismembered hand, “and this is why I get so far in these things Bobby.” 

I sort of wished this time it wasn’t true. The item screen flashed up and with it a severed hand wearing a construction worker's glove rotated slowly on my screen. Whoever drew this one was a little too inspired by real life. I swore I actually had a pair of gloves like that in my closet from last year's summer job. I mean well done and all but that was a little too close to home.

Looking out the window in the game gave me a chill at the irony of that thought. I wasn’t sure if it was the coffee, the beer, or the nine or ten-hour marathon I had been playing but even more than the gloves, the building across from my character looked like the one I lived in. Slowly, I turned my head toward my own just in some morbid curiosity.  

There, across the street and twenty stories up an unfinished build, some rando was staring back at me. Maybe not at me, exactly, but he was looking at my building. There was a horrid thought that went through me though that that was my character.

Glancing back at my computer, I tried my best to see if I could zoom in or something. The game had a first-person perspective but it was very basic and felt more like an afterthought than an actual, playable experience. It did have a zoom though.

“Holy shit,” I swore at my computer, “Like, seriously? What the actual…”

I had to sit there for a couple of moments as I watched, in horror, as I saw my apartment window and what looked like myself inside of it through my computer screen. The dude outside hadn’t moved. I hadn’t moved, either my character or myself. How could I? This was way too close to reality to be real.

My phone ringing scared me out of my trance. Jumping almost to the ceiling, I dropped my phone and almost spilt my beer but managed to right them both without damage. My computer screen was still freaky but it didn’t hold me when I looked at it anymore.

“Hey, what’s up?” I asked hesitantly after seeing the number. 

“Man, you sound like shit,” Jerry chuckled into the other side, “Everything okay?”

“Yeah, no, it’s just been a weird night,” I muttered.

“You're telling me,” Jerry said before asking, “You see that crash down in the parking lot?”

“No? What? What happened?” I blurted out, “You’re van okay?”

“It’s a crossover man and yeah, it’s fine,” Jerry argued, he was sensitive about the thing, “Whatever, when you look outside for once you’ll see the four-car pileup mess down on the street.”

“What?” I asked again, quickly getting out of my seat and taking a peek out the window. I tried my best to ignore the creepy construction worker with no success. Jerry was right though, four cars all mushed together were being spread apart in the parking lot. It was sort of hard to see from this height but it looked back. Jerking a bit, I said, “Wow, when did that happen?”

“You didn’t hear the alarms,” Jerry asked.

“No, there was a whole bunch in,” I wasn’t able to finish the sentence with a new wave of chills going down my spine. Somewhere in me didn’t believe it but I had to make sure. “In game… Jerry, hang on, I may need you for something.”

Quickly moving my character to the window, I tried my best to look as far down as I could but couldn’t see past the balcony. If that cat had been outside then the door was now closed and even hitting it didn’t seem to render anything new. Plan b it was then. I didn't like this but I tried my best to count down from where I thought I saw myself in the game. 

“Jerry, look up and east at the condo building,” I basically demanded, “do you see the guy in the window across the street?”

“What? No,” Jerry scoffed before muttering something I couldn’t understand and adding, “Wait, like way up? Maybe?”

“This is going to sound really dumb,” I said hesitantly, looking at my screen and seeing what could have very easily been Jerry’s red hair, “Give him the finger.”

“What? No,” Jerry scoffed harder this time and the little character in game looked like he walked back into the apartment, “I’m not giving some random construction dude the finger.”

“Give him a thumbs up then?” I responded, “I don’t care, I just need you to do something weird.”

“Why?” Jerry asked as the character on my screen came back to the window.

“You aren’t going to believe me,” I said flatly.

“Fine,” Jerry muttered.

Taking a screenshot through another wave of chills, I captured the little redhead giving a clear thumbs up out his window in game. There was no way this was happening. I couldn’t figure out how it couldn’t be happening but it made no sense. How could a game mimic something this accurately? Why would they?

“Man, you still there?” Jerry asked, “I’m pretty sure that guy thinks I’m a weirdo now. He’s just standing there.”

“He doesn’t,” I muttered, “You aren’t going to believe this but I’m sending you a screenshot.”

“You call me the crazy one,” Jerry laughed and someone loudly knocked on his door, “You sound spooked. Sorry, this better be my pizza.”

“Sir, we are looking for witnesses,” I heard someone’s voice come through Jerry’s phone before it got muffled and Jerry came back on, “Hey, it’s the cops. I’m going to have to let you go.”

“Jerry, wait,” I yelled just as I was getting the shot loaded into my email but he was gone. I sent it anyway. He’d have to get the explanation afterwards.

In the game, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. This was just too weird to let go of but there was nothing I could do other than take a few videos with my phone. I thought about starting up a streaming account just to record some of this but I hadn’t set anything like that up. It would probably crash my poor computer anyway. 

Turning my character around, there in the back of the room was a large black cat staring at me. I yelled at it. I’m not sure what I yelled at it but it couldn’t have been mature. I think I sounded something like a cross between a surprised pug and a seagull choking on an ice cube. My middle finger smashed into the ‘w’ key regardless.

I chased that stupid thing around that empty building until my stamina wore out and I was left hobbling around. Multiple times I could have probably caught it if I hadn’t been as basic as I was. I needed to cut corners. That cat was fast though and it led me into another corridor with an arch. 

The quest marker was clear but I was hesitant to go through. Could I get back to this world? Was it a world or was it just a phase of something? Hopefully, this thing will be saved. I entered it regardless. I just needed to see this through.
