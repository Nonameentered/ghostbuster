“How’s Flight 180 doing?” Jamie asked after a couple of minutes of calm. A small sip of coffee and a bit of the breakfast bar she packed made her relax.

“I think they turned around,” Pat said looking at the radar, “still looks weird though. Is it worth bothering someone about it?”

“Always, that’s what they are paid for,” Jamie explained before grabbing the radio and holding the button, “Air Traffic Control, this is Flight 134, we may be having trouble with our radar. May we get the location and velocity of Flight 180? Over.”

“Taking their sweet time,” Pat muttered after a minute of silence. Both of them sighed at the click of the radio coming in.

“Flight 134, this is Air Traffic Control, we see Flight 180 but haven’t been able to get a response. Their location and velocity are currently under review. Over.”

“That’s uncomfortable,” Pat muttered.

“Air Traffic Control, Flight 180 is on our path,” Jamie explained, “We should be coming up on their location shortly. We will report in when we pass the location. Over.”

“Thank you, Flight 134. Over.”

Both Captains were quiet for a time after the call. Jasmine, popped her head in once to ask a question but neither responded. Both were thinking about the almost motionless icon on their screen. It seemed to have turned around since the first time Pat saw it but it wasn’t moving. It was unnerving to see it sit there. Worse when it just suddenly wasn’t.

“Air Traffic Control, this is Flight 134. We need an update on Flight 180,” Jamie said firmly into the microphone, “It has disappeared off our screens. Over”

No response came.

The next moments were more than a little tense in that small, heavily lighted cabin. Jasmine did not visit. They didn’t even hear her puttering around outside now. The beeps and the clicks coming from around them didn’t help much either. They didn’t really pay attention until they got to Flight 180’s last position.

“Do you see anything?” Pat said as they went over our equipment. Jamie shook her head and tried to look out the window. There was nothing. No sign on the ground, no smoke, no unusual weather, and no Flight 180. Maybe it had just been an error?

“Air Traffic Control, this is Flight 134,” Pat said with a bit of a confused tone, “We are at Flight 180’s last known location. We don’t see anything. Please acknowledge. Over.”

“Flight 134, this is Air Traffic Control. We have no schedule for Flight 180 on our manifest. Please double-check your reference. Over.”

“What?” both Pat and Jamie said together as Air Traffic Control responded. They were going to ask more but they froze when they heard a pong ripple through the plane.

“Now what?” Pat asked loudly, “Did we hit something?”

“That’s what we need,” Jamie groaned but a couple of screams in first class had them both turn around, “a stupid bird.”

“Captains,” Jasmine said as she opened the door quickly, “There is an unfortunate mark across our wing. May I get authorization to make a plane-wide announcement?”

“Yes,” Pat almost yelled, “How bad is it?”

“It’s large,” Jasmine said shakily, “there is so much blood. Thankfully, it only hit the wing and not the engine.”

“Stupid bir-”

Pong.

“Stupid Birds!” Jamie muttered the first but yelled the second. She groaned loudly into her hands before checking over the instruments. Thankfully that one also seemed to bounce off a wing and miss the engines.

“I don’t think that was a bird,” Pat whispered. Jamie and Jasmine looked over to see Pat white as a ghost and gripping her controls harder than ever. “I think I saw a body.”

“A body, body,” Jamie asked, “like a person?”

“I don’t know,” Pat muttered.

“You better figure it the bloody hell out,” Jamie yelled, “Jasmine, tell the passengers that we are sorry about the birds and to close their windows. Fancy it up.”

“Look,” Pat said simply and pointed at the window. There was a dot hanging in the air but with the plane's speed, it would hit them in seconds. It was too late to turn. All they could really do is hope it didn’t hit anything important.

Pong.

“You saw that right?” Pat muttered, stiffer than ever.

“Yeah,” Jamie muttered as well.

“That can’t be right,” Jasmine added. Jamie turned to her radio though and submitted the call.

“Air Traffic Control, something very, very wrong is happening," Jamie whispered.

“Last call, please identify yourself. Over.”

“Air Traffic Control, this is Flight 134. We seem to have hit multiple people in mid-air. Over.” Jamie said more clearly after clearing her throat and wiping her brow.

“Last call, please review. We do not have a Flight 134 on our manifest today. Over.”
