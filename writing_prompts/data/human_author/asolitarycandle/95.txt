This is about right. Metal table, weird little aliens hovering things all over me, and on the table by the corner a long looking tube thing. This is great. Perfect. My life really is a curse. I spent it all on trying to make people happy and what did it get me? Probably a slow death from that tube thing.

They didn’t say much. The aliens. When they did they looked rather shocked, which was odd. I hope at least it was odd. They did a couple motions for me to lay on the metal table and I honestly didn’t care at this point. I just tried to do what they asked me.

It seemed to go smoothly. Whatever they were doing that is. There were green lights on the screen. Probably shouldn’t assume it’s good if they are green as I don’t know what green means to the grey little beings. It was neat to watch though. It looked like they were trying to map out my body. I could see the defect in my kidney that mom had told me about when I was younger.

The screens were really cool. Looked like a special type of glass background that allowed for multiple perspective viewing. I tilted my head slightly back and forth and noticed that there was some way they were mimicking depth with it. Wish I could make something like that. Wish I could make anything right.

“Bahh!” one of the aliens said and opened his mouth wide. Had tiny little sharp teeth in there. Almost cute for some reason. He seemed annoyed though and touched my nose and repeated.

“Oh, sorry,” I muttered and opened my mouth, “Bahh!”

He put some sort of bulbous device in and held it for a second. There was a warmth radiating from it but it didn’t feel dangerous. At least, I hope it wasn’t dangerous. Not like these things couldn’t kill me in an instant if they wanted to.

“B’reesidit’ac, a’col elst’cinte,” one yelled as he ran back into the room holding a bunch of things.

“‘Basdac!” the one beside me said, almost sounded annoyed. It hadn’t really done anything other than observe. They played with the devices a bit and then put something in their ears? At least, I think it was their ears.

“Passhinsscomasslac, shhlooy stimmish,” one said in a crazy hiss like fashion. The other two clapped their hands and the one beside me just sort of grunted and took the one he was handed. They eventually handed one to me and showed me how to put the earpiece in.

“Basidac,” the one in front of me said and raked his hand up its throat and out of its mouth.

“What-”

“English detected, download in progress.” I heard a deep voice say from the earpiece.

“Alasitdac! Das, Das, Balandatalansamac Das stam as dac you stupid moron, we are trying to make this Tamoerasicat on him,” one yelled at the other and hit it with the tray it was holding.

“Download complete,” the deep voice said and the two froze in place.

“Sorry about my staff,” the alien beside me said in a calm but obviously disappointed voice. The two looked down and put the tray back. “We wanted to make this a bit easier for you, all things considering. However, when the translator malfunctioned as we were beginning it was difficult to know what to do. We deeply appreciate your cooperation.”

“You’re welcome?” I said, stuttered a bit, “what are you going to do to me?”

“We brought you on board because we thought you were malfunctioning,” the, what I assume is the leader, explained, “we figured because you are radically opposed to visiting a bodily maintenance shop you were suffering some sort of damage.”

“Hospitals are expensive,” I explained, defensively, “plus I don’t feel that bad.”

“You aren’t in that bad of shape,” it agreed, “regardless, we’ll remove that growth on your lungs and repair your teeth, knee, and remove the scarring on your body. Also some of your organs are misshapen.”

“Thank you,” I muttered quietly, this was not what I expected, “Why are you helping me?”

“We have spent much of the last two rotations watching this planet but in the last two months we found you,” it said simply, “You have lost at everything we have bet on. Except daughter of a sculptor of mid-sea sea creatures bones-”

“Translation not within parameters of basic English,” the voice cut in but continued the translation quickly afterwards.

“Who has won everything by betting against you.”

“Basic English?” I yelled at the room, “I know more than basic English.”

“Incorrect,” the voice responded.

“You really don’t,” the alien beside me said. I frowned and slumped back onto the table. It’s not so much them saying it but it was just the tone. Absolute truth without judgement was bitterly cold. The alien turned over the screens to different scenes throughout the last month though and pointed to one in particular. “That delusion is what we want to talk about. Without a physical reason for your state of being we can only assume that your software is malfunctioning.”

“That’s uncomfortable,” I said, referring to the phrasing. The scene was bad. I had gone on a date and utterly froze up in the conversation. Panicking, I made a couple really bad jokes and ended up getting her wine thrown at me.

“We assumed so,” the alien agreed, “it has been to watch as well.”

“Okay,” I muttered, sort of realising they are serious and that they have seen everything, “hey, you were in my bedroom? What have you seen?”

“Don’t worry,” the alien said calmly, “we don’t judge other species' reproductive procedures or practices. Your’s needs serious work to fall in line with your species standards though.”

“Holy shit,” I said loudly and groaned, louder than I intended. The aliens looked at each other and said a couple things after their own language before looking back at me.

“We disagree,” the alien said, “your attempts at mating are on the level of, again, below average excrement. Believing oneself to be divine is another thing we will help you overcome.”

“That’s not what I meant,” I muttered, “why are you trying to help me?”

“Humans' ability to pair bond is remarkable,” it said, “yours is pathetic but it has made us pair-bond with you. So in some ways it is effective. We want you to tell us about your life, where you came from before this, and we may be able to help you produce something other than those foot wrap things that you use. First question though is, are you okay?”
