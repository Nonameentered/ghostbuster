“Ms. Allison?” I heard one someone call from the tables. My shop wasn’t all that large but was all solid wood, had enough plugins, fast enough internet, and good enough tea that the students from the university would make the ten-minute trek. Some would take the bus and a couple would drive but most of my customers were more broke than I was.

“Yes, Daphne?” I said with a smile from behind my bar as I polished some of the finer cups in my collection. She was a smart kid; she was taking chemistry with the intent of going onto medicine. I wasn’t looking forward to next year though. Most of my readings say I will see her more as she starts to cry into her organic chemistry textbooks.

“Do you know where this is?” she asked in surprise, obviously avoiding whatever assignment she was on.

“My tea shop?” I asked in return.

“Yeah, but,” she said reading whatever was on her screen, “this spot was an archaeological site up until about five years ago. It was home to a large gravesite with stone pillars buried deep into the ground.”

“They are still there actually,” I motioned to the corners of the shop, “they are anchoring part of the foundation. The dig decided that they weren’t old enough to bother with but after the grave had been excavated they didn’t see a need to keep it. Bought the land for a fraction of the price.”

“You bought a gravesite?” another popped her head up and asked.

“Former,” I corrected quickly, “no bodies here.”

“What about spirits?” another said and moan in what was supposed to be an eerie imitation.

“I decided long ago that a liquor license was too expensive,” I dodged but smiled in a knowing way. They chuckled.

“I wouldn’t ever leave here if you served beer,” the third said as they continued to read, “probably should be getting on anyway. What time do you close?”

“About five minutes,” I said, pointing at the clock. They all groaned but they were diligent about paying their tab and cleaning up their space. I mostly went around and made sure they didn’t leave anything.

“Good night Jen!” they said as they walked toward the door. Good kids, but they called out as they left, “Don’t let the spirits stay up too late.”

“Forget the spirits,” I yelled back, “I should have told you all to go to bed an hour ago.”

They laughed, I laughed, even the nearly headless guy in the corner laughed; it was a good time. They couldn’t see him, mind you, but it was still good to keep the early crowd from mingling with the late crowd. On both ends. Oscar wasn’t much more of a threat than any of them were anyway and if I told him, quietly, to wait he did.

I locked the door manually but after I pulled the blinds down I started up the arcane scripts in order to shield the building from anyone who may have an interest. Simple things though. I have one that makes the building remind people of things that they either have in their home or miss about their childhood. Mostly it’s about pulling and pushing memories in the correct way. Didn’t have anything moving on its own though.

A witch always cleans her space herself. It was important to appreciate, respect, and understand the space you were using before you called the corners. I did appreciate it. This tea shop had always been my dream and when the land had come up for sale I saw an opportunity to do some good for this world and the next. A couple of choice words and more salt than I’d ever like to admit I was finally ready.

The spells were old, the chants were translated throughout the ages but they always came back to an important teaching; honour the land, the people, and oneself. The balance between those points is what allows one to open the fourth, which was simply respect for time. Time is what made everything else important.

Darkness took me and I wandered in a space mostly my own. My ancestors would visit, occasionally, but would never stay long. It may sound weird but it’s quite a compliment. Ancestors typically only stay around their kin if they are in need of training or wisdom. Mine have told me a couple of times that they have faith that I know what I’m doing. I waited the minute before breaking the silence, the darkness, and the stillness of my house.

A match and a candle usually did it for me. Sort of liked the smell but also it was nice because a lot of the teapots I had taken little tea lights as warmers. Duel purpose and if anyone became nosy I had an out.

The room was already busy. Not full by any means but I counted eight spirits at the tables. I looked around for one in particular. She had been trying her best to find peace with herself over aspects of her life she discovered weren’t all that clear to her during her time. Family thought it was best not to tell her that they didn’t actually like the things she had spent so much time hunting for. Her gifts to them, she always knew it would be her last gifts, meant nothing.

“Marge!” I said with a smile and clap as I saw her in the corner. Poor thing was always alone but it was hard sometimes when your soul doesn’t have a way to produce serotonin. “I’ll be with you shortly, is there anything you want?”

“Oh blessed dear,” she muttered, “you don’t have to bother yourself with me.”

“Orange pekoe with a biscuit it is then,” I said as I waved a hand at her. The rest of my late-night patrons ordered their usuals. It’s funny. After death, all they really wanted was the consistent things that they had in life.
