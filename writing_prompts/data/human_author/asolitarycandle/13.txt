Thank you. I'm glad that I was able to provide a story worth continuing. It's funny because a lot of my writing I do on my phone and I know the feeling about trying to write like that. I eventually got an MX Keys Mini keyboard that I just pack around with me. It makes writing on my phone easier.

Reading, I find the spotlight that WP gives out is a great help when I want something that I know will be good to read. I follow a few of them and usually read them if I see them on the prompt.
