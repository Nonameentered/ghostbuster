“It bit me?” Sa’thoth yelled at his decontamination chamber. No one answered him. No one was listening to the little lizard as he waddled in place. Grabbing his healing tail, Sa’thoth tried his best to think of anything he should have done.

When Captain Tein had brought their ship into orbit, the planet had acted like every sub-civilization in the galaxy did, inconsistently. Some sent gifts, one was very generous and sent a makeshift capsule of extremely rare 92-143 metal. Some sent needless recommendations that Captain Tein ignored. Some sent mating proposals that made everyone uncomfortable. Some were very rude. Then there was one we all paused at. It was hard to translate what they wanted but clarifying that we were to replace their government with a functioning one was seemingly well received. Hopefully, that was poorly translated back to them.

Sa’thoth left the decontamination chamber in a huff. He had been promoted recently in his efforts to better understand these creatures. The eating habits of these Apes had proved to be Captain Tein’s bane when it came to strategically making the species easier to deal with. All other things being equal, their world was a wonder of unstructured mismanagement.

“Wish this one had a tail I could rip off,” Sa’thoth seethed. Grabbing an auto-injector and a vial labelled, in case of exposure, Sa’thoth jabbed the thing into his thigh and let out a yip in pain. It took more than a couple of moments and a cup of warm bone broth to calm him down. The human watched him throughout it all. 

That was fine. Let the thing rot for all Sa’thoth cared. He had his work to do. Maybe a dead human would make more sense than a living one. At least it wouldn’t bring him any pain. Not that anyone on this ship hadn’t in some way brought Sa’thoth some form of pain. Captain Tein, his second Telgor, Telgor’s Chief of Staff, and even Bo looked down on him. Not that it was their fault, Sa’thoth was quite small. 

“I’ll be soft if-” Sa’thoth muttered to himself as he looked up from his monitor to find an empty room. Panicking, Sa’thoth switched on the intercom and asked, “Human! Appear!”

“Let me go!” an aggressive, middle-aged man yelled back at him.

“Go where?” Sa’thoth scoffed, he hated this argument, “You can’t leave the study until I know you are safe.”

“Home, you idiot!” the man yelled, “Let me go home! My kids-“

“We’ve been over this,” Sa’thoth argued, looking through the barrier for where the human could be, “Your spawn are fine on their own. You jeweling their shells won’t make them better spawn.”

“What does that mean?” the man exhaustedly asked back.

“Let them feed themselves,” Sa’thoth explained, now focused on the pile of lab equipment in the back, “You said it yourself they are almost of mature age.”

“My oldest is nine!” the man yelled, popping his head above the table Sa’thoth was staring at, grabbed a stabilizer off the top, and brought it down with him. Sa’thoth frowned at that. What was he doing? Turning up the volume of the intercom, Sa’thoth heard the man mutter to himself, “My wife is going to kill me.”

“Based on your spawn rearing ability,” Sa’thoth tried to appease, “Maybe, limiting contact with both them and your mate would be in everyone’s best interest.”

A utility pole with the stabilizer fastened to the top flew out from behind the man’s table, hit the barrier hard enough to disrupt and lodged there for longer than Sa’thoth would have liked. Pushing on his end, the pole collapsed backwards onto the floor with a clang.

“What was that?” Sa’thoth screamed into the mic.

“Attempt number two,” the man yelled back, pushing way past the compressor's capabilities and shaking the room that Sa’thoth was in. Covering his ear holes, Sa’thoth chided himself for not bringing the volume back down.

“Was biting me attempt number one?” Sa’thoth asked as he pushed the volume button down.

“I stabbed you,” the man explained, “If I bit you, I would have taken a piece of you with me.”

“Good to know,” Sa’thoth muttered to himself before asking, “Where did you find that stabbing instrument?”

“I MacGyvered one up,” the man answered, clearly doing something else behind the table.

Sa’thoth paused, frowning at the barrier in front of him and then turned to his workstation. That couldn’t have been translated right. Maybe something local that Sa’thoth had missed in his research. What would the son of Ivon have that this man possesses? Was his father Ivon?

“Please rephrase that,” Sa’thoth asked the man as carefully as he could. He needed to know that phrase and the system was still decoding the ridiculous network these creatures created. 

“Since you asked nicely, come in here and I’ll explain it,” the man countered, “all safe like.”

“That seems counter to our previous interactions,” Sa’thoth argued.

“Human culture,” the man almost seemed pleased with himself at the phrase.

“You have to be truthful to your superiors,” Sa’thoth instructed.

A second utility pole, this time with what looked to be a disassembled restraining device flew through the barrier and crashed into the workstation behind Sa’thoth. The little lizard only had time to fall to the floor on base instinct rather than any reasonable reaction. Good thing too. Any reasonable lizard would have trusted the barrier.

“You are in no way my superior, you overgrown gecko,” the man yelled, “Let me go or next time I’m coming through with the pole and taking your ship.”

Sa’thoth peaked over the edge of his desk and into the lab before slamming the emergency button at the base of the barrier. A solid sheet of 22-26 metal came slamming down and locked in place. The man looked shocked in the last moments that Sa’thoth could see him.

“His spawn can’t feed themselves but this male has the mind to break through a barrier,” Sa’thoth muttered to himself. 

Picking up the second utility pole with the restraint on the end, Sa’thoth took some notes on how the barrier reacted. He wasn’t an engineer but this seemed like something they would want to know. That or something that Sa’thoth could use for himself. 

“No,” Sa’thoth muttered as he flipped on the remote viewing monitor and checked on where to human was, “Don’t pick up feral habits.”

To his horror, the human wasn’t hiding anymore. He was examining the locking mechanism that the researchers had brought him through. If the human could break through a barrier, he could probably figure out the door.

“Stop that!” Sa’thoth demanded.

“Ask nicely,” the man responded in what Sa’thoth uncomfortably felt was amusement.

“Please stop that?” Sa’thoth asked.

“Is that a question or a request?” the man asked back.

Sa’thoth stood stunned at the question. Was this man his superior? This was not going well.
