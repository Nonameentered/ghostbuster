In the beginning, we didn’t know why they thought The List was accurate. When they made their presence known and who they wanted, we tried to negotiate. We pleaded to let others go. They knew who they wanted though. It was so exact that they needed a blood sample in order to even enter their ship. What we didn’t know was that dark times were ahead.

Thousands of so-called influencers were called to fulfil their duty and represent the human race in an intergalactic counsel. We were grateful that there were some experienced politicians going on at the time. Maybe if the rest kept quiet then this wouldn’t turn into an abomination of a political summit. We should have been honoured but things kept coming up that was beyond odd.

There were doomsday sayers back then of course. They didn’t seem to stick around though or when they got to a head it just seemed to fizzle out. Local police to international agencies weren’t able to calm some of the factions down but they also never needed to. People went missing. High-level people became ill and passed in a matter of weeks. We all assumed it had to be due to stress. Autopsies found nothing.

It never mattered to those on The List. They sold everything and their souls for more and more money. Influencers got influenced. Cults started around them. People started live streaming them 24/7 and donated anything they could with the promise that these people would put in a good word for them. It was such a mess.

On the day of, the world watched as the dolled-up narcissist’s got their ultimate dream come true. The words they said, just the sheer audacity of them is burned into my memory. Cameras caught every angle in ultra-high definition and pushed it out to every television and computer across the planet. 

We all got front-row seats to a culling of what our enemies thought was the best and brightest.

“We care not for misunderstandings,” a soft-spoken reptile explained after it was done, “This should make it clear that we are now in control.”

Now, as nations scrambled to respond with weapons and the army’s that they had at their disposal the internet did its thing. The Next List was started and quickly filled with names, reasons, and rankings. No government touched it because no one knew what to do with it. 

What did our new overlords think? They watched in horror as the species that they had so carefully studied and culled the head of started offering up round two. What I wouldn’t have given to know what it was like to be in their command center when they were told to take more.

There’s a Bonaparte quote that’s, “Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.” No communications came from space for a couple of days as they apparently deliberated. Nations armed their warheads and moved their assets into place. Everyone went dark. The longer the aliens kept to themselves the better we positioned ourselves for an actual response. 

The time came again for the aliens to speak and to many people's surprise, they seemed unstable. The same alien took the podium but without the confidence that he had before. Multiple screens showed now what must have been to direct him.

“We are… disappointed that your species has decided to be,” the lizard paused and confirmed something with another behind him before saying, “Barbaric is the word you use. You have a chance to make a reasonable response. Please be aware we will judge you harshly for any immorality going forward.”

One-word responses flooded everywhere.

No.

The sky was set on fire that night so that the aliens clearly heard we were not going to go quietly.
