“My lord, do you smell that?” the thin and raspy voice of Sildin, an elf in his middle years strapped tight in his leather whispered to me as we carefully tip-toed our way through the dark halls, “Is that parchment?”

I didn’t trust it. Sildin would have his ideas of what could be in P’ther’anian’s lair but the Drake  would throw another set of traps or monsters at us for his own amusement as much as for his own protection. We had lost brothers and sisters already. If the Dwarves would have cleared this beast out centuries ago when he took up residence then this situation would have never been. 

“Ris, is this dangerous?” I turned and whispered to an even thinner elf behind Sildin. 

“Just off putting sir,” Ris whispered back, “Do you think the beast reads?”

“An eight oak beast with a habit of destroying the treasuries of Elves and Men from here to the sea does not sound like a reader,” I muttered as we approached a hallway. 

The idea of a beast like this reading was absolutely absurd. What would he read? Any of the tales from our kind would allow the beast to understand his place in the world as a powerful creature came with duty. The tales of men, maybe not so much. They had their own ideas of what duty and responsibility was but it would still be a far sight better than the wanton destruction this creature seemed absorbed in. 

No, this beast was probably sitting on his hoard of stolen gold, gems, and other precious metals with the same understanding of language that those arrogant felines that men keep had. The last two I had faced at least had been that way. After the first, my noble parents sent me to seek the fame and glory that came with this duty. To rid this world of the uncounciousable. 

Staring down each dark corridor in front of us, I tried to see or smell anything that would tell us the direction the beast was. The left seemed still while the right hand path had a bit of draft. Nothing could be sensed down that way though. If something had been caught in the gentle wind it would have made itself known in an instant unless the path diverged later on. I made a note to come back if the left hand path failed to meet my expectations.

“Lesis isn’t a reader but he still reads Mistanble’s Tales,” Ris whispered, drawing a quiet chuckle out of the rest of the group.

“If Mistanble’s Tales count as reading,” Myr scoffed, “I’m a scholar.”

I turned and stared at the remaining five elves that had made it through the misery that we had endured at the beginning of this cave. Sildin and Ris looked as hard as they always were. Sildin with his sword at the ready and Ris with her daggers flanked me whenever there was trouble. Myr had nothing out and she preferred it. If trouble happened, she lit up with the excitement of unsheathing her sword. Lesis was at the back with Bob. Both looked miserable and beaten hard. The poor human looked near blind in this low light but the man was solid as stone. 

“We are supposed to be unheard,” I hissed back to them.

“Sir, that boulder dropping from the ceiling probably gave away our position a spell ago,” Myr said casually.

“That Kobold that exploded probably did us in worse,” Ris admitted.

“Do Kobolds always do that?” Bob asked from the back, stretching as he and Lesis waited.

“Hopefully not,” Sildin whispered back as I stared into the group in disgust. These fools had been with me in the last two dragon infested caves, how did they not know the basics of Kobolds?

“You are all going to be in the library, reading Ylling’s Scaled Bestiary when we get back,” I whispered angrily as I turned and started walking down the left path.

*“Tishanthion’s is better,”* I heard ripple through my mind in an unnaturally deep bass mixed with a high pitched whisper. We all froze. I didn’t need to turn to feel the group stop with me. What was this new trap for us?

“Was that?” Ris whispered as quietly as she could.

“I think,” I whispered back. 

“Are we close?” Myr asked quickly.

*“If you go down that hall and then take the first left after the bend, you’ll find me waiting,” *the eldritch, discordian voice ripple through us. 

Not even Bob seemed to move. I couldn’t think of anything really to do other than turn around. If a dragon, a red dragon at that, was waiting for me around a bend then we would be incinerated the second we got into range. Was that his plan though? Was he in front of us or was he waiting now for us to go back? Telepathy never gave away position.

“Is that a yes or no?” Myr asked quietly for once.

“Don’t trust the voice,” I whispered, as sternly as I could even though I felt my own fear betray me.

“That’s still not a yes or no,” Myr pointed out.

“Shut it, you dwarven lout,” I hissed back at her as I tried to think.

“You going to burn us?” Bob asked forlornly, “I would rather not be burned.”

*“That depends on how you meet me,”* the voice replied, *“Claws sheathed and we’ll talk. Unsheathed though and you’ll find my fire can travel further than you can.”*

“Well,” Bob groaned and put away his longsword.

“Bob, what in the Seven Stars are you doing?” I hissed back at him.

“Surviving,” Bob stated, “You should do the same your lordship.”

“I am here to slay this menace,” I glared at the oaf of a man as I hissed, “I am here to restore order to the realms of Elves and Men. The gold in this cave does not belong here.”

*“Whoever told you there is gold in my cave has been misinformed,” *the voice rippled in more rhythmic than the last time. Was he laughing?

“You lie!” I screamed out into the darkness.

*“If you say so,” *the voice stated, *“I don’t argue with fools.”*

“I am Lord Mathylis,” I declared, “Son of the Elven Master, Mathilas, of the Eldenring Woods. I am no fool nor suffer insults from barbaric beasts.”

*“Seems a lot like what I said, you took as insult,” *the voice stated, *“You should try harder not to be so prideful.”*

“No, I mean you will pay for that insult,” I declared, now rather confused.

*“I don’t pay for insults,”* the voice stated, *“If anything I should charge for them.”*

“The arrogance of this beast,” I scoffed.

*“A gold mark should suffice young Mathylis,”* the voice declared, *“Please present it when you approach me.”*

“Did we bring any gold?” Myr asked with concern.

“We are not paying the beast to insult me,” I turned and yelled at the group. This was not going well. Shaking off what energy I had, I tried to think of how to recover from this nightmare. Quiickly, I started to shake my head and whispered, “If you have gold, give it to me. The beast can sense it.”

Holding my finger up to my lips, I placed whatever coin I had on the ground near the wall and put my gilded sword beside it. Two daggers will have to do. They were elvish steel but lacked the gold trim that my longsword had. The rest of the group followed my example and layed down anything of value by the wall.

We snuck as quietly as we could along the wall and as the voice had said there was a bend. Stopping by the door that had to hold the beast. I steadied myself as best I could before facing the group. Bob had never unsheathed his sword and stood back from us. If the oaf wasn’t going to help the least he could do was not get so close. 

Counting down, we all rushed the door only to be met by the glowing amber eyes of the red dragon staring us down. Frozen in place in fear, we stared at him and him at us. I wasn’t expecting him to be honest. This was supposed to be a ruse.

“So,” Myr announced, looking around at what I now saw were stacks and stacks of parchment around him, “You do read?”

*“Rereading Keynes currently,”* the voice answered, *“Chrono-Wizard had a visit to some library of men long from now.”*

“Men,” I scoffed, “Of course you would take the worst of this world and apply your malice to it. Do you know what you have done to the stability of the realm? Do you know the damage you have done to the markets of this world? Only the Pan-Oceanic Tradings and Holdings is large enough to avoid your evil.”

*“My dear elfling,”* the voice now openly chuckled, *“I am the POTH. P’ther’anian, at your service. How may I let you become indebted to me?”*
