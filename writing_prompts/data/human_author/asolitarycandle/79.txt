​“My love, this is Margaret,” Norman introduced the creature staring at them hungrily, “Twenty five long years and I have finally found one willing to come forward.”

  
Dori’s eyes fell to the curb below Margaret and, biting her tongue, she sighed softly in the darkness. Norman knew he promised her an adventure. Norman knew Dori expected something like the ones they went on in their twenties but he hoped this find, this discovery would be enough.

  
“You said that the last time you found a rare Cryptid,” Dori argued coldly and turned to Margaret to yell, “What has this idiot promised you? Better not have been a cure.”

  
The large smile on Margaret’s muzzle dropped in an instant. Bright white teeth reflected the glow of the streetlamp as a wave after wave of menace and anger hit them. Dori knew she had hit Norman’s mark square. Turning back to Norman, she frowned.

  
“Seriously?” Dori asked, Norman felt the exhaustion she had with him return.

  
“She’s a werewolf,” Norman argued, “It can’t be that hard to cure a werewolf.”

  
“Is she a werewolf, Norman?” Dori yelled, “If so, what type and from where?”

  
“Well,” Norman sputtered, as Margaret’s growl grew deeper, “European, I think.”

  
“Oh!” Dori laughed as she clapped her hands in mocking applause, “Good! You think she is European.”

  
“Could we maybe talk through the details, umm,” Norman said but flinched when Margaret stepped out of the shadow of the alleyway and walked toward them. Trying his best, Norman yelled, “Wait! Hang on, Dori is the best Crypto-veterinarian on the east coast. I know how to find beings and she knows how to help them.”

  
“I’ll bet a cow you that you found him!” Dori yelled at Margaret, stopping her in her tracks, “Am I right?”
