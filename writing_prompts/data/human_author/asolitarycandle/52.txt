I came out into another dark room. This time it was filled with supplies and containers. A pantry maybe? The only thing that I could interact with though was the hatch on the other side. With the labels, I was sort of sad I wasn’t able to steal some of this. No, I knew what I wanted. I turned around to go back through the portal but it had closed. 

On the other side of the hatch, an old man with a black cat watched me idly as I approached them. It was Mr. Arkstone sitting there with a rather amused expression and a can of what looked like the same beer I was drinking.

“Thank you kindly, adventurer,” he started as I could only just watch, my headache getting a lot worse than it had been, “My wonderful Mr. Murdermittens has returned home. How did you enjoy limbo?”

My only choice was to answer, “Well enough but some people were watching me.”

“They do that in that world,” Mr. Arkstone agreed, “I am very glad you have made it back though. Being stuck there isn’t fun. Isn’t that right Erik?”

“What?” I muttered to myself as I got up and tried to move back to the window. I felt dizzy. Way dizzier than a single beer should have made me. Somewhere between my chair and the window, I felt the comfy support of my couch hit me and the world faded.

Three hours later I woke up in the hospital. They said it was a gas leak that I was lucky to survive and if Jerry hadn't been looking for me the firemen would have given up on my, as they put it, destroyed apartment.

I tried to tell them about what I had been through but a nurse came in and explained what carbon monoxide poisoning was like. Jerry sat with me until I was released and we spent the night at Bobby’s. I guess it had been a delusion. Part of the gas leak.

“Hey, man,” Jerry said quietly, showing me his phone, “I didn’t know you could do something like this.”

My mind reeled at seeing it as a tensing shiver rippled through me. There in front of me was the screenshot of Jerry. It was real? Something was wrong though. I couldn’t remember if the cat was sitting beside him back then or not.
