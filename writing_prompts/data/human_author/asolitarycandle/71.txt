Deep history tells that once upon a time Drakekins and Humans were at bitter war with each other over resources and land. What happened back then though has always been a shifting quagmire of propaganda and fairytales. Religion, every religion, says that they saved us from inhalation and ruin. Written history, if terracotta pots and stone monuments attest to the truth any better than what we do today, has recorded that as populations grew, alliances did as well. We went to war with each other. 

The first was the Black Sea War. Twelve thousand soldiers, two dozen boats, and thirty combat Drakekin on each side shifted the Nearthos border south about twelve kilometres over a three year period. Decades of resources, thousands of lives, and the scales of seven went down in history as a triumphant song played for the age. More than the war, an alliance had been formed that would seem to last for nearly a millenna.

It was only temporarily fractured by a sin that both of our kinds almost espouse as a virtue. Greed, a multigenerational golden age in Nearthos brought a meritocracy back to monarchy through inheritance and nepotism. When the rulers saw the hoards of Drakekin and compared them to their vaults, they saw an opportunity to expand. Their ashes are a stain on humanity’s record that will always be remembered. 

Stanley wasn’t sure if the movies that had portrayed either the Black Sea War or the Burning of Jewel of Nearthos were anything other than fun. Deep history aside, Zackariah Thomas had done an amazing job being the Phoenix which is the human spirit. He was pitied during the fall and loved during his whole rebirth scenes. Stanley even had to admit that he wanted to change the world after leaving the theatre. 

Dreaming was fun but he and his team were just freight transport. Hot wars weren’t really a thing anymore, nor had they been for the last century. Now the alliance between Drakekin and Humans was mostly about transportation and construction. With the edges of the map filled in, Drakekin no longer held secrets of the world that Humans bartered for and Humans became a needed source of food and creation. 

“Hey boss?” Barb leaned over and asked Stanely, “You falling asleep?”

“No way I’m sleeping through this,” Stanley muttered, eyes closed but wide awake, “I don’t think my legs would let me. What time is it?”

“About half past,” Barb answered, “ I think we have the pool for another half hour.”

“Do you think Camy would question if we charged another two on the card?” Stanley groaned and then almost growled as he sat up.

“No,” Barb scoffed, “She’d just take it off our wage.”

“You mean the nothing we are already getting paid for this job?” Stanley chuckled, “I doubt she’s that good.”

“Just you wait,” Barb shot back, “We’ll end up owing when we get back.”

“You two will!” Marc yelled from the pool, the quiet drum of the volleyball gone and the object itself secured under his arm, “I’m getting paid my contract. You two want to live it up, that’s on your dime.”

“Priority run isn’t worth the dime,” the deep bellow of the Drakekin filling most of the pool sent a ripple through the water. Falsorth had been in the air for the last twelve hours, carrying both them and the cargo. Stanley knew he was sore but his comment was the closest thing he’d say to admit it.

“We could branch out,” Barb offered, “Camy has been light on work and has been complaining that what she has been getting is scaps at best. We could look elsewhere.”

“Elsewhere leads back to the Yamle Holdings Group,” Stanley argued, “Worse, the Setis Brothers.”

“Well, what would you think of biting the bullet?” Barb asked, “we could get our Certs and do channel runs?”

“Cost went up again,” Stanley looked at Barb sternly and whispered, “We’d be in the hole and six months without work.”

“We could do it,” Barb whispered back and tilted her head toward Falsorth, “He could do it.”

“Are we playing or are we talking?” they all heard Tim yell from the far side of Falsorth’s body.

“I am relaxing, they are talking,” Falsorth quietly explained, at least for him, as Stanley and Barb looked up at the Drakekin. “You are waiting.”

“Wasting time more like it,” Tim said loud enough for them to hear.

Falsorth, Stanley and Barb had all started out together. Every Drakekin had a navigator and a liaison but both were trained for either position. Stanley had gotten the contracts with Camy so Barb had spent the last couple of years calling him Boss, tongue in cheek, mostly because she had no interest in dealing with, as she put it, the crazy cat lady. Tim had joined the crew about two years ago as a hitcher and balloon expert. 

Most of their cargo wasn’t carried by Falsorth directly. He was merely the engine that carried the blimp from their warehouses in Newport to wherever they needed to go. At least, that was how it was usually done. Priority runs meant tie downs and direct contact. Falsorth had a two-ton carry limit as a Red Sorgoth with his muscle to wingspan ratio but the one point two cargo got to be too much after eight hours. Stanley knew he had to treat Falsorth right after this one.

“Well Barb is saying we should get our water certs done,” Stanley called out, “What are your thoughts?”

“Better money,” Tim yelled out, “Better Blimps.”

”And I was in Dale for two semesters,” Marc quickly added. The man had been added as an offman. Basically a jack of all trades that let the others rest during long periods in the sky. He had turned out to be a decent polyglot and had stayed when the team started taking jobs passed the Milsen border.

“If it means no more tie downs, I’m in,” Falsorth said with a sigh.

“It means more training,” Stanley warned, “Means we are making a run to Isley and back without pay.”

“We aren’t getting paid now,” Barb muttered, loud enough so that only Stanely could hear it.

“So that’s a yes?” Stanley asked, now in shock. He wasn’t really expecting the four to be on the same page. It was rare they were even reading the same book.

“Worth looking into at least,” Marc offered as he turned around and served the volleyball he had been holding back over Falsorth’s body. A surprised yelp followed shortly after. He chuckled to himself before adding, “If that doesn’t work we could always start smuggling.”

“Drakekin Smugglers are whelps,” Falsorth quickly sneered, “Or worse, runts.”

“Well, imagine how good you’d be at it then,” Marc said with a laugh. 

Falsorth turned his head and Stanley watched as the massive Drakekin glared at the human in the pool. On Marc’s next serve, a wing quickly snapped into place to bounce the ball back down and splash him. Stanley smiled. It was nice to see them tease each other. This last year had been hard enough that he worried if some of the fights they had left scars on their friendships.

Maybe this would be good. Maybe looking into getting certified for water transport would allow them to at least get a steady stream of contracts that they could live on. Not that Camy would be happy with him. Somehow she had both seemed upset that he wasn’t getting enough but if the opportunity came up with smaller companies, she seemed put off that he got work. It didn’t matter if she had anything for him at that time. 

Laying back down, Stanley thought to himself that maybe it was time to let the crazy cat lady go and find a new sky that they could fly in.
