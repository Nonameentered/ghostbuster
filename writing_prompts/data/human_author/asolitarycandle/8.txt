It took every ounce of my willpower to say all that correctly in an unblinking state of focus. My material hummed as I spoke but to my disappointment only stayed on the ground around me. What had I done wrong? I went back over my notes as the crowd seemed to get bored with my unheard handwaving. 

I spent a good couple of minutes staring blankly at my book when I saw it. Scribbling in a closing bracket into my code, I got ready for attempt number two knowing that at least if this went right the second part should be fun. 

“Healer Mack?” the announcer asked as I doubled checked each of the end conditions, “are you going to attack your pillars?”

I only gave them a thumbs up and began my spell again.

“Activate fire missiles on target placement at one-hundred-fifty feet, target core material, Cellulose and target specified material, triglyceride with impurities. Conditional parameters. Condition one. If the oil wavelength reflects photons at six-hundred-eighty nanometers with a variance of fifty nanometers then strike the compound. End Condition One. Condition Two. If the oil wavelength reflects photons at six-hundred nanometers with a variance of fifty nanometers then strike the compound. End Condition Two. Condition three. If the oil wavelength reflects photons at five-hundred-twenty nanometers with a variance of twenty-five nanometers then strike the compound. **End Condition Three.** End Conditions. Spell release.”

My fire rose like fireflies into the air, swarmed like bees after their nest had been attacked, and landed like guidance missiles. Every aspect of the pillars took a simultaneous beating where the red, orange, and teal oil paint had been. Only holes now remained. What sound was left in the crowd stopped in a moment and even the waterfall seemed to get quieter. 

“What was that!” the announcer argued with someone. Was it me? Was I supposed to answer that? I am not sure how I could standing where I was. I watched as panic started to ripple out as the announcer asked, “Do we accept that? Did he hit them? He hit them! How’d he hit them? Could he hit us with that spell?”

That’s… that’s not how they were supposed to react. The big finale I had planned was suddenly very questionable. Maybe this wasn’t the time to show them what a thermonuclear detonation looked like.
