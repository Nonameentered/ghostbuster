None of the doors had locks anymore and some of the doors had been lost to time. Amos entered through the back with the staff entrance. Hidden on the hillside, never maintained but the granddaughter never cared about the help. Quietly, carefully, he stalked one of them through a hallway running from the kitchen to the lounge. A quiet word with his dagger and one went down without even realising Amos was with him at all.

The next was more difficult. Demon was presenting himself to his captive crowd of townsfolk. Mimicking her with her mirrors all angled so he could see the full extent of his plumage. Lavish coat, pressed trousers, and enough jewellery to make the Old Empires King look like a Pawn Shop Pedler. Amos walked around the mirrors from behind but was caught off guard when one of the captive squealed when he saw him. 

“Is that Amos!” the demon asked in a flamboyant sarcasm. You don't get to forget your age without becoming somewhat of a legend, “Sebastian! We have a guest!”

Two shots were fired as whatever this thing was walked out from behind the mirror. Amos was already behind a wall, ready with his Colts out. At least, he thought he was. There was that old ting sound that he hated so much and three seconds of agonising silence. The north wall gave way in a flash and a bang louder than a landslide. Amos was okay; shell shocked and nearly deaf in one ear but okay. 

Looking round the corner he saw the stars of silver shrapnel embedded in the wall. The demons chuckle was less interesting but more useful. Two shots went wide as Amos came out. The townspeople screamed as Amos unloaded four shots from his Colts, Ki and Viktor, at the demon. Two were close, one scratched the things leg as he moved, and the last missed by a good measure. Eight left.

The demon grabbed Bill, good man and an old mechanic from town. Amos tried to get the moments he had shared with Bill out of his head as the demon dragged him away. Three shots, two from Ki and one from Viktor, missed the thing by a small margin. Down a stairway Amos found Bill's head next to where he had left what he now assumed was Sebastian. Five left.

The basement was not tended well. It had been where the heiresses staff had lived and even back then it was never kept very well. The staff had tried, mind you, but the quality of the building was really poor. It was loud down here or possibly quiet; Amos’ ears were still ringing. 

“You killed him?” Amos could make out the demon's voice. It had lost a lot of the charm it had had earlier. Shocking that it had actually cared about something other than itself. Two shots left Ki in an attempt to get the thing around a corner. Two more left Viktor when that failed. Only one was left with Viktor.

“You betrayer!” it yelled, firing recklessly into the darkness at Amos. Most of them missed but one burned through Amos’ shoulder. Amos responded with the last of what Viktor had only to have it go wide and hit the glass bar behind the thing. All that he had now was his dagger, Gabriel, and his short sword, Julien. It was named after his teacher who had told him a sword will never go empty or jam. Gabriel was always more helpful though.

A growling noise came from the corner. The demon must have been out as well. Not surprising though considering how poorly this thing acted. Probably only a century old. Almost sad to think that even with all his gifts that he would die no different than most of the humans he lorded over. Germans had a word for the satisfaction Amos felt for it though.

The thing moved like lightning and in an instant was at Amos. Gabriel tried his best to connect with the things arm but was blocked and knocked out of Amos’ hand in a frenzy of poorly delivered attacks. Maybe the thing had survived just through luck alone? Amos reached back for the only friend he had left, if you could call Julien a friend, and jabbed upwards and twisted. The demon went limp. All was quiet once again.

Back upstairs the townspeople screamed when Amos rounded the corner but stopped when they saw him. He wasn’t really well liked but a sight after those things. Many of them just cried that it was over. Amos did his best to tend the injured and wrap up any supplies he could find. It wasn’t until one gasped that he had taken stock of himself.

Behind him stood one of the heiresses' full length mirrors. Amos regardless of his age looked like he was mid forties. Short brown hair, brown eyes, and a lean body had been with him throughout the ages. His clothes were for use only as he had difficulty caring about the style of any one time. Gabriel, Viktor, and Ki were all by his side and a twisted Julien was on his back. 

It would have been nice to see himself. Probably the first time in at least a decade that he’d had the chance to but with all the lavishness in the heiresses’ estate of course her mirrors would be silver. The townspeople were even less thrilled about it.
