People have asked me in the past why I choose my line of work. I always answered, I didn’t. Cleaning up other people's messes wasn’t something you really choose to do, it was something that you either fell into or were forced to do and then discovered you were good at it. I was never great at it. Half a dozen cops and a couple of agents came close to figuring out who I was but their leads always seemed to end up missing after a time.

Well, that’s only partially true, the money in it was good. People didn’t like to get their clothes dirty let alone their hands. Punks that wanted to pursue a cleaning career were worse. They always sounded like they were some hero in some story. The people that hired me wanted me to clean like it was a hospital or maybe a government building. Nothing special, no one really saw you, and at the end of the day, you aren’t talked about.

I had ten good years of cleaning professionally and then a couple of off ones. I told my boss that old injuries were keeping me from doing a good job and that I wanted to train a replacement. He was disappointed, as expected, but agreed nonetheless. A half dozen rejects, a couple of punks, and one weird dude that watched way too much television later and I found my ticket out. He was nice, it only cost me a tattoo and a brick.

I think I went north because I always seemed to go south to work. Not that I didn’t travel in any other direction, it’s just the boss always seemed to need something cleaned up with the gentlemen that live south of us. It doesn’t matter anymore anyway. I keep tabs on them but the media always seems to paint them in rather colourful tones.

As for the agents and the police, I heard from one source that they were relieved to see me go. One even came to my funeral. Pretty sure he was disappointed when all that was left of me was someone else’s bones. I sort of miss being, I don’t know, interesting. You know?

That being said, I made my little home to make sure that I wouldn’t be anymore. People don’t come here to work anyway. They come to retire in quiet and in peace and with enough space not to be bothered. That and not having too many questions about why I have so many guns. They are, of course, for hunting. I shot a buck last year at 2K just to see if I still could. 

“Anyway, my name is Robert,” I finished off my little intro to the circle in front of me. It was a forlorn retelling but I think it was important. Life had become I guess less than it had been before and I think it was the same for the guys in front of me, “I was hooked for thirteen years and I have been clean for nine. Life has a way of making questions out of long sought after answers and if any of you were cleaners, like me, then I think I can help.”

“Cleaner’s keep secrets,” a gentleman, younger than me but burned to the point of old age, stated, “Secrets are easier kept alone.”

“They are,” I agreed with a nod, “I have given you part of my secret in trust but I don’t expect anyone to share theirs. This is about support for the future, not about dredging up history.”

The group of men in front of me stared, cold as ever, at their marks. It was interesting to see what they picked. Some were straight-up wanting a large mess to clean up but others stared at parts that would be more about finesse. I preferred people’s shoulders.

“This like AA?” a stout man from the side asked bluntly.

“Ish-,” I started but didn’t even get my hesitation out.

“Don’t like AA,” the man interrupted immediately, “You want my money for whiskey, fine. You want my time for feelings, fuck off.”

“There’s five of you now,” I said with a sigh before stating clearly, “What I want is for my retirement to stay clean before I have to clean it up.”

Everyone seemed to shift, rolling onto a hip for access to whatever they wanted. The stout man, the burned one and a taller thinner man, open carried. Their revolvers were old and reliable. The fourth, a fit but older fifties man had a small piece on his ankle. The last I didn’t know about but it had to be some sort of knife. 

“You want trouble?” the burned one asked.

“I want trouble to stay where we left it,” I explained, “I want the answers we sought to be enough.”

“That’s easy to say,” the taller man said with some trouble, “Made sense before.”

“It can make sense now,” I offered, “In the last nine years, the thing I miss most is the rules. Do x, y happens. Ask why and x happens again. I miss the challenges.”

“You play boss you mean,” the tall man scoffed.

“I play keeper,” I explained, “Schedule, offer, and supply. Unlike before though you can say no.”

“What are you scheduling?” the stout man asked.

“Paintball?” I offered, “maybe airsoft matches with youngsters. Something to get us moving without aggravating old memories.”

“I can get myself to firing range just fine,” the stout man argued.

“You can get yourself a blended scotch just fine as well,” I explained, thinking of the cheap bottle he kept coming in to drink, “It’s not what we do, it’s that we aren’t alone doing it.”

“What if we come here to drink alone?” the fifth man asked.

“Then keep coming?” I said with a shrug, “like I said, this isn’t something that I believe should be mandatory. It’s just something that I wanted to offer so that we don’t get bored or worse.”

“If you set up paintball,” the older man said but hesitated a bit before continuing, “I’ll watch.”

“It’s a lot better than it sounds,” I explained, “it’s not just swinging a target and there’s no hesitation like there was cleaning up a kid. They annoy you, you make them cry. It’s simple.”

“Kids made you hesitate?” the fifth man asked.

“Like I said,” I admitted, “I wasn’t great at my job.”

“I wasn’t great at it either,” the stout man acknowledged.

“First time wasn’t great,” the thin man explained, “never got to be great after that one.”

“I was good enough,” the old man acknowledged, “I had one of my own though and then it got tougher.”

That got a look from the rest of us. A cleaner doesn’t really have time for family and if any of us had produced one, we certainly didn’t know about it. The old man seemed sincere though. 

“They follow you?” the thin man asked, “Cleaning?”

“No,” the old man shook his head as he spoke, “I had to clean up my mess with that one.”

“Ah,” at least three of us said with a nod as we clued in. That made a lot more sense.

“I was worried,” the fifth man said quietly, “that secret would have been dangerous not to keep.”

“Dangerous to have,” the old man said with a laugh, “dangerous to keep, and dangerous to clean up. It was fun for a while though.”

“Not worth it,” the fifth man quickly said as he shook his head, “I had that possibility removed just in case.”

“Me too,” the stout man admitted, “No points whoring while loaded.”
“I figured I’d have to give up cleaning if I went that route,” I said quietly, “I never found company in other like that appealing though.”

“Happy Belated Father’s Day though,” the fifth man celebrated, “We should drink to that.”

“Anything for shine,” the tall man muttered, sounding disgusted, “Anything but whining.”

“I’ll get your orders,” I said enthusiastically, getting up off of my seat, “and I’ll grab a pen for a wishlist for paintball. You’d all be surprised how close I can get to the things you want.”

“Probably not,” the fifth man called to me as I went to the bar.

“Custom solutions with bingo dabbers make effective close combat alternatives,” I explained as I got a couple of bottles down from the shelf.

“You weirdo’s really celebrating me making a mess of things?” the old man asked.

“Course,” the fifth man confirmed, “My old man always said, it is the things that go wrong that make life interesting.”

“My life has been interesting then,” the old man muttered and shook his head, “I just wish it wouldn’t be haunting.”

“Drinking usually makes the scars less memorable,” the stout man said as he took his glass and downed the first shot I gave him before holding it up for more.

“Maybe this should be AA,” the old man muttered.

“Not in my bar,” I scoffed, “cleaning makes dying easy. Drinking makes living easy and I’m not giving that up.”

“Stop spilling,” the tall man argued, “More filling.”

“And Happy Father’s Day,” the fifth man said as he raised his glass.

“To the best six years of my life,” the old man muttered and raised his glass as with the rest of us.
