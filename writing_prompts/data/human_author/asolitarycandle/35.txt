Sitting alone in the waiting room outside Captain Tein’s office, Sa’thoth fidgeted nervously with his research. They had arrived at 63.567, -901.673, by 5.002 earlier this cycle, to a world full of resources, and a species just beginning its journey into space. 

Captain Tein, as shown time and again, would explain to the counsel that these humans, as they called themselves, posed a threat. A grave threat. Mostly a grave threat if they actually knew how valuable some of their resources were and what a wonderful trading partner they would make to several species that Sa’thoth knew. The Dal would prosper more though because the Dal knew what they wanted.

“Two cycles Telgor!” Sa’thoth flinched in his seat at the venom that Captain Tein had for his first mate. Telgor was a well-respected strategist, second in command, and leader in his own right. The issue was that he was wrong.

The plan had been standard. Distribute food, mildly to significantly poisoned, on the path of leaders and figureheads throughout this planet with the intent of disrupting this world's government. Fairly simple but any good plan could be condensed down into its fundamentals by any effective strategist. 

Sa’thoth had warned them before it might not work.

Sa’thoth had been demoted to Assistant Researcher, Grade Three because of his persistence.

Sa’thoth had had his food rations cut when the demotion did not properly motivate him.

Now, Sa’thoth sat, waiting uncomfortably as hundreds of trillions of credits were being accounted for on the other side of the shockingly thin sliding door. Captain Tein was not happy. Sa’thoth didn’t know if that was good or bad for him as he only had a partial plan to help Captain Tein in his predicament. 

Captain Tein’s Assistant, Bo, sat stonefaced behind his desk and that man wasn’t going to be helpful to Sa’thoth at all. Bo was meticulous but antisocial. A perfect receptionist for a Captain with too many Dal that wanted his attention.

“You will give me solutions Telgor!” the captain yelled again.

“And that’s probably your cue,” Bo exclaimed, the fact that he was feigning interest was hard not to notice. 

Sa’thoth took a long breath in but instead of calming him, the fact that he was shaking as hard as he was bothered him more. He needed to show strength. Maturity. By the shells he was hatched from, this was Sa’thoth’s chance to make a name for himself. 

The little two-foot, three-inch, forty-pound lizard waddled around his seat to collect his things before heading toward the door. Grabbing his tail and squeezing it tightly for a second, Sa’thoth shook his head and decided he was brave. Terrified but what is bravery if not doing what you should in the face of terror? Captain Tein was probably going to rip Sa’thoth’s newly grown, green little tail off… again but that’s fine. Sa’thoth thought to himself that he would just have to spend ship rotations in the med bay. He’d still make a name for himself.

“Sa’thoth!” Telgor yelled.

“I can’t do this,” Sa’thoth whimpered to himself as he turned away from Captain Tein’s door.

“Not an option,” Bo muttered to himself.

Two things happened simultaneously, first was Sa’thoth was lifted off the floor of the ship by a gravity lift and second was the door to Captain Tein’s office opened with a loud hiss. Or maybe it was Sa’thoth that hissed. No, he was pretty sure the small whine that was made was him. Either way, Sa’thoth was floated into the room and passed a smiling Bo in a couple of heartbeats.

“Your plan involves this weak-shelled, gross little slimball?” Captain Tein asked Telgor even before Sa’thoth was placed gently in front of the very colourful green and yellow Captain and his strong, dark green Second. Looking at Sa’thoth, Captain Tein gave a deep and powerful command of, “Speak.”

“Yes-Sir Your-Worthyness, I-found-a-reference-to-their-mythology-thing-and… umm… they,” Sa’thoth wasn’t sure if this would help him or hurt him, “These creatures, they umm, they clean their food sirs.”

“What?” Captain Tein and Telgor said in unison.

“Their mythology sirs,” Sa’thoth quickly got into what he had found, “they… are very particular about what they eat.”

“Why?” Captain Tein asked, now sounding rather confused. No species cared about what they eat. If it was food, they ate it.

“Ah, yes, see,” Sa’thoth stumbled over his words as he grabbed his work, “Humans, as they call themselves, have not eradicated contagions yet.”

“I thought you said these creatures had weak immune systems,” Captain Tein growled at Telgor.

“They do,” Sa’thoth answered for Telgor to his own horror, “They have adapted to it though. They set their food on fire, freeze it in a cold box, salt it, dry it, and most of all, only eat the holy parts of their prey.” 

“What are holy parts?” Telgor asked.

“No idea,” Sa’thoth admitted, “Probably ones that don’t kill them.”

“So we have an entire species, no an entire weak-shelled planet filled with thin-scaled morons and we can’t poison them?” Captain Tein asked loudly.

“Well, no,” Sa’thoth admitted but added, “common folk have a source of sustenance that is considered potentially tainted already but it is not considered worthy of their elite.”

“And what’s this sustenance called?” Telgor asked.

“Commonly referred to as, umm,” Sa’thoth suddenly wasn’t sure of the name and had to check. Finding it, he read out his notes, “Street meat. It has regional names with varying degrees of contamination. Chipot-”

“I don’t care,” Captain Tein interrupted, “How does this help?”

“Well, Sa’thoth?” Telgor asked loudly when Sa’thoth didn’t answer.

“I… umm,” Sa’thoth tried his best to think but grabbed his tail in fear, “Well if their food supply isn’t an option… then… maybe contaminating their drinking fluid would work?”

Captain Tein didn’t seem impressed but Telgor glanced around the room in thought.

“They regularly drink poison though,” Sa’thoth hedged, “and eat it for entertainment. Ethyl alcohol, capsaicin, menthol-”

“Shut it, Sa’thoth,” Telgor interrupted, “before you waste what little use you have.”

“Sorry-sir,” Sa’thoth snapped to attention. Was that a compliment? From the Telgor?

“What are you thinking Telgor?” Captain Tein asked impatiently.

“Well, sir, you aren’t going to like it,” Telgor explained, “And I’ll have to go over Sa’thoth’s notes myself but we may have to just make a treaty with them.”

“Are you going soft on me Telgor?” Captain Tein hissed.

“No sir,” Telgor responded quickly, “With this new information, it may not be wise to spend any more resources risking a potential partner when the prize we want isn’t achievable. We can’t have war with a fledgling society.”

“True,” Captain Tein quietly admitted before nodding to himself and explaining, “Queen U’lan wouldn’t expect it of us to make a treaty either. Diplomacy may be a stripe in my favour.”

“May even stop her from calling our ship,” Telgor muttered to himself, “the Unbreedables.”

“What?” Sa’thoth scoffed. The Queen, glory to her rule, would never say something so vile. Would she? Wait, was Sa’thoth considered unbreedable? 

“Fold Sa’thoth into your team,” Captain Tein instructed.

“That’s quite a promotion sir,” Telgor scoffed, glancing at Sa’thoth’s incredibly happy face.

“You shouldn’t have said something classified then,” Captain Tein explained, turning to his monitor and turning it back on, “Or let an assistant researcher learn more than you had as your Captain’s Commanding Strategist.”

“Sir,” Telgor scoffed.

“Or rebuked his claims early in our mission,” Captain Tein continued before looking up at Telgor and saying, “Take a sample from him, he may be an Unbreedable but at least on your team, you can all pretend to be.”

Both were pushed out of the room, without another word by use of the mag lift. It was a humiliating way to be kicked out of Captain Tein’s office but Sa’thoth didn’t care. He was getting a promotion, a big one at that, probably a new living quarter, and breeding rights! He had always dreamed he’d get there one day but never at the young age of fifty-three. 

“So?” Sa’thoth asked excitedly, looking over at Telgor, “What do I do?”

“Pack your shell and scales and meet me in Wing 3-23,” Telgor explained.

“I’ve never been to floor three,” Sa’thoth whispered to himself but looked up sheepishly at Telgor and asked, “And the other thing? Umm, do I go to the med bay or-”

Sa’thoth heard a horrible tearing noise as Telgor interrupted Sa’thoth’s rambling question in the least pleasant way he could. As Telgor walked away without another word, he swung Sa’thoth’s now detached tail so that it wouldn’t dirty his uniform. Though in quite a bit of pain, Sa’thoth nodded in Telgors direction.

“Glad to be of service,” Sa’thoth whimpered, wishing he could comfort himself but knowing not to touch where his tail had been.
