Flying used to be a skill before all the switches and buttons let you relax. It was odd to live through the transition. Please, by no means think that it still isn’t a skill but it’s now a different type of skill. The computers and gadgets, lights and indicators, communication and information have changed the game extensively. It’s not like outflying someone anymore. It’s nowhere near the war where you had only a couple of bobbles, a stick, and your soul to keep you up.

For Captain Jamie Oswald waking up was always a struggle. Coming out of her memories, her nightmares, was an experience that had taken some of her friends. She wore earplugs to make sure a misplaced noise wouldn’t bring too much back. She wore a mask to make sure no light caught her the wrong way would remind her of the fire. She liked to wake up chilly.

Her routine was simple, a glass of water to start the morning off right before having a shower and making her coffee and oatmeal. She pressed her uniform, combed her hair, and cleaned everything she could. She lived alone so there wasn’t much. It had been this way for going on a decade now and her routines brought her stability and peace of mind.

Today was simple, a there and back trip to one of the coastal cities with two stops there and three coming back. Should be home after dinner, thankfully. She’d be able to get food from the plane and not have to cook. At least her coffee was good. Not hard to make that when you have trouble making much of anything for yourself. After she finished up she put the Gin bottle back on the shelf but then, with a groan, put it in the recycling.

“Good morning, Captain,” her attendant, a chipper bitch, said in that upbeat, almost whimsical intonation. The plane was going over the final checklists and passengers were boarding.

“Morning, Jasmine,” Jamie said professionally. She hated her but couldn’t get another write-up this year, “All set?”

“Yes, Captain,” Jasmine said with a smile.

“Thank you,” Jamie said, nodded, and headed into her cabin. She had her own lists to go over before heading out.

“Do you think it’s legal,” Pat, Jamie’s co-pilot, said as Jamie sat down, “whatever she’s on?”

“I hope not,” Jamie muttered, “or if it is it probably has a list of side effects that would make death seem appealing.”

“More than it already is?” Pat said with a laugh. Jamie chuckled quietly at it but tried not to make it more than it was.

Take off, and everything before take-off for that matter went surprisingly smooth. Usually, there is something unruly happening in the back, one of the engines decides that it doesn’t like how it’s feeling or some other benign nonsense. Jamie didn’t like it. Something always goes wrong and she always preferred it to go wrong on the ground.

The air was calm today and there were very few clouds. Not all that surprising as she was flying over the midwest and it was mostly plains below her. It wasn’t really until she got to the mountains that she expected the air to change. Radar seemed good too. There was no one around her at the moment and her path was fairly clear. She felt like that was off though as wasn’t 436 supposed to be close to them around now?

Getting into the foothills she finally let out a sigh she didn’t know she was holding in when a brief amount of turbulence bounced the plane. Pat was quick with the radio but Jasmine popped her head in to check anyway. Always does, that one. Not that she shouldn’t. Jamie hated to think it but Jasmine was actually fairly good at her job. A shudder ripped through her for it though.

“What’s with Flight 180?” Pat muttered, checking over the radar.

“What?” Jamie asked, “Why?”

“They have just been sitting there,” Pat explained, “must be something wrong with the radar. It doesn’t even look like they are moving.”

“This is why I want things to go wrong on the ground,” Jamie explained, coldly, “things always go wrong.”

There were more bumps in the next half an hour than there had been the previous month of flying. Every single one Jamie groaned at but at least Jasmine stopped coming to check after the third. Pat had told her it’s just the weather; nothing to worry about. At least, hopefully, nothing to worry about. If the radar was off then maybe these other stupid things are off.

It was sunny out at least. Mountains always seemed better when you could see them. Today was no different. Most of them were still frosted but the trees were coming in nicely. Even with the occasional bounce, it was still an okay trip.
