Under a swinging ashen grey sign was a door filled with laughter and song as the twilight hours of the evening faded. Intricately carved figures of dragons and men danced together in the dark wood as small puffs of smoke pushed their way through carved holes bringing the dragon's menacing figures to life. A lute started up as another round was poured and pewter mugs clanked together.

“Another!” the crowd shouted to a finely dressed man on stage. The backdrop had been commissioned and had taken almost a year to carve. Wood flowed like water, over carven channels and down out into the hall as winged figures in the back flew above the stage.

“What do y’all want me to sing next?” the man laughed as he lifted his mug. Secretly, it was filled with water up to the crowd.

White noise rushed him as voices intermixed with the roar of the fire at the back and the sounds of the kitchen behind that. It was hard to think with the air so filled with smoke but Ballad the Bard wasn’t daunted by the task. He listened, well learned to listen past everything to what he wanted to hear.

Shouts for the Tale of the Sirens call went unnoticed. A sad song of lost love and hopelessness on the sea but they weren’t there and this wasn’t a loveless night. The Great King Alford’s Demise went the same way. Ballad needed something of a crescendo. A jig maybe? That seemed about right.

“The Dragon Squires Tale!” he picked out from the crowd and with a point and a laugh he agreed. Standing tall and lifting his lute, Ballad started to stamp his foot till the crowd joined in. He called out, “The Dragon Squires Tale it shall be!”

A cheer went out but the crowd quickly quieted down as Ballad led the rhythmic stamping and clapping.

&#x200B;

*Oh! There, once was a squire*

*That could never fly higher*

*Than the scales of red and green.*

&#x200B;

*For he once played a tune*

*At a quarter to noon*

*But his prize was left unseen.*

&#x200B;

*He waited and watched*

*Thinking his plan was botched*

*Till a screech shook this canteen.*

&#x200B;

*To everyone's surprise,*

*The dragons outside*

*Weren’t a part of the squire's routine.*

&#x200B;

*Now, the fire in their eyes*

*Bolstered this man's pride,*

*As he tried to reclaim the scene.*

&#x200B;

*A smile and a word,*

*That was better left unheard,*

*Made him look like foreign cuisine*

&#x200B;

*But loathed did the lizard did learn,*

*That the squire did earn,*

*The faith of their only queen.*

&#x200B;

*So with a gust and a flap,*

*They never came back,*

*Leaving the squire in the latrine.*

&#x200B;

*And now we sing and we dance*

*For this man's romance,*

*Means the kingdom knows what we’ve seen!*

&#x200B;

With the merry chorus of the hall with him, Ballad repeated the last verse a couple of times before sitting back down on his chair and putting his lute back on its stand. Nudging his case toward the hall, Ballad raised his glass, finished his water and gave the bartender a knowing nod.

“That’s all for now!” Ballad called out with his mug in hand before explaining, “I need another!”

Cheers and laughter filled the air and then descended back into drunken conversations about the land and love. Many here had made the journey for the Bonfire Celebration and to hear the story of the Dragon Squires Canteen. Not that many hadn’t heard the song.

The old castle that they were a part of was now more of a massive inn rather than a serious outpost. At least, that is what Ballad had always told himself. Once upon a time, these walls meant security and protection for the neighbouring settlements but the Decade War ended far from here.

Passing through the crowd, Ballad patted and hugged more than a family’s worth of strangers and partygoers. Maxim, the bartender looked rough when Ballad got to him. The brute of a man had poured more ale probably today than he had in the past week and the evening was just getting underway.

“May I get a Ballad’s Special?” Ballad asked loudly as Maxim put another set of mugs on his soaking sticky table. Ballad knew not to touch it.

“The little squire can get his own special,” Maxim grunted as he glared at Ballad before being pushed out of the way by a woman even smaller than Ballad. Fiery red hair flowed past her shoulders and down her back but next to the large man, this maiden looked like a toothpick in a dress.

“Careful now, Maxim, or the dragon's fire may appear again,” the woman chuckled and got Ballad his brew.

“Could you?” Maxim scoffed, “I need a break as much as you two do.”

“My queen deserves more than a break,” Ballad whispered as he ignored the warnings of the table and leaned in to kiss the fiery women behind the bar, “My queen deserves the world.”

“Your queen wants a happy tavern,” the woman corrected, “and for you to stop calling our home a canteen.”

“It goes with the song,” Ballad countered as he got back up with his mug in hand.

His queen gave a hiss and a small breath of fire as he walked away but he knew he’d be forever in her heart. The song was never about changing a dragon's heart. That day was actually just a morning and the only dragon that Ballad had enchanted had scolded him for hours. She taught him what he knew now though and over the years the Dragon Song that he had been taught to him turned into a romance that changed him forever.
