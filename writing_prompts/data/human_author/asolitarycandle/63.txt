To be fair, it wasn’t like I spoke up right away nor did I try to voice my profession after even an adjacently medically trained person offered. There was simply no one on this plane that could handle the trauma that a cockpit blowout had caused. The pilot was dead, the co-pilot had a lacerated femoral artery and a total amputation of his left arm just above his elbow. He was leaking bad enough that he’d be running low soon.

The whistling of the breach behind me was all that could be heard in the cabin. About fifty-some people were shoved into this ancient airborne tube with little respect for personal space. No one seemed to know what to do with the offer other than a dozen who said a quiet prayer to themselves. Weirdly, it wasn’t all the ones with visible pendants. I never understood that aspect of mainstream faith. 

Belzog never wanted to be mentioned, by me or anyone in the practice. Before the War of the Ancients, as he calls it at least, he had been a lot more visible and communicated freely the meaninglessness of death. Why let a body rot when it still has potential when your soul has left?

“Okay,” the flight attendant that had yelled tried her best not to sound utterly exhausted by my offer but failed. Looking around quickly she added, “Maybe keep an eye on him,” to someone beside her.

“Well!” another lady stood up resolutely and announced as she produced a vial of something from her bag, “I’m not supposed to have this on board but if the satan man can speak I can sacrifice my essentials for this.”

“Essentials?” the flight attendant asked, now confused.

“My oils,” the lady answered like it was obvious.

“Sit down,” the flight attendant demanded to the women but looked at me and loudly added, “Both of you!”

“Not like I can do anything right now anyway,” I muttered to myself as I sat back down and poured myself another glass of wine as the plane hit a rough bit of turbulence.

To be honest, I wasn’t really sure who was flying at this point. I had heard before that the computer guidance system had been knocked out entirely and we were entirely on manual backup until someone got it back up. The captain was brainless at this point so there was nothing I could do with him but with the co-pilot’s nervous system still intact I’d be able to pull information out of him once he passed. 

A quick descent, caused by more turbulence and an inexperienced pilot, turned into a rocking motion that eventually levelled out. I listened to the screams mildly amused by the sudden impact of the four or five dozen people in front of me suddenly trying to understand mortality. It was cute. Had they been good enough or whatever kept floating around with more calls for medical experience.

My master always gave me a weird sort of clarity when it came to the afterlife, mine was to be in his service. That was all I ever got. I didn’t know what I was doing or what I would be subjected to but I was told after doing level one tech support I could handle it. Not like that was a pleasant thought.

“No, Stan, stay with me!” I heard the nice attendant yell as a sudden, overpowering scent of lavender filled the cabin, making everyone cough. 

“Let me save him!” the bottle-wielding, blueberry of a human yelled as she tried her best to shimmy into the aisle. I couldn’t watch. I would start laughing if I watched and I doubted anyone wanted to hear that.

“Miss!” the attendant yelled back, “Sit down!”

“No,” the lady argued as something was shoved or pushed over. 

“Oh, it’s in my mouth!” someone else yelled before more than a couple of people started gagging into their coughs.

Another jerky descent and a burst of fresh air shut most people up. The cockpit door opened in a burst of air and noise that cut through everything and everyone. If something had been said before the door closed again, I wasn’t able to hear it nor anything else until my ears repressurised. 

“Well, you're a necromancer,” a cocky, almost desperate chuckle came from in front of me after my hearing returned.

“So I am,” I stated as I stood. 

No one really paid me much mind as I went to grab my bag out of the overhead compartment. It was sort of a good thing I was going to a convention considering it was really the only time I would put up with airport security thoroughly going through my stuff. I pulled a couple of long pins out of my bag along with my wand, focus, and enough powdered Stysl crystal to resurrect this poor fool.

Something was said at some point that must have defeated most of the passengers enough to have them either stand in front of their seats or have them sit and try and text loved ones. The aisle was almost empty. The lavender lady was being pushed into the door we had all entered through but calmed down when I picked up her empty bottle and handed it back to her.

“My turn?” I asked as I stood over the body of what was once the co-pilot. The attendant looked miserable but shrugged.

“Why not?“ she muttered exhaustedly before adding, “We all are going to die anyway.”

“Eventually, yes,” I agreed as I reached down and tried to rummage through the dead man's pressed dress pants. It wasn’t personal. I needed his ID.

“Could you at least be respectful?” the attendant asked as I held up the little plastic card I was looking for. 

“Can’t do this without his binding words,” I explained. It was technically his name but binding words always sounded better. 

“Oh, good,” the attendant muttered miserably, “God help us.”

Ignoring her remark, not like anyone onboard was a skilled enough practitioner to be of use, I poured enough of the crushed onto my subject to satisfy my estimates. Magic wasn’t an exact science by any means. Basically, depending on the body, the energy required varied radically both in start-up cost and maintenance. No harm being a little overzealous this time. With his ID in hand, I started the reanimation process.

“Stanley Malcolm Tilsen,” I stated loudly as I plunged the two pins that I was holding into the man’s chest. Aimed at his spine the two would act as a bridge between the crystals and his organs. Feeling the two heat up, I stood back up and commanded, “Rise.”

Much to the shock of the attendant, Stanly did jerk away from me but without a noise rose to attention. There was a silence in the cabin that there hadn’t been any other time before as the other passengers got a glimpse of Mr. Tilsen breathlessly still leaking out the last of his life on the low pile carpet below all of us. I loved my job. Something about the stunning silence always amused me even if I could never take credit afterwards. 

That was part of the deal to be truthful. I got to touch the sticky mess of what was left of the captain, poor Mr. Tilsen got to land the plane with the help of magic, and no one ever got to remember what happened or myself. The essential oils lady would of course credit herself but newspapers and online media would declare it a miracle sacrifice of the co-pilot. Then they would forget it as quickly as it had happened. 

Belzog be blessed.
