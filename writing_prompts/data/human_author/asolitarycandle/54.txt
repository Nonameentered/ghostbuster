“Hey, Jerry?” I said into my phone after a couple of minutes away from my computer.

“I swear man if you want me back in-game right now,” Jerry groaned, “I’m not doing it without being bribed with cash.”

“No,” I said quietly, “Yeah, sorry about today. It went a lot longer than I expected but, hey, have you ever done a Mr. Murdermittens quest?”

“No,” Jerry tried his best to stifle a laugh but couldn’t quite keep it contained, “that sounds funny but I don’t care what the quest name is, I’m not helping.”

“I think it’s solo,” I muttered, maybe half truthful, “It’s just really messed up.”

“Dead family in the basement messed up?” Jerry asked, “or like that cannibal one in Southpale Vale?”

“You’d like it messed up,” I chuckled, Jerry loved horror games, “Zombies, blood notes, and I’m pretty sure there are going to be vampires next. You have to find some old guy’s cat.”

“Mr. Murdermittens,” Jerry muttered quietly before chuckling and saying, “Okay, that sounds funny. Are you getting the creeps from it or why are you calling me?”

“This is going to sound stupid,” I said hesitantly, “Is the building across from us still under construction or is there people living in it?”

“Walls are up but they haven’t started the insides,” Jerry explained, “Should be selling at the start of the fall with completion next summer. You reconsidering getting one with me?”

“That’s what I thought,” I said quietly into the phone, “and no, I can’t afford a condo. It’s just I swear I saw this cat on one of the balconies. Like staring into my apartment.”

“You’re seeing shit,” Jerry scoffed, “Like a cat could probably get up high enough to see into mine but you’re like way up. You probably saw something like construction equipment or something.”

“Or something,” I muttered. Glancing at the game, I took a deep breath and said, “Yeah, I’m probably freaking myself out.”

“Go for a walk, man,” Jerry said but clicked his teeth and added, “In real life, not in game.” 

“I will,” I agreed but said my goodbyes and hung up before finishing the sentence, “once I’m done this stupid quest.”

Sitting back down, I waited for my character to finish opening the large circular door and took another sip of Danny’s weirdly sweet beer. A loud thud echoed through the game loud enough that I took off my headphones entirely just to see if something had moved in real life. Hearing nothing after a couple of seconds I put them back on and continued. My place was a mess. Even if it had been something, it was most likely a pot in the kitchen slipping further into my sink.

On the other side of the door, the game changed from dull, dark greys and greens of moss and stonework into pillared columns and wider halls with a redder hue. It was probably supposed to look like granite but with the torches, it looked a bit more sinister. 

“Bobby, I swear, if you ask who light’s all these torches again, I will hit you,” I muttered to myself, hearing my friend's voice inside my head as I eased myself forward. 

Good guy but he could not keep any plot hole or inconsistency to himself. I just liked believing what I saw was meant to be. Most of these games were meant to be just enjoyed and not a literary staple that would survive beyond a playthrough. In my mind, most MMOs were more like 80’s soap operas than high fantasy novels they tried to base themselves on.

“One of these quests is not like the others though,” I quietly sang to myself as I thought. 

Noises, mostly falling stones or some far-off splashes, scared me a couple of times while I snuck through the open passageway. I couldn’t tell if the noise was supposed to be coming from in front of me or behind me. Any time I angled my character so that my headphones could give me a direction, everything returned back to silence. 

Everything was quiet. I must have snuck down passageways for close to half an hour trying to find out where I was going but the quest marker always just said go forward. Somewhere in this emptiness had to be something. 

“Where are my vampires?” I whispered to myself as I came up on another turn. 

A flicker went through my screen but didn’t stay long enough to be a worry. Four vampires, looked like Dread-Wings, casually walking around an open room with an arch on the far end made the worry very present. Groaning quietly to myself, I turned my character back around the corner and swore. These things would be a nightmare.

Breathing deep, I glanced out the window just in time to see a black blur whip through the building across the street. I couldn’t see exactly what it was but it small and moving fast. Frustratingly, it was out of sight before I could focus. Shaking my head and frowning, I looked back in game only to hear a pop and then a loud crash ripple through me.

“What the fuck was that?” I asked loudly, now taking off my headphones and getting up. 

It had to be something in the kitchen and sure enough when I got there, one of my large pots on the floor. Shaking my head hard, I almost growled to myself in my stupidity. Why was I letting this quest get to me like this? It’s not like today was all that hard and I didn’t have any tests coming up.

“Too much coffee,” I muttered as I tidied up a bit and went back into the living room, “No more two pot days for… what on earth?”

As I was walking back to my computer, I watched what had to have been that black cat walk from one condo window to another like they were all connected. It was quick but I could see it. Like it was there, just walking along at a gentle pace but warping between windows. When it walked passed where I could see, I tried to follow it anyway, mouth open and eyes wide.

“That can’t have been real,” I muttered and rubbed my eyes hard before going and sitting back down at my desk. I took a quick drink and then added, “Mr. Murdermittens needs to slow down a bit.” Grunting, I changed my mind, “that’s not Mr. Murdermittens, that’s just a trespassing cat. Oh lord, I’d rather face vampires at this point than a teleporting cat.”

Turning the corner again as stealthfully as I could, I was met with something that I really didn’t want to see. Four vampires, probably Dread-Wings based on the black blood, were now spiked to the pillars and a bright light emanating from the arch along the back. The words from the poem came back to me and I swore over and over again until I took a rather hissing breath in.

“A twisting fate beyond the portal,” I whispered and bit my lip, trying to bring myself to push my character forward. Glancing at my mouse and then my keyboard, I said, “Well, it’s not like I’m stopping now.”
