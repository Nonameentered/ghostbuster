Part 2

“Dalton, for conspiring with the Wharton family against guild interests,” Bruce, Hiss had finally managed to remember the man’s name, announced as he held the thin ginger man up in the air for all to see, “Your membership is stripped and you know what happens if any of us see you again in the establishment.”

A round of sneers and cheers went up with multiple calls for him to return so that the guild could have some fun with him. Hiss watched safely from his corner though sitting on the second gold coin in his hoard. Every traitor that he had found he had been promised a coin. To his pleasure, this one was shiny. His other probably started as such but a life in the trade had scratched and tarnished it beyond measure.

Bruce had specifically gotten this one out of the king's treasury for him. Cost a gold and a half but Bruce said it was worth the motivation and Hiss admitted that he had become motivated after seeing it. Granted, he was also motivated by seeing Dalton’s name on the list of suspected traitors. No more glares from that idiot for Hiss ever again.

“Wait!” Dalton yelled as Bruce dragged him to the door, “Who’s the Sod who sold me out!? I don’t get paid enough for you lot to deem where I moonlight.”

“New guy,” Bruce announced, “Had a whole lot of very specific information about what you were doing. And you want coin? How do we earn it?”

“We do the job!” a roar went up in the common hall that actually made Hiss flinch. He hissed at the peasantry beneath him for good measure.

“And you never did yours well,” Bruce said loud enough for everyone to hear as he pushed Dalton out the door, “Probably did the same for the Wharton’s. Good luck with them.”

More sneers followed as Bruce shut the door not waiting to see Dalton get up off the gravel road just outside. The hall seemed weirdly cheerful at the spectacle in Hiss’ opinion. He was sure exactly what to make of it. For some reason, he had believed that humans were a lot more social than his kind were but this event was downright Draconic.

“Let that be a warning to anyone else who goes against this family,” Bruce announced as he walked back through the hall, “and a reward to any of those who want to work where Dalton did not!”

“He have anything good?” a short, stout, incredibly bearded man asked while leaning back on his chair. When Hiss had first arrived here, he had suspected that he had been the leader due to that feature. A flair that humans probably had that indicated dominance much like Hiss’ horns, or scale colour, or the length of his tail spikes. Hiss smiled to himself at the thought of how much of his body matched his power. He sneered at the side of the wall when he remember how small he was now. 

Hiss didn’t hear Bruce’s response but he didn’t need to. Dalton had two outstanding jobs with St. Arther’s. One was mostly about information gathering in the neighbouring city of Tillan, which didn’t really pay for the meals required to be there. The other was scouting, actual honest work, for the army. They paid mostly locals if the area wasn’t under threat but close to enemy nations.

In his head, he played with the idea of actually taking the second job himself. Even with his size he could cover ground far faster and easier than any of the men that Bruce had in St. Arther’s. That and at night he was both silent and invisible. Even if one were to look up, he was a small black shape among the stars.

Slipping into the walls, Hiss climbed his way back up to his cave in the wall next to Bruce’s room one story up. The walls weren’t as hollow as some other places but there were still some pathways the tiny dragon was able to slip through and listen in. Dalton’s shared room had walls with wing stretching space and a whole bunch of fluff that Hiss was able to rest on as he listened. Maxis had that room now. Bruce was sure Maxis was going to be the next one out.

The little black dragon didn’t really care about the lives or goings on of any of the members other than Bruce. Hiss did want to get paid so having at least some interest in the man helped. From what Hiss could gather, the man had been married at one point but had lost her and his child somehow. Hiss wondered if he should visit his hatchlings if he ever got back to his regular size. Not that Hiss knew where to find them or really what they looked like. Should he know what they look like? He had flown into one of his mates and she had told him their names but Hiss couldn’t seem to remember them. That had been some decades ago.

Hiss shook himself at the nonsense he was thinking and popped his head out of the hole in Bruce’s room to check on the work board. No one had taken the scouting trip and once again, Hiss was thinking of signing up himself. It paid five silver, which being silver wasn’t great but it would get him outside. Looking around the rest of the room, Hiss bit his tongue gently as he thought but didn’t act.

Four days of watching Maxis lead to exactly zero useful information on whether he was a traitor or not. It bothered Hiss to on end considering that Dalton had basically confessed a couple hours into his first day with Hiss in his wall. The little black dragon was disappointed in that fact but had to admit with the amount of children the man was trying to create he wondered if Maxis had any time at all for moonlighting. 

Bruce entered his room as Hiss was lounging, half hidden inside his cave near the ceiling. Hiss had been waiting. Bruce didn’t seem to notice the new name scrolled on the parchment on his desk but Hiss gave him time. Not that the little dragon could write all that well now that the pen was basically the same size as himself.

“I'm doing the scout job,” Hiss declared when Bruce didn’t seem to notice, “Tonight.”

“Are you?” Bruce asked quietly as he finally looked at the parchment, “I thought you were looking after our project? Who did you scribble out?”

“Every night, Maxis makes me feel lonely,” Hiss admitted, “ He isn’t saying anything other than some weird prayer.”

“Oh,” Bruce muttered, glancing at Hiss quickly before looking back down at the parchment, “Do we have a Besmo?”

“That’s me,” Hiss continued, “Or it was me. Long ago. Don’t tell anyone,” Hiss switched into a threatening tone before saying, “That pain in the tail wizard might come looking for his prized pet.”

“Guild doesn’t need that,” Bruce quietly agreed, “You okay with Hiss?”

“No,” Hiss scoffed at the question before quietly muttering, “He won’t find me this way if you use it. I can outsmart some young upstart using cheap tricks as his go to.”

“Well, do what you want,” Bruce made a note on the parchment, “Try and find something on the scout though or the commander will ask questions.”

Hiss returned that night well informed, covered in blood but not his own, and in significantly better spirits. Not that it would be easy to tell if a black dragon was covered in any dark liquid in the noonday sun. Other than the trophy he carried with him, Hiss’ only tell was he making little paw prints in the wood.

“Okay, what’s with the owl head?” Bruce asked as Hiss struggled to cram the thing into his cave.

“It’s mine!” Hiss announced as he let the thing go. He was going to try and see if he could pull the fresh trophy in instead of push but ended up dropping it to the floor. Bruce only watched as the thing bounced and rolled before saying, “I don’t want that thing rotting in my wall.”

“I do,” Hiss argued, “I won it.”

“Yeah, and if you’re going to keep it I’ll get it stuffed,” Bruce muttered as he quickly reached out and grabbed the head before Hiss could land on the floor.

“Thief!” Hiss yelled out as he tried to bite Bruce’s hand.

“Hey, no!” Bruce yelled back at him, “You’ll get it back.”

“Of course I will,” Hiss argued, “No one steals from me.”

“I’m not stealing your prize,” Bruce argued, getting up and keeping the head away from Hiss, “I’m getting it stuffed so that it stays a prize longer.”

“It’s a head,” Hiss said as he tried to take back his prize, “I don’t have much time with it regardless.”

“I can give you more,” Bruce said, “The ones downstairs have been there for years.”

“I can give you a face full of poison,” Hiss shot back before hearing Bruce fully. He paused and glared at the man for a second before asking, “Wait, what? You can do that to my prize?”

“Yes, of course. Just don’t bite me,” Bruce said as he grabbed a towel and put the head down on it, “Where did you win this thing?”

“Obviously the owl,” Hiss said, flabbergasted that the man didn’t understand how basic combat worked but excitedly explained, “Thing made me feel like a hatchling again, it was so big and silent. Coming back, I felt it more than heard it try and get me but I dived when I felt the air move. When I was big, these things were just annoying puffballs but now it’s three times the size and infinitely more fun. Bigger talons, sharper beak, and smart but I still won its mug for my cave.”

“Yeah, good to know,” Hiss watched Bruce flinch away when Hiss smiled and mutter, “May send you out hunting more often.”

“That would be sublime,” Hiss agreed, “Is there any other creatures that are like this one?”

“Many,” Bruce admitted, Hiss wasn’t sure why but the man almost sounded regretful.

“Yay,” Hiss whispered to himself. Maybe being small did come with some benefit.
