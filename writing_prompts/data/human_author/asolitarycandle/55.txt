I took a quick shower to try and clear my head before going back to the game. Ms. Cho must have put a rush on my order as there was a knock on my door before I was able to even sit back down. The food was always great, probably a bit saltier than in other places but it meant I didn’t need any soy sauce. 

The cat never left. It sat on the railing of a balcony over twenty stories off the ground just watching my side of the building. Technically, at that distance, it could have been watching someone else. I couldn’t make myself believe that but it sort of helped to think that I was just over-caffeinated. 

I woke my computer up from sleep after finishing my noodles and vegetables and logged back into the game. Picking up the piece of paper that I had written on as it loaded, I reread the inscription. The “watching from your window” part was still rather uncomfortable but the cat across the street had to be a fluke.

“Oh come on,” I muttered as I stared at my screen, character center stage and the inscribed wall across from me now missing the inscription. 

This was well done enough not to be funny anymore. How would they even program that? Maybe it just toggles in and out of existence every half hour or something. Unlike Ms. Cho’s comment, my note was still there and still very visible. At least I had confirmation that it was there.

Looking close at the flickering, grey stone walls of the crypt, I couldn’t even see where the writing had been. Gone were the days of single graphics layers where the artist would have to hide the writing within the stone itself. I had to believe it was a transparency over something. 

The crypt was dark, save of course the torch’s flickering light scaring the shadows away. The sharp edges of the walls and pillars cut off whatever was hidden within. Square stone floors always made me worry about traps but with a little magic and a ring of protection, I walked on. Had to find this cat before it found me.

“What? no,” I muttered to myself and glanced out the window to the nowempty balcony across the street. Shaking my head, I continued, “See, just someone’s cat.”

I had to believe I had been playing this game too long. Random cat, disappearing text in-game, and Ms. Cho’s comment wasn’t helping but if I had encountered any of that this morning, well, I would have been impressed. I should be studying. I would probably be at the library tomorrow anyway and whatever this was would be an interesting memory.

Two corridors down from the entrance, the quest marker floated in the corner of a fairly large room with four crypts in the center. Crouching down, I opened up my journal to see if there was anything else for this room but found the only objective active was, “Follow Mr. Murdermittens.”

“Okay,” I muttered to my screen as I crouched and started to carefully make my way forward.

The tiles below me changed from the dull grey in the hallways to a more moss-covered version. The deep green was hard to see as the flickering light of the torches above me but every once in a while they would shine bright enough for it to come through. I stayed on the tiles that I could see just to be safe but some had little emblems that I didn’t recognise. Backtracking twice, I finally made it to the other side where the marker was and searched for whatever it was I needed.

“You have found an unknown hand,” I muttered to myself as the item screen came up with a gaunt but well done hand. It had sharp painted nails and was a bit too pale to be anything other than what I was thinking. “Vampires.”

If there was anything in this game that I tried to avoid, the almost impossible to kill vampires were right up there with anything larger than a dragon. Deceptively small, the stupid things healed far too quickly to be soloable. This was definitely made to be a stealth quest.

Turning back around, I hesitated to move as it would probably activate whatever was in the crypts but was met with a different surprise. There in front of me, blood red script repeated the same little poem that I had gotten before. I quickly took a screenshot of it this time just in case and then sat and waited for it to disappear. This was too good not to have something recorded of it.

Ten minutes of eating my food as I watched the screen proved nothing. The writing stayed where it was and exactly as it had been. No morphing or fading. Sighing to myself, I pulled up a browser and tried to check out if the quest had any guides up on it yet to pass the time. Sadly, it was a search that ended up with nothing. Either this quest was new enough that no one had written about it yet or stupid enough that no one wanted to. Turning back to the game, the writing was gone.

“Ha!” I yelled and pointed, taking another screenshot, “I got you.”

Feeling proud now, I crept forward and finished the puzzle on the tile floor. If I was going to have to sneak past vampires in the future I didn’t want to get caught in one of these hallways making noise. It made for slow going but the spawn point was so far back that I worried about trying to get back to my body.

Hallways turned into a couple of flooded passages and then into a puzzle locked door. The intricate, brass or possibly gold design had concentric circles of patterns. Somewhere in the passage had to be the answer and it was usually obvious enough that an eight year playing could understand it. This time it wasn’t. There was nothing.

Spinning the circles a couple of times didn’t help either. The outside ring was completely filled with gibberish whereas the inside ring was almost empty. I couldn’t make heads or tails of what it was saying or trying to hide. Backing up, everything seemed to blur together even with my resolution set to Ultra until I saw something that made me stand up.

There, in the rings, was starting to appear the poem. At the top was a half faded, “He’s watching from your window,” line, now done up in a blocky, almost rune-like script. The second line was almost unreadable but I could guess what it said. 

I got a beer out of the fridge, one of Danny’s but it would do. I could not believe how anxious I was with this stupid game. How much coffee had I had today? Maybe a pot? Actually, it was probably two. I think I remember making a second one around lunch.

“Let’s do this,” I quietly muttered to myself as I sat back with my beer, took a swig and went back and forth in order to see if I could get all the writing to appear. When it finally appeared I whispered what it said, “He’s watching from your window. A twisting fate beyond the portal. A wasted life in limbo. You should be careful what you do, mortal.”

I sat back in my chair heavily and brought back out the screenshot that I had from the second time I saw the poem. To my surprise, maybe a bit to my horror, it was different as well. Not as much as this one. The second one only changed the last line to, “You should be careful what you see, mortal.”

“That’s fantastic,” I said to my screen as I took another screenshot. Had to have this one in the records. Hopefully, it will be just as well done in the morning.
