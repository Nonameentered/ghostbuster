“Yes,” you growl, a chilling rumble in your voice as the slurred word falls well below a bass. You feel it. The strength of your lungs, once constantly irritated by the very air you breathe, now desire more than you can consume. 

Closing your eyes, you notice the wind sweeping through the trees like never before. The near-constant buzzing of your ears is gone and replaced by the noise of insects skittering around. Focus. Leaping, leaves crackling under something then twigs, and then a clarity that something warm is moving away.

Your claws find dirt and air before your consciousness calculates where you are going. Cold. You feel cold. Not an uncomfortable, sicking cold or a chilling cold but a note that your body is only warming up to what it is capable of doing. Trees, branches, and bushes don’t seem to care. Bushes and shrubs can’t seem to get out of your way as you run but no matter, a small knock for you tears them from the ground for others to deal with.

Prey. You need to find it. Your teeth ache as drool flows out of your mouth as you rush up a hill, gaining on the now heaving creature. Another tree you dodge, another boulder climb over, and there, in your sight now, a deer. Venison, once tasted at a corporate retreat, will be experienced again with a fresh perspective. Climbing the top of the hill, you leap right before a tree to grab ahold of your prey. Claws flexing, paws digging but not finding ground.

You feel dizzy before the soreness of your chest hits you as hard as the tree did.

“You shouldn’t run before you walked a path,” a clear but deep voice explains from the darkness of the wood around you.
