It is never easy being small. Everyone has the literal ability to look down on you, see what you’re doing, and think it would be so much easier for them. The same is true for Flo as for any other creature. At barely a foot in length, Flo is a true Dragon of unfortunate length and size. Abandoned by her mother, who assumed that she wouldn’t survive, Flo had lived a life of isolation from her kin. 

Though she could easily be mistaken for a pseudodragon by up and coming wizards and sorcerers she managed to avoid all of the attempts to bind her as a familiar. This was not some small feat as one would probably assume. A fully telepathic, tiny creature would be the envy of every court mage in the country. By hiding quietly though she had avoided the King’s Conquest of the Eastern Outlands, the Mages Guild’s multiple fact-finding missions to the heart of the Old Forest, and one moron with a sword who kept trying to charm her with poisoned berries. She did tell him they were poison but his multiple, incredibly loud prayers to seemingly every deity in existence was evidence that it was not heeded.

Decades past and the forest seemed to be getting smaller. Shepards and farmers kept coming deeper and deeper into her homeland and eventually, she decided to fly to somewhere that was quieter. Wild boars were fine to avoid but farm pigs were hard to stomach. She settled in the forest near the mountain line about a two days flight for her for a while. Moving again when the tree she was perched in was cut down a mere six years later. 

She couldn’t remember a time when a day’s flight wouldn’t cross more than a couple of villages. Where did they all come from? How did they all get here? True dragons did really care about time after they survived being a hatchling but this was absurd. Flo was barely into her fifties and her home had changed so much. What were these peasants? She learned a couple of months later that they were, in fact, actual peasants. Much to her annoyance. They were escaping some war in the south.

Her reconnaissance inside the village of Twin Rivers wasn’t all for frustration though. On a sign, posted to a crudely done board, was a help wanted advertisement for a runner and it offered compensation in silver. Rather startled that humans would just give out silver for tasks Flo decide to inquire, much to the shock of the mayor, about such duties. Mostly it was letters that needed to be picked up or delivered to the Lords Keep some four days ride from the town. Flo delivered them that evening, hugging them tightly as she flew, and having only dropped them twice. 

That evening, for the first time in her life, Flo went to sleep on a treasure. Her treasure. A dragon that was never supposed to survive had in fact lived into her sixties and was now sleeping on top of her treasure. Flo had never been happier in her life than she was at that moment.

The next day was a little trickier. The Lord’s mage was a piece of work and tried to capture her to study, possibly enslave her but sharp teeth and claws do come in handy. Also, the bag he used was at best a potato sack, not canvas. She left him with a scar that he boasted the rest of his life about. Got it from a real dragon he did.

Figuring she didn’t want to risk any more untrusty mages, Flo settled down outside Twin Rivers and did odd jobs around the Village. Mostly it was the part-time blacksmith as he could boast that his forge was fueled by Dragon’s Fire. The village grew to the point where the two of them moved into full-time work and the Green Dragon’s Forge made the best farming tools this side of Alberg’s Lake. 

It wasn’t a hard job, breath fire into this huge metal thingy and flap your wings a couple of times and the big man seemed to be happy with you. It wasn’t until the Lord wanted the forge to extend into weaponry that it became problematic. Flo tried her best but years of work, building swords for the war had taken a toll on her. She eventually asked if she could move to just lite the forge in the morning, to which the blacksmith agreed. The two purchased a quality set of bellows that month and she saw her investment flourish. 

The day she was able to trade her silver into a single gold coin, minted by the King’s men, was another milestone of her life. It wasn’t long actually until she had her second and third. The blacksmith’s bellows and reputation had grown in the war and he took on multiple apprentices. The Green Dragon’s Seal was something every aspiring smith wanted to have.

Flo though found she wanted to be back in the thick of things after a while and did something she never thought she’d do. She spent her treasure. Not her first silver or gold but a good portion of it to buy a small shop, with a stone oven, and enough room for about a dozen tables. Something about the oven spoke to her and she played in the fire for quite some time those first few days. 

The family that was selling the cafe she kept on but changed the menu around. In the morning she would hunt for duck and bring it back to sell. One at a time was fairly difficult but they didn’t really have many customers in the beginning. She bought spices that smelt like fire and had them make drinks out of it. Eventually, she collected more and more of what the humans called books and learned what they would exchange for their copper and sometimes silver with. 

Twin Rivers continued to grow, the street outside became cobblestone, and the cafe offered outdoor seating on days it wasn’t raining. Flo stayed in the oven the days that it was. Awful thing rain was to Flo. She tried to make those days happier though to the people that came in and traded their treasure to her. Maybe they didn’t like it either. 

“Mistress Flo?” Albert asked tentatively. He was the grandson of the original owner she had purchased the cafe from. Lively man, Flo thought, hoping she was thinking of the right person. People looked remarkably similar.

*“Yes?”* Flo responded from inside the oven, *“has the rain stopped?”*

“No, Mistress,” Albert said quickly, “I found a recipe I think you might like. It’s from the Northerners by the sea.”

*“It isn’t fish again?”* Flo asked sharply. The rain made her cranky and the fire wasn’t helping today.

“No, Mistress,” Albert said, “it’s a dessert the Northern’s finish by searing the top with fire.”

Flo was interested. She was even “saunter out of the oven” interested. She completely forgot that she was now eight hundred degrees though and Albert quickly moved the fragile, extremely flammable paper the recipe was written on out of the way. With a bit of a frown, she told him just to read it to him while she made plans in her head about how best to use this information. 

They called it, "Creme Brulee" in the north. At the Green Dragon Cafe though it was forever known as the secret "Crème Draconienne," which you had to order by name and pay the same gold that Flo made the dessert. 

The night that the first one had sold, sold to a master mage no less, Flo had slept as soundly as the nights of her first gold and silver coins. A master mage had been in her home, respecting her space, eating her food, and giving her gold. The coin he gave her went on her favorite pile, in her lair under the oven with her other favorite coins.  She always loved to hide away in her tiny cafe that served the dragon's creme brulee.
