*Death and Dungeons*

Pain makes the idea of the end seem like a lot less of a thing than most would assume. I was scared of dying, it’s just that it was hard to keep living the way I had been. I wish it wasn’t this way but I remember their faces the most. There was the breaking of reality in many of their eyes. Wasn’t I supposed to be there much longer than I was? 

Thirty-five was long enough though for me. I had been depressed most of my life and then diagnosed with stage four brain cancer. No, it wasn’t the reason I was depressed. I was mildly deaf because of it but other than that it wasn’t noticeable and that’s why it had gotten to the point it had. Treatment, if anyone could have called it that, had been a faith-breaking experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone.

In the end, there wasn’t a light, music, or guidance. It was just a weird cold sensation and a long drawn-out tone when the machines I was attached to stopped beeping. Was it weird to be excited? No more tubes, no more pain, and no more crying. It didn’t matter if oblivion awaited me. I had already gotten used to the hell that was the desperate attempt to keep me alive. Worst case going forward, at least in my mind, was I’d wake up somewhere else and certain tubes would still be there.

I fell into darkness. Time seemed to stretch and bend around me as I floated dark pastels of a lifeless forest and over a river of ink. For the first time in years, the air felt soft, cool, and flowed through me without strain or struggle. I smiled. I was mildly concerned when I heard the crackle of fire but when the world came back into view I was in a small cabin, painless and detached.

“Good morning,” a soft but deep voice beside me gently tried to get my attention. Putting a hand up to my nose and mouth I had to feel what it was like to once again not have anything there. The man put a hand on my shoulder and I looked over at a shockingly well-armoured soldier.

“Umm?” I flinched back and the soldier sat back to give me space. The worst flashed through my head as I tried to make sense of what I saw. Grimacing as I looked around me, I muttered, “shit.”

“Hey, it’s okay,” the soldier tried lifted his hands away from what I saw as a sword beside him, “I’m Pete. This is going to be a bit of a shock but you're dead. It’s okay though.”

“I’m in Hell,” I muttered as I scrambled back.

“No!” Pete quickly before hedging, “I mean we can go there but I wouldn’t recommend it until you level up a couple of times.”

I froze, stunned at that offer or explanation. I wasn’t sure what it was. Turning around, I must have given Pete a face confused enough to make him question what he was doing because he started trying to dig through his pack. Pulling out a modern-day-looking binder, he started flipping through it and then held it up to show me.

“You played RPGs right?” Pete asked and offered me the binder, “I mean that’s sort of why we got you.”

“What do you mean you got me?” I asked, trying to read the paper at a distance. Little squares and bordered sections looked like stat blocks.

“Oh, it’s umm, It’s a little weird here,” Pete tried to explain, putting the binder down with a bit of clanking in front of me, “You go where you are the most passionate, do what you are most capable of, and choices have a lot of power on what happens.”

I grabbed the plastic binder and read like I hadn’t since college. It was stat blocks. Mine. Why did I only have a nine in constitution? No wait, cancer. That sort of makes sense. Ten was average so, I guess, considering what I went through I should be happy that it wasn’t lower.

“Ten is average here, right?” I asked, suddenly doubting myself.

“If that’s what you play, yes,” Pete said with a nod, “Everything sort of warps into what you understand. Pretty cool, right? Like what are you speaking?”

“English?” I asked back.

“I’m not,” Pete chuckled, “German.”

“Okay, but this isn’t hell right?” I asked.

“No, this is Wildmount,” Pete explained, “That’s what we call it at least. There’s a lot of wildlife here and all of it hates you but they are easy to deal with.”

“Okay,” I muttered and nodded quickly, “But like… This is… I’m dead?”

“Yeah,” Pete said slower and frowned, “I’m sorry. It’s hard for everyone. The good news is though you will probably see your family again and you are back to being healthy.”

“What’s the bad news?” I asked, glancing at the stat blocks in my hand and back up at Pete.

“Sort of depends,” Pete explained, “Do you have any combat training?”

“What? No,” I scoffed, “I was tech support.”


“Oh, so sort of,” Pete exclaimed with a smile, “Good. Did you ever want to hit anyone?”

“Like every day,” I admitted. There was a little shame in that but there was also a barrage of memories of me having to deal with overconfident idiots. 

“With what?” Pete asked.

“A hammer,” I muttered. 

I had one in mind too. It was this sledge from the shop that we use to call the hard format button. The poor thing was ancient and slightly rusted but, good lord, it was heavy. Any hard drive that we needed to be wiped and recycled got a couple of good wacks. 

“Good choice,” Pete said with a smile.

Like me, the sledge now in my hands felt new but felt like I had always known it. This thing had been my stress relief and my entertainment over the quiet weeks of the summer and in the dark halls during the late winter. I couldn’t help but smile. I hadn’t seen this thing since I went on disability years ago. With it back in my hands, I felt a strength I hadn’t had since I was a kid. 

“This is real right?” I felt my cheeks hurt I was smiling so hard as I asked it. No more pain, no more tubes, and I got my hard format button back. It was exciting.

“Real is subjective here,” Pete explained but nodded, “You are real, I am real, that mimic behind you is real but-”

“Mimic?” I basically yelled and years of late nights with my friends flooded my mind. We always started this way. A mimic hiding in the corner, disguised as something basic, and usually with a potion hidden inside it. I swung the button harder than I ever had in real life and without all the pain that had followed me for so long. 

I had my body back.
