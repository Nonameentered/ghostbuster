Merry Saturday everyone!

My writing space is honestly just wherever I am. I have a desk set up at home and my laptop has a little seat thing with a fan but I’m usually writing when I have time. My tools have changed over the years. When I’m on the go, I have an MX Keys Mini connected to my iPhone using Google Docs. For editing, Apple has a speech-to-text thing that I use to polish my work or I pull out my laptop and use one of the natural readers on it. I have been writing on my phone since before smartphones. 

This is going to date me a bit but way back I had a Palm m100 that I wrote on using documents-to-go to get the format into Word. I miss that keyboard. It folded up into this solid little brick of plastic and lasted longer than anything I have had since. I sort of miss the magic that was that 100x130 px screen too. It was such a leap forward back then. For me, at least.

Nostalgia aside, I try and spend a couple of hours a week writing. It doesn’t have to be any one space or on any one goal. I have learned a lot about my limits in writing since joining this space close to two years ago. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of it and to the mods who do so much work keeping this space so inviting.

Hope everyone is doing well!
