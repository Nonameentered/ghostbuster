“Good evening,” I announced to the room of zoned-out, partially drunk members, “I see some new faces in the room. To you, welcome and thank you for taking the time and energy to be here. I also see some returning faces. As always, thank you for your continued dedication to this journey. Lastly, I see some faces I haven’t seen in a long time. To you, my friends, know this is not failure or weakness. Tonight is about recognising your strength to walk this path.”
  

  
When I used to picture vampires in my head, I saw luxury and agelessness. Maybe boredom. Most of all I saw the fabled strength beyond measure. The ability and the will to dominate and break anything and anyone that had the misfortune of becoming a barrier. Greatness. Immortality. A beast that no cage could hold.
  

  
What I became, what we all became, was just a vessel of pain. Instead of filling our cups to the point of overflowing, Vampirism just knocked out the bottom. We couldn’t die but we never started living. Blood was only a bandage to a burn mark that covered our bodies. One small drop of fresh water in an ocean of time.
  

  
“As most of you know, my name is Pete,” I continued. The new turns chuckled with some of the older members,“ and as most of you have pointed out to me on a number of occasions, that’s not a vampire name. That’s fine. As always, there’s a lot that I have rejected since turning.”
  

  
The room, which Northward College thankfully allows me to rent weekly without too many questions, smelt like bleach. It was my job to clean the building and I cleaned it well. This room, every Thursday night, I cleaned it especially well. No need to tempt fate and all that.
  

  
Small town, small college, small human population and thankfully most wouldn’t be missed if something went wrong. Not to be offensive to any of them. It’s just the mining town was in the middle of nowhere, with very limited internet, and has had no mine in two decades. Those who could leave, have left and those who have stayed were either one of us, living on the outskirts of civilization or warm bodies that most of us wouldn’t touch with a stick. For me, I’d still wear gloves if I touched one of them with a stick.
  

  
“I am not a vegan,” I stated, nodding, “I have no qualms about killing or murder or whatever ethics this world has thrown at us. No, I’m here, standing here to say that I’m an addict. Blood, that fresh crimson, coppery tasting bliss is my drug and I haven’t had it in thirty-two hundred and sixty-four days. Why? Because it’s not worth it. That high isn’t worth weeks of withdrawal. Years, if I remember one of your stories correctly, if you kill without mercy.”
  

  
“You tell ‘em,” a voice cheered from the back. It was Macron, an ancient french aristocrat before he was found. He had wisdom beyond my comprehension but always choose to support rather than speak.
  

  
“Frenchmen are weak,” a bitter voice, one well-known scoffed back to Macron. 
  

  
The newcomers tensed for a moment. Someone somewhere wrote on the dangers of slighting a vampire after they had been invited into your dwelling. Castles crumbled and buildings burned and all that. Northward College still stood though. 
  

  
“We all have sides,” I said, trying to keep the peace, “and we all have battles within us. In this room, we talk about them and we acknowledge that the words of others may not be what we want to hear. To fight though means we have already lost. Right Sydney?”
  

  
“It’s fine Pete,” Sydney muttered, sneering at me but still giving a half nod in acknowledgement.
  

  
“And we try to keep our words as caring as we can,” I continued.
  

  
“Yes Pete,” Sydney muttered without a prompt. We had done this what I would have considered a lifetime before.
  

  
“Okay then,” I announced with a smile as looked down at my empty lap. Expecting to see my cards, warn and bent through the years, I hesitated to try to refind my place without them. Closing my eyes, I asked, “Where was I?”
  

  
“You ain’t teh vegan?” Daniels’ sharp voice cut through the room, making most laugh.
  

  
“Right, no I prefer a nice cut of venison,” I explained with a laugh, “Rosemary and garlic, cooked to perfection. That’s the trick in all of this. Cooking and eating can still be enjoyable, hunting can still be thrilling, and living, even after death, can be satisfying. There are many ways to achieve this. Some find religion and admit they are powerless, some find the power within themselves, and some find it in the power of others.”
  

  
The newcomers looked at each other sceptically. Blood gave us the power to become living gods for as much as an hour. The first time is longer but even after a decade away it never comes back at full strength. We know what to expect. It makes it less.
  

  
“My name is Pete, I am an addict,” I stated to the group.
  

  
“Hi Pete,” came a few responses from the crowd. 
  

  
“My goal is to live my life mindfully,” I explained, “The path in front of me, I offer to all of you. The path behind me is filled with reminders that there is no such thing as rock bottom. There is only death, which is no longer available to us, and the base on which we choose to build our foundation. No matter the darkness you have surrounded yourself with, know that you are among those who don’t need light to flourish and grow.”
