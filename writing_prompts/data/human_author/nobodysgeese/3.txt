**A Sure Cure**

"A meal most sospital, to keep you from the hospital."

I eyed the pulsating prandicle dubiously. "From what arcane bromography did you pull this insane recipe?"

My wife shrugged. "Joblers cannot be choosers, you nobbler."

I didn't expect to live forever, but I did intend to hang on as long as possible. I ate.

As I finished, I felt somewhat better, my illness' pain receding a little. I mumbled, "We're a strange pair, aren't we, honey bear?"

"I love you too, my s'more," she agreed, whisking the plate away as my eyes drifted shut. "But I love life insurance more."
