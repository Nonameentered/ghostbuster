His sister was baking at a frantic pace. Joey stood on his toes, but couldn't quite make out what was on the counter.

"Em, I wanna help."

She didn't look away from her stirring. "Sorry, Joey, not today, I'm trying to finish before Mom and Dad get back."

"Please?"

Emma grabbed a box instead of replying, and he slowly turned away. As she measured, however, she said, "Can you, uh, double check that there's butter in the fridge?"

Joey grinned and ran to get a stool.

Mom and Dad said the cookies were delicious. Joey rolled his eyes. They *always* said that whenever Emma baked, even when it was too salty or under-cooked or burnt.

But this time, instead of her usual 'thank you', Emma smiled and put a hand on his shoulder. "They should taste good, I had a great helper."

As Mom hugged him, Joey thought that it was strange how he could tell that their parents really believed their compliments today.
