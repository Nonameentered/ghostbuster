<2/3>

You become aware again at dawn standing at the edge of the forest with blood staining your fingers. You turn, but there is no trail to follow back in. Nausea roils in your stomach as you wonder what you killed, dearly hoping it wasn't a 'whom', instead. A voice in your head seems offended at the thought, but you push it aside.

The next full moon, you take precautions. You lock yourself in basement, with silver-coated bars on the door and windows. In the morning, you awake sore, with your werewolf's voice grumbling angrily in the back of your mind. From gouges on the walls, you can tell the ache was from your exertions trying to escape. But it worked! You didn't kill anything or anyone, and you plan on doing it again next full moon.

Still shaky, you make your way down the driveway and open the morning paper. It falls from numb fingers a moment later, the headline burned into your memory. "Five dead, mauled in forest, rangers suspect bear." The werewolf rumbles again, and you understand it this time even without words.

*Why didn't you let me stop them again?*
