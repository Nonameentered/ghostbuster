**Applied Misanthropy**

My client said, "The manor's *perfect*. Benches preventing sitting, standing in opposition to their original intent."

*Why yes,* I mentally agreed, *I* am *a great architect.*

"And the fences!"

I said, "Electricity dissuades climbers. Legally, it's to prevent crime."

"Standing in opposition to- Actually, no, that's just a better normal fence."

*I'm an incredible architect*.

"And surveillance! Controlling the approaches..."

I disregarded their words, absorbing the *feeling* of praise.

"...overall, a misanthropic masterpiece!"

*I'm the* best *architect*.

But exiting the poisonous gate, a screech followed me. "You weren't supposed to do the inside!"

Oops.

*I'm still a decent enough architect.*
