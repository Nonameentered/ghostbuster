## Three Cheese Blend

It was a cold day in Italy's May when Napoleon decided that it was time to crush the Austrian forces. We would, of course, win the battle as always, but it was the night before, dear reader, to which I must draw your attention.

It was the second watch of the night, and Private Denis and I were huddled behind the storage wagons, filled with supplies ~~taken~~ ~~stolen~~ ~~acquired~~ *liberated* from the locals. We kept a close eye on the river Adda, infrequently lit by the flash of artillery, to make sure the perfidious enemy could not sabotage the only bridge.

Denis, terrible man that he was, turned to me and said, "Quiet night, is it not, Citizen?" It was not, of course, even before he provoked fate so egregiously. And when he spoke those words, it became even less serene. The Austrian artillery, guided by the malignant hand of fate, fired again. But this time, the shell dipped early, missing Napoleon's army entirely and landing in the river. Or so it would have, if not for the American merchant vessel blocking the way to the water.

A deafening roar filled the night, and bits of ship and cargo flew through the air. Poor Pierre was awoken when a steak, the rest of the cow still attached, landed on his foot. Louis and Thomas would never look at an apple pie again without a flashback to this terrible day. And Denis, stalwart man that he was, did not even flinch when a crate of Americanized (that is to say, *ruined*) cheese landed in front of us and exploded on impact with the ground.

Cheddar and pepper jack flew everywhere, coating us from head to toe, and contaminating the liberated food supplies we were guarding.

I remember little of what followed, dear reader. But come morning, our beautiful mozzarella was too thoroughly mixed to separate. As the ones who failed to guard it, Denis and I were assigned to taste-test the new mix.

I thought I was die, dear reader. The cusp of the cream of the crop of Italy, blended with the crust of the crud of the crap from America. We were given a baguette, in some small act of mercy, and we melted the cheese upon it in the hopes of choking it down quicker.

But we survived! And the flavors so explosively combined had a surprisingly good taste, the mediocrity of cheddar, the bite of pepper jack, and the smoothness of mozzarella working together better than anyone could have imagined. So if you are feeling patriotic, fellow Citizens, try some of this war-time recipe for your culinary consumption!
