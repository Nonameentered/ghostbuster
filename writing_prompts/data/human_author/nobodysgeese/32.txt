**Beheading, Murder, and Pumpkin Trafficking**

The State of Massachusetts, Department of Melons, Gourds and Root Vegetables (Excluding Carrots) vs. Mr. Horseman

The prosecution contends the following facts, and the defendant declined to hire a counsel to dispute them:  
1: On the 31st of October (hereafter 'Halloween'), Mr. Headless Horseman was murdering mortals at night in Connecticut.  
2: In the course of this slaughtering, a stray flailing leg damaged the pumpkin he uses as a head.  
3: The accused ceased his slaughtering and turned to a nearby farm, where he procured a replacement pumpkin without payment.  
4: Prosthetic produce in place, he then resumed his massacre until dawn, crossing the border into Massachusetts around 4:00 AM.  
5: Despite numerous attempts over a month, the court was unable to serve Mr. Horseman, and he decapitated his court-appointed representatives twice.

THEREFORE, after careful deliberation, the State of Massachusetts charged Mr. Horseman with and found him guilty of the following two charges *in absentia*:   
1: Theft; the pumpkin in question being non-prize-winning but still aesthetically pleasing, this charge is raised to Grand Theft Pumpkin of the second degree.  
2: Smuggling stolen property across state lines; when combined with Mr. Horseman's lack of a gourd-trading license, this charge is raised to aggravated gourd smuggling.

Thus, this court bans Mr. Horseman from importing gourds or being a harbinger of death in the State of Massachusetts, even on Halloween, for 99 years.

Signed on the first of December, 1831, by the Honorable Judge Williamson, Fifth Massachusetts Circuit Court of the Department of Melons, Gourds and Root Vegetables (Excluding Carrots)
