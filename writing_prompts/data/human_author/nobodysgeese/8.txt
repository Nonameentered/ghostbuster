**Part 2/2**

I blinked.

I blinked again and rubbed my ears.

I turned to the wizard, who seemed most likely to give me a straight answer. "Jason, is Greg's account accurate? Did you just meet up during some unspecified disaster in a tavern, and decide not to split up?"

He nodded as if that made sense, "Yes. We fought together well."

"But most of you don't even like each other!" 

The bard shook his head at me in disappointment. "I thought you were a therapist. You're supposed to help us *stay together*, not split us up further."

I closed my eyes and sank into my chair, face cradled in my hands. Without looking, I addressed the room in general. "Did it ever occur to any of you that there are other taverns?"

There was a gasp of realization from the wizard, but from the rest, just a confused silence.

"You could have another 'tavern incident' or even just a few drinks, meet some new people, and make a party with the ones that you like."

I opened my eyes just in time to see the priest leap to his feet, face as ecstatic as though he'd received a divine revelation. "Praise Dialga!" He shouted. "I'm free of you heathens! Free!" He was out the door a moment later.

The wizard rose next, and said, "Gentlemen. I'd say it's been a pleasure, but that would be lying. Please never speak to me again, or I will finally be able to use a fireball on you."

After a short while, the warrior poked the body. "But... what about Dave?"

"Yeah," the bard agreed. "Dave's dead, and Aiden's already run off."

I stood and looked meaningfully at the clock. "He's dead."

The bard nodded. "But we've got no one to fix him."

I headed for the door. "And necromancy is illegal. And neither of you like him. And resurrection is far, far more expensive than a grave."
