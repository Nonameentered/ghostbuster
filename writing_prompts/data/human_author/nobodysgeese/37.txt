**A Burning Desire**

“Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground and start over.” 

Lyari stared at the human for long, silent seconds before she found her voice again. "No. No, no, no, you *can't* burn it."

The human blinked. "Sure I can. Wouldn't even need fire magic. Just get some tinder and it'll go up like bonfire."

"I realize you're not an elf," Lyari said, with far more diplomacy than she thought the human deserved. "But surely even you understand that you can't set fire to the *World Tree*."

The human shrugged and started searching through his pockets. "It's big, sure, but it's still wood, isn't it?"

She'd always had an interest in outsiders, and Lyari remembered being happy when the queen had picked her as an emissary. She hadn't understood the court's looks of pity until now. "That's not the issue. It's the World Tree. It's the center of all elven religions. The more rural tribes worship it as a god. You *cannot* burn it down."

The man pulled out a flint and steel triumphantly just as she spoke. He looked at the fire starter and said, "It's a tree." Hopefully, he added, "You could grow another one."

Lyari closed her eyes and prayed to the World Tree for patience. "No. No we couldn't. No burning the World Tree."

"Fine." The man grumbled, the fire starter disappearing back into a pocket. "Well, every time you find something that doesn't work, you're a step closer to what does work. So if I can't use fire..." he slung his pack to the ground and rifled through its contents, "We'll need other anti-tree weaponry."

"No!" She shouted. "No fire. Leave. The tree. Alone."

The man pulled out a rusty ax. "You sure? It would take a while, haven't done it the long way in quite some time, but there wouldn't be any fire."

Lyari grabbed the human by the shoulders and stared into his eyes. "Listen. We called you here to kill a spider. *One* spider."

The man looked mulish. "A giant spider. 'Kill 'em with fire,' that's what my grandma always used to say. 'An' iffin you can't, destroy their homes around them to show they ain't welcome.' It forces them to immigrate, you see."

Lyari wondered when this conversation had started feeling like a battle, one in which she was the underdog. "Adventurer. Kill the spider. Only the spider. Don't kill *any* plants, and *especially* don't kill the World Tree. Do you understand?"

There was an unreasonable amount of additional hemming and hawing before the human promised to abide by her restrictions. Lyari was not inspired with confidence when the human came back with the rest of his team and asked where to start a campfire.

"Shaker of Blood," Lyari greeted the vampiric representative with relief. "Thank you for coming so quickly."

Shaker bowed. "I heard you have a spider problem in the World Tree?"

She sighed. "Actually, that was... dealt with. The last group of adventurers managed to achieve *that* much. But while the spiders are gone, there's-"

Lyari jumped and spun at the sound of leaves crunching underfoot, so similar to the crackle of flames. Her heartbeat calmed when she saw yet another fire hadn't started wherever the humans had moved today. She turned back to Shaker and whispered, "Yes, the humans killed the spiders, but now? I am haunted by humans."
