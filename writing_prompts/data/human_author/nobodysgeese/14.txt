**A Spirit of Fear**

As I fumble to get the keys into the ignition, I can't look away from the windshield. The headlights illuminate my camp and the edge of the forest, but the contrast combines with the fog to leave the rest of the woods in a deeper umbra. But I can't quite build up the courage to turn them off.

The keys slip through my fingers, and I gasp out a swear word. I scan the few trees I can pick out one more time, and make myself look away. I grab the flashlight from the passenger seat, taking several tries to get a grip on it. But when I press the button, it doesn't turn on. I look to the forest again. A pile of leaves moves, and I freeze, even as I think how foolish it is to try to hide in the only lit object for miles.
 
I try the flashlight again and again, until I smash it against the steering wheel, choking back a sob of frustrated terror. I throw it away, flinching when it strikes a window, and try to rally my scattered wits. The keys are on the floor. The floor is in utter darkness. If I stoop to feel around for them, I can't watch the forest. But if I don't get the keys, I'll be stuck here until dawn.

I don't have until dawn.

I attempt to crouch in the space, so I can look around at the same time, but it doesn't work. Swallowing around my dry throat, I drop below the level of the windows and scrabble around. I almost panic immediately at the sound of footsteps, until I recognize my heart pounding in my ears. My fingers find the keychain, but just like with the flashlight, I can't lift it in my panic. Hooking a finger through the largest ring doesn't work, wrapping my entire hand around it does nothing. Finally, in desperation I clasp it with both hands, very carefully raise it back to the ignition, and look up.

A figure is looking back at me. A single streak of red mars the otherwise blank hockey mask, and I find I can't move, not even to scream.

I came here alone, and within me, fear for my solitude battles with relief that none of my friends have to face this with me. The figure raises a flashlight and shines it at me. A bloody axe rises, and I lift my arms in futile defense. He pauses.

We stare at each other. Slowly, the axe lowers and he turns away. I blink in disbelief. He chased me through the woods, until by sheer luck I found my camp and my car, and now he's going to simply walk away?

Then it hits me that I came alone, and that was my blood upon him. And I remember that the keys fell *through* my hand. And when I was staring at him, I did so through my arms.
