##Why don't the arms look right?

I'm new to the community, but I'm pretty close to finishing my first Frankenstein. Organs are organifying, skin is covering, and after some trial and error I figured out the right direction to slot in the brain. But now that Lurch is lurching around, I can't help but notice that there's something off about the arms. Could I get some help with troubleshooting?

Are the arms on the right way?

>> I certainly hope you got that bit right. But the reason this hobby is so tricky is that a 3D body part can rotate three ways. You got up and down correct, but what about left to right, or forward and backwards?
