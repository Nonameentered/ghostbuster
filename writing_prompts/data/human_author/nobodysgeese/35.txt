***Man Versus Beast***

"Tim, it says *No Swimming*."

Tim straightened his trademark white bandana, ignoring George in favor of looking over the stretch of water he would conquer. He was a good cameraman, with an eye for the details, but he missed the big picture.

"Tim, *No Swimming - Piranhas*. There's even a stick figure being eaten."

"George, they're *aquarium* piranhas. In other words, tame." But it would look great on Tim's blog. The headlines wrote themselves: *First Across the Fish Tank of Death*, or *Man vs. Beast: Who Will Win?*

"There's another sign; *Don't Touch the Piranhas - They Are Not Pets*."

Tim rubbed his temples. It was like this every adventure. Don't swim in the snowmelt. Don't swim with the dolphins with rabies. Don't try to outswim the lava flow. And despite George's doom-saying, he was still fine, give or take a couple of toes.

And what else were hospitals for, anyway?

"I'm not petting them, I'm swimming *over* them," Tim said. 

"It also says *Don't Feed the Piranhas.*"

"I'm not feeding them either. Where would I even keep food in my swimsuit?"

Even across the length of the fish tank, Tim could hear George's gulp. "The no feeding sign has the same stick figure as the no swimming one."

Tim paused, wincing. "That's... not good."

"Oh thank heaven," George said in a rush. "We'll find somewhere safer-"

"The aquarium doesn't even have money for different stick figures. How are they going to replace the door that we broke? Whatever." Tim shook his head and concentrated on the water. "George. Camera."

A deep, performative sigh echoed across the tank, but George still said, "Three, Two, One."

Tim vanished beneath the water in a perfect dive. Only his white bandana floated back up, waving a soggy surrender in the battle of man versus beast.
