Personally, I've grown to love the advice of /u/JustLexx and /u/bookstorequeer in [this Talking Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/oewmf7/ot_talking_tuesday_tutoring_plot_building_pt_1/). When you feel like the plot and the characters are growing stale, throw in a twist. Add a new subplot to explore the world or ~~torment~~ grow your characters (or both). To that advice, I'd add that as long as you keep the subplot's end in mind, and how you're going to use it to get your story back on track, it's a very nice helpful method of getting a stalled story going again.

The other thing I like doing, although it can be unavoidably jarring, is to switch up the POV. If you've been following the main characters, give a chapter or two from the villain's perspective, or from a non-POV ally, or an especially adorable, surprisingly smart pet.
