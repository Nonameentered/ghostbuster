There have been quite a few WPs turned into books, so without more details I can't help directly. In a very quick search, here are the book announcements that mentioned being trilogies:  
[Post one](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/l0om9q/ot_thanks_to_rwritingprompts_i_spent_the_past_6/)  
[Post two](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/atvskr/ot_i_wrote_a_trilogy_based_on_a_writing_prompt/)  
[Post three](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/kxuju3/ot_two_years_ago_i_responded_to_a_prompt_youre_a/)  
[Post four](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/cypeyl/ot_ten_months_ago_i_responded_to_a_prompt_about_a/)  
If none of these are the one you're looking for, the best I can do is point you to two more links.

When authors here turn a prompt into a book, they often post a [OT] to spread the news. [Here's a list of OTs, sorted by most popular,](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/search/?q=flair%3A%22Off%20Topic%22&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=&sort=top) since the book announcements tend to get the highest upvotes under the OT flair.

[Here's a list of books](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/authors/) from authors on the subreddit. It's incomplete, since it's updated by the authors themselves if they choose to, but the series you're looking for might be there.

I hope this helps.
