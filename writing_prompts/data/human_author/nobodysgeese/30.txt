There was evil in the town, and he would find it.

The people disappearing might be explained away by a murderer, but Archmage Tharune knew to his very bones that it was more. He could taste it in the water, the tang of flowing magic turned sour. He could smell it on the breeze, the scent of summer flowers almost masking a smell he couldn't recognize, but which chilled him to the core. And worst of all, he felt it; not a constant presence, which he could analyze and track and rain down hellfire upon until it was vanquished, but an irregular, fleeting sensation of fingers trailing and breath hissing across his neck until he turned and saw nothing.

And so Tharune breathed a sigh of relief when a letter flashed into existence atop his desk, bearing the familiar seal of the Arcane Brotherhood. He opened the envelope with shaking hands, the tension flowing from him. He'd feared it would be weeks to receive help, not a mere day.

*Dear Archmage Tharune, Slayer of...*

He rolled his eyes, still riding a giddy high of relief, and skipped the formalities.

*The evidence of a problem which you provide is vague, contradictory, and matches no known magical phenomenon. Despite this, we surveyed your town thrice already and found no discrepancies. As we have told you before, lease limit future communications to issues related to the Brotherhood.*

The letter vanished in a burst or furious flame, and Tharune strode to the window. His office and workroom were on the top floor of his tower, allowing him to survey the town he was tasked with protecting as he worked. He could see the people, *his* people, scurrying about below, hunched over and hurrying about their business even in the daytime.

At night, no one moved at all anymore.

He returned to his desk and the ancient, leather-bound tomes there. *Greater Warding* was useless, he'd raised every protection already. Nothing dangerous short of a dragon could get in, and that was only if it could find the place to begin with after the illusions he'd layered to the point of excess. *The Way of Sword and Wand* he'd memorized decades ago; if he ever found the person or monster responsible, he'd certainly be able to kill it, assuming it was possible to hurt. *On a Plane Betwixt Heaven and Hell* had spells that at least let Tharune rule out angels and demons as responsible, but that left just about everything else.

Almost as if by accident, he found his eyes straying to a book on his shelf. He didn't remember removing the wards around it. It was to sit there, untouched and forgotten, unless certain bloody criteria were met. Even then, it was meant for reference, not for use.

A scream echoed up from the streets, quickly mimicked by others, and Tharune *moved*. A wave of his left hand and he was dressed in battlerobes, a beckoning gesture with his right summoned his staff, and then he teleported to the ground.

The townsfolk were fleeing, and he raised a shield as he whirled about, seeking a danger. Market stalls were overturned, and amid the cacophony he could not pick out where the first cry had come from. Soon he stood alone in the town square, except for a woman cradling an injured knee and huddled by the fountain. When no danger presented itself, Tharune walked to the woman. Eyes dancing about to avoid an ambush, he asked, "Did you see what happened? Where's the threat?"

She gritted her teeth against the pain, and he healed her with a mumbled spell. She shook her head and buried her face in her hands. "It was a child. He wanted his parents to buy him an apple. When they refused, he screamed, and it just... people panicked."

"A child," Tharune surveyed the empty square again, more slowly. "A single shout from a child and the entire town is running." 

It was a long hour of talking to people and spreading the message before the citizens would move again, and Tharune wanted to scream himself. 

Sitting at his desk, cradling a swiftly-draining flagon, he whispered, "This is no way for people to live." Unwillingly, he stared at the forbidden book again.

"No," he said to his empty office. "It isn't happening."

*But more people were going to die.*

"But I won't be the one killing them."

*They'll die just the same.*

He sagged in his chair and whispered, "But I wouldn't be the one picking the victim." 

And the thought caught in his head. *Would it be better to have one last victim, or many, many more?*

He paced over to the shelf, letting his fingers run along the rune-etched spine of the book, *Bloode Magick*. He swallowed around a suddenly dry throat as it quivered joyously under his touch. But he'd decided his course. He took the book from the shelf.

***

He chose a single man. His parents were dead, he had no romantic prospects that Tharune could find, and no dependents to be left abandoned. Tharune consciously avoided learning the man's name. The archmage teleported him into the bowels of his tower and sent him into a deep sleep. It was the least he could do, even if the book was calling for pain and fear. He was still better than that, at least. He bound the man spreadeagled in the ritual circle, six black candles flickering at the points of the star to send shadows dancing across the walls.

He turned to the page and gagged at the diagrams beside the instructions, too ghastly to be stated so clinically, step by step like any recipe. He skimmed, letting his experience pick out the crucial bits and skipping the rest. First, the chant.

The Old Tongue rolled through the chamber, mixed with the occasional word from Abyssal or Hellspeak. Tharune had hoped, when he started, that it would be a quick ritual, but when the words turned out to be a few bare sentences, he felt only worse. Surely, spending a unwilling man's life for power ought to be more effort than this? But he could feel the forces he'd summoned, poised on every side, ready to tear him to piece if another sacrifice were not offered.

At the end of the chant, Tharune skipped every intervening step and pointed at the man. A flash of magic, and he was dead. The magic around him calmed, and he could feel it waiting, some creature straddling the divide between demon and devil, *begging* for his question so that it could answer as payment for the soul.

"There is evil afoot in my town," he said, turning away from the sight of his own victim. "Show me..." he nearly said *who*, but realized he had no proof it was a person, which would waste the opportunity. "Let me know more about the deaths." It truly struck him then just how little he had prepared to become a murderer. He hadn't even thought through the question at a cost of one of his townsfolk's lives.

The creature emerged from the darkness, all sharp, jutting edges and smooth, flowing smoke. It placed a claw upon the page of the ritual, pointing to one of the steps he'd skipped. 

Tharune peered at the line. "Remembrance? A sadistic ritual indeed. I assure you I have no desire to remember this any better than I already shall."

The creature growled, and despite knowing it couldn't hurt him, Tharune took a half-step backwards. But it only pointed him to the dark corner of the room from which it had come. The archmage walked over. "What is it? What do you..."

Bones. Bones he had no memory of placing there. Entire human skeletons, jumbled together.

Why had he dared change blood magic, as if he had experience? It wasn't a spell to keep the ritual in mind, it was to not forget it *entirely.*

Tharune barely remembered to dismiss the monster and grab the book before stumbling from the room, not noticing his old spells cleaning the ritual circle and setting the body aside. He staggered up the stairs, and he could feel the memory of his crime draining from him, magics that no man should traffic in fleeing the human mind.

He reached his desk and could have wept at the sound of his town beginning to stir in the the early dawn. Didn't they know they were ruled by a monster? Or perhaps they instinctively did, and that was why they crept about. He put the book back in its place, but didn't have the time to raise the wards again. He had to remember. He had to!

To the desk. He fumbled for ink and quill and parchment. He'd found the killer. It was...

Was...

He pinched the bridge of his nose. Exhaustion was getting to him. He couldn't do this any longer on his own, not if he couldn't even remember what he'd come to write. But since he was here, he reluctantly scrawled a letter to the Arcane Brotherhood, begging for their aid.

There was evil in the town, and he would find it.
