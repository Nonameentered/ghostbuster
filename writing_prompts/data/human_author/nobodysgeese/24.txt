This is your first story on writingprompts? It's very, very good. You have a way with words that fits the cosmic horror theme well, like the line "they have not seen what I can't unsee". The descriptions and the way you write unwilling compulsion create this great atmosphere for this piece.

It was a pretty good twist, having what seems like a first-person narrative and then flipping it at the last second so that the whole story was a letter, since you made the lines work for both. Especially since the way you made it a letter, having the character who has seemed afraid most of the story suddenly embracing the void as its prophet, also added to the cosmic horror feeling.
