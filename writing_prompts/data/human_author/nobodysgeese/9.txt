**Burying Old Grievances**

"Thank you all for coming, why don't you take a seat?" He held the door open.

I cleared my throat and gave the bard a disappointed look. "I'd appreciate it if you let me guide this conversation."

"Of course, of course," he said easily. "But then... you *don't* want us to take a seat? All the others did."

"How many times have you done this?" I murmured.

"Eight. Nine if you count the one where the therapist ran out instead of one of us," he said as the rest of the party shuffled in. I categorized them with a practiced glance. Warrior, priest, wizard, and a fresh body that had probably been a rogue at one point-

I rubbed my temples. "Well, normally we'd go through some introductions, but let's skip those and start with the body."

The warrior and the priest dropped the corpse on a couch and sat to either side of it. The priest said, "Sorry 'bout that, didn't have time to revive him yet. Dave here did something stupid, like usual, even though he *knew* we had this meeting coming up-"

The wizard slumped into a chair on his own with a dramatic sigh. "That's why he did it, you idiot. Dave will do anything to get out of an honest conversation. He'll do quite a bit to avoid the dishonest ones too, now that I think about it, although it's usually other people who die."

The bard tried to lean on my chair's arm, and I batted him away with a practiced wave. He leaned against the wall instead and said, "What was it this time? Tried to rob a king? Try stabbing someone while they were watching?"

"Type 21," the others chorused.

"Type... 21?" I asked. The headache these meetings so often caused was beginning faster than usual.

The bard nodded, "Mhm. It's easier than saying 'he died after being crushed under the weight of his own loot' every time it happens."

"Every time?" Yep, there was the headache. "How often does this happen?"

"Not as frequently as type 6 or type 28."

"...Whatever. For today, we'll stick with the living, talking members of the party, if that's alright with all of you."

The priest perked up, "It'll take a while to bring him back, but I can cast a spell to wake him up enough for a conversation."

I closed my eyes. "You mean, necromancy?"

"Yep! I've gotten a lot of practice since-"

"The *illegal* branch of magic. I don't have to report old crimes, but if you could refrain from talking about your intention to commit new ones, I would greatly appreciate it. Does that seem reasonable to all of you?" I looked around the room, and felt the first bit of relief this session as they were all nodding, with more or less enthusiasm.

"All right, then." I forced my gaze away from the body. "Let's start with a simple question, and we'll go around the room, one at a time. What brings you here today?"

I nodded to the wizard, but the bard jumped along the wall so that he was first to my left instead. "Where to begin?" He moaned. "Dave's the big problem, but that's a long term project. Jason here spends all his time in his books when we could be doing team bonding activities-"

"Getting drunk," the wizard in question coughed, but the bard continued as if he hadn't heard.

"-Aiden plagues the rest of us normal folk with his talk about 'morals' and 'praying more' and 'not committing war crimes' at the most inconvenient times, and Greg... actually, Greg's good." He winked, and the warrior nodded back with a slight smile. The bard turned to me, "If you could fix them of all of that, that'd be great, thanks."

The warrior Greg raised his hand and said, "You can skip me, I agree with Herb."

I blinked several times. The headache had decided it was going to stay, it seemed. "Thank you," I said at last, "Now let's hear from Jason," I gestured again to the wizard, who glared at the bard.

"Much as this pains me to say, he's not wrong, *per se*, about Dave. Dave is the biggest problem with this party."

The bard smiled, "Why thank you."

"*However!* Right after him in sheer nuisance value is our dear bard. He may *die* less, but he gets into even more trouble! Herb gets us into a completely avoidable fight in *every single town*."

"I do not!"

"Name one. Name one town we've been in where you didn't start a fight."

Herb froze in place for a few seconds, then crossed his arms and looked away. "...Fine, carry on."

"Aiden's a good enough chap, once you learn to tune out the praying, and Greg is mostly an accessory to Herb's chaos."

"Thank you," the bard and the warrior said together. I turned to the last living member, "Aiden, right? What do you see as this party's problems?"

The priest closed his eyes and laid a hand on his god's symbol around his neck. "I believe that I was brought here for a reason. I will bring them to the light of Dialga in due time, as is my calling."

"Even Dave?" The bard chimed in. 

Before I could berate him for interrupting, Aiden said, "Some people are... a bit farther from the light of Dialga than others. But while there's life, there's hope."

There was an awkward pause as the rest of the party stared at the body, which was noticeably deficient of life. Finally, I said,

"So, there seems to be a lot of disagreement about the direction that your party should be heading."

The wizard said, "No, we're going to kill the Northern Terror next. Dragon's are good money." The others were nodding.

"Not the literal direction," I replied with what remained of my patience. "I mean metaphorically. The style that your adventuring should take. The moral character of your group, if you prefer. Does anyone disagree?"

When there were no responses, I moved on to the next question. "How did such a disparate party form, anyways?"

There was a mumble of, "The tavern," from around the room. When no one spoke on, or even met my eye, I asked, "Would anyone like to elaborate?"

"No."

"Absolutely not."

"Never."

"What happened in the tavern, stays in the tavern."

I dearly wished that I trusted the priest enough to ask for a healing spell for my headache, but he was eyeing the corpse in a rather necromancer-y way that sent a shiver down my spine. "So, the tavern was a strong bonding moment?"

The warrior sighed. "It was an absolute disaster. Dave's first death, heads rolling everywhere, the ale..." He and the bard shivered. "But we were the only ones who could fight who were there, so we ended up a party."
