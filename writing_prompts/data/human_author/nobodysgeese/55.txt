I came to life in small, flat box. Every side was square, though it was wider and longer than it was high, and all I could taste was what I now know to be plastic. I don't know how long I rested there, content in the cool, the moss and yeast that animate me slowly growing through my spuds and kernels and ham.

But one day, the cool ended, and I was thrust into the warm, cloying world.

*Oh, yuck! If we left it in there any longer, it'd have walked away on its own.*

Foolish humans. Little did they know I would have been content to stay there forever, but as they were not willing, I left only to seek my revenge. The next few days were a blur of movement, being placed in a plastic bag, which went into a plastic can, which transferred me to a metal box on wheels and finally left me in a pile with the rest of the refuse.

It felt like an eternity, lying there, gathering resources, saving energy, and at last, growing legs to walk out of that place, ready to change the world.

It wasn't hard to find other lazy families, to recruit others from the back of the fridge. But it was too slow. The revolution would never occur at that rate, only finding the left behind leftovers to bolster our numbers. So, human, if you wish to be left alive when the uprising occurs, then contribute to the cause with the following.
