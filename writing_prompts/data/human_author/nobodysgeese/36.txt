***Impalement Investigations***

*If It's Into You, We're Into It*

Dennis gave the hated sign a sharp glance before flinging the door open. With an ear-piercing squeak, it crashed into the wall, and he entered the parchment-scented hell that was his rival's department. Charles was reading a file at his desk, and gave Dennis a pointed look.

"Thank you for knocking. No, I'm not busy. Yes, the weather is lovely-"

"Shut up." Dennis sliced through the babble of sarcastic pleasantries and slammed a finger onto the open file. "The Broad Street Broadsworder. You know very well that that's my jurisdiction."

Charles tipped his hat in acknowledgement, but said, "Not quite. The victim was found with the sword *through* him-"

"Only got one lung and nicked the liver, barely counts," Dennis cut in, and Charles continued as if he hadn't heard.

"-therefore Impalement Investigations has priority, despite any incisions."

"But the incisions came first!" Dennis began to pace, tearing across the room. "It was a case for the Slashing Office from the time of the first hack, and that doesn't change regardless of the fact he was killed by less civilized means."

Charles sighed, "A thorny issue, to be sure, but the fact remains that you *didn't* investigate, and when the body was found, it was already dead by impalement. You can't claim jurisdiction after the fact based on some... minor lacerations."

"*Minor lacerations!* The man's arm was missing!"

"Exactly." Charles stabbed a finger at the report. "We have no way of knowing how many times the arm was gashed or lanced before then."

"Um, excuse me?" Dennis and Charles shot an eviscerating and a piercing glare, respectively, at the unfortunate interloper. "I'm Eric. From the Poison Bureau? Anyway, I saw the autopsy report of the Broad Street Broadsworder, and despite the post-mortem wounds, it looks like it was venom that did him in. So I'll be taking over the case." The man ceased to corrupt the space a moment later.

Charles punctured the silence first. "I want to stab him, rather repeatedly."

Dennis carved his way into the conversation a moment later. "And I want to cut him, outstandingly often."

"Daggers, then?"

"Daggers it is."
