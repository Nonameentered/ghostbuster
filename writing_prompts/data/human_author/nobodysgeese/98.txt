This was wonderful Zet! The imagery is fantastic, from the descriptions of waking up in the beginning, to the horror of renovation, to the happy ending. 

You called this one experimental, and I'd say the experiment definitely worked. You got me more invested in this house's emotions than I care about most human characters.
