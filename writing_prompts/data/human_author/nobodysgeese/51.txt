Marcus Malletus' gaze shifted from his hammer to the statue of Venus. Then back to his hammer. "I'm not sure about this."

Gaius Pryus jammed his crowbar behind a frieze before looking over. "You've got the easy job! Just aim for the weak points, and keep your eyes closed in case of stone chips." 

Malletus shook his head. "That's not what I meant." He gestured vaguely in every direction, to the yet-decorated Temple of Venus. "Do you think she'd be happy with this?"

"It's us or the approaching barbarians," Pryus said. "It's practically a religious duty. We're being *pious* here." He heaved, and the frieze popped out. It fell to the marble tiles and shattered into a dozen shards.

Malletus winced. "Could we at least be more careful?"

Pryus nudged one of the pieces with a sandalled toe. "Venus is a goddess, and I'm sure she'd protect any art that she liked. It's probably a sign that it broke." He knelt and picked up the largest fragment. "And besides, there's still a whole person on this one. If we sand up the corners a bit, could get ten, twenty denarii for it, easy."

The next frieze came out more easily, and exploded more spectacularly. Malletus looked away, which unfortunately brought him into eye contact with the disapproving statue. "But it's a temple. Be respectful or the gods will be angry, and all that."

"She's the god of love," Pryus noted. "Pretty sure getting angry is against the rules for her."

"Wasn't she the one who turned that guy into a flower?" The statue was *definitely* glaring Malletus now, he just knew it.

"Exactly!" Pryus went to work on another frieze, stone chips flying as he tried to get his crowbar behind it. "Worst comes to worst, you get a nice, early retirement. Flowers have a good lifestyle, you know. No work, plenty of sunshine, no one asks you move from that nice patch of meadow."

Malletus hesitated. "But what about goats?"

"What?" Pryus at last managed to wedge the bar in and took a quick breather. "Nah, I'm pretty sure turning to goats is a Jupiter thing. Or maybe Bacchus?"

"No, I mean, yes, that is more their style, but I'm talking about flowers. Not such a great lifestyle when a goat shows up and bites your head off." Pryus paused as Malletus continued. "Also cows, and hares, and birds, andâ€” Do birds eat flowers?"

Pryus cleared his throat. "Maybe your 'being careful' idea has some merit after all. So be careful taking the head off that statue."

Malletus nodded agreement to the comprise and hefted his hammer. It was probably just his imagination that the statue was enraged.

Rob Burr froze at the door to the temple. His fellow barbarian, Lou Tihng, elbowed him. "Hurry up, before the good stuff gets taken!"

He shook himself and stepped inside. It was probably just his imagination that the pot, with two flowers and a hungry bird, was meant as a threat.
