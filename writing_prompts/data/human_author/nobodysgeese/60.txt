##Redfish Etouffee with Crawfish, Topped with Crispy Sweet Potato Slivers

It began, as most things do, with murder.

I turned up my collar and pulled my trench coat tighter against the New Orleans drizzle. The streets were empty at four in the morning, which was probably for the best. It had kept people away from the smashed-in door until the police could cordon off the scene. I ducked under the crime scene tape and stepped into the house. The furniture in the one-room cabin had been thrown about by some great struggle, but the chaos did little to hide the blood stains liberally coating the floor, or the claw marks dug into the hardwood.

"Werewolves," I told Officer Johnson. He was a good man, and deserved the truth. He listened to the experts when it came to the weird stuff, and his disbelief was more or less permanently suspended. "Was there a body that you've removed, or was it missing when you got here?"

"No body," he said. "Does that mean they?"

"No, werewolves don't eat people." I assured him. "It's worse than that. This means they're start to turn the unwilling again. And that means you're going to have rogue werewolves running around the city soon. And *that* means," I sighed and considered it for a moment. Surely there was another way? But no. I'd sworn to defend this city from the supernatural, and I wasn't going to avoid the lion's den out of pure cowardice.

"That means I have to visit Mrs. Decuir's shop."

***

The restaurant wasn't too busy yet, with the sun just beginning to peek above the clouds. Mrs. Decuir greeted me personally. She still appeared human, though I looked her over again to see if she'd finally let the glamour slip. 

"So," I asked her, "Werewolves are recruiting. Hear anything about that?"

She wagged a finger at me and sat me at a table. "No, no, no, you know the rules."

"Just give me the lead," I begged. "Please? Just this once?"

She transfixed me to the seat with a glare that no mortal could have mustered. "What is the first rule?"

I bowed my head. "No one leaves the restaurant without food."

"And the second?"

"Eat first, then talk."

She slammed a bowl of a dish I didn't recognize in front of me, and I ate. As always with her cooking, it was perfect. The spices complimenting each other, the fish flaking off in delicious crescents, the sauce the ideal consistency, and the fries somehow crispy despite resting on top of liquid.

I asked her the usual question first, but she denied again being a vampire, a demon, or a fae. Like usual, she claimed she knew so much about the supernatural because they liked her cooking as much as anyone. She denied using magic on her clearly magical cooking. I obtained the recipe after only asking her once.

She gave it up much to easily. When she turned to serve another table, I hid a sample of the soup in an empty vial. After I'd dealt with the werewolf case that day, with the assistance of Mrs. Decuir's advice, I performed a standard analysis of the tasty substance, and compared it with what she claimed was the recipe.

###Recipe Analysis Results

- Three redfish (mermaid variant?)
- Crawdads to taste (demonic in origin?)
- 1/2 butter (Suspect says that bought it from a new shipment yesterday. Must to remember to investigate this claim)
- 1/3 flour (Seems like standard spelt wheat. Ignore for know)
- Two 'medium' tomatoes (Does the medium refer to a spirit summoner?)
- A pinch of sea salt (Is the salt being used from its ritual or alchemical purpose here?)
- Secret family seasoning (It is nice to finally have written proof of her secrecy)
- Green onion (but no garlic. Evidence towards the vampire theory?)
- Sweet Potato Fries

My testing proved that the recipe's instructions for how to combine these ingredients did not lead to the same outcome. Further analysis required.
