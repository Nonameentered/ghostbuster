If you're writing a story from the viewpoint of an animal, they're going to have some human traits and thought patterns. That's completely unavoidable; if you want the readers to relate at all, your writing is likely going to have elements of cause and effect, human emotions, and the character thinking actions through. What you want to do, rather than try to completely remove anything that's even a little bit human, is instead deliberately emphasize a few alien elements. Maybe the animal is fixated on something specific like a nest or food, maybe there are a lot of short thoughts with incompletely sentences, or anything else that shows that whatever human traits this thing has, it is *not* human. And of course, when writing comedy, it can be fun to really stress human traits, and never even pretend to be writing a nuanced view of an animal's mental state.

An utterly essential part of writing an animal is mentioning the body parts frequently, often linked with an emotion. If your character isn't human, then emphasize that they have paws or fur or scales or a tail or whatever else it is by mentioning it near-constantly. The most crucial place to do this is in dialogue tags or similar descriptions. If, say, you're writing a dog, it shouldn't lean closer in interest, its tail should start wagging excitedly. If it's a cat, it shouldn't look thoughtful, it should groom its whiskers in thought. Non-human body language is a great way to get your reader into an animal's head with emotions the readers know, while also reminding them that this is not a human.
