It was a muggy night in LA, the kind of night where the heat and still air combined under the new moon into bad decisions. Aronin dearly hoped the mistakes weren't his this time as he scurried to the rusted gates. He eyed the aged lock for scarcely a second before deciding he didn't like tetanus. He glanced around, even the scant light enough for slit eyes to pierce the gloom. No one was watching him, not yet, so with a single bound he leapt the chain link fence.

The abandoned amusement park seemed to repel life. Not a rodent or bug could be heard, not even by his ears. Even the ever-present mosquitoes were absent, leaving the faint creak of tired metal and flaking paint the only sounds. Aronin darted from cover to cover, ears straining for the telltale sounds of pursuers or ambushers, but there were none.

He could smell them, though. The tang of tainted iron that always seemed to hang around vampires coated his tongue, and less overpowering, the damp forest and smoke that signaled were-creatures. They hadn't moved then, even with the power shifts rocking the city. But as he worked his way deeper into the amusement park, Aronin didn't smell the slightest hint of selkies, and some of the tension left him.

He made it all the way to the center of the park, under the moldering Ferris wheel, without being spotted. He gave himself the luxury of a few minutes to brace himself. If the rumors were wrong, this was going to be an utter disaster. 

Aronin pulled out a old scrimshaw pipe and lit it with a snap of his fingers. Immediately, the sounds he'd been missing rattled all around him, vampires and were noticing the single spark of light in the utter darkness. Even with his eyesight, Aronin could barely make out the black-clad figures darting in the alleys, climbing the rides, and flying to hang off the Ferris wheel above him. 

When he was sure there were enough of them around, Aronin gestured with his pipe, careful to keep it far from his face for now, and said, "I'm here to speak to Queen Beircha."

Laughter, low and menacing, rang out from all sides. A vampire hanging above him chuckled, "Haven't you heard? The selkies aren't in the alliance anymore."

Aronin felt hope flutter in his chest before brutally suppressing it. He had to be *sure*. "Pity. I have a message for the alliance, for her ears only."

The vampire appeared in front of him with a flicker of swirling magic. Aronin almost forgot to take a step back, as if he had been surprised. "Mortal. I am Lord Damon, and I lead the alliance. Now speak."

Aronin shook his head in mock disappointment, "Sorry, I can't-"

A taloned hand shot out from the vampire, seizing Aronin by the throat. He could feel the muscles straining, and smiled as the vampire was unable to lift him as he'd planned, or even squeeze tight enough to cut off his air. Aronin said, "So it is true then? The selkies are gone."

Lord Damon snarled, "You dare doubt my word-"

"In that case," Aronin said, "I've got a different message." Ignoring the hand around his neck, he lifted the pipe to his lips and drew. He could see the moment the vampire lord noticed the scales around his eyes, glittering in the glow from the pipe. "Without those blasted water creatures about, you're all looking mighty flammable."

Aronin inhaled, and the spark vanished, reappearing deep in his throat as the alliance, far too late, began to flee.
