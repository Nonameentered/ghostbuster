**The Little Things You Do Together**

The first time she ate someone, Baba Yaga's hut was in Transylvania. She'd known about eating people for a long time; Baba Yaga enjoyed having a person with a nice glass of amontillado every now and then, and the hut was the site of most of these meals. But she'd never considered that she too could eat people, until that spring by the Alps when she met him.

The hut settled on the grounds of an estate, folding up the giant enchanted chicken legs that carried her and observing the manor with interest. It had begun as a stylish baroque structure, modest only by the standards of the Hapsburg offshoot that had designed it. The following owners had been less architecturally minded; there was a rococo wing awkwardly tacked on to the west, a neo-classical tower to the south, and a variety of outbuildings of no particular style. It should have been a eyesore, but the hut found that the manor had a charm all his own.

It helped that he had very nice window moulding. 

Baba Yaga went inside to talk with the vampire who lived here, dragging two victims behind her as payment, and the hut resigned herself to a boring wait. But to her jargoglement, a scream of terror, came only a minute later. It was swiftly cut off by a *squelch*, crimson blood splattering across one of the cute floral blinds. Another scream called her attention to the third floor. 

The remaining victim was pounding on a window, which the hut was more than willing to give greater attention. As she watched, the ceiling began to descend, and from the way the victim moved up, the floor was rising too. There was a longer, drawn out *squelch* when the top and and bottom met, a moment later, the window opened and a single shredded leg was ejected from the room to land almost in front of the hut.

She hesitated, looking between the stray limb and the manor. It was rather clear what he wanted, and it did look appetizing except for the shoe, but she'd also never eating anything except pure magic. She was still mulling the matter over when the front door of the manor exploded. The hut's legs twitched in horror at seeing such a beautiful structure defiled. Her disbelief only grew when her own owner came out of the newly enlarged entrance and stomped back to the hut, slamming the door painfully behind her.

"Get up and get out of here," Baba Yaga snarled, taking a seat in her preferred stuffed chair. "The house has gone rogue. Ate its own vampire first, got to find a new supplier now, and..." The hut stopped listening, still staring at the wreckage of that perfect facade, ever so slowly trying to pull itself back together. He'd given her a leg.

"Well? Move!" Baba Yaga kicked the floor.

She'd never gotten a leg before.

"And recline the chair while you're at it. At least *you're* still good for something." The hut did as she asked, feeling rather numb as she stood and left on wobbling steps. Baba Yaga pulled a glass of wine from somewhere, took a sip and muttered, "I'll come back and burn the place down tomorrow."

The hut stopped reclining the chair. A moment later, she did the opposite, quite a bit faster than it had reclined. There was a *squelch*. 

It was delicious.

She back back for that spare leg, remembering at the last moment to trade it for one of Baba Yaga's. The hut hesitantly approached the manor, dropping the appendage on the stairs. When she turned around to leave, she noticed that the outbuildings had moved, and there was a new, hut-sized gap between two of them. She glanced back, and when a shutter waved her on, she took the plot of land with glee.

And if that clear space was a little closer to than manor than that of any of the other outbuildings, close enough that she could still hear the screams of the mortals who entered his halls, well, that was no one's business but theirs.

And besides, all the witnesses of this architectural impropriety were eaten.
