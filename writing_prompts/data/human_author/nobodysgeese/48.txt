Once upon a time, there was a young castle. It had a castle-like moat, a properly castley stone keep, and a courtyard fit for a castle. But what it didn't have was castle-worthy walls.

When all the other castles had murder holes and embrasures and merlons and arrow loops, the young castle had none. Where other castles had towers and bastions and redoubts and glaces to form strong points in the wall, the young castle had a log that stuck up higher than the others. Where other castles had walls made of stones like limestone and sandstone and dolostone and wackestone, the young castle had only maple. Sometimes, the young castle liked to pretend it was called maplestone, like all proper materials, but it was much harder to pretend after it caught fire.

The fire had been a bad time. The young castle sometimes felt like there was an entirely new group of people inside it after the fire, but that was ridiculous. No, the fire had just been an accident, caused by a couple of hundred accidentally aimed flaming arrows.

But worst of all, after the wall burned down, the people just built another exactly like it!  The young castle would have wept, but the best it could do was pretend to when the rain was especially bad. It pretended to cry harder when the wall burned down again, this time because someone accidentally doused the gate in ten barrels of oil and dropped a torch in it.

The young castle was happy when no one rebuilt the wooden wall. It was less happy when no one came to live inside either. Years passed. The rain fell, and the frost came, working their magic to dig into every little crevice and topple the keep to the ground. The young castle became a younger pile of rubble, which became an old pile of rubble.

The rubble pile was surprised, when after many, many years, it felt its stone shifting under a dozen grasping hands. It would finally be repaired, it thought, and be made a proper castle, through and through!

But it was not. The keep's stones were spread through the entire village, turned into a hundred houses. The old rubble pile would have wept, if it hadn't grown tired of such silly games when its second floor fell in. The new village despaired of ever being a proper castle ever again.

This time, when the fire came, the new village wasn't able to pretend it was an accident. When torches fell and oil was spread about, the new village knew what was coming, and despaired that it would not be able to save these people, any more than it had twice before.

No.

The new village refused. This time, when the fire came, the stones of the new village, creaked, and groaned, and shifted under the heat, but they held. The stone houses the village stood firm, and it was only then that the new village realized that it had proper stone walls at last. 

Sometime, what had once been a young castle missed towering into the sky. Sometimes, it wished people had remembered to build better walls much, much earlier. But perhaps it wasn't such a bad thing, being a village after all.
