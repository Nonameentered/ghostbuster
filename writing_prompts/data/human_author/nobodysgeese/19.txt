## Bump in the Night, Inc.

**Note 1**

Remember to find new hunting spot on Wednesday

*Sorry to barge into your cubicle, but I couldn't help but see your reminder. There's a good spot down King St. Hang a right into the industrial park. Just avoid the ghouls*

I'll check it out

**Note 2**

That was a great place! Thanks for the tip

*You're welcome :)  And welcome to the team*

**Note 3**

*Two witnesses escaped. Track tomorrow*

Blond man, brunette woman? Late twenties, very high-pitched voices? If so, I got them. Was hunting off-the-clock and they literally ran into me.

*Bless you kind sir*

No problem

**Note 4**

We've got another monster hunter in town. Normal looking, trench coat and all, nearly pinned me mid-feeding. Be safe, OK? Last seen on the western outskirts heading inwards.

*Warm-blooded bastard chased me over half the city, I'm starving, but if you'll take him next shift (please?), I guarantee he's tired.*

He was delicious, and from the injuries, you got some good shots in

*bon appetit :)*

**Note 5**

The spot you shared is getting a bit over-hunted. I'm checking out the riverfront

*Let me know what you find. I'll check the police station*

Pretty bare, the humans already know to cower inside. Checking out the new developments.

*Police station area will tide us over a couple of weeks. Share hunting grounds again?*

Agreed

**Note 6**

*Rogue vampires. They're clustered to the east, and I hear management is calling out the big guns this time. Hunt in the suburbs for a bit?*

The mid-workday commute is a pain

*On the night shift, talk to Dan in HR. He'll get you a license and a company vehicle*

How?! I've been on the waiting list since I joined and he just... got me one. Immediately

*The ways of Dan are unknown and unknowable. Of all of us, he's the one with real magic. Do Not Annoy Dan*

**Note 7**

I helped clean out the rogues!

*I clap for you. Hear my clapping. But I can't help but notice the paperwork piling on your desk, oh brave and mighty warrior*

Screw you

*You missed forms 5-A and 1210-R, and the incident report should be in triplicate*

Screw you

*You're getting there! Don't forget to get the department head's signature and run it past Operations before the final submission*

...help...

*Nancy, accounting, you can catch her right at the tail end of your shift. Tell her Rob sent you*

thank you for your mercy

**Note 8**

Buy more pens

*My desk is the second row, third cubicle. I'll leave the top drawer unlocked*

**Note 9**

Dear Rob,

Thank you for the pens. I appreciate the aid. I did not mean to pry, but I couldn't help but see your emergency stash of dried brain strips in the same drawer. As I am a vampire, I do not believe that this correspondence can continue anymore. My coven would not approve.

Thank you for your help in adjusting to this workplace. Please do not contact me anymore.

Fabian

*:(*

No. 

*</3*

I am sorry.

**Note 22**

*Don't you dare throw this one out too! Meet me at our third hunting grounds.*

We cannot meet. My coven would end me. Stop this.

*Bring your coven if you have to. In fact, that would be preferable*

Why?

*You'll see*

**Note 23**

How? How did you do this?

*Feasting always brings people closer together :)*

Zombies do not ally themselves with vampires!

*Of course, I'm not allied, I'm just a friend. A very, very official friend. "Friend of the Ravenling Coven" has such a nice ring to it, doesn't it?*

You're a monster. Not a normal monster, a real monster.

*Aw shucks*

**Note 24**

Sorry about last month. I'd like to make it up to you

*Forgiven already. And I know the cerebellum celery is from you, thank for that*

So you don't want to know where I've taken to dumping bodies, brains still intact?

*Now let's not be hasty here*

Second hunting grounds, the overpass
