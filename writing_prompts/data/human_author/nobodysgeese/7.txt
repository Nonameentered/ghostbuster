A writing prompt is an idea or a concept that's supposed to inspire someone else to write a story. On this subreddit, most of the posts are prompts, and they are what need to be tagged. The tags here are the two letters in square brackets at the beginning of each post. The most common is [WP], which stands for Writing Prompt. [You can find a full list of possible tags here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/how_to_tag_prompts/)

The stories here should be inspired by the prompts that get posted. A writer scrolls through the available prompts, picks one that they like, and writes a story for it in a comment on that prompt's post. The stories do not need to be tagged, just the prompts.

The only exception is poems, which should have the tag [Poem] somewhere in the comment.

If you want to share your writing that isn't inspired by one of the prompts here, check out our affiliated subreddit, r/shortstories.
