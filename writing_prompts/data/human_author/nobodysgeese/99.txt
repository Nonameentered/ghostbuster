*Adrift*

She woke to the sound of screaming and the smell of burning cloth. The dragon uncurled as much as her cage allowed and opened her eyes to a delightful sight. The new campsite was aflame, and carnies ran between the rows of tents, chased by men on horseback. A rider approached her bars, keys in hand, and...

No. Sight lied. Sound could lie. Even smell sometimes lied. The dragon touched her tongue to the familiar bars, but tasted nothing.

It wasn't the present, then, and once she recognized the vision for what it was, it changed. Again she was curled up in her cage, her lying eyes closed, as that hated voice asked its never-changing question.

"Is today going to be a good day, lizard?"

As if omens were so simple. It would have helped if he ever changed the words. Instead, like always, she found herself lost in the turbulence of the ocean of time, the same words washing over her again and again and again.

"Is today going to be a good..."

"Is today going to be..."

*Is today going...*

Her tongue flickered in and out, desperately searching for the one time with taste, the only time that hadn't already happened, or was still yet to come. With perseverance, she found it, the taste of road grit and cold iron. Then, cautiously, she sent her gift of foresight forward, just a little.

But she used too little caution, it seemed, for the first vision struck again.

*The campsite on fire, her tormentors fleeing from angry horsemen, a figure with keys approaching her cage-*

No. She tasted the bars again until she was back in the present, shaking and gasping for breath. The hated man was saying something, likely the threats he always made, so similar that if she listened she would become untethered again, adrift amid all the other times he said exactly the same things. But though repetitive, she knew the threats weren't idle, and she despaired to ask for rest from the constant visions. To let his captive rest her power until she remembered the feel of the present, and could tell it from the lies of foresight. His greed would never allow it.

The dragon clung to the present with all her magical might, focusing on the smells of horses and kitchens, the sounds of tents rising and men swearing, and the feel of iron beneath her claws, but kept her eyes closed. As slowly as she could, she sent only her sight forward, keeping it on a short leash, looking only hours, not days, into the future.

*Tents burning, riders chasing, a man with keys.*

She let the vision fall away and opened her eyes in the present. There were the tents, lined up as she'd seen, but not yet burning, and taste affirmed that this was the now.

"Well, monster? Is today going to be a good day?"

She shivered in delight and said, "Today is going to be an *excellent* day."
