This is good. I love how the only dialogue is from the computer, and the narration is from a pretty sarcastic first person POV. The idea of where this cosmic horror entity is hiding is straightforward enough that I understand what's going on but still strange enough that it works for cosmic horror.

I have two suggestions for improvement. First, if you described the creature even less, it would strengthen the bizarreness of the whole story and fit cosmic horror better. 'Something' moving, and a sense of being watched, rather than a very large monster.

Second, there are a few very good snarky lines from the character, and I'd love to see more where's he's just exasperated with the computer.

A much smaller issue, but the sentence "[Pilot Has Seen Forbidden Information. Informing Luna Authority]" just feels a bit off. You need to tweak it a bit to get the same wonderful clinical tone as the rest of the computer's lines
