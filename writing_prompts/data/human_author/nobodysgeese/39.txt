This is a very nice scene, with great, deliberately over-the-top descriptions. I have to compliment you on putting "digest his distilled wisdom" right after talking about coffee, and the bit about a Tardis and drawers.

I think you made the story chaotic on purpose, and that made it very fun to read. However, I would have liked a bit more clarity on a few points, especially the relationship between these two. You called them friends, but at times it felt more like Robert was a teacher. A less important thing you could have done is describe where the conversation is taking place. Talking about the room or cafe where they're talking would ground the wilder parts of the story and give the reader something to cling to.
