*Elbow Room*

The office building was normal; that was the problem.

Rectangular concrete bones framed rectangular glass eyes, glaring at passers-by with rectangularity. It was bold in its statement, that its colonial mediocrity deserved to take up space. Santiago disagreed, and he set out to take back what was theirs.

Across the street, Santiago painted heritage and modernity with a mad brush. Glass sides, dyed the colorful solid hues of the future, formed Incan and Mayan shapes on a massive scale.

It was bright, brazen, stealing attention simply by existing. And, rarely, people remembered there were other buildings on Santiago's childhood street.
