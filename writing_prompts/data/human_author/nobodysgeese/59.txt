##Haggis: A Taile of Woe and Warrning 

It had been six days since the battle and the sinking. I'd managed to bring few supplies, and I was quite faint with hunger. Fishing from my raft had yield no results, the last of the water skins had run dry, and the sky gave no indication of coming rain. So when I saw a ship, I sought to signal it, even when I saw the Scottish flag. I thought it better to be thrown in prison than to die athirst and adrift.

I was pleasantly surprised when I was escorted directly to the brig, and no attempts were made to press me for any information beyond my name and rank. I should have known there was something amiss, and I can only blame my hunger and lack of sleep for missing it. 

That evening, in what I assumed was a sign of respect, I was invited to the officer's mess to join those of rank at dinner. The conversation flowed well enough, when we didn't trip over the topic of the war. The food was what one might have had on any British ship-of-the-line.

It was too good to last. The steward brought the last course, a strange dish I didn't recognize. When my tablemates ate with every sign of enjoyment, I chose to mimic them. 

I recall little of what happened after. Flashes come to me, of a doctor looming over me, of days in the sickbay, of pain radiating through my innards and a cloying taste that refused to leave my tongue. I know not how long it's been between that doomed dessert and this last spate of lucidity, but I write this and cast it in the ocean in the hopes that someone will learn what became of me, and as a warning to any others captured by the perfidious Scots.

I've deduced the concoction they fed me, from a dozen hints pulled from the sympathetic doctors. I apologize for burdening you with this knowledge, but may it serve you well.

###Haggis, Helle's Repast

- begin with a sheep's stomach, and wash it
- take the same sheep's heart, lungs and tongue, and boil and mince them together
- add a measure of fat
- add herbs if you wish, though they shall not be tasted
- stuff the devil's mixture into the stomach, and sew it shut
- pierce the stomach with a fork, to let the unholy brew into the water as you boil it again

Serves 4-6 of your worst enemies
