**In the Clear(ing)**

Mike turned in a slow circle in the center of the clearing, and approved of what he saw. A rivulet provided water, and he'd ignored the gurgling sounding like a drowning man. Smaller trees could be easily turned into firewood, and he knew none of the foliage *really* hid monsters. And there was even a fire-pit, still smouldering, though there was no sign of a camper. A leaning boulder would give a tent a little extra shelter, and which probably wouldn't fall no matter how much like jaws it looked. A shiver ran down Mike's spine, reminding him that he need a fire. He pulled out his axe and got to work.

It had just been settling down for a nap when yet another maniac started lopping down trees. The clearing awoke sluggishly, with twinges of distress every time the blade struck. Sure enough, there was a human in the clearing. It looked its abode as the axe paused.

The brook eddied to a murderous dirge.

The trees look sufficiently haunted. 

The rock the man was camping under had stalactites that looked like famelicose teeth, for goodness sake!

*Thwack*. The axe struck a new tree.

The clearing seethed and got back to work.

At dawn, Mike stepped out with a smile on his face. The birds sang mournfully despite the beautiful day, the trees looked equally haunted in the light of the sun, and the choking sound of the water's eddies accompanied the sight of his supplies drifting away at the the mercy of the currents.

He blinked twice. He looked between the spot in his tent where he'd definitely left his backpack, then at the backpack in question floating away.

"Huh," Mike said, as the backpack bobbed up in once last desperate gasp for air before being pulled to the depths below.

"Hunting it is," he decided. He'd always wanted the real survival experience, and it seemed he'd finally gotten the final push to try it.

The clearing felt dejected as the human bumbled about, stumbling over a truly ridiculous amount of edible wild food. Usually, targeting the supplies got them to leave, but this infestation was persistent. It looked over its trees, or rather those that were left after that *hooligan* had finished his vile work, and reluctantly picked a big one. At least this would scare him off and it could sleep again.

***

Mike was whistling on the way back to his campsite. All the probably-not-haunted shade had hidden a lot of food, and he was looking forward to some roast mushrooms and onions. He froze as he stepped back into the clearing.

A massive maple, one he'd hoped would help keep off any potential rain, had fallen directly on top of his tent. Only a single corner flapped out from under the trunk, like a hand beckoning him and begging for rescue. It was only by sheer luck that the tree had missed the fire and avoided burning the whole forest down. 

Mike carefully set his meal out around the fire before inspect the damage. It took a few second to determine that absent a chainsaw, the tree was there to stay. It took a minute to mentally measure the distance between the tree and the boulder, and to lie down between them. With such a great pair of walls, it took barely an hour to throw a roof over them as an impromptu shelter, and Mike ate his hunter-gathered meal with a smile. 

It seemed that nature just wanted him to get the full survival experience, and he was loving it. Why hadn't he done this earlier?

***

The clearing spent the rest of the day in shock. It was only at night that it regained enough to its wits to launch its final attack. The human would die, and it would finally have its peace again.

***

A terrible clamor woke Mike, and he opened his eyes to the sight of the boulder falling. He had just enough time to raise his hands in futile defense when it suddenly stopped. The tree which had given him such a great shelter came through for him again, catching the boulder before it crushed him.

Mike crawled out of the space and examined the clearing again. At last, he knelt and patted the Earth.

"Thanks, buddy. You saved me. I had a good feeling about this place."

***

The clearing raged silently at his words, only to have the knife driven deeper a moment later.

"You're a nice clearing. No, that's too common a word. How about a glen? In fact, I'm naming you Glen!"

The clearing whimpered as best it could without a mouth. Its three main defense were all used up. The man spoke again.

"If you don't mind, Glen, I think I'll stay here. Permanently."

Glen wept.
