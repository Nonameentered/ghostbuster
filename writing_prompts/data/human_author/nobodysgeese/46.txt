Tommy had liked the description, ***your arms bristle with something like an electric shock***. But as Tommy felt the sensation himself, he realized he'd underestimated how much it would hurt.

The back convulsions weren't pleasant either.

But at last Tommy staggered to his feet, flexing fingers ending in claws, and cutting his tongue on fangs when he tried to lick his lips. He surveyed the area, and found himself in a foggy evergreen hell. 

"What is going on?" He whispered. The world apparently took offense at his words, because the next moment a heavy form slammed into his side and drove him to the ground.

The next minute was a blur of slashing and gnawing and howling and a little manly screaming, until Tommy ended up on top of the body of a normal wolf. Before he could assess the copious amounts of blood and determine which body each came from, a *ding* rang through his ears, and a sourceless voice stated: "Quest Complete: Kill an enemy. Congratulations on reaching level two."

"I'm *in the videogame?*" Tommy half-shouted. A snort preceded a scarred werewolf stepping into his clearing. 

"Bit slow on the uptake, I see."

Tommy's many questions and protests stumbled over each other trying to escape his mouth. "How am I- Who are- What happened-"

The other werewolf raised a paw to cut him off. "It's fine, it always takes time to adjust, but as you know, time is short."

"I know... time is short?"

"Mhm," the werewolf growled. "Take a hint from a veteran, and swap the third and fifth steps around."

"Steps?" Tommy asked in a daze.

"Yep, from the intro video." The werewolf's ears perked up, and he turned to follow the unheard sound, calling over his shoulder. 'It had everything you need to survive here."
