Hello, dear viewers, and welcome back to season 22 of *Perilous Places,* with your hosts, Dave Johnson-

And me, Mary Campbell.

Past the abandoned mill, up the old road and behind the haunted manor (see episode 3, season 1). there is a greenhouse. Shattered glass, roof falling in, rodent population sky-rocketing in the dirt, it might seem a poor site for paranormal activity, what with the manor stealing all the ectoplasmic energy in the area.

Yes, that's right, Dave, but if you go through the door, you'll find...

Hidden amid the mouldering ruins...

An empty coffin! Last night, at least, you would, but the coffin's since been stolen.

Let's set up some cameras and wait for night fall.

***

Look, lights! Oi, Dave, lights, on the screen, moving. Wake up! Everyone, this might take a second, because for all our professional editing, we do *film* these episodes back to back, and Dave's been up for quite some... Er, Dave, what's that on you? No, stay there, don't come closer-
