Ohhhhh! This was a GD story! Neat!

I want to say first off that this had great characters! I loved how you showed their different attitudes so well in such a short piece! You used your words and your setting well to achieve that, so well done!

I do think the piece could have used a little tweaking to the dialogue. Something stuck out to me as being a bit odd. One in particular was how everyone called each other by name but the Commander was not called by name. At first I thought there would be a reason behind that but the reason was never shown so it just stuck out to me. 

There was also this line: 

"But this room is everyoneâ€™s only chance to forget about this ten year mission to Europa" 

Which I felt wasn't coming from the character and was there just to tell us what was going on. It felt a bit disingenuous and was even more out of place when the same information is presented in a more natural way a few lines later. 

That's all I got for crit! Still a great story and I hope these crits help you in your writing!
