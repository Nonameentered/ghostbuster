The light has no fear of darkness. 

By its very nature, the darkness hates the light. It hates to be revealed, to be seen for what it is. To face the truth that it is, and always has been, mere nothingness. 

What the light does fear, is those who fall into darkness. 

The Drakenvulf was one such creature. 

Zivra had known the Drakenvulf when he was a pup. It had been feisty and stubborn. She had admired those traits when she taught him to chase and hunt and fetch with his brothers. Yet, stubbornness ballooned into pride and feistiness soured to moodiness. As his kin grew and learned and searched the world for adventure, Drakenvulf stayed behind, telling himself and all who would listen that only fools left the valley, only fools went away. 

And more and more, as Zivra came down the hills of the valley to visit the beast, she heard him shout at her to leave.

"Go away, lightbringer!" He would howl from a cave or a hollow. "I need not your lies and lessons. I am grown now, I am wise! I know more than you!"

And so, each day, Zivra turned and walked away. She send gifts to the his siblings, books and letters and pictures and bits of flower that she thought they'd enjoy. Every now and then she would see something she'd think Drakenvulf would like too, but each time she left him a gift she'd return to find it untouched, sitting out in the sun and rain until it rotted away. 

Then came the day she went to visit a nearby rabbit named Rabbenthorn and found the small hole empty. There was blood upon the earth, and Zivra despaired. She knew that death had come for the old rabbit and she knew it's name.

"Drakenfulf!" She screamed as she marched into a cave he'd taken to. "Drakenvulf, why have you done this?"

She walked inside, her light revealing the damp walls and messy floor, a floor of old fur and rotted things. 

"I would have brought you food if you were hungry!" She called through the cave, reaching what should have been it's end but finding that the beast had dug himself deeper into the dark. A hundred tunnels stretched out and away. Zivra could not search them all. 

"I have brought you books to keep you keen! I've brought you treats and treasures and all my light!"

The darkness only growled in answer. 

"Why have you done this?"

Jaws snapped from the darkness, a face that had once been beautiful with cream-colored fur was now torn and scarred. Drakenvulf had not eaten well, thus his fur had fallen out. He had not bathed, so he contracted many diseases. His eyes had not come to see the light, so now they were squinting in pain. 

All things of his own making, his own choices. 

"Rabbenthorn was old!"

"Yet he was young in soul, always helpful, always growing!" Zivra snapped back, she cast her light upon the beast and watched it flee from her, recoiling as Drakenvulf caught sight of his own skin, his own form. 

"He was different!"

"All are different, not one among us is the same as another."

"He was stupid not to protect himself!"

"There was nothing he had to fear. All who knew him called him friend."

"He was foolish."

"He read every book I brought him. He taught others and spent his words well."

"He was... he was..." The growl stuttered from the tunnels. 

"I see the truth, Drakenvulf!" Zivra stomped her foot, causing the earth itself to rumble. "Speak it!"

"HE WAS TASTEY!" 

Drakenvulf leapt from the darkness into Zivra's light. His jaws open, his breath boiling with rot and sickness. 

And Zivra looked upon with sadness as he flew past. He landed hard behind her, his front paw giving way beneath him. His head turned back and forth, trying to find her but having lived in the dark for so long he could not understand the world in the light. He stumbled forward and then his own tail, bare of fur and kinked with broken bones whipped about and struck him in the face. In his fury and his pain he bit at it, crushing his own flesh between his teeth. 

He howled and whimpered as Zivra stood in the same spot, the same sadness coloring her light. 

"Look at what you've become." Her voice tore with the words. "Open your eyes and look."

Yet Drakenvulf would not. He put his paws over his eyes instead, pressing them down to keep himself in the dark. 

"I cannot bring my light to you anymore." She whispered. "Nor gifts, nor stories. Not after what you've done. You, little fool, have dug so many holes into darkness, dug deep and lost yourself among them all. From now on, that is all you shall do until you learn to dig toward the light."

And Zivra left the cave. She stopped only once to stomp her foot upon the earth and call the cave to collapse and seal the beast down in the darkness that he'd made his dwelling. She planet hushseed around it so none would hear the foolish things that Drakenvulf would wail, then she made for the home of Rabbenthorn so she could cry for both of her now lost friends.
