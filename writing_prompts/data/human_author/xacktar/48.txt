The skinny young man in the leather jacket kept glancing back, over his shoulder. There was nothing there. There hadn't been anything there for hours. Nothing but the wide, open sea.

"What's got you spooked, son?" The grey-bearded captain asked. 

"Nothin." 

The young man held a knife in his hand, one of those collapsible kind. He kept flicking it open and shut, open and shut. Click-click-clack. Click-click-clack. 

"Must be something to send ya all the way to the mainland." Captain gently touched the wheel to correct the course. "You in trouble with the law?"

"Shut up." The skinny whelp tried to stand but a bit of rough chop sent him stumbling back. "I ain't done nothin."

The captain nodded, his cold steel eyes kept looking forward. He didn't say a word as minutes stretched on with nothing to hear but the sound of the ocean, the low drone of the engine, and the Click-click-clack of the kid's knife.

"...I think someone's after me." The whelp said. "Things keep going wrong. Ever since I-"

He snapped his mouth shut. The captain said nothing.

Click-click-clack. "First they took my wallet. Then my car was torched. Then they stole some of Shara's stuff." The kid looked back over his shoulder once more. 

"Shara?"

"That was my girl."

"Was?" Captain said. "What happened to her?"

The kid didn't answer.  The low drone of the engine got louder all of a sudden. It choked and gagged and shuddered to a stumbling stop. 

"What's that? What's wrong?" 

The captain just raised his hand in a placating motion before climbing down the narrow ladder to the engine. The young man waited, leaning forward in his seat to hear the clang of metal on metal and several thumps of something heavy scraping wood. He flicked his knife faster and faster. Click-click-clack. Click-click-clack.

"Well, no turning back." The captain said as he climbed back up. "All out."

The kid surged to his feet. "What?" 

"She's dry, no fuel." The captain planted his feet in a wide stance on the deck as the boat rocked against the waves. "Used it all."

The knife was at the old man's throat in a second, then a wave tilted the deck and the kid lost his footing. The captain, however, never wavered. His hand snapped forth and grabbed the kid by the collar, dragging him in to smell the gin and rot on his breath. 

"You were right, son." He breathed foulness into the kid's face. "Someone was after ya."

The knife struck true this time, casting a spray of red amidst the sprays of white. Before the body even hit the deck, the whelp was below. Feet hit water so cold it seared. The engine was half-covered, the fuel gage proudly announcing 'Empty' as the room swung back and forth, back and forth with its own waves.

The kid didn't see it. His eyes caught something else: words painted jagged and black around the hole in the hull. 

*SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER.*
