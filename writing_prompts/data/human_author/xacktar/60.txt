My take is that I try my hardest to avoid those simple descriptions and try to spice things up with more specific actions that show those things. 

It isn't always possible, however. Sometimes the best tag is a 'he whispered' but if I have the time to, I like to spell it out a bit clearer with something like: 'his voice was low and dry.'
