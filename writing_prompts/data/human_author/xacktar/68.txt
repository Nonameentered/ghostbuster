Hi Stick! This is a lovely twist story and I like the way it plays. I did notice one small thing in this line:

“In Dad’s toolbox,” she lied. “Who knows how it got there.” 

Since we already see the truth in the story, I think it would have a greater impact if you didn't state the lie and let the reader suss it out in their own minds. 

Just my thoughts! Hope it helps!
