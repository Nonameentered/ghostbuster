Prince Edward Francis Ulysses Symbolton trudged through the door, flopped down into a 500-year old love seat, and kicked one leg up and over an armrest set with Mediterranean pearls. 

"Well, he's dead."

His two other siblings looked up from their books, faces turning white in the warm firelight of the evening. 

"Pops really popped off?" Prince Philip bent down and picked up his small, rag-like creature that he insisted was a champion sheep dog, "You sure?"

"There were thirteen royal doctors, twice as many nurses, and a cancer-sniffing cat at his bedside. I think they're sure."

"Even the cat?" Isabelle, also a princess but the title seemed to slip off of her shaved head and studded leather knee-highs. 

Edward  ignored her. It was the safest move, "This means one of us gets the crown."

The triplets stared at each other. They'd been born together, via surgery. In the panic and confusion the record of who was first had been lost, so there was no eldest.

"Uhhhhhhh..." Philip began.

"For fuck's sake, Eddie." Isabelle unhooked her leather-clad leg from a silver candelabra and sat up, "You tellin me that after thirty-five years of doing absolute shit, one us has to go up there and run parades an' oversee parliament an' all that?"

"Seems so."

"Shit."

"...But we made a pact." Philip's small voice tremored, "You s-said-"

"I know what I said, Phil." Edward sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, "I think we did well, really. For thirty-five years, what have we done to change the country?"

"NOTHING!" The two shouted, raising their fists in the air. The response was automatic, perfected over decades of use.

"Right. We've done nothing. Throughout the history of the Symbolton rule, our ancestors continually fucked things up. Murder, war,  oppression, plague... but not us! The Torpid Triplets! Nothing for the good of all! ...Or so it was."

Edward let his head drop back so he could gaze up into the fabulously marbled ceiling. 

"I c-can't...can't be king." Philip mumbled in the silence, "I-I'm just not!"

"Samesies." Isabelle played with one of her many ear piercings, "I don't do dresses... or crowns."

Edward sighed. He had no desire to be king, that was for sure. Visiting places just to sit around for hours on end listening to the worst kind of inane drudgery. What kind of life was that? 

"What if... we gave it up." Philip popped his head up, "I-if we each ab-abdicate, then..."

"Then it goes to cousin Stefan." 

Their pact of 'don't fuck things up' did not extended to their cousin. 

"Oh."

"Right."

"What about... if we named a family member, collectively?" Philip was staring intensely at nothing while his hands scratched his dog's ears, "An individual of, uh, likewise royalty?"

"Yeah, and who would that be? It's us or the idiot cousin."

Philip said nothing but held his dog up.

Edward laughed, then considered, then grinned in a sinister manner, "The King is dead. Long Live Lil' Scruffles."
