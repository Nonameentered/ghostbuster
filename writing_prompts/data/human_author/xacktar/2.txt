##The Bright Stuff

Upon a small hill between a pie factory and a mattress warehouse, there stood a small cemetery. Among it's many rows of brightly colored, inflatable gravestones, a crowd milled. In it's center was Ryto the Ragnificent. 

He was dressed in his most subdued pinks and yellows, holding in his frilled gloves a small, fake flower and the mechanism that helped it squirt people in the face. His makeup was awash with streaks, and his pocket overstuffed with the many knotted handkerchiefs he'd used that day. 

"We are here to honor our fallen." He announced to the crowd as a series of honks and sad slide-whistles rose up around him, "Zoopy the Zopper was a clown among clowns. Everyone here was welcome at his two-legged table, at any time, on any night. He was there to refill our seltzer. He was there to lift us up when the trampolines let us down."

A second roar of honks and weee-oops echoed forth.

"Yet it was his act of bravery in the second silent war that brought us together here today. When the WOOP-D2 division was deployed to the mime fields of southern France, we believed all hope was lost. In that quiet hush as we stumbled through the trenches, it was Zoopy who painted on a brave face each morning. A honk there, a flower squirt there, and when all else failed, that shaving-cream slap to the back was there when it was needed."

Ryto pulled out another six handkerchiefs to wipe both eyes, nose, and ears with. 

"And when the mimes were upon us, not-thundering down on our positions with their wickedly quiet ways. It was Zoopy who rose up on widened feet! He bent down upon his miniature motorcycle and rode straight for the front, honking and spraying the whole way. Pies flew left and right. The air was thick with the sour taste of lemon meringue. Yet it was a simple, invisible rope from a mime tug-of-war that stopped him.

The procession bloomed as plastic flowers were raised.

"Lying there, alone, amidst the enemy's stripes. The world was black and white and... wearing a *beret.* Our Zoopy, bless his nose, took his seltzer bottle and let fly. As the enemy mime-th division dove for cover, our hero sprayed the battlements with bubbly froth, revealing all the invisible ropes and walls. It was Zoopy the Zopper who crossed the mime field. It was Zoopy the Zopper who scattered the enemy. It was Zoopy, *dear* Zoopy, that made it so that each and every one of us could pile into our clown car together and come home."

The honks and whistles were quiet as twenty fake flowers squirted toward the sun in sequence.

"It was there, upon that ground that Zoopy pied." Ryto called out, raising the fake flower above him and squirting the last, somber squirt, "Zoopy, poor brother, we knew thee well. May you honk in heaven and not in hell."
