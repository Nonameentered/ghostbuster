Leatherhead, Scarecrow, and Jigsaw sat on their folding chairs in the middle of the fake butcher's shop, listening to the angry crowd outside, each of them holding their respective heads in their hands.

"Jerry's late." Jigsaw itched the inside of his mask with his middle finger, "Again."

"He does this every year." Scarecrow's voice was more feminine than one would assume from her bloody coveralls, "Last year he was, what? Two hours late?"

"Yeah." Leatherhead's low rumble was the direct opposite of scarecrow, "Always workin' on his costume, nevah shows till he gots it right."

Scarecrow folded her arms and huffed, "Drama queen!"

Whatever was to be said next was interrupted by a thumping, then a rattling, and then finally the door bursting open and a woman charging in. She dragged two children with her, one arm each held in a vise-grip. Her hair looked like a shellacked chicken tail, while the rest of her face was obscured by dollar store sunglasses.

"WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE!" She dragged a kid in front of her and shook him for emphasis, "THIS is a DISGRACE! I paid good money to go to this haunted house and so far I have done NOTHING but wait in line! My children want to be terrified and they're getting BORED!"

Scarecrow got up off of her folding chair, tilted her head, and moved some of the straw out of her eyes.

"Are you sure? Because they look pretty- "

"Are you the manager?" Chicken-hair brought kid number two forward, shoving the six year-old into the chain-link barrier that divided the customer from the employee side.

"Er, no. The-"

Chicken-hair stuck a finger in Scarecrow's face, "I paid good money to get scared! Why aren't you scaring me! Who is in charge here! I want to speak to them!"

Leatherhead slowly unfolded his bulk from his chair, stretching out the previously baggy jumpsuit until it showed off his entire, six-foot-nine form, "Look, *Miss,* We're not gonna scare you."

"And why NOT?"

""Cause that's Jerry's job."

"Alright. Then which one of you is Jerry? I demand-"

The doors slammed open and a foul mist poured inside. It boiled across the room in a wave, smelling of blood and rotting fish. Then there came the sound, a soft, slithering, suckling noise that emanated from below, swirling and twisting, rippling beneath, unseen.

The first tentacle shot up and wrapped around the woman's neck. It's pulsating flesh coated with grey-green ooze. Leeches crawled and wriggled from the slime, searching for exposed skin to feed upon. The second curled up slower, slithering around her waist.

The kids screamed and pulled at the hands that gripped them, but they were held fast. The woman just stood there: silent, shaking. Something moved within the mist, a figure, sliding forward until it's face bore down and settled on the shoulder of it's victim. Glistening lips pulled back to reveal rows of razor-sharp teeth. It smiled and hissed:

"*Hiiiii. I'm Jerry.*"
