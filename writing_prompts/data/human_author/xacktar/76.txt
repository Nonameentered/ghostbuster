In the middle of the Cornfield County fair, on a small hill beneath the Ferris wheel, there sat two lawn chairs. One was occupied by a middle-aged man with the same plaid shirt, worn jeans, and sun-burnt bald spot as so many others in the fairgrounds that day. The only thing that differentiated him from the others was the large fishing net in his hands and the scowl on his face.

That was until the second seat was taken up by a man much like him, sans the net and sporting a slightly different pattern to his plaid shirt.

"Mornin, Lenny."

"Morning, Kenny." The net-holder nodded back. "Had the funnel cake yet?"

"Yup." 

"Was burnt."

"Was."

Lenny paused as there was a scream heard overhead. He looked up and adjusted his net for a second. "Corndogs were good."

"They were."

"Onion rings were too sour."

"Yup, they skimped on the sweet onions." Kenny agreed.

"Should never skimp on sweet onions."

"Yup."

Another teenage scream overhead caused them both to look. The net was stretched out to catch a bright pink iPhone as it came plummeting down. It landed with barely a sound.

"What 'bout them apple fries?" Kenny asked.

"Burnt my mouth on 'em." Lenny said as he dug the phone out of the net and put it in a bag he had beside the lawn chair. "They don't let 'em cool long enough."

"People get pissy waiting for food."

"They do."

"They'd get real pissy if they made em wait just because they hot."

"Fair 'nuff."

A round of raucous laughter from the Ferris wheel made both their heads snap upwards again. The net was repositioned for a second, then both net and heads tilted back down.

Kenny sighed, winced, and reached deep down into his jeans pocket, pulling out a smooshed blob in silver wrapping.

"Whatcha got there?" 

"A mint."

Lenny's head swung around. "What mint?"

"The mint from the maze."

"What mint from the maze?"

"The maze mint."

"There's a maze mint?"

"Yeah, right in the middle." Kenny unpeeled the melted object and tossed it in his mouth. "Ith there efery year."

"Bullshit!"

"Not bullshit."

"I do the corn maze every year" Lenny raised his net in protest.

"No, you don't"

"I do so!"

"No, you don't!" Kenny raised a finger. "You sit outside the maze exit and spit watermelon seeds at the kids leaving."

"Oh, right." Lenny looked up at the sound of a random curse word and caught a second cell phone with a twitch of the net. "Here, you take it."

He handed the net over and then performed the complicated series of motions needed to get standing again.

"Ya going for the mint?" Kenny asked.

"I'm going for the mint." Lenny popped his back into place, then turned and started to amble down the hill.

"Maze's that way, ya know!" Kenny pointed 

"I know!" Lenny shouted back. "Goin' to the fruit stand."

"Fruit stand?"

"Gonna need me some watermelon first, ain't I?"
