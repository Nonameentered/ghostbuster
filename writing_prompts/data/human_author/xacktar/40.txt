"No, no, no, and NO!" Carl Boutwhick shook his head, his hands, and, inadvertently, his gut.

**I DID AS INSTRUCTED.** 

His student looked at him and he looked at his student. For Carl, this required quite a bit of leaning back and angling his neck. Not only was Death standing atop the small stage of the  *HIGH-Larity Comedy Club,* but it was clear that he was the type who shopped for 'Big and Tall' when he needed a new robe. 

**I USED RULE OF THREE.** He raised his arm and started ticking off items on his fingerbones, **STRANGULATION, ENSANGUINATION, DROWNING. THOSE ARE THREE THINGS.**

Carl began pacing along the front row of empty fake red velvet seats. How did this happen? Why him, of all people? He wasn't even a comedian. He was the night manager and sometimes-costumed mascot for the club. It shoulda been Big Lee 'The Banana' Bernhard or Ry 'The Guy' Noteman who was stuck with the rare, existential dread of not only dealing with Death, but dealing with Death like they were an earnest, but confused, grandparent. 

"Look, Death, buddy, pal, best friend-a-rino." Carl flashed a smile, not his best smile, but it was smile-ish, "The rule of three doesn't work if all three items are terribly depressing."

**I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.**

"Comedy is about reversing expectations! You have to learn to figure out what people will and won't expect."

**BUT THEY WILL EXPECT A JOKE.**

"Yes, true." Carl paused, his face screwed up, then screwed back down, "But that's different."

**HOW?**

"Because..." Carl waved his hands in the air, wishing that all he'd had to do today was wear that creepy clown costume, spin his oversized, novelty anvil around over his head, and wave at the dogs in passing cars. "Because... they expect a joke *in general*, but what you want to do is surprise them in a *specific* way! Here, try this: What is something you know surprises people?"

**ME.**

"That's... what?"

**PEOPLE ARE QUITE SURPRISED TO SEE ME.**

"I...well, yes. I guess that's true."

**EVEN WHEN THEY WERE EXPECTING ME. EVEN WHEN THEY HAD JUST FINISHED SAYING THINGS LIKE 'I'M DYING, HELP ME I'M DYING!' AND 'SO THIS IS HOW I DIE. WHAT A CROCK.'** Death paused and tapped a fingerbone on his jawbone. **IS THAT HUMOROUS?**

"Well... in a way, sort of. The thing is, well, the thing is-"

**YES?**

"Death isn't funny when he's the one telling the joke."

**I DO NOT UNDERSTAND**

"You worry people." Carl stopped his pacing and leaned up against the stage, staring out at the empty seats and imagining what an audience would do if they were sitting in them at that very moment. "Nobody knows what comes after death, but you know. You know it and you can show them, BAM, like that, right?"

**BUT I DO NOT KILL.**

"I know, I know. You don't kill people, you just make sure they die. It's an important difference. I heard you, I get it." Carl did not, in fact, get it. "The point is, that scared people don't make the best audience for comedy. They prefer a more, let's say, somber tone when they are faced with their own fragile mortality."

**I SEE.** Death lifted his empty skull. **AH. I UNDERSTAND.**

"You do?"

**YES.** He nodded, **TO BE FUNNY I MUST FIRST EXPLAIN WHAT COMES AFTER.**

"Er..."

**ONCE THEY UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF WHAT BEFALLS AT THE END OF THEIR EXISTENCE THEN THEY WILL NOT BE AFRAID.** Death grinned down at Carl. **AND I WILL TELL JOKES.**

Carl opened his mouth, then shut it, then resisted the urge to pull out the few bits of remaining hair that still clung to the skin around his ears.

"Noooo!" He wailed. 

**WHY NOT?**

"Because... " Because every religious order on earth will have a bloody conniption fit if the exact truth about the afterlife becomes fact instead of myth. "It would cause problems."

Death stood still for a long moment. He was incredibly good at that. If you let him sit there for more than five minutes most people assumed he was a novelty coatrack. Thus, when he spoke again it make Carl jump just a little. 

**COMEDY IS HARD.**

"Yup, and dying is easy. I know, I know."
