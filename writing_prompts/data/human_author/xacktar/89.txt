"You know... tonight wasn't awful."

Louise would have smiled if her smile had left her face at all in the last hour. Now, the most she could do is crinkle her eyes just that bit more as she dug through her purse for her keys.

"Oh, totally. No screaming, no gravy spills, no fight with a waiter..." Tim waved his hands in mimicry of all of these events.

"I... have your other dates been that bad?"

"Well, it was one date." Tim sighed with all the exaggerated flair that a theatre major could rustle up. "I really should stop dating supermodels, yet here I am again with *another* gorgeous woman."

Louise giggled and then forced herself to focus on the search for her keys just to keep her head from floating off. Her hands scraped against cold metal under the tissue packet and she grabbed at it, pulled them up into her hand, and turned back. 

"You know..." Keys shook in her hand despite her trying to keep a grip on them. "It's been a long night..."

"No kidding! It's, like, what? Two in the morning now?" Tim checked his phone. "Crazy that we sat there talking till closing."

"Yeah..." Louise took a deep breath. "If you want to come in for a bit before you go... I could make us coffee?"

"Aw, man, I'd love to! I can't do coffee, though. I'd be up allll night and tomorrow we have rehearsals and-"

"It doesn't have to be coffee!" Keys shook with the words. "We could just...rest... some, on the couch or..."

She looked down and wished the wind was much colder so it might cool down the heat her face was producing. 

"Oh man, if I sit down I am *not* getting back up again, ya know?"

"Mhm!" Louise stepped down from her porch till she was close enough to smell Tim's shampoo. "That's no problem. At all."

"No problem for you!" Tim laughed. "I gotta get home and stuff."

"...do you? Really?"

"Well, duh, yeah. That's where my bed it. Can't sleep without a bed."

"I have a bed."

"Yeah, uh, of course you do. Everyone does."

Louise looked up into the grin and contemplated her choices up to this point. Tim was looking at her, right at her, and he was hearing everything she said. 

"You- you're sure you don't want to come in?"

"Nah, I don't wanna keep you up."

"I'd be fine with that." Louise decided to drop all the pretext for one final stab, "You can keep me up all night, Tim."

"Aww." He locked eyes with her, bent down and suddenly everything in the world was concentrated on the feeling in her lips and her hands and-

Tim broke the kiss and leaned back. "That's sweet, but I gotta run. See ya at rehearsals!"

She watched him as he jogged off down the row. sighed heavily and went inside with only a single, harsh word escaping her lips:

*"Boys!"*
