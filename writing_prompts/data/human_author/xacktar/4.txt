You have quite a few errors in the first few sentences due to extra words, things like this:

> For a while I struggled to *make out with* the features around me.

And 

> A few sparsely *spaced placed* plants on a barren landscape that spread out to a flat horizon.

So you might want to give it a quick read-aloud. This always helps me find these kinds of things!
