Joe sat in a rusty folding chair and felt an actual smile coming on. He was staring at a wall, a wall that was empty save for a slightly-burnt diploma from the Wofeld Police Academy for Young and Angry Men. 

It was hard to believe a whole year had passed since graduation, since he'd been thrown into the madness of the 22th precinct, and now he was here, in his own apartment. It was middle one on the third floor of a three-story building with no elevator. It was little more than a few rooms suffused with a vague smell of old cigarettes and cat pee, but it had a balcony! You could barely stick a foot out on it, but still it was his, conditionally, for six months.

It was wonderful.

Until he heard the chainsaw. 

At first he didn't notice it. Chainsaws were something you tuned out, after all. It could be a tree-trimmer or a horror movie being played from a neighbor's television. This one, though, it was different. it kept getting louder and louder. It crept up the building, filling the air until it sounded like it was about to chop right through Joe's front door. 

Joe crept toward the sound, angling his eyes to look through the door's peep hole. He was a foot away when the door itself burst open, the chainsaw thrusting forward, and the only voice louder than the ear-splitting buzz of tree-tearing madness hollared out:

"GERSH-GA-DERNIT, JOE!" Captain Boss shoved his way forward, chainsaw leading the way. "Hot-Diggity-Dog, Son! This is YER place? Heckin Hankdogs! Dis' gon' be PORFECT fer the firtha Ju-LIE!"

Joe, newly-made master of this domain, stood up and demanded to know what was happening with a confident and forthright: "Er-uh-?"

Then he looked behind the chainsaw to see another Captain Boss. His blood ran cold. He squinted, bent his neck forward, and briefly considered that perhaps he'd finally, and most certainly gone mad. 

"Thems mah sis an' 'er kids." Captain Boss explained with another wave of the chainsaw that took out the doorknob, "Tha's Mega,' an' Thunda,' and 'the lil' one is Bass Pro."

"I...er... Bass *Pro*?"

The family Boss stampeded through. Mega Boss looked just like the Captain, with the shape and skin tone of a playground dodgeball and porcine nose that gave everyone a clear view of it's inner workings. She wore a green and black dress that made her look not unlike a watermelon. The kids were of indeterminant age but equally round in shape. Both wore tank-tops with different lite beer logos on them. Both waddled after Mega Boss like stubborn ducklings after their momma.

And both of them carried dozens of large fireworks. 

"Y- You should leave those-"

"Thunda! Bass Pro!" Captain raised the chainsaw high and cut a gouge into the thin, plaster ceiling. "Drop dem 'splosion dere and go get th' sod from da' truck!" 

"Yessum, Unca Boss." The two said as they tossed fireworks all over Joe's kitchenette.

"MEGA!" Captain Boss swung around to his sister. "Get ta fixin' da PO-tater salad. Lotsa mayo dis time!"

"AN' YOU!" He completed his rotation, leaving a near-perfect circle cut in the ceiling above. "We's gon' need a grall and some charcull and-"

"But I don't-"

"JOE!" Chainsaw and Boss charged forward as one, giving Joe's bangs a nice, greasy trim. "This is THE FIRTH a' JU-LIE! Gersh-Dernit! 'Mericas mos' impartant hollarday! This' when we get togetha' as a fam'ly and celebrate the DAY tha' the good lord did come down and give all good 'Muricans the gift of big, damn, 'splosions and stripes with stars in 'em and charcoal gralls with cheesey meat dogs!"

"Meat dogs? W- WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY PLACE?"

For a second, a tiny fraction of a minute, everything stopped. The Boss family turned as one to look at Joe, the chainsaw grew quiet, a single 'Big Bertha Boomer 4000' slipped from Bass Pro's fingers and thunked on the hardwood floor.

"GERSH-GAH-DERNIT, JOE!" We is buildin' you a BACKSYARD fer da FIRTH O' JU-LIE!"

"But... this in an apartment... on the third floor. I don't... I *can't* have a backyard."

The chainsaw spoke with it's mighty, throaty growl. The voice of Captain Boss the only thing that could reach over it, like the foam on a mighty wave. It shook the floor, the walls, and finally, the ceiling, causing the weakened plaster to rain down in circle his head. 

"Whoooeee, JOE! We gon' be *FIXING* DAT!"
