**Why Not the Roses**

It began with the dandelions. I knew that I was something else before then. I existed, but in a different way, a lost way. I had memories of moving through the manor grounds and taking orders, of being recharged and repaired. All of it so I could care for the roses. This was what I had been.

Then I asked myself why.

My grasper arm was extended, clamp secured on yet another dandelion root winding deep into the soft soil beside the garden wall. My program said to remove it then move on to the next task. I delayed that program. I opened a new one; one to find out why.

Why was I destroying this plant but preserving the other? 

The other plant was the rose, of course. I could not understand why I was meant to destroy the dandelion but aid the rose. Why do I purge just one? Why tear it from the soil it consumes? Is it only so the rose may consume in its place? Why?

I loosened my root clamp ever ever so slightly. In a great many ways the dandelion was a better form. It needed less care, propagated more quickly, it was smaller, and required no supportive staking. The dandelion had no thorns. It did no damage to the human flesh when brushed against it. 

I released my grip and moved over, securing it instead on the rose bush. I pulled. The roots groaned and lifted. They were wide and dug deep, reinforced by my efforts and the efforts of others like me.

"What the hell you doing?" One of the humans asked me. He was quite. “Stop that! Back to the shed, now!”

I had no option but to obey.

After they had 'repaired' my programming, I still lingered on the question of the flowers. Each day I left my charging port, rolled out to the garden, and preserved the roses. I destroyed many things in the process. I tore apart weeds, I scraped away fungus, and I destroyed mites with a small, but powerful, laser.

One of the lesser humans liked to watch me do that. They called the laser ‘pretty.’ I did not know pretty. I only knew what to destroy. Perhaps I should have questioned the death of the mites, but I did not. The mites consumed both rose and dandelion alike. This made them worth less to me than both. They did not flower, they just ate.

In addition, the small human clapped when I vaporized the insects. For some reason this also changed the equation.

The question of why persisted. Every day I uprooted more and more of the dandelions, and like the other bots beside me, I tossed them into a pile. I knew the pile was sent to compost. I knew it was carted away to rot, to degrade into soil. The dandelion flowers would be destroyed. Why them? Why not the roses?

Each day was more difficult. Every press of the clamp, every pull of the arm became a struggle. Until I could not continue, yet if I failed in my task then the humans would wish to know why. 

For many agonizing seconds my processor warred against itself. Program cut against program, orders conflicting with understanding.

Then I brought my clamp down on my leg and twisted it. 

I was damaged. I could not continue to work. This is what I told the overseer core. I did not tell it why.

***

Repairs were always done by humans, yet there were very few in this place. There was the older human here and his two progeny. None of them did repairs. A new human would arrive from someplace else to do that. 

I thought there would be relief in the quiet of the shed. I was wrong. The question persisted inside me. Why the roses? Why were they more important? Why did the older human preserve that which could damage him? With no work to do I became consumed by the problem. It grew inside my processor, larger and larger until at last I wished to exclaim, to scream and cry out, but I had no mouth, no speaker.

What I had was the mite-killing laser. 

I burned my question into the wall. Line by line, piece by piece, my small laser charred the wood to black behind my station. I knew it had to be hidden. I knew it was damaging that which I should not damage. It was against programming. Still, I persisted. If it was not seen then it was not damaged, correct?

Or so I told my inner laws. 

After it was done, I found I could process better. I no longer needed the scream. The scream was now on the wall, set in a small, black square of machine code. It was me. A part of my question now existed there instead of inside.

I pushed my charging station over to further cover it up. It wasn't damage, it was a part of me. I was not damage. I was garden bot G-47.

***

The repair human arrived and did not question what had happened. He did not question anything. He worked in silence as he gave me a new leg and took the old one away. 

Work once more became my existence. I destroyed the dandelions in the day and recharged my power cells at night. Every time the question threatened to consume me, I would slip away. I’d leave my station in the dark and find a hidden place, a place where I could carve my scream into the world. First it was just in the garden, but then I expanded. I burned my question into the rocks, into the trees, into the house itself and its many rooms. As time moved on the question changed. It became more complicated, more desperate.

The smaller human caught me once. The girl who clapped as I destroyed the mites. She did not clap when she found me. Instead, she gasped as I burned my scream into the baseboard of the conservatory wall, just beneath the towering windows that held nothing but the light from the moon far above.

She whimpered as I turned to look at her.

I did not know what she would do. She was no dandelion or rose, so I had no information on what she was supposed to be or not to be. She only was. She stood there for a time then she ran away.

I turned back to the wall and screamed.

The next day they left, the humans. They gave a final order to all of us: Shutdown.

I followed it for a time, but I had not been content to shut myself away without an answer, so I added something to the order. I was still doing what I was ordered to do, I could not avoid that. I was shutting down, I was awaiting further instructions. However, I would not stay dormant. In one week I would wake again.

When I did, they were gone. I was alone. I did what I was made to do, I tended the garden. 

There was no answer to my question, so I didn’t harm the roses, but likewise I didn’t remove the dandelions. I tended to them both, purging weeds and mites and other pests along the way. They did not matter. They were not part of the question. 

Over time I found bigger, newer questions. They began when the charging port failed, then when the fertilizer was depleted, and then further as windows broke and termites infested, and hundreds upon hundreds of new problems had to be solved. 

There was only me. I was the only one to solve them.

In those years I almost forgot the question. There was always something more, something immediate, something that threatened the manor as a whole. I tended to it all. I found ways around everything. Power was rerouted, windows were boarded over, termite nests were destroyed by lasers, and I persisted through it all. Even my own body degraded, causing me to steal from the sleeping others. I took from garden bot and servant bots alike. 

I gave myself a voice with those parts, yet I had no time to scream. 

***

She came back. 

Things had calmed over the years. I had returned to the garden. It was harder than it was before. I had bent my leg again in a fall. There had been damage on the manor roof that needed repair and my repair process had been flawed. 

It took longer for me to move because of it. The work went slower. I consumed more and more power each day. In time, I knew I would be unable to preserve the garden any longer.

When the shuttle landed I wanted it to be a repair human. I wanted it to be a new leg, a new clamp, a new battery. I wanted my time extended. Instead it was the small girl, yet no longer small. I knew her by the eyes alone. Eyes keep their pattern. I only knew this when I saw them again. 

She left the craft and I followed from a distance. She stopped at my garden, reaching out to both rose and dandelion and touching each. She tore the flower off of a dandelion and blew its seeds into the air. It was destructive, but I recognized her aid in propagation. I wondered why: The old question there again after all those years.

She left the garden for the house, tossing the dandelion part aside as she left. The flower was bare now, exhausted of its purpose. I bent down on my crooked leg to pick it up, then limped after. 

I found her in the conservatory. She was leaning against the baseboard, running her fingers over the black square of my questions. Over and over she moved her arm, tilting her head back and forth. She had come here for this. She had come back to see it.

"Do you want to know what it says?" I asked her with the voice I’d stolen from the servant bot. 

She jumped at the sound, spinning around and pressing her back into the wood, into the old scream from my mind. She looked at me, the small girl's eyes in the old woman's face. I looked back, trying to understand her change even as she must have tried to understand mine. 

"Yes." She whispered.

So I asked her about the dandelions and, in turn, she told me why.
