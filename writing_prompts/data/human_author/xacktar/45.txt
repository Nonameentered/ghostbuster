Hi Kat!

I love the way you weave such subtle flaws into your characters. You have these characters that are genuinely dislikable, or covertly affable, and more. 

What I want to know is what do you do in your character creation process to add those small, subtle traits into them so well, and what inspires their unique flavor? Is it something planned or is it something that grows as you write them out?
