Abner Winwhittle swished his next projectile from cheek to cheek. The problem was tracking. Your average wad of spit was a little thing. It could hardly be tracked by eye for more than twenty stories, much less the record fifty-eight that Abner was aiming for. He'd tried a variety of strategies. He'd tried mixing fluid ratios, enlarging the projectile, even putting a spin on the launch under the hypothesis that rapid movement might help highlight it once it got further out. 

Nothing worked, nothing.

""Heya, Abner!" Came a squeal-like shout from behind. 

"Hey Chuck," Abner called back. 

Chuck thumped over the tar-patched roof and stuck his head over the concrete wall so that he was sharing the distended posture of his friend. A popsicle stick stuck out from his mouth. It danced and wobbled from side to side as Chuck took in the busy street below. 

"Still tryin' for th' white top?"

Abner grunted his answer. The white-top Rolls Royce. His nemesis. It showed up every Sunday at three. Gary, the maintenance guy, said that it belonged to the owner of the apartment building. He came for the rent money. Maybe Abner shoulda cared about that but he didn't. The only thing he cared about was the perfectly white square centered on a street of black and grey.

"It's impossible!" Abner pushed himself off the wall and kicked a pebble. "I can hit anything, ya know? I hit Bodger Watkins straight in the eye from twelve feet, you saw it!"

"Even Mr. Grady was impressed!" Chuck called back, his head still poked over.

Abner nodded. "And the fireman's helmet? Hit that from three stories up over at my auntie's place. Only had seconds ta judge the distance on account of the truck being movin' and all."

"Heard about that one too." Chuck popped off of the wall and crunched on his popsicle. 

"But this!" Abner raised his hands and dropped them with all the dramatic effect of a chicken trying to take flight. "I can't tell what I'm hittin.' It's too far!"

"Why doncha wad some paper in it, like theys do in school?"

Abner shook his head. How could he explain it to dear, sweet Chuck. Paper would mean it wasn't him. It wouldn't be the pure, straight-shootin art of the spit.' It'd be spit-ballin,' an *entirely* different sport altogether. A sport that allowed outside modification just didn't hold the same appeal. 

"Anyone could do that!" Abner shouted. "I'm tryin' ta keep it legimittant!"

"Wassat?"

"Means I ain't cheatin!"

"Ohh." Chuck pulled the stick from his mouth and grinned. "Are my teeth blue?"

Abner turned to look. They were. Every inch of his mouth was bright-

"Chuck... "

"Yeah?"

"You have another popsicle?" Abner's hopes hung on the words. 

"Yeah, we got a four-pack? Want one?"

With dreams of the white-top dancing in his head, there was nothing that Abner could want more.
