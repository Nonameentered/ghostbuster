Ethan held the phone in shaking hands. He read the same words over and over again on the tiny screen while he sat, perched like a roman statue, on the closed lid of the toilet. Outside the thin, wood-veneer of the bathroom door chaos reigned. 

He could hear the squeals and shouts and the thunder of little, stubby feet as they thumped up and down the stairs. He heard his wife laughing, that short, sharp sound that first burst out, then tittered away into silent giggles. 

There was nothing in the world he loved more than that laugh, yet for the first time in his life it didn't bring a smile. For the first time, it didn't steal away his worry and his stress and make the outside world feel like a foreign place, somewhere far away from the little circle of wilderness that he felt so warm within. 

Ethan stood, pocketed his phone, and pushed brightly-colored toothbrushes and assorted bath toys out of the way just enough to wash hands that didn't need cleaning. Instead, he just kept the cold water rushing over them until they stopped shaking. 

The number four rattled around in his head, over and over. Nothing but a little number, not even an interesting number like seventeen or thirty-nine, just... four. 

"Dadddy!" 

Two feet of pudgy toddler slapped onto Ethan's leg, wrapping hands around his thigh and wiggling back and forth. A set of bright blue eyes looked up at him, the same color and shape as his mother's. He loved those eyes and all that they belonged to. 

Four. 

He tried to remember what he should do with his son. On any other day he would have known. He wouldn't have to think about it, but now as he stared down he couldn't see it. He couldn't think. All he could think about was that he was:

Four. 

"Daddy, pick me up!"

That was it. That's what he was supposed to do. He bent down, ignoring the sharp pains in his back and side, gritting teeth as he lifted his son and hugged him tight, pushing his nose into tawny blond hair that smelled like peanut better. 

"Charley, you need a bath!" The response was automatic. He'd said it a thousand times before. 

"Nooo." Little arms and legs wiggled back and forth. The toddler escaped, free to run off back down the hall, far away from the bathtub and any kind of soap. 

"Oh, you let him go." His wife's voice, a voice he loved, a voice he wanted to capture forever. 

Four. Ever.

He turned to his wife, and much like little Charley, wrapped his arms around her and tried his best not to let go. 

"Ethan..." She knew. It was in her voice. Thirteen years together meant she knew. 

"I'm sorry, dear." He whispered to her. "It's stage four."
