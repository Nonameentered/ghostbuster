The summer sun felt endless on their open-toed sandals as Shad and Mitch flip-flopped down the cracked and faded asphalt. Texas State Route 67-B was bare and empty. There were no cars, no trucks, only dust and tumbleweeds and the two young men yelling at each other over its empty lines. 

Shad Willis was flip-flopping behind his brother in their two-man caravan of sadness. He was the shorter one, the grumpier one, and, according to his brother Mitch, the 'Worst brother in the history of all brothers, Cain included'.

"I can't believe you lost the car!" Shad tried to kick a rock but just ended up slipping it into his sandal underneath his middle toe. 

"For the last time, we didn't lose the car, dude!" Mitch rolled his eyes, and head, his shoulder-length dark hair, and some parts of his shoulders, "We know where the car is!"

"Yeah, it's in a ditch." 

"See? Not lost."

"Okay, *fine!*" Shad snapped. "Then I can't believe you lost the tire!"

"We didn't lose that either!"

"You know what I mean." Shad's tone became more grizzly-bear-like. "No lug nuts, no tire. No tire, no car!"

"Oh, that's my fault now?" Mitch spun and started walking backwards just so he could glare in the right direction, "I told *you* to hold the lug nut! *YOU* dropped it!" 

"That was just one! What happened to the others?"

"I dunno." Mitch spun back around, "I put 'em down somewhere."

Shad let out a long, hoarse scream at the sky, then crossed the road to trudge in his own lane of non-existent traffic. 

"'Let's take a vacation!'" He yelled out in a sarcastic imitation of his brother's voice. "'Time for some fun in the sun! Go down to Mexico, hit the beaches, stick our toes in the sand....'"

"What the hell you talking about?"

"MY TOES ARE DONE WITH SAND!" 

Mitch rolled his everything again. "Will you stop with the dramatics, okay? We got our backpacks, we got water, we got foo-"

"Breath mints do not count as food!"

"-our mints, money, cell phones-"

"Which have ZERO service!"

"-And... oh, hell."

"What? What this time?"

Mitch swung his bag around to his chest and started rooting through it, using his hands like claws to scrap empty Dorito bags and silvery gum wrappers aside to reach the heavier goodies far below. 

"What? What's wrong now?"

"Forgot my sunscreen." Mitch frowned.

"...Great."

"I'll just use yours."

"No, you will not!" Shad crossed back over and snatched the small plastic tube out of his brother's hand. "Get your own heat stroke."

"Harsh."

"You 'Harsh!'" Shad grunted, then winced. "I mean... you... shut up!"

"God, you are such a whiner." Mitch zipped the bag back up and slung it around to his back. "Are you gonna start with 'Are we there yet?' next? Maybe some 'I gotta use the bafroom!' too?"

"Shut up, Mitch!"

The hot, desert wind picked up and blew over them. There were no tumbleweeds, no laconic guitar song in the background. It was nothing like the Texas they'd seen on TV. It was just dry, half-dead scrubland all around. Nothing to look at but the road stretched out before them.

Shad eventually dislodged the stone from his sandal and sent it flying off into a bush. "I hate summer." 

"What?"

"The summer sun was NOT meant for boys like me!" Shad grunted. "Boys like me belong to the rain. Give me a goddamned Seattle thunderstorm any day."

"The hell does that mean?"

"It means 'Shut Up, Mitch!'" 

"Psh." Mitch made his own attempt at kicking a pebble and succeeded. "Keep this up and you aren't getting a mix tape when we get back."

"I don't want a mix tape!"

"Dude, don't lie. Everyone wants a mix tape."

Shad marched up next to his brother in silence. He kept his gaze fixed ahead, locked on a bent and shot-up road sign that announced the next rest area was fifteen miles away. He stared at the sign, at the number, then down at his red and blistering feet in their cheap, Wal-Mart sandals. 

"Shad..." Mitch said his brother's name in a quiet, almost reverent way. "I just want you to know... when we finally see another car, or truck, or whatever, I just want you to know..."

"Yes?"

"I'm gonna push you in front of it."
