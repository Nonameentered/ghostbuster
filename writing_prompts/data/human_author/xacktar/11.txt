Larm sat, as he always had, upon his pedestal beside the  sleeper. Larm required only three things to complete the rising. First, the brass umbrella; It's weight both a comfort and burden. He had to hold it, for to release it was to risk the end. Second was the strength to hold it steady, hold it still. It must not move until the time was right, until the end. 

The third was the counting. A counting that was went beyond the mere thinking of numbers in the head. It went from hundreds into thousands, then thousands into tens of thousands. One had not the time to recite each number, only to imagine it within. The endless march that consumed the mind, blanked it, made it into a madness that infested all thought.

*86,392... 86,393...*

The sleeper was beside him, just beyond his sight. It's ancient form lay still for much of the counting. Larm was but a mole beside the mountain. The grand plinth it slept upon was a thing unnatural. Great trees, so tall Larm could never see the tops, had died for the plinth. Mountains had been torn asunder, their hearts ripped out to craft the bones of it's construction. Greater still were the herds of animals sheered and slaughtered to make the skin of the great plinth, for the skin could not be cast from the mountain, it had to begin with the blooded beast. 

*86,397...86,398...*

The hour was nigh. Larm could feel it in the numbers. The great rising was here, after long last, after so much time, which existed for him in a limbo of ascension. The great expanse of stacking was closing, coming to an end. Soon the rising would be here. It would come. He felt these things but he could not think them, he could not say them, for he could only count. 

Only his heart was left to feel.

*86,400!*

Larm rose with the brass umbrella, lifting it higher in limbs sore and stiff. He gloried in the release from the counting, taking the sweet reprieve to think about the nature of his existence, it's agony, it's sweet release. This moment, this glorious moment when the there were no numbers, no counting, no endless desert of the mind. For now was the Rising! Now was the time!

He held the umbrella aloft and shook it, releasing a sound like a thousand screaming beetles. A sound that consumed all, rose into the mind, broke it open and reformed it.

The Sleeper Rose.

Throwing off the skins of the dead, it rolled over. Great jaws widened and sought air. It brought it's arm up, a great hand rising.

Larm crumpled as it fell upon his umbrella. Many before him had broken under its weight, but he would not. 

Then he heard it. The great curse, the return to the counting, to the unending. For the sleeper rolled back onto his plinth and announced to all:

"Ugh, Gimme five more minutes..."
