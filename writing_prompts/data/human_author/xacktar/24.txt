Hey KAT! I think you might have double-copied part of your story here! I think you left a copied section from a previous edit draft up. Uhhh, so... I'm gonna edit the lower copy.

> “Oh, please do excuse me. Capes are such a nuisance in battle. Here, why don’t you take mine instead? It’s unsoiled.”

I think this might flow better if you drop the 'In battle.' part. As it is an exclamation of sorts, the qualifier slows it down. Plus, we get the  idea they are in battle by the very next line.

> “Oh, drat. Then I’d be stuck in the dry cleaning conundrum. .. Shall we just stab each other and be done with it?”

This is a tiny, tiny crit, but since this is a tiny, tiny piece I'm gonna give it anyways. I think that the 'Drat' is a bit underwhelming. It might be fun to use a more interesting/haughty exclamation here, something along the lines of 'Misery Me!" or "Oh, heavens!' 

That's all I got! Hope it helps!
