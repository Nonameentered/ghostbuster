Hi Chop! Just read this for campfire and noticed you have a lot of word pairs that should be hyphenated but are not. For example: 

"Silver whiskered"

"lichen covered"

"moss covered"

"weather scarred"

All of these need a little hyphen between them as they are written in the piece. Hope this helps!
