"Billy? Are you there?"

"Hi, Mom."

"Are you still at the store?"

"Yep. You forget something?"

"Yeah. I forgot the... oh, gosh. The...um.... you know what it is! The, uh, the...spotty bread!"

"Spotty... bread?"

"You know! It's the bread that has the spots on it. The blue and yellow and such... it's all over it. Oh dang, I can't for the life of me remember what it's called. Gosh darn it. It has the spots! You know?"

"Are you talking about muffins?"

"What? No. I told you it was bread! Bread isn't muffins."

"But you were talking about blue spots."

"And yellow!" 

"Okay, and yellow... Bread shouldn't have spots."

"Oh, not on the- No! In the closet! THE CLOSET!"

"The spotty bread is in the closet?"

"What? Oh, no. I'm talking to your father. He's trying to clean the gutters."

"He's cleaning the gutters in *the closet!?*"

"What? No, of course not. He needs the dust buster."

"Why does he need- You know what, never mind. Tell him to stop. Right now. Keep him inside and away from the gutters until I get there. *Jesus H. Cheese and Crackers...* Look, mom, just... keep him there."

"How am I supposed to do that? You know how your father is!"

"Yes... and I also know there is a thunderstorm outside. With lightning. Just keep him inside. Take the dust buster away from him. Just... please, do this for me. I'll find your spotty bread."

"I told you the bread isn't spotty! It's the packaging. It has spots. Yellow, red, and blue and-"

"OH! OH, okay. I got it now. I know what you mean. Right right right. Now go keep dad from killing himself, please."

"But how am I supposed to do that? He's already got the dust buster."

"I don't know. Ask him about spotty bread! I gotta go. Be home soon."

"Okay, bye! Love you!"

"Love you too, mom."
