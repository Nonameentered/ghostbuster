"There you are," Frank Lethursty snapped open the door with a flourish. "We are so glad you accepted our invitation, Mr. Timudice."     
"H-Hey, er, hello, I-" Vic stammered as he was forcibly yanked inside the steamy glass doors of the private, indoor pool. 

Everything had seemed fine on the invite, just a pool party with the folks at work. Pool parties weren't anything to be scared of, right? Of course that's what he'd thought. Of course he'd been wrong.

"Let us proceed to introductions, my young man." Frank was saying, his hand on Vic's back, pushing him past the pool that Vic couldn't seem to take his eyes off of.

"I-Is that... the pool, it's full of-"

"So much to see, yes. We'll get to that later, my little lamb, later!"

Frank ended his push at a small group of people that Vic recognized from work. Unfortunately it was only now that he noticed how similar they all were, the thin physique, the black hair, the pale skin.
 
"Lovely to see you, My boy," Mr. Ulah said.  

Lord Drake Ulah was the big boss, CEO, master of all. On a normal day, Vic would have been terrified of losing his job should he ever run into the spry, old man, but today he was terrified for all new reasons.

"Fresh-faced and looking just soooo *delicious!* Aha!" Came the squeaky, high-pitched voice of Ulah's secretary, Cindy Meetin.

"Bl-bl-bl... in the-I-I was j-just stopping by...t-to...I'll-" Vic managed to get out, "S-see you at work t-tomorrow."

Lord Drake Ulah frowned down at him, eyes like burning filaments in an Edison bulb. 

"Oh, you can't leave yet." Frank said as he set two thin, yet strangely powerful hands on Vic's shoulders, "Not without a swim."

Of all the things Vic didn't want to do, the top one at that moment was swimming in the pool. 

"Dinner is so much better after a little workout, after all." Frank whispered.
