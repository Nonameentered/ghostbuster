"It ain't gonna fit."

Sylvia was certain. The pavilion might have been big enough to accommodate a small wedding party, but not the crumpled wad of brown nylon and thirty-pound air compressor that inhabited it now. 

"Nah, it'll fit." Jordan reassured as he swaggered back from plugging everything in. "No problem."

Sylvia shook her head. "It gonna blow up."

"It's an inflatable. Ya can't 'blow up' an inflatable!" Jordan paused and scrunched his face up, "Well, not like that. 'Course ya can blow it up like huff-huff blow it up, but not like *Pssh-Brchhhk!*"

"But-"

"I said don't worry, girl!" Jordan put an arm around her. "Dis is gonna be great. The whole thing gonna be a big-ol' turkey for the parade. Gonna be all over the socials."

The turkey's head chose that moment to slowly unfurl over the pavilion steps, right between two beautifully-carved support beams,

"But..."

"Picture time!" Jordan spun around with his phone and used the flash right in Sylvia's face. 

By the time she got her eyesight back it was too late. The pavilion was ninety-percent inflatable turkey now. Every gap bulged with brown nylon and yellow feathers. The air trembled with the sound of cracking wood.

"Jordan!" 

The first support failed with a deafening pop, flying end-over-end across the grass and into the park fountain. The second tore out and tumbled through a crosswalk before knocking against the door to a Vietnamese restaurant. The third just snapped in half, but the fourth! The fourth support bent and groaned and quivered under the stress as the turkey reached maximum volume.

Then it shot out like a toothpick under a cinderblock, right through the treetops. It dislodged four kites, one kickball, and forty-eight squirrels before impaling itself in a parked Cadillac.

"Told ya it could blow up."
