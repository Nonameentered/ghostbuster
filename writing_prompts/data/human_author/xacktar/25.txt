HFSODN! So good to see you writing again! Yay!

Hey, I have crit for you!

> It’s the village bonfire currently and I reluctantly came, unsure whether I wanted you to be here or not.

Using two adverbs in the sentence detracted a bit from the impact of it.

You mention light in the eyes twice in the second big paragraph. 

The line about 'mean smart' was very clever and very real! I like it.

>Not just because of all the lovely things you’ve written about me, though I don’t believe half of them as you have a beautiful way with words that reality doesn’t always live up to.

This is a very fragmented fragment and it took me a few reads to understand what was being said. I think it might be better if it was broken up a bit.

> I wasn't expecting to stumble into this when I picked up the abandoned journal I saw on the grass and I also have no idea where you may be.

I think perhaps the detail of where he found it is a bit too much telling? I like the idea of his saying how surprised he was that this was her journal, but giving the location seemed a bit forced.

That's all I really have for now. You really nailed the flustered feeling of thinking about a crush, which is nice! Reading this brought me back to my middle school days for a bit! XD

Hope this helps!
