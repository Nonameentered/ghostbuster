"Dude, like, what the hell you doin, Bro?" Chad Bradderson flipped his Ultra-Raybans up to get a better look at his bro. 

Like, he totes couldn't believe what his eyes were, like, seeing. His dude, his bro, his total buddinski Rhett Van Ondabeach was, like, totally out by the pool with one of them foldy mirror-things up, all slathered in suntan lotion and stuff.

"Just soakin up the ray-rays, man!" Rhett told him. "C'mon and join me, Bro!"

"I can't do that, man. No one can."

"What you talkin' bout? We're in Miami, Chad! This what we gotsta do if we wanna get major babe-age, bro." Rhett shimmied his shoulders to emphasize his righteous point.

Chad just shook his head. "Nah, dude. It don't work like that."

"Man, why you being all harsh right now, brah?" Rhett dropped his mirror board and shimmied in an angrier fashion. "Whatchu got against some rays, man? We's in the F-L-O-Rida. This ain't the place to be all Raydolf Hitler, right? We don't need no Sundamn Huissein up in here."

"Dude, I ain't tryin ta harsh ya or anything."

"Then what you on about, Brah? Why you actin like you the tannish inquisition and all that?"

"Man, i's just..." 

Chad took a moment to, like, look around him and stuff. He totes soaked up the awesome palm trees, the hellasweet pool that was in the shape of another pool that was in the shape of shark drinkin' a mai-tai. He got stoked at the sandy beaches with the surfboards sticking out of them, waitin' for the next day of righteous waves to bring em out. His eyes closed as his ears totally hot-tubbed in the soothing sounds of Party Rock by LMFAO playing from the nightclub next door.

"...it's like, eleven PM, bro." Chad finally said as he opened his eyes to the moonlit sky, where a prop plane with a banner behind it telling all of Miami that 'Red Bull was Lit' lazily droned away overhead. "Ya just can't catch rays at night."

"Bull!"

"Not Bull, bro!"

"Nah, man, see, I been seein' this astrolmonner chick, right? She been tellin' me bout how there is rads and stuff from space, mega-rads, dude. So I figure, like, if you want hella righteous tans ya gotta get them space-rays at night."

"Fer real, brah?" Chad looked back at his bro, feelin a headache comin' on. "Then why don't anyone else be catchin' em?"

"Psh, brah." Rhetta rolled his eyes. "'Cause they ain't smart like us, man! We ahead of da curb on this shit!"

"Yeah? Well... alright."

"Hell yeah, brah. Here, grab some screen and shit. We gonna catch all the rays: X-Rays, Cosmic Rays, Manta Rays, Gamma Rays..."

"Oh hell no, man!" Chad stopped mid-grab for the sunscreen. "I don't want no green skin and purple pants, man! I can't be doin that Hulk stuff."

"Relax, dude!" Rhett laughed. "That's why we gots the sun screen, duh!"
