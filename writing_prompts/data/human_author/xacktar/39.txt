"I heard Brian is back with Marshiela." Carri whispered over the cubicle wall.

Janice gasped as she opened her fourth copy of form BN-50-H19, "No!"

"Yes!"

"I thought they were finish-ville after the whole hairball thing." Janice let her fingers fly over the keyboard while her ears begged for more secondhand romance gossip.

"They were, but *Brian* says he's into that now."

"No!"

"Yes."

"Scandalous!" Janice breathed with only the slightest hint of a blush. "Hey, Carri, do you know what to mark down for subsection RJ in a BN-50-H19 if it's a Tuesday?  2b or N-02b?"

"Hmm, I think it's N-02b, but I'm-"

"WRONG!" The words echoed through the office. Staplers rattled, monitors waggled, and the hundreds of motivational posters of cats just hanging in there stopped hanging in there. 

"Who-?"

"Wha-?"

The tremors stopped. Three young women in business suits marched down the cubicle aisle, waving their tax law binders in the air as they sang:

*"Who puts the X in Exactitude? It's Exactitudinal MANNNNN!"**

A seven-foot giant in a gray suit, grey tie, and gray hair marched down the aisle to Janice's cubicle and knelt down so he could wink at her from eye-level with his steel-gray eyes. 

"That's right! It is I, the accountancy hero! Here to save you from days and days of tedious tax law research!"

*"He's Exactitudinal! So exactitudinal!"*

"Haha, that's right! Filing a BN-50-H19 with N-02b marked in section 34-A would result the in disposal of the entire form due to incorrect formatting. If you wish to correctly process the file claim and receive the correct form in response, then always make sure to mark 34-A with 2b!"

"Oh gee!" Janice breathed, "I coulda royally screwed the pooch there. If you hadn't stopped me..."

"Then you would have had to refile from the beginning!" Exactitudinal Man threw his head back and laughed. "All the way back to P4J-1!"

"That'd been a right mess up!" Carri breathed from over the cubicle wall. "Boss woulda gone nutso!"

"There's no need to fear!" Exactitudinal Man stood back up and placed a gentle, ink-stained hand on Janice's shoulder. "For wherever there is financial strife, whenever there is numerical woe, whenever the collated forms rise up to swallow even the most stalwart of minds, *I'll* be there!"

Janice blushed and muttered. "Thanks. You, uh, you really saved my bacon." 

"No need to thank me, just remember correct filing procedure from now on. That will guarantee that you'll never get hurt by form BN-50-H19 again."

"I'll remember!"

*"Who has the knowledge, who has the plan? It's Exactitudinal MANNNNN!"*

"Come, my X-Girls, my misaligned stapling senses are tingling... we are needed on floor twenty-seven, pronto!"

*"Yes sir, Mr. X!"*

"Quick, To the X-avator!"

The hero and his crew dashed back down the aisle, leaving Janice and Carri breathless and in awe.

"So, anyways, about Marshiela...." Carri picked up where she'd left off.

"I know, I know." Janice huffed. "It's not that surprising. Brian always *was* a freak."
