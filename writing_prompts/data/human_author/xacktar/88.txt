One that helped me last year was not to stop writing at chapter or scene endings, but to stop a few sentences into the NEXT scene or chapter. 

It makes is much, much easier to pick up where you left off as those 2-3 sentences help remind you where you were going with your narrative and prevents the 'First Word Paralysis' some authors get.
