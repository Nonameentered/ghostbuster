The house sat on the corner. Not on the corner of two streets, or on the corner of a block, but instead on the pointed edge of the Wickson Township. It lingered between the grassy lawns turned to weeds and the *true* wilds beyond, those places unmarred by cracked concrete and fire hydrants. 

There'd been an old lady too, but she was no longer part of the house. Her funeral had been last year. The cemetery held the small ceremony as several hundred others just 'happened' to pass by. 

Wickson had never seen such traffic before.

Yet the house remained. As Halloween's hours passed into November, Mallory and his friends crept closer and closer to the dark porch. 

"Just go!" Tristan's words were like a chant, a hope that he clung too but would not accept himself. His green eyes crackled between fear and malicious hope. "Just a few steps! Do it!"

"Shut up!" Mallory growled. "I said I would!"

"Then go!"

"I'm going."

Des kept her eyes away from the boys, she watched the dark beyond the corner. She searched the fields of wild grass that faded to black as the streetlights reached their limits. 

"Des, get your boyfriend to shut up!" Mallory urged.

"Shut up, Tris." The words came without emotion. 

"Aw, babe..." Tristan cooed. "Ya scared? We scarin' ya, baby girl?"

"Shut... *up.*" Her eyes let go of the dark just long enough to skewer the lanky blond boy. "Mal, either do this or don't. I wanna leave."

Mallory stiffened his back and stomped up the three crooked steps to the porch. Desiccated charms hung all around him, circles woven with sticks and stuffed with the hollow bones of small birds. They whistled in the now-November wind. 

He reached out to touch one of them, fingers rasping dry against the white. 

"Mallllll...." Tristan teased.

Mallory bared his teeth and opened the screen door. He made to step inside but he felt something, a strange prickling, as his foot passed the threshold. It was like he'd splashed his leg in a winter puddle only without the damp. 

"Mallllllllll...."

Cold ignored, fear quashed. He stepped forward, his body shivering as he let a smile appear. 

"Your turn, Tri-" The words died in his throat as he turned to see his own face staring back.

It stood there, still on the porch, foot not even past the threshold. His face was there, but empty, void, staring without the horror that Mal knew it should show. 

He tried to get back. He bolted for the threshold, pushing his body against it. The charms along the edges shimmered and rattled but they would not let him pass. 

"This is ridiculous." The other him said through stiff, alien lips. "Let us go. I have... *things* to do."

And they left. They left to the mocking tones of Tristan and the rattling of the bone charms. The screen door slammed shut and the house upon the corner kept still... and dark.
