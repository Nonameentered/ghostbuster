"Thank you, Rodney. Everyone one here appreciates that you turned your evil robot army into robots that help the elderly cross the street. This is a big step for you and we're all very proud. Let's give Rodney a hand."

The six other men in lab coats shifted aside inventions and circuitry and gave a discordant round of clapping. Honestly, it was the best you could get out of them. Super Therapy for the Criminally Disturbed Genius was a trying experience for all involved, even me.

"However," I continued after Hans started getting bored and began to invent a machine to clap his hands for him. "I do have to point out that while more efficient, picking up and throwing old people to the other side of the road isn't very nice."

"But it *is* efficient!" Rodney protested, his voice somehow both nasal and squeaky.

"Yes, but it hurts them"

"That matters?"

"Yes it does." I nodded to him gravely. "Moving on... Hans. Hans! Hans, pay attention!"

"Oh, hi there!" Hans finally looked up from the clapping device that was now slapping his left leg enthusiastically. 

"Look, I made an ashtray for my mother!" He held up a lumpy bowl of clay. "Which is weird because she doesn't like me, *and* she's been dead for five years, buuuuut I figured I could just, you know, borrow a mother and give it to her. It's also weird that-"

"HANS!" I snapped out a bit louder than a super therapist should, but Hans was a 'special' case. "Hans... why is it beeping?"

"I was just getting to that! Sheesh, no patience nowadays. Yeah.... I somehow included a self-destruct button on it." He turned the ashtray to show off the large, red button that was both glowing and beeping. "I don't even know how I did it, I only had clay to work with and how did-?"

"HANS, you know the rules. If it explodes, you can't bring it to group. Now, go take it back to your room."

"Aw, man." He tucked his ashtray under one arm and his clapping-turned-slapping machine under the other and trudged out to the hallway.

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. "That leaves Herman."

All eyes and eyepatches turned to Herman. He ducked his head and rummaged through a giant duffle bag, then pulled out a heavy, silver and black laser rifle.

"I, uh... I modified my Disentigron Death Ray." He mumbled. "It, uh, look."

He raised it up to his shoulder, prompting the whole room to duck, small inventions and lab coat tails flew everywhere. Yet, when he pulled the trigger it just cast hundreds of colored light about the room and started playing some upbeat techno music. It didn't burn the walls, it didn't spew poison gas, it didn't even have the song set too loud. I felt tears glisten in my eyes as I watched.

"Herman-" I said as I got back to my feet. "I'm so proud of you!"
