Dwayne pulled his coat tight against the rain. 

Thirteen years. For thirteen years he'd scoured every corner of the globe, every dark website, each and every e-Bay auction listing he could find. It all seemed to lead here, to this set of crooked stairs in a dark back-alley and the steel door they ended at. He raised his fist and slammed  it against the cold metal once, twice, three times.

An eye slot opened and a nose poked out. "Yes?"

"I... I'm here for... the..."

"Say it."

"What?" Dwayne took a step back. 

"Say it." The nose loomed closer. "If you *want* it, you have to *say* it."

"I want.... the Oinky Poinky." The name left his lips like a poison. 

The nose pulled back, the slot shut, and various clanking noises preceded the door sweeping outward. Dwayne wasted no time slipping in, making sure to avoid even looking at the doorman, whoever he may be. 

"...rilyn Monroe Pog set! We will start the bidding at one thousand." The words echoed through the space, engulfing the audience full of shady, covered faces. 

Dwayne grabbed a paddle and settled himself in the fifth row just as they got to his section of the pitch.

"And now, lot #6144, a rare set of 'Oinky Poinky: Bright and Boinky' Christmas ornaments. These come straight from the hands of a private collector and will likely never be seen again! Bidding starts at four thousand!"

Nineteen bids, one glaring match with a man in a green suit, and six thousand dollars later, he had it. He stood in the lobby, hands shaking as they held the pristine box set of adorable anime pigs in tiny Christmas hats. Thirteen years! Thirteen years and he'd finally-

"That's a nice set, mistah." The words crumbled off of some mountainside to crash down on his parade. 

Dwayne looked up to find the man in the green suit, his bidding competitor, standing between him and the door. 

"I'll give ya eight K for it, right here."

"N-no." Dwayne wrapped his coat around his treasure and try to move around, but the man stepped with him. 

"Ya don't undahstand, pal." Green suit leaned in. "I came a long way for Oinky Poinky, an' I'm not leavin' till I has it."

Hands reached through personal space and dug dirty nails into the pristine plastic packaging. Dwayne stood there in shock for a second before letting out a guttural yowl and pulling his prize back. It couldn't end like this, not after all this time!

"Is there *a problem?*" 

A matching pair of large suits materialized from the dim lighting, accompanied by a small woman with a cane.

"He damaged the packaging!" Dwayne cried out. It was all he could think about. The plastic was dimpled now, dimpled!

"That's against policy." The woman's tone darkened.

"L-look, this is-" Green suit stuttered.

"*Against* policy." She raised her cane. "Boys, take him to the Lego room."

"Wait! No-"

"And take his shoes off."
