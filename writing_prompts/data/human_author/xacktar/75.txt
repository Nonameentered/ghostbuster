"He loved them, you know?" Heather's hands trembled as she held the old copy of *The Bottle Imp* before her. 

The book was old, more than a hundred years had cut themselves through its cover, its pages and its ink. Dust didn't just coat it, it was ingrained into every edge and cranny. Its shape was warped, the cover held itself open an inch, pages slumping around things held inside. 

Heather opened it up to one of the many ancient protuberances. 

"Every day he was at the meadows. Rain, snow, winds so stiff it takes a loose hat to the next county." Her fingers reached up to touch the dried flakes within, skin catching on the brittle edges. "He'd come back with a handful every time. Then he'd pull a book from the shelf and stick 'em inside. Look, Henry."

She tilted the book over toward her brother. His eyes took in the mangled page, the warped paper with its smear of ink that had once been neatly-printed words.

"Must have been sopping wet that day, a real bluster." Heather pulled it back and lifted a desiccated petal with a fingernail. "They were beautiful, though. He always found the best ones."

The slow bend of trembling fingers sealed the pages once more. She placed it back upon the shelf, set among its brothers and sisters that all held the same fattened, ruinous prominence. 

"He brought a sunflower back once." Heather's breath caught itself halfway through an attempt to laugh. "A sunflower! You should have seen him trying to close the book on it, slamming it, and cursing it, and sending seeds flying everywhere! His mom about killed him!"

"He wasn't really meant for the indoors, was he?" Henry's voice was soft, low, pressed down like the things around them.

"No. He wasn't" The laugh came unstuck and tumbled out through wry, blistered lips. "Look at this place! He ruined all those books! All for what, for... for-"

Henry's arms wrapped around her before the rains came. As the arms closed in, her hands reached out, dragging fingernails over the spines and titles until grasping one more case of sacrificial literature. 

"What am I going to do without him? How... *What* am I supposed to do when every time I see them in the meadows, in the shops, on the side of the road, in these damned, damnable BOOKS!" Her lips lifted and twisted under the salted rain. "...All I can think about is *him.*"

Henry cradled her and crushed her, wishing for stillness as life's cruelty rattled his sister's body: bone-by-bone, sob-by-sob.

"They were so bright before. So colorful... and now? Now they're... they're just-" Her hands fumbled with the book, opening it up and spilling old life around her like a shock of umber snow. "-just this."
