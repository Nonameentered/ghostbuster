Hi, Android!

I think the italicized misspellings are a clever way to foreshadow what was coming, but... I think it doesn't work if you only use it on words that would still sound correct if spoke aloud. 

I think it would have been better served if you had used it on words that would sound wrong if spoken but still spelled close enough to the right word for the readers to understand. 

Example: 

Instead of: "dommin ace" for Dominates 
Use: "dommernates"

Then we can imagine the discrepancy as if she is telling us this commentary out loud and it will better sell the child-like aspect of it.

Hope this makes sense! Good words!
