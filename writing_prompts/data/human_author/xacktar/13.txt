This is a very interesting take on growth, but I do have a hard time getting into the story because of the lack of specificity. 

I know they had coffee together, but I have no idea what they are working on, what the subject of their discussion is about, and therefor, the source of the conflict present in the story is likewise obscured. 

Basically, I want to know more! But beyond that, this is full of fun lines and has a very real, relatable feeling to it. 

Hope this helps!
