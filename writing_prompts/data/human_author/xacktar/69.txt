Norman Effingway had prepared for this moment his entire life. He had smiled and charmed and wooed and gifted. He had even, god forbid, baked cookies for the crooked old man whose mortal remains now sat in a small blue-green urn atop the desk of his longtime lawyer Mr. Kettleblack. The same urn which had held his father before him, actually. 

“...and finally, the remains and proceeds from the sale of any and all assets connected to the Itsa Steelworks, including the property of the adjacent Lostan Foundry, are to be granted, in trust, to the Highland School for Lowborn But Still Quite Polite Young Urchins.”

Norman had listened to this for six hours. Listening as the Itsa estates were parceled away to nieces, nephews, scholarships, garden funds, and whatever other nonsense the old crank had come up with.

“Thus concludes the bestowments portion of the will.”

“Wait just a minute!” Norman shot up from his seat so fast that his wig from Coverup Couture almost took off from sheer transferred momentum. “I believe you have missed a name.”

“Which name?” 

“My name! Norman Osborn Effingway.”

“There are no bestowments or endowments to-”

“That's... that's....” Norman then did what he had always done when he found something in his way. He turned the problem over to the law firm of Lu, Cashew, & Kry. “Mr. Lu, Go!”  

Lu shot up behind Norman, which had little effect since he was a foot shorter and far thinner, giving the appearance that Mr. Effingway's neck fat was pleading to the executor of the will.

“There have been concerns about the state of mind-”

“Mr. Itsa passed a full mental and physical examination before dictating his will to me.”

“Ah, but the intervening timeframe between the examination and the-” The lawyer continued.

“Was six hours.”

Norman raised his hand and waved the lawyer off, then turned it slightly and pointed to the next one in line, a full-figured gentleman with fabulously blond hair. 

“Pete Cashew, I choose you!”

“Er, yes... we have no record of the will being filed with the proper government offices and thus respectfully suggest-”

“The will has been certified and witnessed by no less than six county clerks and a high court judge.” Kettleblack said without looking up. 

“Kry!” Norman practically screamed the name. 

The third, and final, lawyer popped up, took a deep breath and launched his words like a leaky rowboat from a yacht club.

“I, er, uh... maybe you dropped a page?”

“Mr. Effingway!” Kettleblack finally dropped his papers and looked up, piercing the room with his dark-eye gaze. “If you are quite finished!”

“But I haven't been mentioned once in the entire will!”

“You are mentioned.” 

“I- what, where?”

“At the very end, under the contest provisions.”

“Oh, well, that's good!” Norman forced his face into a smile. 

“There is a note at the end of the will that speaks to the state of your inheritance.”

“What's that?”

“It says, and I quote: 'No, Effingway.'”
