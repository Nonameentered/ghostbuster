"No, no, NO!" Mitch turned his mic off and wheeled on his buddy playing Bass. "Its 'I am *darker than* a blood moon. Here to bring *you* fear.' Gotta emphasize the 'you' right there. Then ya go: 'I am the weeping monster: 'Cause I AMMMM- Ya hear that, ya gotta pitch it up, Daryl! Up!"

"Like this?: I aaaAAAAmmmm-"

"No! Higher! Bigger! This is important, Daryl! This is the big lead up to our band name! It's important!"

Daryl looked around the small garage, his gaze lingering on their drummer, Dewron, who was currently trying to keep the two-foot tall costume hat on his head. It was really top-heavy and kept falling off when he was playing.

"Are you listening to me?"

Daryl pulled his attention back. "Yeah.. about the band name..."

"OH for f-"

"It's just... I know all the other spellings were taken and it's a lot of paperwork... but a silent G before an N. It's weird man."

"Look, I didn't have a lot of time to think about it! I got up to the counter and they said having it with the K was taken, same with the dash in the middle, and with the ending spelled A-I-R-E, AND with-"

"I get that, I get it!" Daryl raised his hands. "It's just... we have a lot of other songs with other words. I mean... we could be Midnight Thunderbutton, or Dark Warble, or even Jacked Up Rudder Nut from that song Dewron wrote."

"It's 'bout boats!" Dewron added as he lost the grip on his hat and it fell onto the drum set, playing a nice three-second solo.

"Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa." Mitch ran a hand through the locks of his white-hair wig. "We ain't changin' the name. It's who we *are.*"

"Uh... well. It's not who I am."

"It's who we *ARE!*"

"Look, Mitch, I'm sure you think it-"

"Dey keep asking us if we're gnomes." Dewron popped his head up from behind the drum set, dragging his overly-sized hat along the concrete back toward him. "Are we gnomes?"

"Gnomes? The f- How could we be GNOMES? Look at us! We're hardcore metal-playing kings of bloody darkness!"

"That'd be a good band na-"

"We are not Gnomes!"

"But the whole silent G before an N thing..."

"What about it?"

"'Gnomes' is spelled the same way."

"So what?" Mitch crossed his arms. "Lotsa words do that."

"Like what?"

"What?"

"What words?"

Mitch's face collapsed in on itself, eyebrows jumped and fell, lips twisted and were chewed on by teeth: "Gnarly!" 

"Gnarly." 

"Gnarly has a silent G!"

"And you think people still use 'gnarly'?"

"I'm done with this! WE are NOT changing our name! That is final!"

Daryl picked up his Bass Guitar with a sigh, then watched as Dewron's costume played yet another drum solo by itself. 

"Can we at least get rid of the red, pointy ha-"

"IT'S who we *ARE!*" Mitch screamed into the mic. "Now put on your fake beards and play."
