"Hello, Maria. I'm sorry, I mean Ms. Commons. Here, please take a seat."

Bill gestured toward the faded red chair that sat before the small, faux-wood table. He settled himself in the seat opposite as Ms. Commons made herself comfortable, putting her purse on the table and placing her hands in her lap. She was an unremarkable kind of person. Average height, mid-thirties, she wore a faded pink skirt and burgundy sweater as if it was winter outside, even thought it was the middle of July. 

"First off, I want to thank you for applying with us at Thousand Time Cloning Solutions. We're always excited to have new people join us and to have them apply their natural talents to our programs."

Ms. Commons just bowed her head a little. 

"You've applied for one of our many gene sequencing positions. I must remind you that this job will be set in a different time zone than the factory here. Your team lead will be running operations from Europe, which will, of course, cause the hours here to be a bit unusual should you decide to work from this facility." Bill read through the spiel just as he had three other times today. Interview days were the worst.

"That's fine." She nodded. "I... have trouble with people anyways, so one of the reason I applied for this position was due to it's...unique situation."

"I see. Well, glad to hear it." Bill shuffled his script to the next page. He didn't need to, he'd done this enough to have each line memorized, but it had to be done for the look of the thing. "And you come from Boston?"

"That's right."

"Born there?"

"Raised since I was seven, cluster home. One run by this company, actually."

"How fortuitous that we'll have you back in the family, as it were." Bill flashed a smile then let it drop. "And you skipped college for a VR speed certification?"

"Yes, my... issues... made it the preferable option." Ms. Commons shifted in her chair a bit, "My Guidence councilor recommended it to me. She said it's almost as good as a degree, education-wise at least."

"And she is correct. TTCS takes great pride in our own reliance on VR speed certs." Bill checked off a box on his paper and moved on to the next page. "Finally, you will be offered the benefit of living here at the facility for little or no cost should you decide to. This is, of course, completely optional and acceptance of the offer can not, by law, interfere with our offer of employment. That said, would you like to accept on-cite living arrangements as part of you employment contract?"

"I... I get a room to myself, yes?"

"That is correct. In fact, your room in particular will be away from the other dormitories. It'll be right down the hall from your office."

Ms. Commons let her shoulders drop a little. She closed her eyes and a small smile touched the corners of her lips. 

"Yes, thank you, that'll be perfect."

"Excellent." Bill marked off the last two things on the page then turned the whole packet face-down on the table. "Then I happy to extend to you congratulations. You are now a part of the TTCS family. Please exit through the left here and Janet will give you directions to your new office and apartment. Oh, and don't forget to pick up your card and lanyard from her as well."

"I won't. Thank you!" Ms. Common bowed and her face cracked into a beautiful smile for just a moment before she rushed to the door and left. 

Bill leaned back in his chair and savored the moment. It was his favorite part of these interviews, that dancing little smile at the end. It never lasted long enough, though. Not nearly long enough. 

He sighed, put the finished packed in a box on his left, then reached down to the box beside it to grab a fresh packet. He set it on the table, checked the pen just to make sure it was still working, then buzzed the office to let them know he was ready for the next one. 

The door opened and another one walked in. Same nervous look, same timid actions, same skirt and burgundy sweater. 

"Hello, Maria." Bill smiled at her. "I'm sorry, I mean Ms. Commons. Here, please take a seat."
