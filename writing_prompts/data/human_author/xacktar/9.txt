Detective Biscotti swung open the door to the interrogation room and stood there for a long moment, breathing in the sweet and yeasty smell of the suspect handcuffed to the table. 

"Well, well, well... Mistah Shortbread." Biscotti rumbled, "We've been looking for you."

"Why're ya doing this to me?" Shortbread twisted and pulled his wrists against the handcuffs, grinding a fine dusting of crumbs and blue sprinkles over the table, "Ya should be owt lookin for Gingersnaps. Theys the ones that killed my dog. Theys the ones that killed my brotha."

Detective Biscotti gave the young lad a hard smile. He crossed the gap in the room and settled himself in the other chair.

"Yer sayin' the Gingersnaps killed yer dog?"

"That's right!" Shortbread straightened up, "Sunday night, theys did it. Killed my poor Snickerdoodle. He nevah harmed nobody. He was a good dog. 'An now theys killed my brotha!"

Biscotti slapped a folder down on the table, "It's a good story. Real good. Only it's a bit... half-baked. You see, the Gingersnaps were 'ere with us on Sunday night."

"Whut?"

"Caught both of em with six ounces of coco powder; possession with intent to smell." He flipped the folder open, showing the pictures of the twins behind bars, "Couldn't be from yer dog. Not an ounce of coco in him. No, no Mistah Shortbread, Snickerdoodle was all sugar and spice and everything nice."

"Alright, then it wasn't them. It was the Macaroons. They're completely coco! Nuts, I tell ya!"

Biscotti shook his his head, "No, Mistah Shortbread. It wasn't Macaroons, or the Tassies, or even the Lebkuchen. It was your brother that killed your dog. He left his crumbs all over the scene. But you knew that already, didn't you?"

Shortbread began to pick at his sprinkles, leaving more blue on the table. 

Biscotti went on, "You found out what he'd done and *you* decided that enough was enough. You went across the street and borrowed a breadstick from Mr. Crostini. Then you murdered your brother with it and disposed of the body. Now, we haven't found all of it yet, but we will. We knows it was you. We have the crumbs to prove it."

"Crumbs? So what." Shortbread sniffed, "Was my brotha, wasn't 'e? Of course my crumbs'd be there."

"Inside *his* crumbly bits?" Biscotti sighed, "Oh yes, you missed some. Officer Donut lost his jelly when he found it. You may be right, Mistah Shortbread, I can't get ya on murder, not yet, but I will be putting you away for assault with a breadly weapon. I can do that much. Just tell me something, just one thing: all o' this for one, crusty ol' dog. Was it really worth being thrown into the jar just for this?"

"Well, well, Detective, the thing 'bout revenge is..." Shortbread's lips pulled back to show his teeth, glittering with sugar and sprinkles not his own, "That it's sweet, innit?"
