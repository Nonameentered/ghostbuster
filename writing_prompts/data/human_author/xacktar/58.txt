Agatha Wriggleswort had never been to a convention center. In fact, she had never been inside a city since the whole Salem incident. It was the sign that drew her in. It was huge, glowing, and often had unintelligible nonsense on it about baskets with balls in them or other such gobbledygook. 

This time, however, it said: WITCH'S BREW SHAREHOLDER'S MEETING! NEW RECIPES!

If there was one thing Agatha loved, it was brewing. The lure of new recipes was just the newt's eye on top. She put her broom into a dive, found a bush to crash into, and stomped her iron-toed boots straight in. 

There was a young woman inside dressed all in pink. She was thin, with fair skin, and tiny, gold-rimmed glasses parked atop her nose. Her eyes lit up the moment Agatha walked in. She raised her hands and clapped in tiny, little slaps of fingertip on fingertip.

*"Oh my gawwwwd!"* She squealed like Agatha's pig, Chauncy. "Look at you! You're *fantastic!* The hat, the warts! Oh my *GAWD*, that shawl with the moss on it? Per-fect."

The old witch paused, her hand in her robe's pocket. She'd been about to throw crushed demon bone at the wild woman, but the sudden praise stopped her.

"You... you like it?" 

"It's *wonderful.*" The pink lady breathed before grabbing Agatha's arm and pulling her further inside. "C'mon they're starting and everyone *has* to see you!"

Agatha showed both her teeth with a grin. They must have heard of her brews before. That was the only explanation for the applause and the cheers and the many, many men fawning over her looks. That hadn't happened to her in three centuries. 

"Witches and Warlocks!" A voice boomed around her as the lady in pink set her down in some sort of chair that folded. "Welcome to Witch's Brew's Annual Shareholder Meeting!"

Cheers went up from the crowd, and for the first time in Agatha's life, she cheered with them. 

Then it soured. Booming voice began to talk about numbers, and figures, and shares that split. Agatha didn't want to split shares with anyone! She wanted her own. The speech went on and on and on.

Agatha Wiggleswort, ancient witch, and thoroughly cranky old lady, dipped her hand back into her pocket and deftly began combining the ingredients she kept in there into something decisively nasty. This wasn't her type of party. Damned city folk with their numbers and 'progress.'

"-And finally, the expansion of the Middlesborough bottling plant remains on schedule." Booming voice was saying. "Now that all that is over with, let's get totally sloshed!"

The room erupted into a cheer that was twice as loud as the one before. Agatha's fingers paused right before adding skullcap powder to a vial of gator's blood.

"What's that mean?" She asked the lady in pink. 

"It means grab yourself a mug, dear, we're all getting drunk!"

Agatha paused, grinned, and firmly decided that this was her type of party after all.
