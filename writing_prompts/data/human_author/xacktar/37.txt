Heya, I just want to say that this was one of my favorite stories of the bunch! Great idea, solid execution, all the elements used well. and a very clear arc to the story. 

My only real crit would be a tiny thing, the opening lines were just a  bit unclear and took me two reads to understand what was meant by "Lucy made sure to let him know how she felt about it." Beyond that it was just a fun ride! 

Well done!
