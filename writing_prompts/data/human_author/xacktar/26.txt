Captain, I've got to tell you, I've seen a lot of things in my time as a member of Magical Forest Firewatch Service, but this was something else. 

Upon my arrival on the property of 29 Tiny Forest Path, I observed no less than fourteen Kingdom Code violations, mostly involving the gigantic bonfire that the perpetrators were building not five feet from the hovel.

Our prime suspect, a human female by the name of Ms. White, was using magic to compel small animals to fetch uninspected wood from the forest. Ms. White was also directing her dwarven companions in a most inefficient manner, causing them to fall over branches, clothing, and each other in their efforts to carry a live torch toward the ill-prepared bonfire. 

Now, I've seen a lot of dangerous situations in my time: Dragon attacks, wizard fireballs, that one pixie from down south who loves burning people alive... but this, THIS was the worst. In the process of moving the torch six feet, the observed dwarves(See files: Bashful, Sleepy, Sneezy, and Dopey) caused at least fourteen minor fire incidents. These include, but are not limited to: The unintended ignition of two small hats, three beards, one clump of particularly long ear-hair, six shoelaces, a knapsack, and the tail of one unfortunate squirrel. 

I attempted to extinguish as many of the fires as possible, however I could not catch the squirrel before it lit another two garments on fire, including the long, flowing dress of Ms. White. One of the dwarves, a Mr. Doc, did try to assist by throwing the contents of his mug on Ms. White to douse the flames, but said mug is presumed to have contained illegal dwarven moonshine(See Cauldron Brewing Code 91-b). Ms. White was immediately engulfed in flames until a pair of raccoons tackled her to the ground with a large blanket. 

At this point I ordered all residents of 29 Tiny Forest Path to stop their activity and line up against the hovel. I, with the assistance of the racoons, doused the additional fires, including the one on the squirrel's tail, which had ignited a further six trees and one hovel roof before it could be stopped. 

I then proceeded to explain the *numerous* fire code violations and the fines they had accrued. However, this was not accomplished without interruption. One Mr. Grumpy assaulted me, saying, and I quote: "You pig-eyed lilly-liver! We ain't paying that!" I was also further threatened when he picked up a mining pickaxe. A scuffle then ensued between the dwarf, the raccoons, and Ms. White, in which a beard ended up wrapped around the mentioned weapon and yet *another* squirrel was lit on fire. 

At this point, Captain, I snapped. I couldn't take any more! I doused the squirrel, threw the tickets down, and got the hell out of there! 

Hopefully things will go better when I visit the castle of one Mr. Beast tomorrow. I've heard he has a new guest.
