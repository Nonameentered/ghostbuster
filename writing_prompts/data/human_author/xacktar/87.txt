"Dude, he ate it."

Chad looked up from his phone to stare at his Frat brother, Mule. "What the heck you mean 'He ate it?" 

"Like, bro, your cat just, like, ate the dot!" 

"What dot?"

"The laser dot!"

"He can't eat the dot, dumbass" Chad spared a glance toward Pong the cat. The black, fluffy beast was sitting upright on the second level of the beer box pyramid looking mighty pleased with himself. 

"He totes did!"

"It's light. You can't eat light. That's, like, biology and stuff."

"But he did! Look!" A laser pointer was shown off, now dark and devoid of laser. "See?"

"That's stupid." Chad returned to perusing page 302 of Instagram's 'Best Bikini Butt Pics' page on his phone. 

"It's not! Look, if he didn't eat it and stuff then why is he glowing?"

"He's not glowing." Chad swiped over to page 303.

"Ya didn't even look, Bro!"

"Mule, bro, for the last time, the cat is not-" The words caught in his mouth as he saw red light gleam off the screen that was currently showing Miss Utah University's bronzed backside. 

Pong was staring straight at him, dark red shimmering in his saucer-wide eyes. 

"...er, that's just... a reflection." Chad shook his head. "Like, cat's eyes have, like, mirrors and stuff in 'em."

"Why the fuck'd they put mirrors in there?"

"What?"

"Do vets do that? Like install mirrors on cats when their born? That's weird, man."

"What? No, like, dude... their eyes are just like that."

"What, fer real?"

"Yah."

"What about the floating?"

"What floating?"

"That." Mule pointed once more at the beer box pyramid.

Chad slowly turned his head to find Pong stretching and yawning while approximately three inches above the nearest beer box. 

"Uhh...." 

"Is that 'cause of the mirrors too?"

"What?"

"Do mirrors make 'em float and stuff?"

"I...uh..." Chad's eyebrows did an intricate dance. "Dude, what do you feed him?"

"Nothin, man, just the dot."

"What dot?"

"The laser dot." Mule threw his hands up. "Dude, weren't you listening?"

"But he can't... that can't... the fuck?" Chad glanced over again and now Pong was yowling as a pair of white, leathery wings slowly unfurled from beneath his fur. "The f-"

"Ohhhhhh, dude!" Mule jumped out of his seat, causing a small mountain of beer cans to avalanche outward from his location. "It's like a fuckin' bat! Dude, ya got a bat-cat! Nananananana: BAT-CAT!"

"Dude, shut the hell up! What the fuck did you do to my cat?"

"Nuthin!"

"I left him here for ONE afternoon! What did you DO?"

"I didn't do nothin, Bro... Well, like, nothing bad."

"MULE!" Chad grabbed mule by his fraternity jacket and pulled him close enough to smell the beer foam on his goatee. "What... did... you... do?"

"Just gave.... just, maybe^gave^himsmrdbl..."

Chad shook Mule mile a bottle of cheap champagne, "WHAT DID YOU DO?"

"I gave him some Red Bull, alright?" Mule grinned a little. "Fuck did they nail that slogan, though!"
