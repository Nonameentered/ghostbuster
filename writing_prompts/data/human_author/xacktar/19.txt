"Unca Vex!" Seven year-old Sylvie attempted a tackle and shouted, "You can't do that! You can't use potatoes on my castle!"

Her uncle paused mid-cut, his attention now fully focused on thwarting his niece's attempt to grab his half-carved princess. She did her best to use her weight to push him over. He dodged and she missed. She went flying past him, right into the stack of picnic stuff. There was a cacophonous sound as swimsuits, frisbees, sunscreen bottles, and a can of *'Ridicky's Thirst-Quenching Limeade'* went rolling off the watermelon-pattern blanket and straight into the ubiquitous sand. 

"Uh oh." Syvlie's cry sailed over the sound of the waves.

The universe stilled for a moment, save for the fragrant tropical breeze and the sizzle of sunburns-in-progress. In the distance some surfer bro yelled things like 'Tubular' and 'Gnarly' to his friends. Uncle Vex paused to put his knife away, patted Sylvie on the head, and began cleaning up in his fastidious way. 

"I'm sorry, Unca Vex." She tried to cover up her flabbergasted expression. "I didn't mean..."

Uncle Vex just picked up an avocado and inspected it. "Is this ours? I don't remember packing it."

"You can't use alva-tacos on my castle either!" Sylvie declared as she crouched down to help her uncle. "The rules say you can't!"

"What rules?" 

"Sand castle rules!" Sylvie heaved a sigh, "I read them, you know. They sayyyy... no veggies!"

Uncle Vex spared a moment to turn and look at his niece. She had found her kid-sized parasol and was shaking the sand off of it, right onto the open cooler full of ice cream sandwiches. For a moment, he explored the idea that the sand had somehow missed all the scrumptious, icy treats, but that hope was soon vanquished.

"Sylvie, why don't you go take a swim? I'll clean up here."

"No!" Sylvie floundered for a moment then flopped over into the sand with her parasol, which bloomed like a very surprised flower. 

"Sylvie..."

"If I go then you'll put the potato on MY castle!" She pointed at the half-carved starchy princess to vindicate her prediction. 

"I wouldn't dream of it."

"Yes you would!" She stomped her foot, causing a perfect puff of sand to go flying. "I know it! 'Cause you're a liar and, um, acentric!"

"Eccentric?" 

"Yeah, that!" Sylvie sashayed up and poked him in the chest with her parasol.

Uncle Vex rolled back onto the blanket and looked up into the humid haze of the afternoon, looking to all the world like he was some half-baked radical trying to stargaze in the daytime, searching the sky for answers unseen.

"What if I give you the potato?" He tossed it to her in a moment of spontaneity. "Now I can't use it, right?"

"Ummm....yeah."

"Fine, there you go. Now go! Frolic! Shoo!"

She giggled and bolted, holding the potato high above her like a flag while Vex wondered how hard it would be to carve a princess out of an avocado.
