"Help me hang this thing, Finn!"  Alyx shouted across the cramped, messy, and now sticky boathouse interior. 

The remains of the last twelve beers slowly dripped along the warped and faded planks, contributing a new texture and smell to the place .

"This is your stupid idea." Alyx's boyfriend, Finn, grumbled from his perch on a plank across two barrels. "I ain't helpin."

Alyx answered with a grunt and a thump as she tried to lift herself and a battered old Ouija Board up atop an old shipping crate.

"YOU lost the board." She reminded him. "So YOU should be up here replacing it."

"I didn't *lose* it..."

"You hit it so hard it fell off into the lake!"

"Not my fault it wasn't, like, secured."

Alxy yelped as the crate tilted her off. She grunted, swore, then climbed back up. 

"C'monnnnn!" She whined. "We need to replace it."

Finn groaned and flopped onto his side. "For the last time... ya can't replace a dart board with a-"

"JUST SHUT UP AND GET OVER HERE!"

Finn knew that tone. In fact, most boyfriends, husbands, and young children knew that tone. It meant right or wrong, he had to heave himself off the plank, trudge over in a sulky way, and hold Alyx steady while she hung the board. 

So he did, but he made it the decision to hold her steady using the hand-on-rump method. Boyfriend Perks.

"There!" She announced and scrambled down a second later. "Now, let's test it!"

"How?"

"Gimme the darts." She held her hand out. "I'm gonna express my *true* feelings about you."

Finn tilted his head, but emptied his pockets into her hand.

Alyx took them, threw them, then stood back admiring her handywork. Finn read the board.

"Ashmole?" He asked.

Alyx shrugged. "Close enough."
