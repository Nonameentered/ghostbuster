Eddie Lawn hated most things in life. He hated his job, his family, he hated being outside, he hated being inside. In fact, there was so much hate curled up inside his tiny, sinewy body that most people thought it was the only thing he lived for. 

They were wrong about this. Eddie Lawn lived for horses. 

It was why he was perched like a featherless vulture on the edge of a cold metal bench at the horse track, mouth twisting and chewing the remains of a toothpick. 

"Edddiiiieee!" 

He turned to find Bernie stomping down the metal stairs toward him. She was a friend from work, his only friend, really. 

"Hey there, ya old gargoyle." Bernie punched him in the shoulder as she plopped down next to him. 

Her real name was Bernice, but she would viciously pummel anyone who actually called her that. She was loud, rude, dirty, sometimes violent, and so much else, but she grew up around horses. It meant they always had something to talk about.

"Why'd you drag me out here to this muck?" 

"Wanted ya here for my retirement." 

"Retirement?" Bernie punched him again, "You're only thirty-five, ya big dope."

Eddie shook his head. "Don't matter. Gonna retire. Took everything and hocked it, set it all on that big bruiser right there."

He pointed at the horse gate where the jockeys were getting mounted up.

"Eddie, you can't do this." Bernie breathed

"Already did."

Bernie checked the betting list and groaned. *Iron Moon: odds: fifty-seven to one.* "You'll lose everything!"

Eddie shook his head. She wasn't looking, so he did something he'd never done before and he touched her, just a little, using his hand to turn her head away from him to look back at the horse gate. She resisted, then complied more out of shock then anything.

"Look at 'im." He said. "Look at the ears. Ears are a horse's eyes. All th' others are twitchin' left an' right, watching their competition. His are locked ahead, looking forward. Iron Moon don't care about nothin' else."

Bernie looked, really looked, and Eddie watched her lean forward. 

"He's a big one." She breathed. "Real big."

The shot rang out and they horses bolted, the whole pack streaming ahead except for Eddie's pick. He was last out of the gate, kicking up the mud in huge chunks behind him.

"Oh, Eddie." Bernie sighed.

Eddie didn't bother to comfort or reassure, he just made sure she kept watching as the big horse slowly got faster and faster. Where the others reached their peak, the big one kept coming and coming and half-way through the course he rolled past the pack like they were standing still. 

He crashed through the line two lengths ahead of everyone else. The track was full of the moans of the disappointed. All except Eddie, who stood there with a thin smile pressed against his toothpick. Damn, he loved horses.
