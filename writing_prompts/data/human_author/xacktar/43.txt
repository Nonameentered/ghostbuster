**Eyepatch Stew**

&nbsp;

Ohhhhhh! 

&nbsp;

Never wear your eyepatch when yer cookin for the crew.

'Cause ya might just drop yer eyepatch right into the ol' fish stew!

&nbsp;

*Ho! Ho! Feel th' breeze! Tell us why, oh Bosun, please!*

&nbsp;

An' if ya lose yer eyepatch, an' if ya spoon it out,

That eyepatch, it be smellin' like a seven week-old trout!

&nbsp;

*Ho! Ho! Feel th' breeze! Tell us why, oh Bosun, please!*

&nbsp;

Now if you found that eyepatch, now if you washed it good.

Don't ever wear th' patch on leave, is tha' understood?

&nbsp;

*Ho! Ho! Feel th' breeze! Tell us why, oh Bosun, please!*

&nbsp;

'Cause if ye go ashore, if ye hear the hawkers cry!

Them gulls'll want th' tasty fish and take yer other eye!

&nbsp;

*Ho! Ho! Feel th' breeze! Bosun told us... 'cause we said please!*
