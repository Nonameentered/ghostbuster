Hi, Astro!

First off, this was really clever. You hid the acrostic incredibly well! I would not have known it was there if I had read this out in the wild. 

I don't have much in the way of crit, to be honest. The only small thing I might change is the word 'floatie' in the first sentence, it seems a bit too childlike for the sentiment of the whole piece. It might be a touch better to maybe say something that could forecast the hidden truth of the piece, like describing a life preserver without saying what it is. 

I dunno, just an idea. That's all I've got! Good words!
