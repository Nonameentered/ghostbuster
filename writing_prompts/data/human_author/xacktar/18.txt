Aw, this is very sweet. I love the imagery and how you stack it up for the ending, very fun!

I did notice that I think you are missing some punctuation in this section:

> she must swim slowly– the water
> chokes with eels
> writhes with their emptiness;
> they clot around her fins.

I think you want a comma after eels, but I'm not certain if that was how you wanted it read. 

Another section where the punctuation and capitalization confused me a bit is here. 

>The haze of other galaxies burns. like the sun at night,
>unseen and implacable–
>vex it. Draw the stars close as

Not sure if you just forgot to capitalize 'like' or if the period was meant to be a comma, but it does need a fix either way!

Normally this is nitpicky stuff, but punctuation is quite important in poetry, and even more for just being a small piece. I think you could do with another edit pass to fix these and other small issues.

Hope this helps! :)
