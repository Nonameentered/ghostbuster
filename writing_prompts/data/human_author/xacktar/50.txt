Dolomite the Wise kept two lists of things he hated. One list was for things he hated specifically, the other was for more general hates. Today he was dealing with something on both lists. 

In general, he hated mediating dwarven earth-rite disputes. They were tedious, stupid, and boring, but not the fun you-have-a-big-metal-drill type of boring. Right now he hated the McClod brothers, because they were always bringing up these disputes.

"He purposefully and maliciously built his access shaft beneath mine!" Slam McClod  shouted across the dwarven court chamber. "He *knew* I had a ventilation shaft above!"

"I did NOT!" Crevice McClod bolted up from his seat on the other side of the courtroom. "How can anyone know where anything of yours is when you never file any claim tabletwork!"

"This is not about the tabletwork!"

"Because you never DO any!"

"I do too!"

"Alright, when was the last time you went to a filing office?"

"Right after Jean Clod was married."

"That was eight years ago!"

"ENOUGH." Dolomite struck his miniature pickaxe against a tiny quartz cluster on his desk. "Crevice: be silent. Slam: explain to me what the issue is here?"

Slam adjusted his mining harness and leered his beard at his silenced brother, "*Crevice* McClod built his access shaft under *my* ventilation shaft."

"And?"

"And it threatens the structural integrity of my mine!" Slam slammed his fist on the granite table. "If his poorly-constructed access-"

"HEY!"

"I said be silent!" Dolomite slammed his tiny pickaxe twice more. "Continue, Slam."

"If *his* access shaft collapses..." Slam went on. "It would bring down my own ventilation shaft and compromise the air quality of my entire claim." 

"I see." Dolomite reached down and lifted a stack of heavy stone tablets up onto his desk. "And can you tell me what *your* mine expansion permit file number is?"

"Ah... well..." 

"Yes?"

"...I haven't really got around to, specifically, filing one yet."

"Hmph." Dolomite the Wise leaned back in his seat, glared, glowered, grumped, then ultimately sighed. "Let me make sure I understand this correctly. You!" 

He pointed at Crevice.

"You expanded your mine without filing mine claim. Then You-"

His finger snapped over to Slam. 

"Also failing to file claim, decided to expand your mine under his mine."

"It's my mine!" Slam protested. "I can mine under mines if it's still mine mine to mine!"

Dolomite frowned at this, consulted the tablets, then nodded to himself. "Yet, according to the records, that location has no claim. Therefore, the only proper response I can make to this dispute is to have both parties collapse their illegal expansions within a time frame to be determined by the court."

The brothers exchanged looks, shuffled mining helmets and axes around on their persons, then turned as one back toward the judge. 

"Uh, maybe we can just forget this whole thing?" They said in unison.

And *that* was why Dolomite hated the McClod brothers, specifically.
