Hi Mott0r! I have crit for you! 

First off, I love the nostalgic feel of the piece. It comes through quite strongly, so much so I think you could even trim out the nostalgia line you have because the feel of the whole piece makes it very clear. Quite poignant and bittersweet by the end, which I am big fan of. 

Onto the more specific crit:

> I watched how the last flames in the grill hug to death the coals, clinging to life to the point of killing what made them exist.

I had to re-read this sentence a few times to understand what you were saying. It's a bit awkward mainly due to 'hug to death.' I think replacing that part with a single word would make the whole sentence much clearer. Or you could break the sentence up and rephrase.

> Each year without fail I stayed over, and after evertyhing was clean, we will sit by the grill, open a pack of cigarrettes, drink beer, and watch how it burnt itself out.

This sentence is way, way too long and complex. You have four commas already in it an two that should be in it around the words 'without fail.' I highly suggest breaking the sentence up into a few smaller ones. 

You also switch tenses between past and present a lot in this section when it should remain past tense.
