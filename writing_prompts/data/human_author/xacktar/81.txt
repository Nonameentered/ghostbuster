As a purveyor of collectable dolls I thought I'd 'seen it all' as the phrase goes, yet that notion was quickly discarded when I met Mr. Linus. 

Three bodyguards came first: dark suits, blank faces, and hands that lingered under jackets. They filed in one after the other, found the darkest corners in my cluttered work space and tried their best to look like furniture.

The only reason the man needed any protection was due to age. Mr. Linus was built like a train, barrel chest that labored with steam, arms like pistons, and great, thundering footsteps that one could hear for miles away if they set their ear to the ground. 

"Mr. Ritanio." He nearly mumbled, lips nary moving an inch. "I need to find a doll."

"Of course, Mister..." Forty years of work inspired professionalism no matter what the circumstance. 

"Linus." A sigh like escaping steam filled the air. "You will call me Linus."

"Ah, yes. Mr. Linus, what's the name of the doll you-"

"I do not know the name." 

"I see. How can I help, then?"

"It was..." 

The large man found the only chair in my workspace and lowered himself onto the ancient wood. It creaked and shuddered under the weight but held together.

"It was a gift." He continued. "A gift for my daughter. I remember... she had a noose."

"Your daughter?"

"No!" The steam rose. "The doll!"

"The doll had a noose?"

"Around her neck." Linus touched a finger to his own, "And she smiled. Strung up to die but she smiled; smiled as she swung back and forth and back and forth and..."

A glassy look took Mr. Linus in the eyes. I'd seen it before. It meant they had taken a little trip back to something their minds could not escape. 

"Mr. Linus." I said after an appropriate pause, "I'm afraid there are no dolls with both a noose and smile."

"I know what I saw." His eyes came back to the moment.

"Well... can you tell me anything else?"

He shifted, wood creaked. "Her dress was... It was long, and her hands were metal: hooked, and she swung... she swung back and forth and back and forth..."

*Hands hooked?* The strange detail cornered me in my mind. For a long moment I thought the man insane, that delusions had taken grip on him and I was soon to be an unfortunate victim of them.

"...and forth on her door. Always swinging."

"On her door?"

Mr. Linus nodded. 

"With metal hooks?"

"Yes."

I closed my eyes and saw it now. Not a noose, not hands. I could see it for what it was.

"I am sorry, Mr. Linus." I smiled at the poor soul, "But that was not a doll."

"I know what I saw!"

"It was a coat rack, decorated for girls. It often hung by a nail from a door."

"And the noose...?" His eyes bore into mine, pleading and dark.

I smiled. "Just a little bit of string."
