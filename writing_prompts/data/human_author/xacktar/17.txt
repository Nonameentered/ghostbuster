Ooh, I love a good mythical sci-fi story like this. It's very fun! I wish there was more of it but I know sometimes the piece is just where it needs to be.

As far as feedback. I was confused by this section of dialogue: 

> "I'm nervous." One said, looking to the other who appeared more masculine than she.
> 
> "Are you?" He replied.
> 
> "Yes. Aren't you?"

As the first speaker already said she was nervous, so why does the second speaker ask her if she is? It almost feels like there is a missing line of dialogue here. 

I also noticed this line:

>As they sat on the edge of the universe, sharing their woes and hopes for the future, two of the turtles swam into their palms.

I think it should be two sentences instead of one. There are a lot of complex phrases stacked together and I had to give it two reads to unpack what was happening.

That's all I got! Also, as a side note, the space geek in me loved the detail of the raspberry smell! Very clever!
