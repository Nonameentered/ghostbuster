"Welcome back to *Who Wants to Goorgle the Glok!* I am, as always, your favorite bio-organic computer game show host, Jelllllpo 357!" 

A small plant that looked like it was wired into a large computerized refrigerator seemed to be the one speaking. Jake wasn't sure. In fact, he hadn't been sure of anything for the past three days. All he knew was that he had something implanted in his forehead, he was wearing a spongey onesie with clown horns on the belt, and his left ear had been leaking something green and sticky for two days.

Oh, and he was on some sort of alien game show. 

"When last we left off, our reigning champion Krrrrrr was in the lead with FIVE borts! Let's hear it for Krrrrrr!" 

A herald of honking filled the air. Whatever this place was, they liked honking. Maybe that explained the clown horn belt on his suit.

"Unfortunately, our two contestants from the exotic countryside of 'Ee-arth' have not been faring so well. Susan, a human biped, is trailing behind Krrrrrr with one bort. Sad! I'm so sorry, Susan. I'll be rooting for you. Which leaves Jake, who's had nothing but a penalty negabort for three rounds! Too bad!"

The drones briefly swarmed Jake and he tried not to cry out in terror. They emitted a sound not unlike a wasp buzzing your ear.

"However, things could change!" The crowd honked wildly at this. "For it's time to..."

The whole audience screamed back in several languages: "GOORGLE THE GLOK!"

"That's right! Contestants, if you look this way you can see my lovely tentacled assistant C'thulia is passing out a single Glok fruit to each of you. I will read you a question and you will have forty-five space seconds to carve the answer into the Glok with your teeth!"

"Teeth?!" Jake whined. The Drones all spun in on him again. "That's unfair! Your champion guy has bigger, sharper..." 

Jake trailed off as Krrrrrr turned, many of it's fangs dripping purple drool. 

"...it's unfair." Jake mumbled in final protest.

"Oh, I am sorry, but acting out of turn means a second penalty negabort, Jake!" The plant-computer wiggled it's leaf-wires at him. "Now, the question! What kind of salt-encrusted creature can be found in the underground oceans of Wibblehem Five? Go!"

Krrrrrr turned into a buzzsaw of drool and flying bits of fruit. Susan was quietly gnawing on her own, and Jake just wanted to cry. In fact, he spent the whole time fighting back tears. 

"And time's up! Let's see your answers! Jake! Ooh, no answer. That's rough." The plant wiggled again. "Krrrrrr.... Sorry, no, it is not a Wibblian Eel. Susan... the Salt-Crab is correct! Oh my Glompa, we have a new champion! Give it up for Susan!"

Jake turned to looked at Susan as she grinned and waved at the drone swarm. 

"H..how?" He muttered.

She must have heard him because she leaned over and whispered "Carcinization is a thing everywhere, I guess."
