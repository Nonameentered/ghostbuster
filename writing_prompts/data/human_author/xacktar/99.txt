"Ith it thith one, Mathter?"

"For the last time, Igor, it is not! Where are your glasses, man? I told you it would be a late night and you would need your glasses. How many times have I told you?"

"One thousand theven hundred and thirty-"

"Don't quote numbers at me, you disastrous dunderhead! Now, where are we?"

Dr. Rayson D. Bodyswell the Third, heir to the Bodyswell castle, the Bodyswell swamp, the Bodyswell Cave and Lair Historical District, but not the owner of the Bodyswell line of fitness equipment vendors, put his hands on the hips of his colorfully-stained lab coat. He cracked his back, then his knuckles, then someone else's knuckles that he kept in his pocket as a stress reliever. It was always good to have a healthy way to relieve stress. Without one, you might go mad.

"I believe we are on the thouth hill, Mathter, between the mautholeum and the nithe pond that hath the duckth you like to feed."

"Hmph." Dr. Bodyswell crossed his arms behind his back. "They do love my potions."

"And the noitheth they make are much better than the old 'quackth,' I dare thay."

"Quite true. Well, enough with this lollygagging, my sedentary sidekick, onw-"

As Dr. Bodyswell swung his arms in the direction he hoped was west, he instead smacked his fingers straight into a pair of bottlecap glasses which happened to be attached to another person. What followed was a tangle of complicated curses, dropped bones and vials, and two lab coats that somehow got their sleeves tied together in the chaos. 

"You bilious baffoon, how dare you step in the way of SCI-"

"ME? Quiet your jowls, old fool!" The other pulled a scalpel from a pocket and cut the offending sleeve off his own coat to free himself. "You clearly struck me with your detestable digits!"

"I did no such-" Dr. Bodyswell stopped as he noticed that his fingers had, in fact, poked through one of the lenses said glasses and, in more fact, the entire pair was now dangling from said fingers. "I mean to say I would never do such a thing on purpose. Here, I believe these are yours."

"Oh, thank you." The other doctor took them and passed them to his Igor, which looked indistinguishable from any other Igor. "And these here are yours?"

"Those are somebody else's knuckles."

"Not yours, then?"

"No, they're mine. Thank you."

"Ah. Well, then... I must be off, uh, things to do."

"Indeed, Quite so, likewise. Come along, Igor!"

"Yeth, Mathter." Both Igors said at once. They glanced at each other, looked around, then one waddled off into the fog.

Dr. Bodyswell glared in silence until he was sure he couldn't see, hear, or smell the other scientist, then he bent down and whispered:

"Igor, who was that?"

"I believe that was the ethteemed Doctor Raython D. Bodythwell, thir.

"Oh, W-  Wait! I'm Dr. Bodyswell!"

"What? Are you thure?"

"Yes, I'm th- sure. I have it embroidered here on my sleeve." 

"Oh dear." Igor paused as a duck howled in the distance. "Then I believe there'th been a bit of a mixthup."
