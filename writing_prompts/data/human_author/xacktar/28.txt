Hey Astro! 

I love the way you wove the phrases together for this narrative, especially the quote at the end. 

I do think that writing in present tense when you have time skips made it very difficult to track what was happening in the story. It took me a while to realize that some of the present was actually in the past. 

I also noticed a few other parts that read a bit awkwardly.

> Britney laughs at his joke.

This one feels like you are telling us things we should already be able to read in the story itself. 

> "It's fine," Britney laughs, "This will be a charming part of the story."

This dialogue sounds like the words are coming from you, the narrator, not from the character in the story. It feels a little forced and unnatural.

Hope these help!
