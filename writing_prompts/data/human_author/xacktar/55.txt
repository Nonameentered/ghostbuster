It was a damp and steamy night. Mosquitos and crickets fought a war for noise supremacy as Brent Buckson, owner of the only gas station in Clay County, rolled spitballs. All two hundred and fifty pounds of him sat perched on a repurposed barstool, pudgy fingers slowly working soggy napkin scraps together into gooey ammunition.

He carefully loaded his red-striped plastic straw, raised it to his lips, sighted his pray, and fired.

The noise of the mosquitos lessened by one. 

"Gonna be a bad 'un tonight." Hank Dinkly said from his perch by the magazine rack where he was rereading *Fish and Bits! Issue 147*, "Smell it?"

"Yup." 

"Should board up them winders."

"Dun't need to."

"I'm thinkin' ya do." Hank tapped his nose with the least grimy corner of the magazine. "Nose knows."

"Ain't needed boards since '89. Ain't gonna need em now."

Any witty rejoinder from Hank was ruined by the dinging of the bell over the gas station door. Brent pushed his ammunition aside as a quad of lanky teenagers piled in. They were accompanied by a cloud of bug spray so thick the walls started to wiggle from the scattering termites within. Brent took one look at the them, sighed, and gave Hank a slow shake of the head. 

"Gimme twenty on the pump." The largest, and sweatiest of the teens slapped his credit card on the counter. Brent mentally dubbed the lad 'Big Sweat.'

"Ya boy goin campin?" Hank asked as an errant backpack almost hit his magazine.

"What's it to ya, 'Bubba?'" 

Brent and Hank shared a look between them. Brent sucked his teeth while Hank slowly rolled the magazine up into a tight tube.

"Gonna be a knockaround night." Brent commented as he took the kid's credit card. "Ya'll should bunk it for now. There's a motel up in-"

"I didn't *ask*, 'Jimbo!'" Big Sweat snorted. 

"Mhm." Brent slid the card through the reader, punched a few buttons, and tossed it back. 

Big Sweat snapped it up with a leer and turned to leave.

"Ya boys should really-" Hank started to say, but the backpack that had missed his magazine before now smacked him fully across the face. The teens giggled and hooted as they ran out.

"What they drivin'? Brent asked after the door had shut.

Hank arched his neck and glanced out at the pumps. "City Jeep."

"Mud on it?"

"Not enough."

The two grunted in unison, then sighed in sequence. 

"Should probably call Cecil." Hank nodded toward the store phone.

"Yup. Should." 

"If'n ya call him now he might get 'em turned back before it gets too bad."

"Yuuup." Brent made no move toward the phone.

"'Course, ya could wait a bit." Hank unrolled his magazine and resumed his inspection of TroutHammer Supreme fishing rods. 

"Could."

"Cecil'll be pissed."

"Cecil owes me ten bucks."

"Ah.

"Mhm."

A straw was raised, a spitball was loaded, and another mosquito became a spot on the window.
