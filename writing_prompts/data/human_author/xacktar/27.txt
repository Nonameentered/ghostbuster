Aw, this was so cute. I love it! It was a such a great tactic to have a summer DnD game as the story center. You made your main character relatable and interesting and the friends really felt like friends!

As far as crit goes, I only noticed two things in the story. First was this line here:

> It was when you put on your adventuring mixtape, the road stretched out before you, and chopped down some trolls.

I know you were trying to use the required 'The road stretched out before you' phrase here but it doesn't fit with the rest of the sentence. I think it stuck out because of it's placement in the order. I might try putting it first then rearranging the others to see if it might play better. 

The other thing I noticed was the friend's usage of nicknames in the piece. They were cute, but in such a short piece I think they worked against the piece as they made it harder to follow who was who. In addition, using the 'Betty Boop' nickname when Fiona was supposed to be consoling her friend felt a little flippant for the serious nature of what she was telling her friend.

That's all I got! I love this little story, great job!
