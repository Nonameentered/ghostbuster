"I'll ask again. Who are you? What are you doing in my house?"

The man standing in front of me seemed completely unconcerned by the shotgun aimed square at his chest, nor did he bother standing up from my couch. His confidence was starting to be... unsettling.

"Name's Bill Stevens. I'm a god," he remarked calmly.

"Right. You're nuts. I'm calling the cops," I said and with one hand still on my gun, I reached behind the corner for the landline.

"I wouldn't," he said - but not from the couch. The voice came from my right where my phone was and when I looked over, I found him... there, hand on the phone, holding it in place. Looking back to the couch, he was gone. He... teleported.

"What the f-" I yelled and jumped back, pointing the gun back at him. And with that, he was gone.

"Told you I was a god," his voice came from the couch again. As if I blinked, he was gone, not by the phone anymore, instead sitting on the couch again. I lowered my gun; seemed futile at this point.

"Please. Sit," he said and pointed to the chair across from him. I obeyed, still in a stupor from the situation.

"You summoned me, you know?" he said casually. I pinched myself, felt the pain. Dreaming was out of the question.

"Am I hallucinating?" I asked.

"Nope. Told you, you summoned me."

"Are- are you for *real*?" I asked again, squinting my eyes. He gave me a smile.

"Yes. And let's get one thing straight, first of all," he said and leaned over. I grew nervous as his expression became more serious.

"Yes, they *do* lay eggs," he said with a hearty chuckle.

"W- what?" I asked with complete confusion.

"Platypuses. They do lay eggs despite being mammals. You thought about it just now."

"How..." I tried to protest but realized the pointlessness.

"Yep. I'm a God of Thoughts regarding the weirdness of platypuses," he chuckled.

"You're kidding." He merely shrugged.

"You'd be surprised about the kinds of gods we have."

"But... if a god appeared for every thought, Earth would be teeming with them!"

"Most don't appear, but, well, I was bored," he grinned.

"How did you even become a god? Bill Stevens is not really... not really the name of a god," I inquired.

"Heard that one before. It's, uh, a [long story](https://www.reddit.com/r/PiecesScriptorium/comments/syspn6/you_find_yourself_waking_up_to_a_strange_new/), honestly."

I sat back in the chair and tried processing the entire situation. I could still scarcely believe it, but...

"But... they're mammals. How do they lay eggs?" I cried out.

"I know right?!" he said with a loud laugh.
