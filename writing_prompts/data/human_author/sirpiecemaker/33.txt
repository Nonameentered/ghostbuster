"Was it... left here and then... no! No no no! Lamps again!" the young man cried out as he once again set his eyes on the rows and rows of lamps before him. He had been wandering the halls of the Ikea store for what felt like ages now, utterly lost. He knew his sense of direction was terrible - to the point of it being a running joke - but this was something else.
  

  
He'd been lost for the past 28 hours.
  

  
Surviving on soda and candy bars from vending machines, with no signal on his phone, panic was truly setting in. He even had to take a nap at one point, though at least he found a comfortable bed for it. Worse yet, he had not seen anyone in hours - no customers, no clerks... no one. It was as if everyone had vanished.
  

  
He tried climbing up the furniture several times to get a vantage point, but no matter where he climbed, he could only see so far into the corridors that curled and coiled like snakes.
  

  
"YES!" he shouted as he turned a corner and saw his salvation - an information kiosk! He rushed to it, ignoring the pain in his tired legs, and looked for anything of help. No attendant. Of course, he thought. Ignoring all modicum of manners, he quickly jumped over the counter and turned the computer on. After what felt like an eternity, the computer whirred to life but presented no real operating system, only a green command line on a black background. Come to think of it, the monitor itself was unusually old - a CRT monitor, at least 30 years old.
  

  
"Uh... shit, what do I..." he mumbled before typing 'MAP'.

His eyes widened. Unusual as it was, he was past wondering and hastily typed EXIT into the command bar.

A printer he had thus far ignored suddenly screeched to life and started printing a large sheet of paper.
  

  
𝙿𝙻𝙴𝙰𝚂𝙴 𝚂𝙴𝙴 𝙰𝚃𝚃𝙰𝙲𝙷𝙴𝙳 𝙼𝙰𝚃𝙴𝚁𝙸𝙰𝙻 𝙸𝙽 𝙳𝚁𝙰𝚆𝙴𝚁 𝙱𝙴𝙻𝙾𝚆.
  

  
Eagerly, if suspiciously, he opened the drawer below the computer, finding a length of rope.
  

  
And at the very same moment, the printer finished printing meticulously illustrated assembly instructions for a noose.
