"Report," the violet-tinted cloud commanded through a series of flashes of varying intensity.

"They call themselves 'humans', sir," the crystalline creature in front of them replied with a voice that was rough and coarse, yet oddly soothing. "I believe you'll find some of their attributes... peculiar."

"Is that so? Do go on."

"Some basics - physical prowess is an alephar grade. Deceptively resilient, short lifespan, limited offensive capabilities. A flexible species with a shocking amount of variety, but nothing we haven't seen before. The planet itself is not entirely remarkable. Mostly water, high biodiversity, some specimens could be used for research."

"Go on," the cloud flickered.

"On a civilization scale, they're brahmen. Spacefaring and largely peaceful with only occasional squabbles over minor disputes. Their history shows their war-like nature used to be far worse. And, well... this is the interesting part. Their intellect. It's oolke," the crystal growled.

"And that is interesting... how?" the cloud blinked incredulously. "They're a versatile, resilient species with a reasonably capable society that are a bit... on the dim side. Why are you telling me that?"

"Their intellect is oolke, but their combined mathematical knowledge is... I- I'm not sure how to describe it. Here, see for yourself."

The crystal pushed forward a slightly moist globule of dark-blue mass that the cloud turned towards. The mass hummed quietly.

"Fission, space-faring for the last 266 cycles, gravity slingshots... grav- gravity drive?" the cloud gasped. "They've... they've constructed a gravity drive?!"

"Before you ask, sir, I've quadruple-checked. They are, in fact, oolke class."

"How does an oolke tier species create a *gravity drive*? We've been trying to make one for the last 745 cycles!"

"Sir... they're *incredibly* irresponsible."

The cloud stared at the crystal silently.

"The- the experiments they've conducted over the past several hundred years, sir, they've done them with reckless abandon. Before they created the gravity drive, they created several miniature black holes that went out of control. They, uh... used to have a moon."

"Used to?"

"A black hole swallowed it."

The two creatures pondered the situation in silence.

"Sir, what do we do now?" the crystal asked.

"I'll be honest," the cloud replied slowly. "I'm not sure if we should give them funds for research... or *stop them immediately*."
