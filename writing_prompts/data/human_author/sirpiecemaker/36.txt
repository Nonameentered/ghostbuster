"The choice is yours, soul. Walk through the Door towards the unknown or be judged by the Arbitor, leaving your fate in Their hands. Should your mortal life be judged virtuous, eternal paradise will await you with open arms. Should you be judged vile..."

The spirit before me didn't finish the sentence. I didn't find it necessary to ask. The silence was telling enough.

"Take your time, soul," the spirit continued, "for this decision will decide your everything."

I rubbed my chin curiously.

"And those are the only option?" I asked. The spirit tilted its head ever so slightly.

"These are the options you are given, soul," it hisses. "*Choose*."

"Oh, I getcha," I nodded. "But that doesn't mean they're the only choices, right? Not necessarily." I looked behind me, where I emerged from the darkness just moments ago, freshly dead and confused. The spirit remained silent.

Cautiously I took a step back unsure if it would try to stop me. I did not flinch.

"What are you doing?" it asked.

"Taking a chance."

"Why would you walk backwards? How do you even know there is anything there?"

I chuckled. "Well, *someone's* never played a videogame. You *always* check what's behind."

I walked back into the darkness, gradually seeing less and less until... I saw nothing at all.

And suddenly, I felt a pressure on my eyes. They were closed, despite me not remembering closing them. With all my strength, I forced them open, seeing a fair-haired man ahead of me.

"Hey, you. You're finally awake," he said. "You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us. And that thief over there."
