Random chance is overrated.

Don't believe me? I suppose you've never looked much into NetSecure. *World's most popular security system*. A constant generation of randomly picked values, changing each second, ensuring your data and access points remain as secure as possibly could be. After all, how could you breach a system that changes encryption *every*. *Single*. *Second*?

Simple. *You can't*. Unless, say, you have the rather uncanny ability to manipulate random chance. Only extends to numbers - I have no idea where a marble will roll when I toss it, but you throw a bucket full of dice, I'll simply *pick* what number will be the result - even if some of the dice have to be lost along the way. And NetSecure? Like logging into my e-mail.

I've even got a bit of a reputation for myself. Well, not myself, not really - officially, there is a mysterious group of hackers and spies who operate in the shadows to do all the fun stuff, agenda unknown. After all, there are arrests here and there, vile individuals brought to justice after they've crashed an economy. I can breach any network on the planet, but to give NetWatch some credit, they do occasionally manage to track my access point. Just a matter of swapping a few files in their database and some sap gets arrested in my stead. Kinda fun.

I've crashed economies, sent planes to the furthest parts of the planet to crash when fuel runs out, engaged in a little bit of political assassination here and there. Why? It's fun. Watching the news is like playing a management game. You know how in games you sometimes just... kill some NPCs, maybe nuke a city to see what happens, and enjoy the chaos?

Yeah.

Still, I know what you're wondering. Such horrific acts, such pointless loss of life, for what, my personal entertainment? Only yesterday, NetWatch and I went on a jolly little adventure ending with a country going into civil war because the wrong files were leaked. *And they weren't even true*! Why? Why would I do that?!

Well, let me put it this way.

Why would **you** do that?
