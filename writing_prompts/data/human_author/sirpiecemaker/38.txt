Y'know I couldn't stop thinking about the last question so I had to go back and add something - I think a good word to describe my actual writing, not the frequency, would be "concise". I noticed, especially when putting together my book, that the vast majority of my stories are very, *very* short - not something I necessarily consider bad. A good few people do call what I write "Short and sweet". I dislike wasting words, like efficiency.

Not that I'm trying to knock longer stories - I often find myself amazed by how people can paint a vivid picture with words.

Apologies for getting back to this after so long, but I kept thinking about it. Again, thank you for asking! \^\^
