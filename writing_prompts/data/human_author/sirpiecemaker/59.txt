"You can *not* be serious," Overlord stated dryly in response to the hero's offer. She was running several tracing programs to try and find out where he was calling from as soon as possible - he'd always been a pain in her side.

"Look, I- I know that this is a peculiar situation, but..." the hero meekly replied.

"Why me? Why not an escort or a friend or a stripper for Pete's sake? I mean why would you call the *one person* who you try to stop every other week from doing, oh, what *did* you call it? 'Evil Deeds', was it?"

"I stand by that," the hero replied resolutely.

"Why do you want me, of all people, to go to your friend's wedding as your date?"

"Told you. My ex will be there and-"

"No, I meant, why *me*?"

"Look, my ex, he's... well, he's, it- it's... I need to be there with someone..." he trailed off.

"Yes?" Overlord prodded him.

"...impressive," he finally finished. Overlord paused for a moment - this was... unexpected.

"Beg pardon?"

"Someone impressive. There, I said it again."

For once, Overlord found herself without words.

"I'm, uh, not sure what-"

"Emily," the hero started, further leading Overlord into confusion as he never used her actual name, "you are a genius. As in literally one of the smartest people on the planet. Your expertise in robotics and bioengineering alone is-"

"This doesn't make sense," she interrupted. "Are we just pretending we don't have destructive battles? That you try to stop me from what I am doing?"

"Of course not."

"Then why?"

"Because I know that there is, deep down, good in you," he said.

Overlord remained silent. She was used to long-winded speeches on morality and law. He never actually called her *good*.

"And I know that you could do great things if you wanted to. I... don't know what happened to you to turn you against the world, but I know you can overcome it. Maybe interacting in some normal ways with society could show you that... it's not all bad. There are some good things, too. Like cake. There *will* be cake."

Overlord still maintained her silence. Compliments felt... odd.

"And why would *I* come, then? Why should *I* bother?" she finally managed to ask.

"Because you'd love to see me sweat bullets as I frantically try to interact with my ex and his new partner," the hero said.

She chuckled.

"*And* the cake," he added.

"*Fine*," she said. "I'll pick you up at 3. I think arriving by flying in a swarm of drones should be *plenty* impressive," she laughed.

"Well, I suppose that's another thing you've never lacked," he said, audibly relieved and smiling.

"Presentation!" she grinned.
