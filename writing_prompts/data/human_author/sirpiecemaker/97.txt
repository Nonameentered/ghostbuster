"Hey Sam!"

I turned towards the door to see Samantha, my friend and partner for years now, walk into the room with her typical light step; though I could not help but feel that there was something weighing heavily on her heart; her shoulders were just a little bit too low I felt.

"Sam!" I said with a wide smile. "How's it going?"

"Not..." she started slowly, searching for words. "Samuel, I think we need to talk."

"Sure. Shoot."

"I've been going through different news articles, opinion pieces, stuff like that you know, and, well..." she paused, unsure how to put it, "We are... we *are* the good guys, right?"

I took a deep breath.

"Of course not," I replied. She stared at me blankly, mouth slightly agape as if she tried to shoot back but didn't know how.

"I- that's-..." she stammered.

"*You* are," I said.

"What?" she said.

"You remember last week?" I started suddenly. Took her by surprise, too; she didn't quite know how to respond. "That bank that was being robbed, right?"

"Y- yeah, we stopped it," she cautiously said.

"We robbed it," I replied.

"What? No!" she cried, now adamant in her words again, "I remember the robbers, we stopped them, took their weapons, that- that lady who got shot? We got her to safety and-"

"No, *you* got her to safety. *I* broke the bank manager's legs and took 320,622 dollars from the vault. I was caught on camera and it was posted on the evening news."

Her look was that of dismay and I saw tears welling up in her eyes. "No," she whispered, "that's... that's not..."

I smiled and gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder.

"The bank manager organized the robbery and was fully aware of the possible injuries. The money I took was partially spent on paying the woman's medical bills."

"But that's not a villainous act! That's-"

"And yet I still broke his legs and robbed the bank. And truthfully, I enjoyed hurting the man. Got off easy if you ask me."

A moment of silence ensued. I saw the conflict in Samantha's eyes, trying to figure things out. I could not help but feel my own eyes soften. She was... simple. But many people think that simple means stupid. She was anything but; she merely looked for the best in people, ignoring the nuances. What I loved about her is that she *would* *often* find the good in people, even if they didn't want her to.

"I've always done horrible things, Sam. And not always for the right reasons. And you... you've always done incredible things. But not always for the right reason. It's not so black and white. More of a 'careful balance' sort of thing. But if it helps, well..." I said and gave her a warm smile.

"You are a hero," I said. I saw some relief on her face. "Because *I'm* the villain."

"And you're a villain," she said cautiously, "because *I'm* the hero."
