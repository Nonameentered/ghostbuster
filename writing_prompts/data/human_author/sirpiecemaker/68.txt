As the apprentice rushed in, the cantankerous old wizard pondered what she'd discovered this time. Last week, it was a fireball... but pink. The week before, it was a *fireball*, only green. It was charming to see someone so excited about discovering magic, even such little details as colour modifications. Though he *would* like it if her presentations stopped being so hyperactive.

"Master!" the young, freckled woman said as she rushed to his side. "I've made the most wonderful discovery in my latest studies. It-"

"A fireball?" the wizard merely sighed back.

"W- well... yes, but I swear even you'll be surprised by this one!" she excitedly insisted.

The old wizard put down his toast, much to his disappointment, and moved his hand slightly. The two then stepped into the newly formed portal into the training grounds before he once again sat down, preparing himself for the newest colour of the impending fireball.

"Ok, so," she said, nervously preparing her hand gestures, "if you'll just... aaand... just a... there!"

With her final word, a whoosh was heard in the air and a target dummy, scorched from many sides from previous tests, had once again exploded in a shower of flame. The young girl jumped up and down, clapping her hands excitedly; her mentor, however, grew quiet and gravely serious.

"What did you do?" he growled.

"A fireball!" she replied happily. "But the colour of *nothing*! An invisible fireball!"

"No," he merely said.

"I'm- I'm sorry master?"

"You can't do that," he said and looked her in the eye, more serious than she'd ever seen him, "You can't *EVER* do that, you hear me girl?"

"But-" she grew flustered and worried, "but it's possible! You just saw! The applications in combat-"

"Are too great! There's-" he yelled but stopped himself, regaining composure. "Sit," he said and pointed at the chair next to him.

She sat meekly, without a word.

"Do you think you're the first one to discover that?!" he said. He found no response, the girl terrified of answering.

"You're not. Not by a long shot. I'd dare say most young mages did at some point. Even the ones that fell to darkness," he said somewhat somberly.

"But... none of them-"

"...had ever used them? There's *rules*, girl! Rules *none* of us break, not even the worst. An invisible fireball would be a spell of possibly unmatched power. But it'd get everyone thinking. 'What else can we make horribly strong?' we'd all think. And then? Invisible monsters, microscopic magic missiles, supersonic telekinesis... and then?" he said, looking into the distance.

She looked at him expectantly, waiting for him to finish. He was lost in thought but she did notice he was rubbing his left hand, the heavy scarring, the missing finger, the- *oh*.

"It goes too far," he uttered. "And it doesn't end well. Never. For anyone." It was a rare moment of weakness for him, not one he was used to. The apprentice looked at her feet.

"I'm- I'm sorry, master. I'm terribly sorry. I will not repeat my mistake- please do not-"

"Clara," he said. It immediately put an end to her apologies. For him to actually call her by her name...

"I don't want you to be sorry," he said softly. "I want you to learn. You're a studious one. Clever, too. You were bound to find things like this eventually. I just need you to know, now that you have, that you must never go down this path. Because if even the worst of us won't..."

"I understand," she said. He looked at her and, given her solemn expression, was convinced that she did. Worse than solemn, he thought. She looked downright downtrodden.

"You know," he said with an unusually optimistic tone, "I used to make all manner of stuff like this too when I was young." He moved his hand again and opened a small portal into his personal chambers, a dusty shelf on the other hand. He reached in and after a little bit of shuffling the ancient books pulled out a yellowed piece of parchment that likely would have fallen apart already had it not been for the magic in it.

He gave her the slightest of smiles and opened it. She followed his every move intently, but could not quite read the incantation - not only was the ink faded, the words were also incredibly dated. He murmured for a moment before striking the air before him and casting a...

A fireball.

It moved slowly, so incredibly slowly that no one would ever be hit by it, but it did allow her to closely look at it. Namely the little feet that wiggled in the air, simulating running and the little hands at the sides.

After several silent moments, the fireball finally reached the training dummy and exploded softly. The fireball with little hands and feet that looked like it was running.

And she laughed.

She could not help it - it was partly genuine laughter at the preposterous spell, partly her letting out the anxiety and fear she had felt thus far. Whatever the reason, she laughed, uproariously.

And then, to her surprise, so did he.
