"So, let me get this straight," I said, eyes transfixed at my interrogation subject. He stared back.

"You're agents of chaos. Like, literal primordial force of chaos?" I asked. He nodded silently.

"And spreading chaos by doing various tasks, no matter how minor in their nature, earns you... benefits?"

He nodded again.

"With you so far, but... why pushing stuff off of tables?" I inquired.

"Meow," he answered.

"Huh. I suppose that makes sense. Still, you could put a bit more effort into it you lazy bums."

"Meow."

"Fair."

I wrote down the new discovery and tapped my fingers on the table.

"So," I continued, "how'd you get this arrangement in the first place? Any why 9 lives specifically?"

"Meow. *Meow*," he said slowly.

"Seriously?"

"Meow," he assured me with a soft purr.

"I never would have guessed that- well, I suppose there's a lot of things I never would have guessed, right?" I chuckled. "Any closing statements?" I asked.

Without any further comment, he got up from his comfortable position on the other end of the table and walked over to me with the softness of steps befitting a cat. Then he pushed my pen off of the table.

"Goddamit," I sighed.
