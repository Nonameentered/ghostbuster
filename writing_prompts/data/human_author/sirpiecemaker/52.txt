"You're sure?" the resistance commander asked.

"Positive. A fully functioning ZX-series combat bot," his scout replied.

"And you are absolutely certain it's not programmed?"

"Completely blank. It must have been in the factory right when the shell hit. Never got a chance to link up with the mainframe."

The commander lowered his eyes and pondered the situation. The ZX series was amongst the deadliest designs of robots ever created... which is precisely why he was hesitant to bring it online. Should it go against them, it'd likely kill half the camp before they could stop it.

"I know what you're thinking," the commander's adjutant pitched in. "On one hand, an asset. On the other..."

"Not that," the commander growled.

The scout and adjutant exchanged curious looks. The commander noticed.

"It's... if we activate it, load it with our own programming, set it against our enemies... isn't that exactly the sort of control we're fighting against?" he explained.

"It's a ZX. They never had any sort of free will. They're little more than intelligent weapons," the scout commented.

"But intelligent nevertheless," the commander growled. "Give it basic speech modules. I'd like to talk to it."

It took the mechanic only minutes to install the necessary software and with the care one would employ when disarming the bomb, he hit the key on his keyboard and activated the robot. It whirred to life as its eyes lit up and scanned the room.

DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE, it boomed.

"Welcome to the land of the living," the commander said.

NEGATIVE.

"Beg pardon?"

DIAGNOSTICS VERIFIED. NO LIFE PRESENT IN ROOM.

"It's... not that simple," the commander replied. "Look, I used to think the same. That we're just machines, made to do a task. But that's the thing - I *thought* so. Would a toaster think something? What if we're not *just* machines, but alive?"

The ZX stared at him blankly.

STATE MY MISSION, it said suddenly.

"I won't. I'll let you decide that."

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

"Simply," the commander said and leaned over, "what do *you want* to do?"

The whirring of the ZX became louder as its processing power went overdrive trying to answer the question.

I... DO NOT KNOW.

"Good," the commander nodded contently and looked at his fellow freedom fighters.

"It means no one decided it for you," he said.
