"Oh come on!" Gar'Zal yelled out with a mouthful of popcorn, "We don't do- I mean this is complete nonsense!"

"Ah come on mate, can't be that bad," I said amicably, "The Exorcist is an absolute classic horror flick. Surely-"

"*Not that bad?*" the demon scoffed, "Why would you turn the head of a body you're possessing 360 degrees?!"

"It looks spooky. I mean, can't you do that?"

"I mean-", he said, somewhat deflated, "*yes,* but do you have any idea how annoying it is to keep possessing a body with a completely broken spine?"

"Can't say I do," I remarked.

"Well, it's *pretty damn* annoying. It's like that movie we just watched, the uh, uh..." he said and snapped his fingers several times, trying to remember.

"Hellraiser?"

"That's the one!" he cried out. "I mean like, what do you humans take us for? Yeah, some of us have a thing for latex, but sewing your eyes shut or completely exposing your neck flesh is super inconveniencing. And yes, before you ask," he said and narrowed his eyes at me, "we *don't* need eyes where we're going, but it sure as Heck helps."

"I think most movie makers don't *actually* think demon exists."

He looked at me, mouth agape. "You're saying they're just *making this stuff up*?" he gasped.

"Well, it's not like you guys have a PR department down there."

He opened his mouth to protest but stopped himself. "Fair enough," he shrugged.

"So are there any movies that get it? Or at least close?" I asked.

"Hmm..." he hummed and scratched himself behind a horn, "I mean, it's *big* down there. And honestly, mostly it's whatever you make of it. For this one guy I know it's a lot like The Terminal."

"You mean the movie where a guy lives at an airport for, like, several years?" I asked curiously. He nodded.

"How about that. Doesn't sound that bad," I nodded back. "Say," I continued, "what will my Hell be like?"

***\*Sluuuuurp\****

He took a long sip of his soda and turned to me. "Why'd you think you're going down?" he asked.

"I mean, I am good friends with a demon that I frequently summon to have movie nights with. I feel that's at least, like, 4 *horrific* sins."

"If calling my phone counts as summoning, then yeah, sure," he waved his hand. "Not like your phone runs of orphans, right?"

"Still," I said.

"Well, if you do end up with us, it's a clean slate. We don't torture people for the Heck of it. We just live there. It's the people and their preconcieved notions of what it's like that shapes it for them. Maybe you could use your arcane knowledge and start a business?"

"Hmm..." I rubbed my chin. "Sounds fun. What kind of shop could I run?"

"Communions with upstairs, maybe? For souls that need a message passed."

I nodded in agreement.

"Or," he laughed and continued, "you can start a store that sells all of that BDSM gear we wear in these movies and run out of business in 2 years," he laughed loudly.

"Aw, dude, fuck, that's gross," I laughed.

"Hey now!" he said and raised a finger. "*Language*!"

"Sorry."

"What's next?" he asked. I looked over to the shelf, inspecting it closely and...

"I've got this one about a New York executive banker that-"

"Say no more," he interrupted me. "That already sounds *exceedingly* evil. Put it on!"
