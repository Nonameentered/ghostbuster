"Wait, what? Them?" the man said and leaned forwards in his chair.

"Yes, sir," the woman replied.

"What's changed? Why now?" he inquired.

"Seems to be a coup. There's been a breach in the Apex where Them had their-"

"Was it that upstart?" he interrupted.

"We believe so, sir."

The man tapped his fingers on his desk. "Told Them he was trouble. Should've just taken care of him when they had the chance."

"Hindsight, sir. 20/20," the woman said with an exceedingly dry tone. He cast a quick look at her but conceded to the truthfulness of the remark.

"Can We help?"

"We seem to be somewhat reluctant, sir. I believe they are still counting on the possibility Them will completely deteriorate and that we'll be forced to act. We'd likely use the chance to harvest..." the woman quickly flipped through her notes, "at least 3,2 billion right now, ahead of schedule."

"Of course they'd try to pull that shit," the man sighed. "The invasion Them are going with; how's it looking?"

"The... *upstart* as you called him, sir, seems to have mustered 4 Arbitors and is targeting humanity's control centres. So far Washington, Paris and Moscow have fallen. Berlin likely has hours."

"Prague?" he raised his eyebrow.

"It will fall around this time yesterday, sir."

"What about the agents Them had in those centres? Did they evacuate?"

The woman paused for a moment. "It... seems they harvested those too."

The man frowned, somewhat disturbed by the thought. It made no sense. Why even bother? Things have been peaceful for a while. Just some chest-thumping moron making a mess for everyone else. He sighed.

"Right," he said, standing up. "I need you to contact Misses Jones and tell her to monitor We in case they make a move. I am authorizing Class-V countermeasures in case they do. I'll go and prepare the broadcast."

"Of course, sir," the woman said and walked out of the office, her heels click-clacking on the marble floor as she did. He put on the featureless brass mask from his drawer and set off in the opposite direction of her.

What a shitshow, he thought. Hopefully, they can still nip it before too much damage is done.

And on a *Monday* of all days.
