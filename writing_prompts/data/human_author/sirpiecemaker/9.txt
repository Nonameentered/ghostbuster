"Hey Josh!" Morgan Cromwell, my roommate, said loudly, alerting me to his presence, "rent's this Friday, right?"

"'Sup Morgan. Yeah, it is," I answered. I was still groggy from bed, having been woken up early by the distant sounds of explosions and police sirens blaring.

"Good! Let me just get that done now," he said and pulled a large canvas bag with a dollar sign on it from his flowing violet cape adorned with numerous skulls. He insisted they were replica skulls, not actual skulls of the innocent. I didn't much care.

Still half-dazed, I waddled over to the counter to get some cereal and turned the TV on for some background noise.

*...and the fire department is on scene rescuing survivors from the collapsed bank. As of now, we are unsure how many have perished in the gruesome explosion, but estimates say...*

Aw, nice. Morgan bought milk. No dry cereal for me today.

"There," he cheerily said and put 300 dollars down on the counter. "That covers it, I believe?"

"Hey, uh, rent's only 250. This is more than necessary. I'm not sure I have any change around..."

"Ah, don't worry about it," he chuckled. "I had a great payday recently. You can use it for groceries or keep it, I don't much mind."

"Well, thanks Morg," I smiled and ate a spoonful of cereal. "Oh, bu habe sumfing on-" I sputtered with my mouth full and pointed my spoon at his shoulder. He looked over and dislodged the finger, seemingly torn off by an explosion, from his magnificent cloak.

"Huh. Weird," he smiled. "How did that get there." I merely shrugged. "Anyway!" he chirped and put the finger in his pocket, "I'm off now. Got some more business to take care of," he said and cast a glance back at the TV still airing the report about the exploded bank. "See you in the evening? I was thinking about making some goulash if you'd like."

"That sound excellent!" I smiled. He nodded and left the apartment.

I sat down to finish my cereal and watch the TV properly.

*...the chief of police has issued a statement regarding the explosion, saying it is most likely the work of the reviled villain Morganicus-*

I turned the TV off and sighed. I had plans for that exact same bank, even bought the C4, acquired the blueprints, all of it. And then Morgan had to rush in and do it before me with considerably less spectacle. He's yet to figure out the correct amount of chemicals to add to the explosives to give them that neon purple colour which he wants to be his signature calling card. Still, he's a good kid. Eager, capable, smart as a whip.

Maybe one day we'll even team up. Show this city what *real* villainy is.
