I squeezed my palm tightly, digging my fingers into the gash in my palm and forcing several drops of blood onto the rune. I held my breath unconsciously as I saw the chalk lines light up one by one until they all shone a bright red colour and then...

...a flash of light forced me to close my eyes, too much to handle, and the moment I opened them I knew it worked; a figure stood in the thick smoke. The Demon I had been summoning for days now.

The... the seemingly six-year-old child... demon... thing.

"You called, mortal?" it said - the voice was echoey and strange, ethereal yet recognizable. It was like several voices speaking in perfect unison from a distance; a long tunnel, perhaps.

The smoke dissipated and I was finally to able to get a truly good look at the creature. My initial impression did not lie; it looked like a small child, around six years, with pale white skin and blonde hair. You could almost mistake it for a regular human had its eyes not been bright red.

"I... called upon a demon," I said hesitantly.

"And I have answered."

"I wasn't expecting a kid is all. The book illustrated more of a... well, *demonic* entity."

"Fortunate you are, mortal, for this is the first deal I shall be engaging in," it said with an uncomfortable smile. "This truly marks a momentous occasion and you get to be a part of it."

I stared at it for a moment.

"Rrrriiight," I slowly said. "So can we deal, as per usual?"

"What do you desire?"

"Power. Necromancy," I said bluntly.

"Ah, of course," it chuckled. "How... *human*," it said in a blatantly condescending tone.

"Your price?" I asked.

"You know the price," it smiled innocently.

I paused for a moment, making sure one last time this is what I wanted. But I've gone too far to give up now. If I did, it would have all been for nothing, the bodies I've buried would... no, I had to go through with this.

"My soul will be yours."

"Excellent!" it clapped its hands. I felt a surge of power course through my veins; my eyes flared with flames of pure, unbridled magic. I lifted my hands and saw bursts of electricity spark between them and-

A loud crash filled my chamber and multiple figures started pouring in, making horribly distorted moaning noises. I only got a brief look before they rushed me. They were people in various states of decay, covered in dirt and maggots.

They pinned me to the ground and I got a closer look at them. I recognized them.

My sacrifices.

A sense of horror filled me as I saw them rear back and dig their fingers into my abdomen. I yelled in pain as they started ripping me apart while the demon kneeled next to me with its hands in its lap.

"Your power, mortal. You have raised the dead. They are... not pleased to see you," it giggled. A splash of blood stained its face but it didn't stop smiling.

My consciousness started to fade as the undead creatures enacted their revenge.

And all I could see was the blood-spattered face of a smiling child.
