Review: **"The Grill Between Time"**

After much anticipation, our team has decided to finally visit one of the most sought-after grills in the world; The Grill Between Time. Promising a wide selection quality of meats, ribs, sausages, and more, the diner has also made a fierce reputation for itself as a 'one-of-a-kind' establishment where the 3rd and 4th dimensions meet, allowing any and all customers, no matter where or *when* they are from, to enjoy the menu.

Upon arrival, we immediately noticed the cosy, sleek, and timeless atmosphere; tables and chairs made of mahogany, a beautiful tiled floor and exquisitely crafted glassware, it would most certainly appear that the design would be equally appealing to people from all points of history; a statement we can safely make after spending a good portion of our visit speaking with Tulius, a patron visiting from Ancient Rome. We were taken aback at first by our ability to understand him but the owner assured us it was a temporary perk of our visit.

We have ordered honey ribs, steak done medium-rare and the staple "Dimensional" sausage with a side of bread. For drinks, we ordered wine and beer. The meals arrived instantly with zero waiting time; like another one of the perks of the grill. All meals were prepared to perfection though for a more thorough dive into the dishes, please see our added "*Meat Between Time*" review.

The evening we spent was immensely pleasant, even more so thanks to our fellow diners providing a fascinating insight into their time periods. Towards the end of our visit we were even visited by someone seemingly not entirely human; we suspect it was a more evolved human from the far future though we found it rude to pry.

Ultimately, The Grill Between Time most certainly lives up to the hype and we can confidently give it a 5/5; a must-visit for any fan of good food, good atmosphere, and brilliantly vibrant company.
