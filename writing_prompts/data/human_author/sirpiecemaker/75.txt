This is a \[PI\] meaning Prompt Inspired. Generally used for prompts you didn't get to write for; in this case, it's a prompt that's from before I even found this sub.

It's also fair to use them when you write a story you really like but no one reads it and you want to put it out there. Just always credit the original prompter.
