Bjorn, one of the most revered berserkers in the halls of Valhalla, had just finished his 7th beer in the last hour. Despite his resistance to inebriation due both to his colossal size and his lifetime of drinking, even he was starting to be rather... wobbly. And itching for a fight.

"Which among you has slain the most men?" he roared. "I challenge you!"

None raised their hand, but several cast a sideways glance towards the corner of the room where a man sat surrounded by other warriors. Bjorn sized the man up incredulously; he was small, petite even, hands so smooth it was beyond clear he had never lifted a weapon. He could likely not even grasp Bjorn's battleaxe, let alone wield it. Bjorn scoffed and pushed his way past other merry souls and faced the man.

"Oh," the man said. "Hello." His voice was rather high-pitched and soft, a stark contrast to Bjorn's rough and gravely tone.

"Who are you?" Bjorn growled.

"I'm Doug," he smiled. "A pleasure," he said and extended his hand which Bjorn callously ignored.

"What is that... thing on your nose?"

"Oh, haha, these? My spectacles. Help my eyes," Doug said and ran his hand across his glasses. Bjorn scoffed.

"How many have you killed?" Bjorn asked.

"Well, the official amount would be, let's see... 6 million, 342 thousand, 255 people," Doug smiled. "Give or take some 2 million people unaccounted for in the official records."

Bjorn's mighty eyebrows furrowed as he tried his best to imagine the amount in his head.

"You? Impossible," he finally said. "How could you possibly-" he said and poked the man with his finger, upon which several warriors, far taller and more muscular than Doug, stood up and gave Bjorn menacing looks. It was clear they held more respect for him than for Bjorn. He removed his hand from Doug's chest.

"How familiar are you with... numbers?" Doug asked slowly.

"Bjorn can count!"

"Of course, of course," Doug said with defensively raised hands. "See, I'm what's called an accountant. I manage numbers - *lots* of numbers - for people. Like making sure who owes money, how much food there is, stuff like that."

"How is that at all important?" Bjorn said. "I asked for how many you've killed, not-"

"Ah, but see, good sir," Doug smiled, "it is *crucial*! You fight with axe, I with numbers."

Bjorn frowned.

"Say there is a war," Doug continued. "Warriors in combat need food, medicine, reinforcements. So, what would happen if, say, payments for food were late? Why, the food vendors wouldn't provide it. What if, say, medicine, was *mistakenly* shipped to the other side of the country? It'd be sorely lacking on the frontlines and illness would kill thousands, hundreds of thousands. And... well, you get the idea," Doug chuckled. "All I did was move numbers, destroyed documents, lied here and there."

Bjorn's face turned to one of disgust and ever so slight apprehension.

"There's no honour in that! You... merely deceived!"

"And in doing so I have killed more than all of you combined," Doug calmly stated.

"If not for honour, if not for the joy of visceral combat," Bjorn snarled, "then why?"

Doug smiled and took a sip of his goat's milk. "Because I could."
