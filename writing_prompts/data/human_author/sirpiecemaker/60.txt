We found it, at last. The origin of life. Not an intelligent creator, not a random chance, not some cosmic scale. A ball of water. It was... almost insultingly simple. Just a cosmic ball of water filled with cells that would sometimes shoot out comets filled with the basest organic matter. I mean all of our wildest theories seemed so utterly bizarre by comparison, but... how could we predict *this*?

Naturally, we went in all curious.

A submarine. Just... a submarine. Yes, the most advanced submarine ever produced by mankind, but still just a submarine. The crew in it - the best and brightest of our generation - were chosen to receive the utmost honour in the history of possibly not only mankind but perhaps the entire universe. To see where it all began! The source of it all!

It felt as if time had stopped when the submarine returned; the whole world stood with bated breath, glued to their screens, as the door slowly opened and the mission leader, Captain Phillips, stepped out.

Or, we think it's him, anyway.

No one else was as tall as him, but that was all we had to go by - his face, body, entire being, was covered in... something black and dry, cracks showing on it, like old paint. Every noun and then a flake of this substance would break off and float upwards, slowly dissolving in the air.

And he just stood there. No movement, no talking, not even breathing, like a statue.

He stood there when the scientist begged him to speak.

He stood there when they questioned him why the black substance bore the genetic material of the rest of the crew.

He stood there, steady, as the four soldiers tried to drag him into the lab.

He stood there, without a care, as the soldiers clutched their heads and screamed before stopping suddenly and standing up, skin black and dry, unmoving.

He stood there without so much as a flinch as the .50 cal rounds bounced off of him and his new companions.

But none of it - *none of it* \- was as bad as what came next.

The worst was when he stepped forward.
