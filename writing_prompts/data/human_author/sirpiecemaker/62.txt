"You leave your left side open," the princess said as she wiped blood off of her sword.

"Wh... what?" the knight asked, panting for air.

"When you thrust," she explained. "You have good form but you lean on your right foot too much, leave your left side open. If you fought someone with an off-hand dagger or someone more skilled than this rabble," she said and nodded towards the band of dead brigands at their feet, "you'd be looking at a serious stab wound."

"I... I see," he said, finally catching his breath. She gave him a cheeky smile, though it was somewhat hard to see it beneath all the scars she bore on her face.

"Still. Not bad. Certainly better than the pompous bastards who, uh... *guarded* me before." She said the 'guarded' word with such disdain she practically spat it out.

"You do not appear to require guarding, your highness," he said.

"Tell that to my father!" she cried out. "Every time it's a new moron who barely fought anyone that I could drop in a heartbeat yet he insists that 'A princess must have a noble bodyguard', as if- oh, *blast*."

She looked down at her dress, noticing the sleeve barely hanging by a thread. The dress was exquisite, made of the finest silk, yet did not fit her comfortably at all. Despite being made by the best tailor in the kingdom to her exact measurements, they did not account for the chainmail she wore beneath.

Unceremoniously, she ripped the sleeve off entirely and moved her shoulder, enjoying the new comfort.

"Better," she said contently. The knight kneeled and inspected the bodies of the would-be kidnappers.

"Red Hand," he noted.

"Hm?" she looked at him.

"The tattoo," he said and pointed at one of the dead man's shoulders. "They belong to the Red Hand. A network of bandits - more of a cult, really. They're getting bolder, going after royalty. Not sure if it was for a ransom or sacrifice."

"How do you know that?"

"When I was assigned to gua- er, accompany you, your highness, I did research on anyone who could try to harm you. Know your enemies and all that," he said with a knowing nod. She nodded back, almost impressed by his astute observation. *Almost*.

"Not bad, knight. Not bad at all. What's your name?" she asked.

"Sir John Penderton of the River Mou-"

"John it is," she interrupted. "Listen, John, let's make one this clear. I don't need your protection. I dropped two more of these than you did. I can handle myself."

"I understand, your highness. But I was assigned to you. I cannot simply leave."

"I know!" she cried out, rubbing her eyes. "I... know. I just needed to set it clear. That said..."

He looked at her expectantly.

"You seem clever. And you did handle yourself decently. How do you feel about... 'guarding' me while I go out and hunt down this Red Foot or whatever? Could be a good bit of fun. And I won't let some two-bit bastard think they can kidnap me. *Me*!"

He considered it for a moment, then nodded. "It'd be an honour, your highness." Not like he could refuse - she had authority over him. *And* he was pretty sure she'd sooner break his legs than let him drag her back to the castle.

"Good!" she perked up. "Finally, a knight who doesn't try to get in my way."

"If I may, your highness, what happened to the other knights? Those before me?" he asked.

She cracked her calloused knuckles loudly. "They all regrettably broke their arm and were unable to guard me further. All six of them. Funny, isn't it?" she said with a devious grin. The knight gulped nervously but kept his composure.

"Indeed, your highness," he replied dryly.

"Cut it with the 'highness' hogwash, would you? It's tedious."

"How am I to address you then, your hi- uh..."

She gave him a smile - a truly genuine, honest smile, to both of their surprise.

"It's Joanne."

He prepared the words carefully, then gathered his courage - more courage than he needed to fight the brigands. Finally, he managed to speak them. "Very well... Joanne."
