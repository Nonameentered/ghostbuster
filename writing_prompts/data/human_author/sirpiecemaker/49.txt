Thank you kindly!

1. It's somewhat of an itch, a need to create. I scour the sub for prompts I like that interest me, make me go "I can work with this"
2. Since the beginning of this year, so, 10 months. I never actually wrote before that; I didn't feel any interest in it. Imagine my surprise when I got that itch.
3. This one is odd to me. I never... *learned* anything. No writing courses or special grammar lessons. I just sort of... write. I do read a fair bit, so perhaps it's that - I write in a way that sounds good to me. It's actually a bit of a worry of mine that the very things you described are lacking on my part since I can't effectively evaluate my own writing to know my shortcomings. Glad to hear you like it!
4. "Sporadic" perhaps. I don't plan my writing out, instead relying on moment-to-moment inspiration. I usually start with the ending of a story in my head, then write the rest.

Thank you for the questions! Really fun to answer \^\^
