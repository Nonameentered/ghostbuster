"Hey, uh, Tanis?" I yelled towards the living room.

"Yes, honey?" my girlfriend of many years responded.

"I, uh..." I nervously walked to the room where she sat reading a book. "I think I found something in the basement."

"Oh, was it the lawn chairs? Been looking for them for ages," she smiled.

"No, uh, I moved a bookshelf and there was this... small cave filled with treasure."

"Right, my treasure hoard," she said casually.

I stared at her blankly.

"Were the lawn chairs there?" she continued.

"What do you mean 'your' treasure hoard?" I asked warily.

"Well...it's a treasure hoard," she said as if explaining it to a child, "and it's mine. Come on, every dragon has one. I just haven't maintained it in a while. Been busy with the kitchen renovations."

"Wait, what? Are you... are you saying you're a dragon?" I asked.

"What's with you today Jacob?" she giggled. "Are you a *human*?"

My stunned silence put a pause to her jovial manner as she stood up and faced me properly.

"Jacob, are you alright?" she worried.

"But... how are you a dragon?!"

"I've always been a dragon, you know that. What kind of-" she said but paused as she saw my shocked expression.

"You... know that..." she said slowly with a great deal of distress.

"How- how could you be a- what?!"

"Honey I never hid it from you. I've always been open about it. My dating profile said I was a 367 years old dragon!" she cried out.

"I thought you were being quirky!"

"I lit the fireplace with my breath yesterday."

"I was pouring the wine, I didn't-"

"I shed a part of my human form for Halloween! I walked around with wings and tail!"

"I thought it was a really, *really* good costume!" I panicked. We stared at each other for a while in an uneasy silence.

"I... I always thought you knew. That it didn't matter to you. That you loved me no matter what." Her expression was clearly solemn, her anguish clear. She looked down not to meet my eyes. I... I did love her. She was still Tanis. The same Tanis I went to Greece with, that I watched movies with, that I grieved my father's death with.

"Now what?" she whispered.

"Well..." I said slowly, weighing each word with the utmost care. "I dunno about you, but... I could eat. Lasagna, maybe? There's a new Italian place a few blocks away."

The relief on her face was palpable and made my heart flutter.

"I'll go get my coat," she smiled.
