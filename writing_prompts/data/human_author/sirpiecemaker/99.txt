It's a meta horror story. There is the story itself and then at the end of some of the paragraphs, there are small notes in superscript that are warning you, the reader in real life, to stop reading, including in the note saying who originally posted the prompt. I end the story by telling you, the reader, to look at the Moon, implying that contrary to what the story said, there is something terribly wrong; hence the "^(Help me)" at the end, again suggesting that I, as the writer, not the protagonist, am affected.
