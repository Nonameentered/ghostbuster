Can't say it was Skyrim, no. I think more than anything it was the general concept of slayers from Warhammer Fantasy; dwarves who have been dishonoured and seek a glorious death in combat.

Fun story - there is one particular dwarf that is a slayer and wishes to die in combat but is *so good at fighting* that he straight up can't do it, instead becoming an absolute legend.
