It's not human, I know that much. Can't be.

A human wouldn't be able to follow you day in and day out. A human would utter a word at *some* point. A human would be seen by others. But most of all - mundane as it may seem - a human would *stop smiling for at least a second*.

Not this thing though.

It's always there, in the corner of my eye, the reflection of a mirror, just barely leaving my line of sight. But I see it, standing, staring, smiling. Takes on different forms too; people I know, have known, and, in some cases, will know. Always just slightly off - eyes a bit too large, head a bit too crooked, limbs a tad too uneven... grin far too wide.

I wonder if it's trying to dissuade me, especially when it looks like the people I've... worked with. A sort of defence mechanism or psychological deterrent. Doesn't matter. I won't let a few spectres from my past stop me and my work. It's too important. *Far* too important.

If I succeed, we will enter a new era of human civilization. The discovery of fire will pale in comparison to our discovery of their world. The wonder we shall uncover... I can scarcely hold my excitement when I think about it.

If I don't succeed, well... next time you see someone in the corner of your eye, smiling...

That might be me.
