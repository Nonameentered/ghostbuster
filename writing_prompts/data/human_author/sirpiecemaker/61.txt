They wish to inspire change and push social boundaries towards a greater people; a simple start such as killing a rich criminal that got away with it. Wanting people to be outraged at vigilante justice, to reflect on their own broken justice system, yet no one cares. So they go further and further, one-upping their evil deeds hoping it would prod humanity to action, enact new laws, change their ways, become kinder; all to no avail.

When seemingly nothing works; when they can slaughter an entire city and the world as a whole doesn't care - it could lead to complete and utter nihilism. No longer a wish to push an agenda, no belief people will change, but doing it anyway.

'I told you so' in a way.
