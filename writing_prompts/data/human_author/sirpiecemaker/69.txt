"Readings are clear. This vessel is officially mutant-free."

"Good. We can finally shut off the cloners, stop making-"

"Way ahead of ya."

"How about that."

"How many... we's are out there right now?"

"Just you and I, actually. The last one died 42 minutes ago. Venom."

"Then that leaves only one matter to resolve."

"Yeah. Policy. Only one me can leave this room."

"Yep."

"Toss a coin for it?"

"Sounds fair. I'm calling heads."

"..."

"..."

"Lucky me."

"Yeah. Lucky you."

"How are we doing it?"

"I'm guessing a syringe full of sedatives will do? A good way to go compared to the rest of us."

"Sounds good to me."

"Right. Ready?"

"Yeah."

"Scared?"

"I- *\*ow\** no. You're me. You *know* that I'm not scared. And *I* know that *you* are."

"Yeah. I'm scared. Because I'll have to live with what we did here."

"Life's... funny... that... that way..."

"See you in the next one."

"..."

"Lucky you."
