The two lovers kissed each other passionately the moment they met, glad that they were once again able to meet despite the best efforts of their disgruntled parents.

"Your mom give you trouble?" the boy asked.

"Of course she did! Went on another rant about 'Fraternizing with the spawn of that sanctimonious bastard' and all that," the girl replied.

"She called me 'spawn'?" the boy laughed. The girl chuckled back. "Dad was the same. How you'd corrupt me, bewitch me with your..." he said and gently ran his fingers through her hair "villainous wiles."

"How do you know I didn't do *exactly* that?" she smirked.

"How do *you* know I'm not wearing a wire for the FBI right now?" he fired back. The two laughed and went on their walk. 

Ice cream, fresh summer air, a playful offer of robbing a bank, looking at ducks... it was a perfect afternoon. The two found themselves at a bench, watching the park's serene lake.

"What does your dad say about my mom anyway?" the girl asked suddenly.

"Oh, you know. Supervillain, breaks the law, holds no regard for safety..."

"That's... that's not even remotely-" the girl protested.

"I know, but you have to admit..." the boy shrugged. The girl lowered her head.

"I know," she said. "Her relationship with the law is..." she motioned her hand, "*tenuous*, shall we say, but she's... she's not a bad person you know? She never hurt anyone. *Ever*. And she pays for the damages she causes. Indirectly. Usually."

"You're telling me. People think my dad is some boy scout but he ain't all good either. He throws a car at a bad guy and doesn't even bother exchanging insurance."

"Why does she do it anyway?" the boy asked. "I mean, not like she robs the banks for money. You guys are loaded."

"You know last month? First National?" the girl asked. The boy nodded; a great battle between their parents ensued. Media coverage was through the roof.

"She shouldn't have gotten in. The bank manager skimmed on security. City hall knew but profited off of it as well. She tried showing it, how broken the security system was, but..."

"Not in the best of ways," he finished the sentence for her. "And my dad had to fight her."

The two shared the somber moment in quiet reflection.

"Say..." the boy started, "if your mom is a 'villain' but not really all bad, and if my dad is a 'hero' but not really all good... what does that make us?"

She smiled and looked him in the eyes.

"Normal."
