Misery is uncomfortably bitter, like a pill that's stuck in your throat and burning it. You feel like swallowing it, but it doesn't feel like being swallowed.

Sadness is perhaps worse; it's empty. You know it has been eaten and it sits in your stomach like a lead cannonball, but you can't help but feel hollow, even though you feel heavy and weary, unable to get up and do anything.
