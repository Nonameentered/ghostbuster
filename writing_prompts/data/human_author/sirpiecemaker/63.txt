As a lifelong Pratchett fan, I often mimic, both consciously and unconsciously, his style, but I'm fully aware that I'll never be able to actually write like him. I'm not even hard on myself for it - like you said, he's another league altogether and being called Pratchett-esque is still high praise for me.

The fact that people can even tell how much I read him is awesome.
