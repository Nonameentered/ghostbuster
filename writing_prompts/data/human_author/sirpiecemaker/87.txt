To summon soldiers, creatures, and war machines from other worlds is to wield one of the greatest powers in the world. Only the most talented summoners can aspire towards such power; only a few of them manage to gain it. Even then, you cannot choose the world you will pull from; it is something that is simply *yours* and *yours* alone to be. And there is no changing that.

I have seen creatures I would have never dared imagine. Men of Metal with shining eyes, always eager to assimilate everyone they came upon - a dangerous yet volatile force. I've seen... things not of this or any other world, vile, malevolent things of slime and tentacles, apparently not from a *planet* per se but a mind of a troubled yet brilliant man. That summoning has happened only once; the summoner herself went mad the moment she set her eyes upon them.

And... then there's my assigned world.

I do not know what it must be like, living there. But I can only imagine it is a living hell. I pull various soldiers from there - always human, yet their uniforms change wildly, their weaponry is hardly uniform and they are even sometimes accompanied by... I am not entirely sure. They appear human enough but are far larger than the rest of them and possess combat capabilities worth 20 men, if not more.

There is only one unifying factor between these men and women. Their zeal.

Fortunately for me, they are always convinced I am an extension of their great leader - someone they call 'The Emperor' and are more than eager to fight for me. I've... once seen a soldier in their ranks doubt my origin. The soldier behind him used his weapon and quite literally blew his head off. It was... unsettling.

They charge headfirst into battle with no concern for their own safety. They see death as an honourable thing; for what is greater than to die for their Empire? They see victory as but one part of a greater plan by their leader. Among all their fights, all their units, all their battlecries, there is one that sticks out; one chanted by most if not all at some point. And given what I have seen... I truly doubt it stands true in any way.
