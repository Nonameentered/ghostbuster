Thank you!

1. This might be a tad convoluted. Couple of years ago, before I ever found this sub, I wrote a character for a videogame by the name of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. It's a roguelike made and maintained by fans. I had to learn JSON over a weekend to do it and ended up making the most complex in the game without even knowing it. Thing is, the character I wrote - Brigitte LaCroix, the Bone Seer - became a character I hold very dearly in my heart as it was my first taste of creating *something to be proud of*. In most RPGs I even make my character like her. I do also use her in some of my [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/PiecesScriptorium/comments/wxrjyi/humans_such_a_weak_species_they_cannot_hide_their/).
2. As generic as it is, coffee. Lots of milk, lots of sugar. I'm a child.
3. I almost always write at home, sometimes at work; I don't really have the means to be online otherwise. When I start writing, I tend to stop any videos I was watching and start playing music. As of writing this, it's [Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dazVELmg19M&ab_channel=RecklessLove-Topic), but I keep coming back to [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGXPAoyP_cg&ab_channel=ChrisChristodoulou) to get me writing comfortably. Skip to 4:47 and you'll understand, I believe.

Thanks for the question! Super fun to answer \^\^
