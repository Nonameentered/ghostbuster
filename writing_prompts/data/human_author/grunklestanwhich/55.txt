Atlas shrugged, so they say. Shrugged, died, then fell like a shooting star back down to earth in a godly heap. When he collided with the sea I was told the shockwave could be heard from the shoreline. That any ships in a hundred mile radius were vaporized instantly by the sound alone. Then, the real waves came. Massive, thousand foot waves of pure water that plowed through the land as if they were made of cement. 

With nobody to hold the heavens aloft Zeus took the mantle in Atlas's stead, but soon realized there was reason Atlas had never failed. It wasn't just Zeus's punishment that led Atlas to be the holder, no, it was The Fates themselves that had appointed him. His body was patience, it was a tree trunk rooted so deep into the ground that nothing but death could knock it from its placement. The head of the gods could not compare for one of the first times in his existence.   A few days later Zeus too failed as the heavens fell from his grasp and collided with earth. Less violent. Less destructive. Far more chaotic. 

Olympus did not fall. Instead it crashed into the earth and molded itself into the land in a ruined heap. Some gods searched for solution, like Athena and Hermes. Others found new placements in wandering amongst humans, Ares, Aphrodite, and Poseidon. Especially Poseidon. I had crossed paths with the owner of the sea once. His deep blue, vengeful eyes made me tremble. I had heard stories that he had quickly become the strongest upon earths flooding, and hearing it I'd tried to imagine how he looked now. Nothing in my imagination was even near what I had seen when I witnessed him. Massive, as if he was the waves themselves, and twice as angry. Pride leaked from his body like a plague, the world, now mostly sea, bent to his will. 

I remained on one of the few coasts left, and from that coast I could see him clearly gliding through the ocean, or more, he was the ocean. We prayed to other gods as he passed by. None replied. 

They say you can still see Atlas poking up from the Pacific. That his massive body remains dormant and Zeus's next to that. Atlas sleeping and Zeus too broken to move. It would be almost poetic that they had both seemingly perished on the lands they watched over, or it would be if it weren't for the power struggle that now took place. 

I was of the first to set out and see the behemoth. More curiosity than anything, that and humans had become quite apt at boat building in the months since heaven fell. To my surprise Hermes guided our travels. We prayed to him out of habit, sailors typically prayed to Poseidon but he had stopped his answers long ago. So the Golden Messenger took his place. Something about roads being whatever man makes them. 

But all I could think is how awful he looked. How his crown of wings did not glow like it did in the stories and how his cherub skin was not smooth like porcelain. Instead it was tan and dried as jerky, as if he'd been working in the sun for months. His face was sunken and lacked the godhood that stories of old told of.Though his power waned his guidance was true, in a matter of mere days we had sailed through to the crash. With the fog that blanketed the earth the trip should have taken weeks, months if we'd made it at all. Days it was. It seemed even at their weakest the gods proved superior. I did not know why he helped, and I think I was too afraid to ask. 

When we arrived nobody could believe how massive the Titan stood. The water, the ocean, only rose to his chest, the rest remain bulkily shooting out from the waves and up to the sky. His body remained unchanged from before Olympus, unlike Hermes's. His skin rough and cracked in massive chunks of stone, his tunic like a massive sheet floated on the oceans surface. On his hands chains kept him bound even after he'd falled. 

Then we saw Zeus, god of the sky and once of all gods on the big ones shoulder. Upon our boat arriving he sat upright, much to our surprise. It seemed most didn't know whether to kneel or run. I did neither. 

"I knew *uck* eventually some would arrive *ack!* Oh and you brought my son!" 

Hermes did not bow. 

"My brother, I hear he rules now! How quaint." 

Nobody spoke. Nobody breathed. We all waited to see what came next. I had words, but they stuck in my throat like sand. I could not breathe straight, let alone speak. But Hermes did. 

"The fates have ruled it!" Despite his small stature his voice boomed out across the ocean surface. "You know what ails him! You find yourself too weak to change it, too broken to try. You know what must be done Zeus!" 

The bearded man atop the giant shifted his weight and stood shakily. A storm was beginning as dark clouds formed overhead. I could see lightning dance in the sky. 

"Weak? You are brittle messenger! You are but a remnant of times passed. I will show you power!" 

I wondered many times why Zeus had not summoned his lightning. I heard his bolt remained suspened on Olympus, held by Poseidon to stunt his brothers power. I didn't know then if I believed it, but now I saw it to be true. The bolt whizzed towards Zeus as he cast his hand to the sky. I could see it zooming in the distance, crackling and ripping through the air as it approached; trails of lightning arcing through the sky. He reached out, but a larger hand opened first. Atlas, stilk unconscious, his hand held up by a pillar of water. 

"Damn you! Dammit all! I will take what is mine!" Zeus's voice boomed from the heavens. It was too late. The bolt slammed into the Titans hand. Time stopped for us in the boat. Hermes grinned. 

As the bolt struck Atlas's eyes electrified. His body convulsed creating large waved that rocked our boat to no end. Then, they rolled back, showing the deep black of his iris. Atlas awoke. He took a long moment to survey the scene, looking from us, to Zeus, to Poseidon who now stared wide-eyed riding on a wave.  His voice bellowed so loud and so far that those on the shore surely heard. 

**You will be punished for your sins! Godhood is but a farce, I need no Olympus to show you strength.** 

His mighty hand rose, and he stood.
