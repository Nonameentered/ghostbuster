The chains that binded the prisoner looked scrawny by comparison to him. Even while unconscious his muscles rippled as if made of stone and veins ran like rivers just beneath his skin. He was as close to godhood as any man had ever came, not that his summoners knew it. If they did then they'd have been more cautious. But instead a man loomed over him, poking and prodding in anticipation of any sort of a reaction. He gave them none. Instead the only sign of his life was the steady rise and fall of his muscled chest. 

A tall, robed man with creases around his eyes stared down to the man he'd summoned. He could not tell what he had exactly, but he knew it must be important for how much difficulty it had been to bring him to this world. Worth it, he'd hoped. 

"So, is this the hero we summoned?" there was a twinkle in the priests eye as he spoke. 

A younger, more nervous face stood to the right of the priest, too scared to touch the man on the table, to even look at him.   With a stutter he replied: "Well- y-yes I believe so. It says he's called...Doomguy." the apprentice looked into a leather bound book. "Why is he chained up l-like that?" 

"Caution, my boy. It's not like I've ever done this before either. Now help me wake this...Doomguy" he tested the name in his mouth. It came out sour. 

With a steady hand the priest tapped the sides of the mans face. Even while asleep he had a wild look to him. A look of despair, of anguish. Hesitantly the apprentice laid a hand on the mans chest, still chained to the wood alter, and gave him a light shake. 

"Wha-what if he doesn't wake up?" 

"Just hope he does. Because if not then well...well we won't be here long enough to know what comes after." he followed it with a prayer under his breath. *Lord let this not be our final place of rest, and if it to be then let your guidance take us to the after*. Before the apocalypse the priest would have said heaven, but recently he had become unsure. 

Outside, as if on command the roars of otherwordly beasts sounded. The door to the church lurched inward, splinters falling down from the sides as it heaved. 

 The two holy men did not stir. They did not shake at the noise or falter in their task, instead they called harder to the man on the table. 

"Doomguy! You are needed! You are our only hope. You have been summoned to be our savior, and it was quite a pain to do so!" the priest spoke with urgency. Still the body did not stir. 

The door lurched forward once more, bowing in even further, the hinges threatening to pop. 

"Wake him! I'll buy us time my boy!" the robed man ran to the door and pushed a nearby bench in front. It would be of little help. 

"Wake up demon slayer! The book says you will rescue this world, so it must be true!" the young man pounded the slayers chest and came back feeling as if he'd hit solid stone. Back at the large church doors the priest continued his futile attempt to bide time. The doors cracked and fell to ruin. He could see the glowing eyes of the demons outside. Once more they roared with that unholy sound. 

From the table, still in chains, the slayers wild eyes shot open. With a single jerk of his arm the chains burst up from the floor and the apprentice fell back to the ground. The slayer, now awake, stood up from the altar. He was massive, beyond massive, no longer seeming a man but a machine of unstoppable force. 

Walking with purpose he passed the circle engraved in the floor that had been used to bring him to this world. Approaching the door he slid the Arch Priest to the side with a burly hand, who only stared in disbelief. 

He had been here before, Doomguy. Had killed before, slaughtered before.To the priest and the boy this was the destruction of their world, to the slayer, it was any other day. 

Through the cracks in the door the slayer looked out to the sea of flesh and bone that awaited him. It looked almost...comforting. 

"Rip...and tear...Till it's done"
