Mayor Drake was an...eccentric man, eccentric just being the nice word for strange. I can't recall the last time I'd seen him during the day, for instance. And last I'd seen him at all, other than on tv, was last week on a late night stroll through Lyle Park. He scared the shit out of me when he rounded a corner, mid-sprint, only slowing by as he passed to tip his hat and grant me a brief: "Good evening Tommy!", before running off through some bushes. Don't quite know how he knew my name. 

And last barbeque he attended, held for his welcome to the town (which he insist be held at nightfall) I didn't see him eat a single bite. Mentioned something about having "eaten before and planned dinner later", while looking at Ms. Thompson. I guess he was making fast...uh...friends. But it seemed good for Ms. Thompson, who I'm sure could use the company after her husband up and left her. Didn't even leave a note behind. 

But tonight he was to host, and the entire town was set to come. Apparently he owned some extravagant mansion on the outskirts of town that had been in his family for quite some time. At one point this sort of wealth he kept may have been a secret, but the town of Askledad had a way of prying those from people. Then the more that learned of his housing the more that requested to visit until a party was the only option left. Honestly I felt bad, I really did. 

Nobody seemed to understand Mayor Drake in the month since he arrived. It was in agreement that we all loved his policies, that the city was happy to have him, but behind closed doors was all gossip. Talk about his banning of garlic. Of his nocturnal nature and firm opposition to yard signs. 

But I think I had cracked the code. The code of what made the head of our town different: Mayor Drake was a vegan. The garlic fear must be some sort of allergy, and I think I'd heard somewhere that vegans were nocturnal...maybe. That's why tonight for the party I would surprise him with a fat kale salad, all the vegan fixtures (mostly heaps of avocado piled on top). With only an hour to spare I placed the finishing touches on my surprise (mostly even more avocado). 

As I approached the address, the card simply labeled *Mansion on the edge of town* in red cursive, my stomach knotted. Over half the town would be in attendance and I had no idea what to expect. A mansion, sure, but what would there be to eat? What games to play? And how did this strange man really live? 

It didn't take long driving down the winding back road before my destination sprawled up before me. An impressive boast of craftsmanship that appeared as old as the city itself with grand arches and tower roofs ending in sharp points. In front a line of empty cars. I parked and listened in through the door, to hear only silence. 

*Clack clack*, I ratcheted the wolf-headed knocker, to which I was answered immediately by the head of the town. Mayor Drake dressed in gothic sheek complete with a cape, looked down to me. 

"Ah Tommy yes! You are now invited in! Come come....why are you holding that sign?" his tone shifted from excitement to what seemed like fear. 

"Oh this? Its one if your campaign signs I thought It'd make a good gift." as I approached he backed further away. 

"Keep-watch. Tommy watch the point. Watch the wood!" But it was too late. You see, I decided to wear dress shoes, be fancy and all, and my shoes have those strange thin laces that are impossible to tie. So, I didnt. And now I fell sign first down. Down and down until the stake planted itself into Mayor Drakes chest. He looked down with a tinge of confusion, I looked back in horror at what I had done. The campaign sign stabbed clean out his chest read in bold red letters: *Invite Drake into your Home!* Then, *poof* Mayor Drake was gone in a cloud of dust. 

From behind the door a crowd of shocked faces peered out, many of whom I recognized. The town now crowded the door to the mansion looking as if they'd seen a ghost, Drake meanwhile, sat in a steaming dust pile on the floor without much to say. 

Well. That was one way to kill a vegan I guess.
