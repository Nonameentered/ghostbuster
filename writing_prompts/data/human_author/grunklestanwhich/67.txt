My room was colder than usual. Not the sort of natural cold that creeps in with changes in the air, but rather a fast moving, devious cold that signals something amiss. It felt like this was becoming a more common theme with my work. More often I felt as if something was wrong before it was. Premonition, I had chalked it up to, but maybe I just learned to know myself too well. 

A chill crept down my spine, whether from the aforementioned cold or the "science project" on the table before me I couldn't be quite sure. It writhed in an odd way, the severed hand on the floating stone table before me. Not floating literally, that was somewhere beyond my power, but chained up from the ceiling so it lacked any grounded support, just thought I'd clarify. The hand lurched once more, this time the muscles twitching it back to life. 

I had intended to grow it back to working order; to be reattached to some poor soul who had lost it doing some magics of his own, though I was becoming less optimistic by the second. As if it'd heard my thoughts the hand jumped from its placement. It bounded around in a violent show of muscle epilepsy as I watched on in silence, taking mental notes. 

As I'd feared. From the wrist a series of wirey veins sprouted out followed by the beginning of new bone growth. The veins twisted and pulled, forming the framing of an entirely new arm. Slowly I backed away and grabbed my necromancy club from the wall behind me (a normal club with a particularly heavy head). This was the third time this week it'd prove useful, evidence by the dents punched into the side of the wood. 

By now the arm was fully formed, continuing its seizure fit as it grew. I had to kill it before it became fully formed. That would constitute as murder...I think, or at least a crime against humanity. With a heavy hand I brought the club down onto the table with a loud *thwack* followed by a series of awful sounding chain noises as the table saw its opportunity to glide across the room, carried by its binds. The arm continued its defiant growth on the now swinging table. 

"Fuck off!" I yelled in its general direction. It did not listen. A pectoral formed off of the shoulder. The stone table swung to the far wall. 

"You stop that right now mister! There can't be two of you, thats got to break some sort of necromancy rule!" I bluffed. Necromancy had no rules. 

But then the thought struck me of all the trouble I would have to go through with a newly birthed, yet fully grown human spawning in my sanctum. What would he do? I barely even knew the man that the hand originally belonged to on account of my quick borrowing of it. I owed this man a hand. And I indeed did have a hand. A growing, forming hand that desperately needed a body. Genius struck. 

In full sprint I grabbed the hunk of growing flesh from the table as it writhed around in defiance. "Table! Hold down the fort, I will return shortly!" It replied with a series of clanking chain noises. Good. It knew what to do. 

Then I ran through the building, past the series of doors that constituted my complex, all the while fighting with a hunk of growing flesh that had grown to a nearly complete torso. One hand swung out at me, to which I ducked mid sprint. 

"Stop that! I am only- trying to- help!" It began an attempt to crawl up my body in a sort of awkward hug. The neck had begun growing. 

*107...108...110* Yes! The room I had gotten the hand from. I heard his cries from down the hall and luckily had been the first to respond, then quickly realized my lack of medical knowledge and instead opted for the hand. With a firm kick the door shot inward, slamming to the wall behind it. Inside the man from before sat clutching his nubbed arm and desperately flipping through a book of magics with his nose. 

"What the hell! No not you again! Wait...what is that? What is that!" the handless man fell back from his seat with wide eyes, staring at, well, himself. 

No time to explain! Well, actually, we do have a moment if you'd like to hear...no no! We must get this done now! 

I slammed the torso to the table and withdrew my necromancers knife (a regular knife). It fought hard, growing in all directions now and forming too fast to keep up with. It was now or never. With a well timed chop I lopped the hand from its body, which crinkled into a shriveled mess. Once again I was left with a writing hand. 

"Here! Put this on man who's name I never learned!" 

He looked to me with a horrified gaze, but surprisingly complied, taking the hand and placing it onto his nub. In a matter of seconds it had grown attached and only looked a little out of place, a success all things considered. 

"Wow. Ok so that actually worked. Im genuinely impressed." he flexed his hand a few times. But I was already on my way out the door to celebrate. The first patient of many. Hopefully the next one would go just as smoothly.
