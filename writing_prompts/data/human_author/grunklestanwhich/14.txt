Each step was triumph. Each of the God of Thunders final nine steps a greater victory than any man, god, or anything in between had ever achieved, and his sons counted them as such. 

**One** the poison from the mighty beast, slain by Thor himself, had begun to take hold. 

**Two** his hair lost some of its golden lust. His grip loosened ever slightly on the hammer. 

**Three** veins of green spread to his neck, popping out as if they'd explode. 

**Four** his step faltered. Thors step had never faltered. Their *fathers* steps never faltered. 

**Five and Six** only lumped into one motion because it was a stumble. A weak, pathetic stumble. 

**Seven** the thunder faded from his eyes, and so too did the fighting spirit he once had. 

**Eight** the hammer dropped from his grasp and left a neat crater in the frozen earth. 

**Nine** Thor dropped in a lifeless heap. The sky parted as if just for him, and a ray of sun all his own shined down upon him. 

Magni and Modi were left staring at their fathers body, at the death and destruction around them. Ragnarök had come, and now gone. There was nothing to say, only the sound of the winters wind blowing through the trees. Finally they both came upon the hammer left in the snow, each knowing in the moment what the other was thinking. Magni was the first to speak, the more confident of the two. 

"So....who gets it?" 

"I dunno. I figured we'd each lug it around for a week, and whoever used it better would keep it. Not like either of us could ever truly wield it anyways." 

They both sat in silence, simply staring at the symbol of their fathers ultimate legacy buried in the snow. Mjölnir. A weapon eternal yet useless in the hands of anyone who wasn't Thor. A waste. Magni considered his brothers proposal, well, he mostly considered it idiotic, but he had never backed from a challenge before. Especially not now, in the face of their fathers honor. 

"Fine...you first." 

Modi did not hesitate to approach. He walked up to the hammer as if it'd jump out to bite him. As if it was some extension of the mighty snake his father had just slain, but it did no such thing. As he placed his hands on the grip he felt nothing. As he bent down, squatting up until his muscles bulged through his clothes he still felt nothing. 

Embarrassingly he mumbled, "Ah...just thought I'd check to be sure.", before grabbing it and dragging the hunk of metal behind him. 

"Good luck brother! I will await your tales of adventure, I will lay father to rest." 

Modi's week with the hammer was...uneventful. Mostly bragging of his ownership of it to anyone who would listen, and considering Ragnarök not many, and one ingenious application of using it to split a mountain in two for no reason but to have something to tell his brother. 

Upon passing it to Magni Modi kept his tales to himself as to not give his brother anything to beat. But three days into the week it was apparent that keeping these secrets were unnecessary as Magni also had no idea what to do with the remnant of his father. He mostly tried lifting it, day and night, solely convinced that with enough effort he could show back up at the weeks end wielding the thing rather than dragging it through the snow. But no such luck. No amount of lifting made it any lighter. No amount of training made the hammer more balanced and he wondered how his father made it seem so simple. 

After the week the two arrived back where they'd taken it, neither with a story to tell. 

"I thought you said you'd lay father to rest?" Modi gestured up to the hill where Thor's body still lay in the same condition they'd left it. 

"I tried. The pyre burned, he didn't. I figured here was better. 

Modi nodded in agreement before blurting "Alright you win. You can keep the hammer brother. Well fought." 

"Ah no! I saw the way you split that mountain in two, well played! You may keep Mjölnir. Do our father proud." 

They stared to each other wide eyed, then burst into deep laughter, Magni putting a large hand on his brothers shoulder to steady himself. 

"Well, maybe it was only meant to be fathers after all. Let's be sure that it stays that way, huh Modi?" 

"Yes. We are not worthy as he had been. No man has been or will be" 

They brought the hammer back up to their fathers resting place on the hill, where that beam of light still shined down on him, and placed it by his side. It looked good there. Looked at home, and their father more complete with its presence. 

The brothers agreed that it was their fathers to own, and that any man worthy could one day lay stake to its claim, should such a day ever come.
