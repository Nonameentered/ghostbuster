The shoveling was a grueling process that we had been at for weeks. It went like this: put a shovel in the fridge, remove a cold shovel, place your hot shovel in the shovel trash pile, repeat. It would work better if the fridges could fit more than one shovel, but with them having to be strapped to our backs and all that wasn't really an option. 

I tossed a melted shovel to the side with a repititious *clank* then withdrew another from my back. Around me several others did the same. We had been shoveling so long that our movements were often on pace. 

I don't remember how long it'd been since we broke the crust. I do remember it being a big deal though. Cheers, laughs, an ice cream cake, the works. But now that seemed an eternity ago. A faded and distant memory of long gone success. The mantle was our fight now. 

Behind me some labcoat yelled: "Heats starting to turn up boys! We must be close!" He looked ridiculous. For some reason the labcoats insisted upon wearing their white coats over their chrome heat suits. This led to them all ordering xxxl coats and a great deal of time looking in the mirror to ensure they didnt look entirely ridiculous. They still did. 

Across from me a suit mumbled at the ground, "We better be close. Starting to run out of cold ones." then threw his shovel into the pile. 

But I guess the scientist was right. The ground beneath me bad begun glowing through the cracks in the dirt. I began shoveling faster, faster, faster still. Around me others picked up on this new rhythm and followed, all of us shoveling as fast as we could with what little strength we had. 

After a moment we had broken through. The mantle had been conquered. A labcoat let out a roar "Wooo! Ice cream cake for everyone!" He reached into his fridge pack revealing a tower of cakes. Another coat cut him off, "Wait...what. What is that?" Below us the core glowed a bright, almost blinding orange. But something more. It was too round. Too shapely. The other layers were ill-defined, but this was something different. 

One of the coats bent down slowly and gave the glowing orange sphere a knock. To our surprise it sounded...hollow. The knock echoed deep within the sphere. Then from within the sphere there was a noise. Like a whirring, a loud whipping of metal as if someone was taking a zipline. Suddenly a tablet burst up through the sphere and presented itself front and center, it read *This man-made planet is our project's last hope: a space station capable of sustaining life. All other options have failed.* 

All eyes read it, then read it again, then the thorough ones amongst us read one more time, just to be sure. It grew silent. Then shoveling began again, one by one. A coat looked around in stunned silence. "Wha- what are you all doing?" 

"Well. What else is there to do but dig our way out? We found it. So. Lets do it." 

"Found it? This raises all sorts of questions! This, this is the meaning to life!" 

This time I spoke "Yup. Pretty powerful stuff. So...start planning your speech on the way back up then" more had begun shoveling upwards. I didn't have the heart to tell them that it wouldn't work. 

The scientists remained baffled, they spoke in circles and wrote down theories and formulas on stone tablets. And us? We shoveled. Praying we had enough cold ones to get us back up. 

I can't say I didnt ponder the meaning of it all. That I didn't feel surprised by the turn of events and wonder what could be in that core. All of it intrigued me. But I was the one shoveling. And I'd be damned if I wasted any more cold ones down here.

 There was nothing more to know anyways. We were the aliens, or at least made by them. There was nothing else. And I had to shovel.
