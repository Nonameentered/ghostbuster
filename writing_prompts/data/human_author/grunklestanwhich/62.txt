I hovered before them, the gears in my brain grinding together as I considered a response. Usually the kids just cheer as I fly away. Usually their only response to my line was "Ok Windsong!", but this kid, he stared me down with genuine wonder. 

"I...well it's not about the money! It's about doing what's right!" 

"My dad said he makes more than you, he works at the bank. I wanna work at the bank too." 

His dad was probably right. Pay didn't really exist in my realm of work. Sure in my apartment I had plenty of keys to the city, gifts from ambassadors, pictures with powerful men hanging on the walls, but it was still an apartment, and one that I could barely afford. I would never admit it aloud that I would trade it all for a salary. 

"Ah, well that's very good! You should want to be like your father! Alright kids be sure to-" 

"*My* dad says you're a waste of time." another kid interrupted. 

Well that was just mean. But still a kid as shown plainly by the large booger hanging from his nose I floated down, the wind surrounding me softly blowing back the kids hair and fluttering their kool-aid stained shirts. As I landed the weather dispersed and I leaned in close. 

"What bank did you say your dad worked at?" I whispered, just to the one in the middle. He told me, in broken words and misspoken titles, but when you've protected the city this long you learn to parse these things out. 

"Stay safe kids. Ill be back." I didn't bother putting on my hero voice. I just spoke, then burst off from the ground, the group of kids barely standing after facing the windstorm from my launch. In seconds I was at the banks front steps. *Headway International* The kid had told me *Head Bank*, close enough. 

Fueled by anger, by a sense of just how unfair what I did was. What did that kids dad do? Did he save the city working twelve, thirteen hour days? Of course not. Yet he made double, maybe triple what I did. 

I burst through the glass bank doors, the storm of my wind in tow. Papers shot from desks, pens flew up into the air,  at one of the counters a mans toupee rose from his head. Everyone shot for some semblance of cover from my power.

 As my storm settled all eyes were on me. I spoke loudly, confidently, my voice carried by wind: "I would like a job!". 

The room stared back with wide eyes. One of the clerks looked around to the devistation I had caused just by entering. "Well I uh...yes right this way Mr. Windsong."
