*Unconventional*, thats the word the registers used when I'd gone to enter the competition. They snickered and said that my weapon of choice was "unfit, ridiculous" and worst of all, that word: unconventional.  I knew what they meant by it. They meant that I would lose. That I had no chance. But to me it was just a word meaning a lack of creativy. 

I had seen the other contenders. Seen their *conventional* weapons. Yet what they failed to realize, what they all failed to understand is that all that conventional means is common. I have fought against every conventional weapon, trained against every great sword and rapier, bested every overconfident demeanor hidden behind a tower shield. And my opponents had too. What they hadn't fought was the unconventional. What they had to best...was me. 

As I entered the tunnel I could barely hear against the roar of the crowd on the other side. Hundreds of voices it must have been, all stacked neatly on the stone benches that lined the colliseum. I was them just last year, watching in awe at the great warriors below. Baltghast had been my favorite. An underdog who wielded a large club that appeared homemade. The way the crowd hushed as he bested opponent after opponent, all untrained against such a beast of a weapon. Now it was my turn. 

As I exited the tunnel opposite my opponent the crowd burst into new levels of sound. Upon seeing what I wielded though I could hear sections mumble in confusion, then others roar in bursts of laughter. Even my opponent, who had come forward until he stood facing me, could not keep the grin from his face. I would remove it. 

A shortsword, he had. Arms length. Handsome, with inscribings that I'm sure meant something, but I didn't care to decipher. Instead I gripped tightly to the handle of the pan in my hands. A cooking pan, my family had it for quite some time. Heavy and dull. My mother told me to return it when I finished, and I intended to do just that. 

I looked to the stand of past winners. Of champions the arena had granted fame. They stood in a box of ornery and gold, posing for their onlookers. Most of them looked to my rival with admiration, a few to me with grins, but Baltghast, he looked straight into my eyes. I could feel it. 

 There was no announcement, no bow, instead a simple clang of a gong and the match had begun. He swung down instantly, arms full of muscle. If a hit like that connected it would cut almost any man in two. He was bigger, stronger than me. The clear favorite of the two of us. If I had any conventional weapon it would be no contest, but I did not. 

His sword connected with my pan and clanked off to the side, and I could feel the reverb from his power in my hands. He brought the sword up for a second, clumsier swing from the dirt, but I was already there. My pan inches from his head. With a loud *cla-ah-ang* my cookingware connected. The crowd gasped, then grew silent. My opponent fell in the dirt. 

One lone set of hands clapped for me. The past champion with the club, clapped and nearly doubled-over in his seat from laughter. The rest stood in stunned silence. 

But I was not done. Not even close. This was just one small victory in a sea of faces I'd defeat. I would steal the rest of their applause.
