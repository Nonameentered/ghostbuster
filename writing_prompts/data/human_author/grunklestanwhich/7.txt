The sad, decaying room sat before me, falling apart from years of neglect. I poured another glass of red and downed it. I'm sure at one point in my life a wine this cheap would have burned going down, but now? Now feeling anything was a welcomed rarity. 

As I poured another the room suddenly felt unnaturally gloomy, as if the shadows in the corners had swallowed me whole. In that moment a figure appeared in the chair across the room, robe dragging down onto the floor. He looked up to me behind a darkened hood. 

"...Death?" I asked, unsure of the word as it left my throat. I was not fearful, for he was an old acquaintance. A man, or...thing, that I had met once before. 

The robed man replied without missing a beat, a voice like gravel scraping "I’m whoever you need me to be."

I didn't need anybody really, anything. People think of depression as a lack of something, a lack of happiness or love, but in reality it's just like it was never there to start. But I had questions. 

I thought for a moment before my reply. "Do I matter?"

"Do you think you matter?"

"Well- I'd like to believe so, even if I dont." 

"Well then congratulations." A dull horn sounded and clumps of sad confetti fell from above me. 

"I didn't mean it like that-." I paused to brush a lump of confetti from my shoulder.

"Does it matter?” I asked, gesturing out of the window to the world outside. 

"No, just you. You are the Ubermensch. You are Aristotle and Plato. You are Caesar. You're a narcissistic fool. Well so yeah, just like Caesar."

"I'm not here to be insulted."

"And I don't STAY here to be asked pointless questions, but look where we are."

The room grew silent between us before I broke the tension by downing my another glass of wine. The reaper just watched on. 

"I just want to know if any of this is important, and what's the meaning to life? What happens when we die?"

"I'm not a shrink, but how important is humanity to you?"

 "It used to mean the world to me. A time ago." my hands reached for the bottle but paused short. 

"Then you had the world."

"I meant in a cosmic sort of way."

"In a cosmic sort of way nothing matters. Get used to it." 

At the snap of his bony finger a wine glass appeared in the reapers hands. Wine began filling the glass, my bottle emptying slowly at my side. 

"You drink?"

"Only when I want to." Death brought the glass up to what would be his mouth and it disappeared behind his hood. When he withdrew it the glass was polished clean. 

"You remind me a lot of my brother."

"Hm? Yeah I get that a lot."

"A lot of people tell you that you remind them of my brother?" I smirked for the first time in a while. 

"If it weren't for the wine I'd be almost positive this was torture. I'm only here to conference. Call it an olive branch, or maybe just foresight.", the glass in his hands began filling again with deep red liquid. 

"So how does it all end?"

For the first time the Reaper raised himself from the chair to face me. I felt something in my chest. A tension, a feeling I hadn't felt in so long I almost could not place a name to it. Anxiety, excitement, a heart attack? 

I feared the Reaper didn't have an answer to my question, but after a second he replied.

"Quietly."
