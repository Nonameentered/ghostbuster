Vaults are stupid, treasure troves too. Both just invitations to be robbed by someone with half a mind and a sprinkle of sense to do so. Unfortunately I possessed neither qualities, though I did have a few others to speak of. Determination, for one, at least twice that of the average man and they half as much as me, so... quadruple the determination I believe. Numbers aren't a strength, but I did like to think myself privy to a fair amount of luck. 

Once I'd been caught surveying a place to hit, some small homestead or the like, and the owner caught on. Was supposed to be out with the missus, why that got cut short I'd never know. When he caught me he beat me half to death, left me bleeding at his door. Physician said I was lucky to be alive. Since then I knew I must've mistakenly stolen up some poor bastards luck along the way. Hate to see where he wound up, but thankful that it brought me to where I was today. 

*I am coming to take your most valued treasure. Stop me if you can* I had sent the letter a month ago to date. Even wax sealed the envelope with my gold goin insignia, just to show those hoity-toity types that I meant what I said. It seemed they caught on. The amount of guards around the castle surely grew after my invitation arrived, though by how much I was unsure; numbers and all. 

This is why vaults are idiotic. Same as gargantuan stone front doors and gold embroidered gates: they are all just invitations to steal. And if not then they at least make a man consider the fact. So, all I had to do was enter the back. Say a few hello's, share a few stories and I would be on my way, which is... nearly how it went. I snuck quietly, passed the treeline at the back of the building and through the first door I saw. 

I had been smart enough to had taken some precaution. Formal dress, of course; a few blades, standard; rope, classic, and determination. Turns out I only needed the determination, good thing I had so much The sneaking in process proved less of a sneak and more of a determined walk. Every guard was too busy raving about the threat of  action. The ones going to the vault clamored at the stairs in rabid packs, pushing through one another. They ranted about what they would do when the caught the thief. Though I didn't catch the whole thing, the punishments they listed sounded worse than death. 

But just as I'd arrived I'd gone, true to my word. Left with the most valued treasure and I hadn't even had to steal it. If I didn't know any better Ida said that it actually wanted to be stolen, Helen, the kings lovely wife. She slipped back through the forest with me behind the castle unseen. Or seen without care. Nobody really questioned royalty. So I left, having completed my greatest heist. Id stolen not a heart, but a soul  and claimed it as my own.

In my experience men with more gold than they can count are the most skilled at neglect. Throwing money at problems becomes a past time, a skill set. Thats why I stopped stealing it, was too easy, led to too many terribly selfish outcomes, and I was very determined to not wind up like the king of whatever castle that was. 

There was no certain *happily ever after*, but there was a freedom we now both shared. Her being granted her independence, and me proving that I was not only the greatest thief to ever live, but the luckiest too.

Maybe if the king had placed her in a vault he'd still have her.
