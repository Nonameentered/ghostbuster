A light zipped across the field, a neat little shard of heat concentrated into an arrow shape. As it struck the grass it blew up into an impressive display of power, sending the older, wiser man down to the dirt. He muttered a curse under his breath as he arose, his head now filled with malice, his tongue tasting of blood.  But something else was there too. A feeling, cutting through his fiery rage like ice. *What the hell was that?*

Upon rising the robed man concentrated hard until the world around him became malleable, shapeable to his will. The grass at his feet rose up to the heavens, then he too rose until he floated just above the ground. He thought about the air molecules around his younger opponent. About how much of a shame it'd be if those molecules were to just...poof away. 

Meanwhile the boy across the field stared in confusion at the old man, levitating quietly to himself. He readied a spell, thinking he must've broken the poor fellow, or he'd become senile in his old age, but when he went to breathe in his throat did not take in any air. Lungs did not inhale. For a panicked moment he tried with all desperation to spark another bolt of fire at his fingertips but only sparks came forth. Across the field a voice called out. 

"Just give up boy! I'll admit I was impressed, but you are no match. I'd hate to see such a talent die here in this field, though if it comes to that I'll gladly watch!...Ah...you can't hear me. No air for the sound." 

The boy watched his opponent's mouth move though heard no sound. It did not matter though, he had much more pressing matters on hand and only a few more moments of air. With an open hand the boy found what he needed in the grass, in the life around him. With his last seconds of breath he yanked the life from them leaving them dry and withered. The air around him returned and he inhaled it deep like a jug of water to a man in the desert.

"Hey...how the hell. Boy! How the hell did you do that?!" the robed wizard yelled. 

The boy let out another strained cough before replying: "Funny, I was *ack* gunna ask you the same thing old man." 

"Where'd you study lad? Crenshaws? No no, Whiles I'd bet." 

"Those stuffy places? No chance. Crenshaw laughed me out, and Whiles? What a joke. Just beat their best last week. You're from Retrodum innit?" the boy brushed off his jacket and fiddled with his sleeves for no reason other than to hide the fact that he still had a shortness of breath from the mages last attack. 

"Yes boy, Retrodum's best. Im assuming that's why you're here. Well I hope you've found that I am no Whiles rudimentary magelet. Retrodum is a respected staple-" 

"Ah you're casting to the wrong crowd. But.." in a flash the boy was now standing next to the mage, a cocky grin on his face. "I dont suppose you'd teach me a few things." 

"Teleportation. A neat party trick" the robed man tried his best to hide the sudden wideness of his old eyes. "And I don't see why not. If for no other reason than to beat that Crenshaw man...Greyth I think he's called. Heard he's quite good." 

"Oh! He was next on my list." the boy yanked a crinkled piece of parchment from his pocket. The robed man recognized some of the names, including his own. 

~~Franth of the Grey~~

~~Dallas Stapleton~~

~~Carrie Underwood~~

Thom Daugers

Greyth Thundercall

The robed man, Thom, took a long look. Then with an outstretched hand in proposition he looked over to the boy. "It's a deal then. I hear Greyth's an asshole anyways. Hate to lose to him." 

"Then let's not old timer" he returned the gesture and they shook. Both knowing something special had just happened but not knowing the reality. The reality that the shake was their becoming the most powerful duo the world of wizarding would ever see.
