The house at the intersection of 15th and Abson Street had begun to rot, literally. Shingles slid off the roof piling up on the sidewalk, the paint began to peel back in thin sheets, and the front door drooped inwards like an old banana.  Worst of all the whole thing had began to wreak with the scent of death. When a house died it was the worst, usually they were  quarantined and well... dismembered before that late stage decay set in. If not it could bring in all kinds of pests, but some families liked to hold on as long as they could. 

Inside Darrel Turnen sat on a couch that seemed pristine compared to the inner decay of the house. His wife was seated next to him, and their daughter across.  

"Are we going to move soon?" the youngest in the room broke the uncomfortable silence. 

"Well....I just thought we had more time. I don't think she's all gone yet right honey?" 

As if on queue a chunk of the ceiling fell from its place and hit the floor with a mushy squelch. The hole it left behind revealed a slimy mess of graying flesh. 

"Ok fine, but don't you think it's a little wrong to talk about this sort of thing, ya know, in here?" Darell went to gesture to a specific spot but instead found himself waving his hands across the entire room. 

"It can't hear us. It's not like she ever could really. Better to just do it in here." 

"Fine." Darell spoke unconvinced, but spoke nonetheless. "I think we should get an inorganic next. Nothing could replace this old girl, and I dont even want to think about that right now." 

"What, like a pre built?" 

"Yeah, why not?" Darrel wrinkled the skin of his forehead. "They can last forever you know. No upkeep, no maintenance, just a place to stay." 

At this suggestion the youngest, Lilly spoke up, "What? But how will we bond with it? Then it's just another inorganic hunk of material." 

"Yes, exactly! Inorganic. Simple, retro, I mean can you imagine, god forbid, when my car passes away? Dealing with her going was hard enough." Darell laid a hand on the wall but quickly retracted it as it squished inward. From the ceiling that empty crater from where the piece fell began dripping. 

"Fine. But lets build one, take the bones. She had good bones." 

Normally Darell would have argued, but coming to an agreement this fast was a miracle in and of itself. Plus his wife was right, she did have good bones, and it was the least they could do to remember the old girl. Getting a new organic may have been cheaper, but bonding with a new house just took too much work. 

And so they built the new over the old. Let it decay to nothing  before having a classic reconstructed, a pre-built, they called it. Those walls of flesh became drywall, the floors wood, and the foundation a brick of stone. A giant headstone honoring the loss of a loved one, of a house they all loved dearly. 

But those organics are tricky things. Built to be resilient and long-lasting. In some cases forever lasting. Before long those bones became one with that inorganic material. The marrow within lived on, attached, and grew once more. And once again they had the house they had once loved.
