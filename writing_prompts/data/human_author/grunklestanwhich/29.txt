"Well you see, it is all about getting the mix right." the two men down the bar table nodded their heads in agreement with the first. 

"Aye cheers to that. You start messing with the mix and the coke doesn't come out right. Ruin the whole batch" the words were once again met with nods of agreement at the bar. Lesser so now from the man farthest down; he looked nervous, as if any wrong word and his head would explode. 

The bartender served another round of drinks to the gentleman, who continued their very similar conversation on vastly different topics. 

"And cooking it. One wrong move and.." the burliest amongst them paused and mimicked his throat being slit "...you fuck the whole thing up!" he followed up with a long swig of his beer. The furthest down the table, the most nervous amongst them, tried to take a sip of his own but found that he could not bring the glass to his lips for more than a moment before setting it back down. He kept bringing it up, then back down, back up, each time getting barely a drop before his nerves got the best of him again. 

After a moment of this he slammed down the glass and spoke, "You sure it's smart to be talking about this here? I'm all for friendly conversation but c'mon."

The other two paused, growing silent at his words. Behind them in the bar glasses clinked, voices mumbled to one another, and the sounds of the room found there ways between them. But the three men drank in silence. 

"I suppose yer right there lad." the burly one spoke slowly, carefully. "Start revealing too much and prying eyes might find their way in. Smart to think about. Sometimes my nature gets the best of me, eh." 

The first at the bar followed, a tall, sharp faced man with dull gray eyes. He had not looked up from the table since the conversation had begun. "Indeed. I had considered the thought, though I was elated to have met some like-minded fellows. Well, it was nice to meet you gentlemen anyways. Cheers."

The three toasted, tapping their drinks together and taking long swigs. In a toast, to a like-minded bunch. 

The first, the gray eyed man, got up first, leaving to secure a batch of coke he'd recently secured through...less than legal means. The second, the burlier of the three, left to prepare for work tomorrow. The furnaces would not run themselves. And the last. He took several more long, nervous sips of his drink, a bottle of coke that he could barely stomach. Not because he had grown to hate the drink, but because of the rumor circulating that the mix, the formula, had been leaked.
