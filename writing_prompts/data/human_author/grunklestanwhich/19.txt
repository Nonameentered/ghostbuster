Fuck...ah fuck fuck fuck" Ichabod rifled through the cupboard, throwing all sorts of highly breakable things to the floor in the process. Each one shattering brought him no closer to what he really looked for: a small obsidian marble. Normally this would be no issue, a location spell would do the trick, but a spell needed a name, and Ichabod was sure an object as precious as this had no name. A smart move for those who didn't lose items so frequently. 

Behind him, as he continued his tossing Ichabod Jr. ducked and weaved various objects with little effort, his scaled head bobbing as plates flew past.

 "Ichabod Jr, where did it go?!" the lizard looked back to him with no discernable expression. Very lizardy, one could say. Icabod jr chose not to reply, and instead flicked his tongue across his eye. 

"Dammit! What do I keep you around for?!" the tongue came out once again, this time slowly licking the other eye. 

"Fine. I don't need your help!" Ichabod went to slam the cardboard but realized it would not be the same with how empty it was after his tirade. Instead he dropped down to the  stone floors and began a desperate search, scooting along. After only a few half-hearted shimmys along the stone and nothing in sight Ichabod pricked his finger then called out to the room. "I could really use the help right about now. So...help." Instantly at his request an unseen energy filled the room. Spread like a fog throughout. Then the room began to rumble with an unholy power. *Something stirred* First ten, then twenty, thirty, more and more spiders crawled out from their various getaways within the room, all suddenly compelled to help the thin, sharp faced man in the center. The ones on the floor, most long dead, twitched and jolted back to life then joining the ranks of the rest. 

The arachnid army scoured the room at a spiders pace, swinging from webs and rapelling down from the ceiling to the floor. Meanwhile, Ichabod searched for the marble too, but now with not nearly as much effort as before. He lifted a box with a groan, then, upon seeing it was empty underneath let out a long huff and lowered it once again. Ichabod jr watched on with lizardy judgement. 

Finally, after what Ichabod thought had been an eternity, a group of spiders approached, something in their hands...or do they have hands...feet?....legs maybe? Legs, yes.  They approached with someone clasped between their legs. In a show of wobbly acrobatics the crowd of spiders approached Ichabod, then bowed, revealing the object of the necromancers obsession. 

"Most appreciated. Ichabod brought a fast hand down onto the arachnid acrobats crushing them and feeling only the marble in his palm. Upon pulling back he looked to his hand, which not was smeared by a large group of spider bodies. "Eck. I didn't think that one through. Oh well...I hate spiders." Ichabod brought the marble up to his mouth, ready to give it a kiss, but promptly halted at the sight of a twitchy leg stuck to it. 

"Found er'!" the necromancer tucked the sphere into his breast pocket. "Ah, and no thanks to you Ichabod Jr."

The lizard had slinked its way back to the room and looked up to who he unfortunately had to call master. Then he replied "Fisrtly you know that is not my name. And yes yes, I've heard it before. 'Some familiar I have proved to be' and the like I'm sure." Rather than argue as they so often did Ichabod decided to celebrate his victory, stepping off into the other room after being sure to give Uru a few less than nice hand gestures. 

Uru the lizard sat in silence among the broken pieces of plate. He listened as his masters footsteps raised up the stairs and off further still, above him and over to a room in the back. In that quiet room, only the settling of broken glass daring to make a sound, the lizard familiar mumbled to himself. "Maybe he was smart enough to find immortality, but I'll be damned if that idiot has the key to it too. Bah. Ill just have to hide it better. Next time somewhere the spiders wont go." 

And all Ichabod thought, was that maybe he needed to keep better track of his things.
