My eyes did not shoot open, full of potent rage. My face did not remain caked in the dried blood that proved I had fought well. These were just the images in my dreams, the ways I was told that waking up in battle should be if I was unlucky enough to wake up at all. 

Instead my awakening was in a docile lull, surrounded by those who cared about me far more than I them. I cared only of their deaths, of their peoples enslavement at the hands of mine, of winning. A woman peered over my bed as my eyes drifted open. Pretty, a soft face with sharp eyes and finely drawn lines. If I wasn't so dazed I would have choked her till she turned blue. 

"Awake I see. Your people recover fast" her words drifted in and out of my consciousness, as if she spoke to me from underwater. Then she turned to another body, another nurse maybe. "Dorian is awake. What now?" 

Surely she would plant a knife in my neck. Would put a rifle to my chest and pull until I'd stopped moving. They would be pulling for longer than they had the strength to do and would find me ok, then find themselves corpses. But they did not. "Keep him here until we are sure he's well. Then we can let him back.", was all the other replied. *A trap*. *A trick*. We killed their people by the pile and laughed as we did, yet here in this tent I was being told I would be released. Under my sheet I reached down my leg in search of the blade my people held dear, trying my best to keep my arm flat beneath. Then, after a moment, my hand met its grip. *Fools*. Fools. Empathetic, compassionate fools who remembered things like names and traits other than those that suited warriors. 

Outside the sounds of war machines grew. Metal shells erupting into shrapnel and fire. Cannons and slugs punching holes through metal as if it wasn't even there. Inside the tent the nurses didnt even duck at the sounds. Maybe they had once, but now they just continued their work as if it were a regular day. Tending to broken men that looked to me with fear. 

"Dorian. You'll be going back soon. We'll put you as far into your line as we can." her voice was sweet but callous, with a hint of something buried deeper. A coldness maybe. A hatred. I would not blame her. The losers of such crusades always learned to hate. And there were a lot of losers. 

I grabbed her by the wrist, my hand engulfing her small frame whole. Soft, was the only word I could think. "I will stay, if you'd have me." 

And she smiled to me.
