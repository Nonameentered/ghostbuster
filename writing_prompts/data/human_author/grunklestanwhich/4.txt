It started with a room, built onto my house overnight. A bathroom, I'd thought it was meant to be. It lacked a toilet and the shower wasn't anywhere near functional, but it looked to be a bathroom nonetheless. 

When I left to work that day I had just chalked it up as some strange prank; what person pulls a prank in the form of home additions I did not know, but it seemed silly to report such a thing. When I returned, however, well that's when the rest began. My home was no longer a home. It was an amalgamation of rooms and walls. Of roofs with no rooms below and gutters that drained to nowhere. 

Inside was even worse: staircases with no story above, doors opening straight into walls, and windows looking onto nothing. My mind reeled at the sight, brain trying desperately to comprehend what was before me. But it had become too late. I realized the moment I entered my house was not when I had made my mistake, instead, the moment I failed to report the initial oddity, that I ignored my instincts, I had doomed myself. 

As I turned to leave the door was missing, a new room in its place. A bathroom. In the next week I only survived off of luck alone. Sometimes I would stumble upon a morsel of food that had found its way separated from my cupboard. A stray packet of oatmeal on an end table I didn't remember purchasing or a rotten banana on a staircase. 

But something kept tugging at me. A sound, a skittering I'd call it, within the walls. I couldn't sleep. Couldn't stop myself from tearing the wallpaper back or punching holes in the drywall to find the source of the crawling, but each time I'd wind up with nothing. Then, the next day, my destruction would be repaired as if nothing had ever happened. Finally a month into my journey, into my madness, I reached a chamber that I assumed was at the center of it all. A massive dome of wood, chittering bugs crawling around at the center and hundreds of dirt nests lining the ground. Termites. Hundreds of thousands of little crawling termites. 

Looking upon this scene I finally realized their purpose: my home was a nest of its own. The new rooms were food for the new hatchlings, and they would continue to spread until their nest encompassed the neighborhood. With the last bit if life that remained within me I ripped a piece of wood from the wall and lit it. 

The fire spread quickly.
