Isenbar took a angry look at his demonic clipboard (a normal clipboard with spooky little horns) then back up to the hordes of bodies piling up at hells gates. None of the bodies names of which were listed on his horned clipboard. In fact, most of the humans in the past few decades had not been registered, a fact which at first Isenbar found easy to blame on the Head of Human Relations, Alan. But now, as he looked to this horde of human limbs squished up against the iron bars of hells gate he could no longer deny the facts: hell was overflowing, and the humans were to blame. 

"Alan! Alaaan! Get over here we have a problem!" Isenbar yelled out to hells eternal night sky. 

Before him a tall, lanky figure descended down from the sky in a beam of red light, vaguely human-like but in such a way that only another demon would describe him as such. Alan. 

As he touched the ground he replied,  "I agree as to your assessment, we do have a problem it seems." Alan leaned over on the hilt side of a sharp piece of metal in his hands, letting the tip bury into the brimstone ground. 

"Good. I mean, im counting two-hundred and four Dallas Winstons in the crowd, none registered to be here. And look!" Isenbar, the smaller of the two, angled his clipboard up for Alan to see. On the slab was two-hundred and four of the exact same man pictured, all accompanied by the same name. 

"Those? Ah thems just husks. No soul in em to speak of" Alan cemented his point by giving one a poke with the sharp end of his "Human Relations Stick". The body writhed in that same brain dead fashion that it had been for nearly a decade, unbothered by the stab. 

"Well how do ya know for sure? Humans are weird things." Isenbar spoke with distaste. 

"Isenbar. I know because it's my job to know. Just like it's your job not to. Send em back I say. Not our monkeys, not our circus." 

"The fuck is a monkey?... Nevermind, so where are the husks coming from?" 

"Humans, as always. Built these damn *teleporters*. Kinda like ours but they couldn't figure the things out, so they built long-range cloning machines instead. These are clones." 

Their conversation was interrupted as a hole in the sky opened and another heap of bodied poured out down into the crowd. On Isenbar's clipboard a new list of "unregistereds" popped up. 

"You know what? You're right Alan. This has gone on long enough. Im pulling the lever!" 

There was a series of levers by Isenbars post, most doing nothing except making his job look more important, but one in particular was for the reverse function of hell. Seldom used. As he yanked the lever back a massive swirling vortex opened quietly in the sky, cutting through the black with a red spiral. Bodies all over began rising from the floor and back up en masse in silence. Isenbar looked pleased. 

On the other hand, earth did not. Bodies began pouring out of the cloning machines piling up against their metal frames. Some poor souls caught glimpses of their clones and became horrified at the confusing reality before them. Others saw copies of their dead relatives broadcast on the news. Chaos ensued. 

Without knowing what to do many people tried their damndest to teleport the bodies back, but well...cloning a clone is never a good idea. So the next best thing was to rid themselves of the problem, to stop using teleportation altogether. Even when Tele-tech announced their "improved model" they remained unused. 

But the next best thing seemed to work wonders: transport tubes. Humans and their innovation.
