My office wasn't particularly busy today. A handful of dreadful faces had sauntered in and out, mostly all too forgettable to name any certain features of. The last guy may have been tall? The one before possibly pretty? I think she had hair. It was more likely than not. 

The usual glare through the window was there too, shining in my eyes as it did every day at 2 o'clock. When I had first scored the 15th floor it was bragging rights for the month to every other CPA who would listen, but now, with just me and the glare a part of me wished I'd still had my office on the 5th. "A room with a view", I'd said. Yeah, of the fucking sun. 

Through the wall I could hear Jessey at the counter talking to a customer I assumed."Well did you have an appointment?"

"I uhhh well no. But I needed to talk to Mr. Carter. We go way back." 

Another customer trying to pull the classic "I know him, let me in bit"  3:45pm the glass clock up on the wall announced silently. If I could just hold on 15 more minutes I could make it out. Slip out the back without another appointment.

 I tried to continue my snooping, but the voices had gone silent. Instead I heard loud, metallic stomps heading my way.  They circled through the halls, echoing off the metal of the empty corridors. Each step threatened another hour in this place. Another bit of more time I would never get back. So, I did the only thing I could and dove down behind my desk. An act of cowardice by some, a stroke of accounting genius by others. 

The steps came to a mighty crescendo at my door before pushing it opened with slow uncertainty. I listened as a few more metallic clanks pushed closer, then halted. 

"Mr.Carter, or should I say Darell? Pathetic. Trembling behind a desk. But I cant say I blame you, I'd be scared to fight me too." a voice boomed out from the other side of the desk, so loud it shook the glass of my office windows. 

"Excuse me?" I rose to meet the assailant of my time. Instead, what I was met by took me a few moments to comprehend. He was something out of a movie; wearing a hodgepodge of medieval armor pieces and modern military gear, neither of which appeared to have seen much use. Over his eyes was one of those headpieces with the four lenses. 

"Ok what the fuck is that" is all I managed to blurt out. 

“I have hunted for you for years! I have trailed you across oceans and continents! Today you shall finally fall to your archenemy!” his voice once again tore through the office, carried by a speaker at his neck. I stared back in confusion 

"I uhhh...im an accountant?" 

"Yes! You are! And- wait. Do you not know who I am?" 

"No no. Its not that its just that I might need a reminder. High schoooo-? Do you go to my gym maybe? Im kidding. Now why the fuck are you in my office dressed like a rejected marvel villain?!" The mans eyed visor raised to reveal his eyes whuch blinked back in disbelief. His posture went from a confident stiffness to a slouch. 

"Well this is a bummer. I've been following you for like 3 years dude. It's me Tim....Tim Bensely?? You misfiled my taxes like 4 years ago. The IRS was on my ass since." I still had no idea, but what I did know was the kind of gun on his hip, as I had the same under my desk. 

"Ok so why didnt you come back? I could've fixed it in like 5 minutes." 

"Huh. I hadn't really considered-" Before he could finish the gun was in my hand, and with two shots I shot clean through the sprinkler head on the ceiling. My ears immediately felt the repercussions. It wasn't like the movies where guns made no sound, instead now my ears rung so hard I could barely make out the sounds of the fire alarm blaring through the building. A spray of blackened water flew out of the sprinklers from above and sent "Tim" down to the ground. 

I, on the other hand, had slid over my desk and was halfway to the door. To freedom. I'd be damned if some guy was going to force me into overtime. Through the glass doors, down the hallway that now crowded with faces all gunning for the elevator, behind me a voice cried out: "I'll get you Darell! I waited three years, I can wait a little more!"

To my right a colleague I vaguely recognized looked to me "Ah, fuck up someones taxes too?"
