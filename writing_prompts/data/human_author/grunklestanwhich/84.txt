The crowd watched on, enthralled by every moment of Burn Johnson's speech. They hung on every word, every hand motion, every action their newly elected Congressman made. All of the poor bastards not knowing what came next. He was a witch. A creature of the supernatural. And even more he was advocating for more of his kind: *Warewolves in the Senate*, *Vampires on the Supreme Court*, *A Changeling as President?!*. Blaspheme, it all was. 

There was only one action to be taken. I had seen the Wizard of Oz enough times to know the weakness of a witch, I was just the only one who would be strong enough to do it. 

There he stood, surrounded by his flying monkeys. There he stood, up on his stage that would soon evolve into the world's stage. There he stood, a tyrant who could not care less about humanity. And how could he? He didn't know what being human even looked like. 

"I believe in equality. In cooperation, in unity between both humanity and Super humanity! With us working together nothing is beyond our grasp!" Burn Johnson continued to dribble his slime. All of it lies so he may implement his...his...uhm...witchy plans? 

From my back pocket I drew my secret weapon: an oversized bottle of water, and prepared to act. As I approached the stage I noticed that security seemed tighter than I'd have guessed. Must have been upped due to the whole witch thing. The speech continued before me: "We will act as one nation! And as a free nation show that we are unified!...Oh and can someone get that guy who's coming to attack me?" 

I had been only half listening during my approach, but those words sent ice through my blood. My steady stride through the crowd halted as my face was now projected across the many screens in the building. "I'm a witch you know...prophecy is sort of our thing. Anyways, bring him up here!" 

The chants from the crowd switched from *Burn the witch* to *Burn that guy*. A group of beefy security guards carried me up to the front to my struggling that seemed more of a child trying to fight their dad than an assassin in captivity. Every face that I passed boo'd me or yelled in favor of Burn Johnson. They did not know what they had done. 

As I reached the stage security left my sides. At some point in the charade someone had taken my weapon, my only means to end this all, and now more than ever I wish I still had its comfort. 

Burns looked me in the eyes. His pale, green eyes staring clean through mine. He was taller than I'd thought. Cleaner too, for a witch anyways. Almost normal. His voice shriveled down to fit the area in which I stood. "If you wanted to kill me you do realize you would have to kill the rest of Congress too, right?" 

"I'm not sure I follow." his words hurt, and I didn't know if it was natural or his witchy powers in play. 

"Oh well of course you do. Every member of Congress is a witch. As a matter of fact, only a handful in history haven't been. For whatever reason we keep getting elected, I just was the first who wanted to be honest with the American people." his tone stayed constant, neutral. I tried to see the evil in it all but failed. 

"I...I voted for witches?" 

"Well yeah. And a handful of other Supers too, I'd guess. So whats the play here?" The cameras stayed zoomed on me. I had no idea what to say, if there was anything to say at all. But I knew there was only one way out of here. 

"Burn the Witch!" I screamed, and after a pause the crowd roared in echoed response. *Burn the witch! Burn the witch!*

Burn Johnson smiled, "Smart man. I hope in the future I have your support." 

And just like that a witch was my Congressman.
