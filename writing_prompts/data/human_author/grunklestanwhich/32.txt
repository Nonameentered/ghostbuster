I awoke surrounded by faces I did not know. No longer laying in a bed, but upright at a table alone. Immediately my nose was filled with the overwhelming scents of barely and wood, typically a welcomed bunch, but at it filling my nostrils I almost fell back in my chair. I was in a bar, I thought. Cozy yet familiar, the faces that surrounded me were the same. 

Every table, every barstool was filled with another face I thought I recognized but couldnt quite place a name to. Though I stared they seemed to not even know of my sudden existence, most of them talking amongst themselves and laughing with pints in their hands. 

I stood up a bit wobbly and wandered to the bar where another familiar face waited to serve me. My heart dropped in my chest and my brow grew hot with anger.

"Da- dad?!" I tried hard in my head to process his image, an image I had last seen 26 years ago, on my 16th birthday. He looked no different from the day he left me. 

He looked up to me from behind the bar with tears welling in his eyes. Suddenly I realized that the entire bar was watching on. 

"What is this?! Where have you been! Here, in this fucking bar?" 

The tears rolled down his cheeks and onto the bar top. He tried to wipe his eyes but only more tears fell. The rest of the bar watched on in silence and I too grew silent. This was not normal. None of this was normal. Behind me I glared from person to person, the ones I recognized I had only seen in photos. The man with the mustache, Grandpa Elric, dad had hated. Said he never stuck around past his 16th, same as me. Told me he'd never do the same. 

And the man at the bar, crying the same, was Great Grandpa Darren. All of my ancestors. Sitting in one single room together. 

My dad looked up to me. "Son...I never wanted to leave you. You have to believe me. You were the most important thing in my life, but when I came here. When I was given that choice I couldn't say no." 

I felt a hand on my back and when I turned Grandpa Elric was holding me. The rest of the room stood and walked over to join us. 

"Choice? What choice?" I could feel my anger subsiding into confusion. 

This time Elric spoke. "To stay. Stay and spend eternity here with your boy. And his boy, and so on. Forever" 

"So what do you say son? Grab a seat, tell me...us about your boy" my dad spoke with hope in his voice. My reply did not take much thought. 

"Maybe he'll know you one day. But he will not wait a lifetime to know me. It was good to see you dad. I just wish we had more time. I guess this is it then" 

I could see his face drop along with the others. Something told me they weren't so often denied. He brought me in close . 

"I'll miss you boy. Just know I did this for you. I wish you'd stay" 

"I wish you had too" 

And like that I was back once again. Back in my bed, my house, with my son. I went to his room and looked in, still asleep where I'd left him. I couldn't imagine leaving, even if it meant I'd see him again one day.
