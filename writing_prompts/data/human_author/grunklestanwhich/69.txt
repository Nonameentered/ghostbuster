Bells chimed outside waking me from my sleep. It was early, earlier than I was ever used to waking; evidence given by the deep grogginess I now felt. Outside I could hear footsteps, one pair first, then two, three, more and more passing by until they all blended into one noise. Hearing them pass by I let my eyes peek open to see what was occuring, but instead of being met by expected sunlight I instead saw the moon up high through my window. Outside a parade of long haired, two-legged beasts wandered by. Their limbs stretched unnaturally long, eyes deep yellows that practically glowed in the night. 

As one passed by its gaze caught mine. With wolf like legs it lumbered over and looked in through the window with a gaping maw. 

"Are you coming? We're meeting now" the beast spoke in vaguely human noises.

"I uhhh...sure let me get dressed....you all don't plan to like, eat me right?" 

The beast, or Kiel as she had told me to call her, stared at me with a unamused look. Or at least as unamused as a werewolf can seem. "Well we weren't, but now? I'll think about it.", she spoke before wandering off towards the treeline. 

I took a second to think about it before darting up from my bed into a room I'd hardly had the time to recognize. It had only been a few days since they'd taken me in, and the ins and outs of their culture were still often lost on me. But here it wasn't so boring. Wasn't so normal. Their tribe was something new and interesting to me and they had taken a real interest in me too. I cant say the idea didnt cross my mind that they would at any moment gobble me whole, a negative stereotype I'd been told, though stereotypes always have a basis somewhere. 

As I moved through the dark my foot connected sharply with the dresser corner. "Ah fuck me!", I yelled out into the dark. Outside more bodies passed by. I hadn't realized there to be so many in the tribe. 

In my best walk-hobble I dressed myself for the outside and grabbed a few useful essentials that I counted off in my head:, *flashlight*, *book of matches*, *revolver*. The last item I held in my hands a moment as if to memorize the wooden grip, the feel of the hammer, the way the chamber spun smoothly, then loaded in a round and darted out the door. 

Outside most of the beast people had gone into the dense thickett. Behind my room, my small yet comfy hobble, was a sea of other, similiar structures. Small cozy homes of wood and dark clay that barely stood out of the surrounding landscape. I stared to them for a moment, lit by warm lights and beautiful against the scenery, then left to the woods. 

They weren't hard to find thankfully. They had lit the way with a series of torches and lamplights. Some symbols were carved out into the sides of trees that I recognized. A circle, two figures placed within its frame. The symbol of their tribe I'd been told. 

Through the treeline tons of fur covered bodies sat in a circle around a series of fires. Most of them chatted within their groups, a few wandered around, dressed in traditional garb of leathers and hanging ropes trailing to the ground. The full moon shined bright overhead. 

At my arrival the chief stood tall and announced: "Welcome! A new member joins our tribe tonight! Welcome him!" 

Howls erupted into the night in a castrophany that traveled up into the night. As I tried to take a seat a few garbed wolves of massive size led me instead to the middle of the ring. 

"We welcome our guest, but one does not. Without full agreeance we cannot move forward. Kiel! Do you vouch for this man?" 

The werewolf I recognized stepped forward, she called out in response: "Yes! He had saved my life, and I vouch for his inclusion to our people!" 

"Hey uh...whats going on...", I mumbled to myself, gripping my pistol tight. 

"Then with only one disagreement they may step forward, and Kiel, yours can prove himself worthy." the crowd grew quiet now. Only one beast stepped forward, tall and proud, a snarl etched into his face. He wore scars across his chest with pride, telling me I wasn't the only one to have tried to join. Without warning he darted forward with speeds hard to track by eye, I kept my grip on the pistol tight. 

He dashed side to side, growing closer. My heart raced. I could feel his movements in the ground, in my bones. Every leap brought that gaping maw closer to my throat. Just as I could see his pupils, the deepness of his yellowed broken eyes, I drew. Drew my revolver fast and true, holding it up and straight with a steady hand. His paws slid in attempt to slow his charge, sending him to a halt just as his head reached the barrel. His chest heaved up and down and his eyes looked up to me in anger. 

"Go on then" his gravely voice mumbled. 

I let the trigger go, pulled it to a *click*, then moved the barrel to the sky and pulled again to a loud *bang!* that sent the watchers ducking. 

"I think that means I won. Does it not?" this time when I spoke it was a mumble still, but heard by all. My opponent snarled, to which I placed the barrel back at his head. That bullet was meant for me. Just in case. But now, now if anything went wrong I'd be maimed rather than granted a quick death. 

The chief stepped forward once more, tall and with wisdom in the wrinkles around his sharp eyes. 

"I'm proud to say, welcome to our home! I was always rooting for you." 

The wolves howled once more at the moon that had now begun to set. My chest heaved a breathe forth. Well, I guess I wouldn't need the gun anymore.
