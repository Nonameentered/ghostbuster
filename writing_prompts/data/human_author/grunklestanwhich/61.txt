Harvey looked back and forth, from in the room to out, in, out, in....out once more. He placed a finger to his chin where a few stray bown hairs had begun sprouting out. After an unnecessarily long *hmmmmmm* he finally spoke: "Look man I think it's just the one gate." 

I stared back at him with a sense of confusion, or maybe I was just reassessing his levels of stupidity to a new high. There were clearly two gates, one in the hallway and one in the room opposite. "Dude there's two. Just because you can only see one at a time doesn't change that." I replied trying not to sound too sarcastic. 

"The gates are weird man. Maybe they're moving back and forth real fast." Harvey glanced between the room and hallway again, this time faster. I thought I felt a brain aneurysm coming on. 

"Ok even if so, Professor Jay said to call him if the gates do anything funny, especially multiply. So, lets call him." 

"Wait wait. Ok you look at that one ill look at this one. Don't move! Then we can call em' if there's two". I didn't want to agree, but Harvey had already retracted into the room and begun yelling out "Still here...still here." 

I stared to my gate in the hallway. The swirling portal of reddened energy held within a rectangular frame, same as it always looked, well, cept I had never seen it in the hallway before. Usually it was in Harvey's room on that pedestal with that little sticky note reading "Do not enter" written at the top.  I had been sure to always follow that rule to the T, especially after the freshman year incident. *It was the kids fault. Shoulda followed the syllabus* is what the school board had ruled. But a few days after that sticky note appeared in Professor Jay's sharp handwriting. 

"Gone!" Harvey yelled in a unsure tone to me. My heart sank a little. I could feel heat rising off my chest filling my shirt as sweat formed. 

"I uhhh...can you repeat that?" The fluorescent lights in the hall flickered. I turned to see my gateway gone. Entirely. In its place was a missing gateway shaped pile of dust. Then a long, almost infinitely long line of replica gates spawned and lined the hallway. I went to jump back only to realize a gate now sat right behind my neck, whirling with a loud *mmmmmmmmm*. I could feel its heat on my back. Then the heat dissipate as they all disappeared at once. 

"Nevermind its back." there was a long pause that followed before his next words, "And, well, you'll want to come in here." 

Sometimes its hard to describe something you're seeing for the first time. Sometimes it takes a moment, a long moment for your brain and eyes to work together long enough to get a reading of what is happening before you. This was as much one of those moments as I'd ever experienced. Before Harvey, and around him, and everywhere were new gates all popping up for mere moments before disappearing once again. Harvey stood in the middle of them deathly still as a highway of portals barely missed him as they spawned. 

"Whats Professor Jay's number again?" he whimpered.
