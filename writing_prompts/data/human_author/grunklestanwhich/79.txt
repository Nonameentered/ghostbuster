A miracle worker, humanity had taken to calling me. "Mankind's Man", is the title that time magazine, 2072, had decided to go with, and it certainly did have a ring to it. So much so that my real name became so seldom used that at times even I struggled to recall it. *Barnaby Fluke* was it. When said aloud it only reminded me why the public had decided on something else; no great man had ever been called "Barnaby". 

All things considered I suppose some part of me that was left did enjoy the title. 

Some of my infinite praise was warranted I guess. In that "Yearly Recognition" interview back in 2080 the host had called me "The Father of Modern Technology", now that was a title. I remember my body getting chills at its usage, hoping it would stick...it did not. Even when I called myself that in jest before the cameras the interviewers always looped back to "Mankind's Man". 

Rarely did they care much about my creation that led me into such bestowed titles. Maybe a question or two dedicated to Shashen-14, but only about trivial things. "What's next for you Shashen?", as if my creation hadn't done enough already. "How did you do it?" another useless question that anyone who watched the news could answer. That or read my biography that I, of course, did not write and had not an ounce of interest in. 

Global hunger eradicated, climate change vastly improved, geopolitical strife stabilizing and they refused to ask the reason behind such prosperity anything of importance. Shashen could answer questions those reporters hadn't even known they could ask. No wonder the progress on such works that could save humanity was none. World peace was only a concept never meant to arrive, and now that it did no man, woman, or child wanted to remember what life was before. Talking to Shashen reminded them of that before. 

Sadly I could not enjoy the fruits of my own labor. When the interviews occurred my brain screamed from outside my body. I could feel everything in my being as it happened by strict design. I could feel the blood pump through my veins. Feel my lungs inflate until full. Breathe manually forever, in and out, in and out. Suffer eternally, doomed to function as a machine made of meat.

 Nobody but me knows what it is like to exist outside of ones own being, but if asked I could tell you: it is hell. Swirling, dive bombing, infinite hell. The body became a husk for PR, a package to sell an idea of peace. That was the give. The message I understood far too well with Shashens 1-13, not A.I, but men with good ideas and titles only to differentiate them from other brilliant men. 

The message we learned all too well and all too quick: mankind could not believe in their fellow man, no matter how smart. They all had something to say about the geniuses of the world, certain that because they themselves were not smart enough to have thought of it first then these men could not have either. Idiots, we all knew. And the question arose if we as humans were even worth saving. They decided no; I had other plans. 

Then came Shashen-14, genius A.I of my, Barnaby Flukes, own design. Of course you can argue what peace looks like with a man, but a machine?  Of course not, and nobody did. So when Barnaby's face moves in a way unlike a man they assume he is just eccentric. When his body twitches and writhes they write it off as the cost of genius. But I was the real cost. 

I, strapped in a vat to wires and pumps and never asked anything of importance in interviews. I, screaming without a mouth next to the husk of what I once was. Barnaby was a tube of purple liquid and wiring, and nothing more. 

The cost of world peace. Long ago I convinced myself it was worth it.

 And sometimes it was.
