*How did it come to this?*, the thought rang through my head as the crown came down. *What led to this?* more thoughts, nearly drowned out by the roar of the crowd. The man in front of me looked as if he'd keel over at any moment. I recognized him I thought, a great uncle... Gregor maybe?. On my moms side. One of the many faces splattering a vague painting in my head of the countless great feasts I'd attended. None in my honor of course; In fact, I'd taken great pride in my ability to avoid any gaze at such events. 

Despite my efforts now all eyes were on me. I could not avoid the crowds burning stares. Sometimes my nerves quelled long enough to make out a few shapes. A cousin, a nephew, a distant aunt, all so far unrelated to the king before me that it was surely a question in every one of their heads as to how I arrived in this position. Yet here I was. 

The crown lowered onto my head and I rose from my bow. If the crowd was loud before now it was deafening. The old man before, the one who's name I now decided to be Gregor, spoke with a rasp. "Not the first, but the only. May he rein true and prosper" 

Rumors flooded back to me. Words I'd picked up during those long feasts of important men. "Tyrant, deserter, regicide,  bloodline", the same words now mouthed from scattered lips of the crowd below me. I would be next, not because I was worthy, but because I was all they had left. Not the youngest, but not the toddler Adalale either. Not the wisest, yet still wise enough to not have been taken yet by age. I would not be king because I was worthy, I would because I was all they had. 

The crowd cheered. Not for me, but for the existence of someone who seemed just competent enough. And I did not mind. For I would show them all that I was much more.
