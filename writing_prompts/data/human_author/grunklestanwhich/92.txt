"Corvus? Corvus you big hunk of bird! What have you gotten into " across the room a bird-like man coughed up a bit of a feather and laid a metallic button on the floor from within his beak before replying. 

"**Scraw!** I mean...I was working. I have two in my sights. Watch." Below the crow like man and the Cherub God of Love emanated a circular ring of sight into another world. Within the swirling frame was the image of people walking down the crowded city street, then closer it zoomed into a building window, into an apartment. Finally the frame focused on a man with his back turned, doing dishes. 

"Are you watching? It's important you watch- **Scraw!**" 

The cherub faced god rubbed his temples with a tiny hand, "Yes. I am watching Corvus." At the go Corvus reached his hand up through a cloud into the sky and snapped. With this command a raven drifted down into his feathery palm and nestled itself in position. Then, with a mighty pull back, Corvus launched the bird down through the circular frame of the portal. It flew down with an ever fading **Sqwaaa-aaak** before gliding into the apartment window and beak-diving into a trashcan. 

Corvus watched on with an expectant grin on his face as the bird essentially exploded into a cloud of feathers. 

"What the hell?!" the man previously washing dishes jumped around at the sound of a bird flying into his trashcan going 60 miles an hour. "Was that?...was that a bird?" He walked over and peered in the trash as both Cupid and Corvus watched on from far above. With a hesitant hand he began reaching into the can. **Sqwaa!**, the bird yelled. **Ah!**, the man replied. 

"What is that noise?" From a back hallway a girl emerged to see the commotion, her brown hair half curled and shirt on backwards. 

"I think a big ass bird is in here.." **Sqwaa!**, the big ass bird agreed. By now Cupid was staring in horror at the mess that his brother had made down within the mortal realm. Corvus meanwhile stared on with a continued grin. 

"Oh...well lets take it out then I guess! In the trashcan of course." At this the mans eyes perked up, not at her suggestion, but at the prospect of having company. So they walked and talked, talked of life, of what they had become, and of the bird in the trash which frequently sqwauked to keep its end if the conversation up. With every movement they made Corvus's happiness only grew. He excitedly ruffled his feathered arms and shook his beak, and on the other side of the frame Cupid began to see the point of it all.

 He remembered both of the humans well as just last year they were within his jurisdiction. He shot the arrow that grew them together. Then watched on as its power crumbled until there was nothing left.  But now something new sprouted like the buds of spring. Not love, at least not the kind Cupid dealt in, but relationship nonetheless. 

Both Corvus and Cupid watched on as the humans below released the bird as it flew off back into the sky. 

"So, friends?" The girl brushed a curl from her face. 

"Friends" he replied with a smile.
