It had been a gruelling month. A month of constant torture in the form of a man talking in my ear, the same tired request in that medieval peasant voice. Just begging me over and over, "Please sir my family's homestead...if you dont help me pluck my cabbages then we'll lose the crop." Over and over I told him the same. 

"This is not your world! There is no crop!, no cabbages!" and he'd always reply: "Well there surely won't be without your aid, come quick!" and then leave. 

In the beginning I wouldn't see him for around a day or two upon denying his request. I never knew where he ran to, but I was always thankful for the moment of peace and quiet. But he always showed back up. Back with that same request."Please sir my family's homestead...if you dont help me pluck my cabbages then we'll lose the crop."

Throughout the month his leave times grew. Sometimes I wouldn't see him for a day, then for a month, then two. The longer, the better, for it meant that in the mean time I could have some semblence of my life back. When he was around I could do nothing. Couldn't shop, couldn't see my friends, my family, how was I supposed to explain the 16th century farm hand following me around when I didn't even know what he was? I figured early on it was easier to just not. To instead bolt myself in my home when he came and be driven to madness by his words. 

But one day he left for the longest he ever had, for three whole months of silence. I remember almost not recognizing him when he returned, his outfit once a pristine look of a medieval peasant he now looked like any homeless man on the street. His clothes were worn and stained. And this time his words were direct: "Come with me. I need you." 

And for the first time ever I obliged. I don't know why exactly. Maybe out of pity or some kind of obligation, I mean in the other world I did tell him I would help though I never really planned to. Maybe it was just curiosity as to where he went for those months, but either way I followed. He took me far away, never stopping unless I did. He didn't seem to need to. Just ran on and on. He had this look in his face that I had not seen before. A harder brow, sharper eyes, determination in his stride. 

Finally after days of almost non-stop travel and near sleepless nights we had arrived to an endless field. A blackened sea of burnt ground that had once been something, I thought. It stretched on past the horizon with that blackened, burnt grass and a lingering scent of fire. 

 Somewhere as we walked along the field the air started to warble, like a mirror in a funhouse. I recognized the look, the feel, but I could not focus as my companion only trekked on and I struggled to keep up. But then I saw it in the distance. A ruined clump of smoldering nothing with a stone sign posted outside.  As we approached I could see it read: *Laymans Homestead, All are welcome*. The memories quickly came flooding back. Of a green field and a family. Of a farm of cabbages so vast it seemed a biome of its own.  And of a world outside of mine. Even then, with the owner of the farm pestering me daily I thought maybe I was still in that medieval dream, only seeing this ruin did the reality  become undeniable. I really *had* been in that other world, and Layman really did need my help upon following me back, or at least he had at some point. 

"Why....why are we here? What is this?" I spoke, trying to hide the fear in my voice. "Who burned this all? Who would do this?!" 
 
He turned and looked to me with a face full of dread, then gestured to the field of black. I understood, the farm, his crop, his family: all gone. 

This time his voice came through the air dead. "Please sir my family's homestead...if you dont help me pluck my cabbages then we'll lose the crop. They will be sure of it. They own us." 

Above his head words appeared: *Quest Failed*.
