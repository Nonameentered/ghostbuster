The day had been exceptionally quiet, not a single customer through the shops glass doors. Posted on them a large square, peeling at the edges, read: MARLEY REASUN: PSYCHIC INFLUENCER *Help me Help you*. It was a catch phrase that I hadn't been too fond of, but it got more customers than my last one, *Allow me inside*. In hindsight not my greatest use of wordplay. 

I heard footsteps approaching the office door, hesitant and uneven. They stopped at the square on the door and a man gave it a long look, brow wrinkled with worry. He looked to be in his mid thirties, hair blackened and pulled back neatly. After another pause at gripping the handle he pushed his way in. 

There wasn't much to look at in the office, I was really the only thing people came for anyways. So besides a few sideways glances to the cheap crystal balls and occult merchandise that lined the few shelves inside the man made his way straight to me. 

"Hello, can I help you?" I spoke first to break any tension. Most people were entirely unfamiliar with the idea of "mind control" and often didn't know what to say. Luckily I did. 

"I need to mow the lawn and don't wanna so....do your thing." he rubbed his wrists in discomfort. 

"My thing? Hire someone to mow it. Cheaper I bet. Anything else?" 

He seemed lost for words at my decline, but I was a business. Not a multi-million dollar chain that bibbity bobbity booed at any cash that came in the door. Respect was part of the transaction. 

"Fine. Then uh...my taxes. I want to do my taxes but cant being myself to. So hook me up." 

"Firstly, it's April. Secondly, same note as before. There's an accountant a few offices down, names Tom Rackard. Good guy." 

Finally, seeming fed up with my declines the man withdrew a needle from his coat and slammed it to the counter. There was a long silence between us. I knew not what to say and it it seemed neither did he, so we just sat in silence over the needle

"I...what is that?" a stupid question to ask, but the only words I could muster. 

"A needle. So, can you do it or not. My friend said-" 

"Be quiet please. And sit still." I spoke calmly. Casually. 

At my words the man grew stiff. His body perked up and his muscles tensed in his neck, his eyes faded from lively to dull and droopy. The man from before was no longer here, just a husk stood in his place. I had never been under my own control, but I had been told it was like watching a dream. As if your body was someone elses. 

I just needed a moment. A moment to think to myself, and those like him, desperate like him, didn't often give me any time to consider. Of course I remembered his friend, but his friend was trying to quit smoking, no harm in that. But this? This would be agony. Misery of going through withdrawal inside while the body marches on unbothered. I wished now I'd granted his request of making him mow the lawn instead. 

"You may be yourself again." at my command he let out a sharp, long held breath. I then realized I had forgotten to tell him he could breathe while under, oops. 

"So- so it works! Do it. Now before I change my mind." 

"This will be agony you understand. Pain and misery for...a week at least. And if you dont make it..." 

"I dont care. Just do it Mr. Reasun. If I die then I die. At least I tried then." 

I cared to be convinced no more. I held out a hand for him to shake. I thought I saw the slight of a grin as he took it. 

"Fine. You will be under the embrace of your addiction no longer....and you will forget my name. I do not exist." There was a spark at my words leaving and entering his head. His gaze softened. Then he looked up to me with a bit of confusion. 

"I was- I was just-" 

"Leaving? Yes you were Mr. Reddle. You have a good one." and I watched as he walked back out the glass doors, hoping he wouldn't show back up again as he had in the past. Hoping that this would be the last, for better or worse, that I saw of Reddle.
