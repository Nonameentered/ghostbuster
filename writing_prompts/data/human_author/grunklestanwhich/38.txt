As the tall, robed man strolled through the hall with increasing urgency his much smaller assistant struggled to keep up. They walked from door to door, opening them, uttering a phrase, and closing them once more. Some voices behind the doors screamed. Some groaned.  A few screeched with a sound somewhere between joy and fear. But they all heard the same words: "Kings dead, heir will be picked soon." 

The assistant looked up to the robed man as they jogged, a man who just an hour ago had been called the King's hand, but now had no real title. Though he hadn't the time to think about that. 

"Uh...sir. Who do you think will be next in line for the throne?" the assistant spoke with hesitancy. 

"Blast it! Hell if I know. I was hoping Charlotte, smart girl, but it seems at the news of her fathers passing she's turned into some sort of dunce! We'll try Harold." 

The two opened a few more doors and yelled inside to mixed reactions. Then the hand stopped in the hall, posted himself in place, and yelled out. "Awh fuck it...Kings dead! Heir will be picked soon! No rioting!", before starting a brisk walk up the closest set of stairs. 

"You know I don't get paid enough for this Thomas. No, not nearly enough!" the Hand spoke between labored breaths. 

"Ah, point of note. Who is paying us now?"

"I don't wish to think of that now. Let's just get the boy." 

As they reached Harolds room the Hand hesitated at the wood door. The boy had never much cared for him. Never much seemed to care for anyone really, but was brilliant nonetheless. A tactile brain wrapped up in a pretty face, a near perfect choice for king. The Hand gave a brief knock before pushing himself in. On the other side Thomas was the first to see it, letting out a soft gasp at the scene before them. 

Harold kneeled over, shirtless, hunched over a map on the floor with a wild look in his eyes. Beads of sweat pooled at his forehead and dripped down his bare chest. Bits of blackened ash lined his forehead. Upon them walking in he did not look up, just spoke into the open air of the room. "When I am king Lindest will be it! We will take it fast and hard. They will never see it coming!" 

"Uh.. Lindest, my lord ? That is the capital of the free world. Of course I am no brilliant mind but...how does that benefit us?" the Hand approached the kings son with an arm outstretched. He cautiously closed the gap between them nearing the map, then his eyes grew wide. On the map were tens, hundreds of citys with large black x's drawn through them. Listed by each one was a count: *50,000 dead*, *5,000 dead*, and so on. Harold looked up to him. 

"Is there something you wish to say Godfrey?"

The Hand looked to his assistant who had backed himself up to the door and was now gesturing desperately for them to leave. "Uh- no. No lord. I was just going to see your brother Charles. Your father had said something about him being next in line I believe..." 

Harold seemed content at the answer and went back to his map, drawing a large blackened x across another town. The two walked out hunched in seeming defeat. 

"So, Charles?" Thomas spoke before noticing Godfrey seated near a hall window staring out in silence. He sat to join him and tried to match his gaze, which didn't take long. Down below, muscular and rippling with strength, Charles was bathing nude in the fishpond. Near the castle entrance a couple of young women and nurses gathered to stare, but Godfrey stared for another reason. 

"We're doomed, you know that Thomas? These were meant to be the fixers of the kingdom." Godfrey gestured out the window. 

"People were waiting, expectantly might I add, for King Alexander to die. And now that he did nobody will take his place. I do not blame them I suppose. He left quite the mess behind." 

There was a long silence between the two. Godfrey was right. For the moment they were ruined. Someone new from far away would probably step up instead. Some unknown factor with only a drop of Alexanders blood and a heart of pure greed. 

Thomas broke the lingering silence. "Well...what about you sir? I'm sure some would look to you as the next best thing. You are the Hand and all, and you did a great job as counsel for the last eight years. People seem to trust you-" He looked up to Godfrey who had begun undressing as he walked down the hall. 

"Sir? Where are you- where are you going?" 

"Hm? Oh I think I'll go join Charles in the fishpond."
