The field was cold, the ground hard and covered in a layer of tightly packed snow. Many wars had been lost to conditions such as this, or at least so I'd been told. For mortals I could believe it, especially having once been one myself. But now, how long I'd been what I am, everything was cold. Always. So the cold didn't make much of a difference. 

I often wondered if my opponents felt the same. They didn't seem to fatigue, and if the cold bothered them in any way they did good not to show it. I cant imagine they would be, the fur and all. I watched across the field as one of the wolf beasts tore into somethings neck. It ripped a chunk clean, leaving the corpse to freeze over, then its eyes met mine. I did not fear it. I had fought this battle for fifty years, almost nothing could scare me anymore. Not the threat of winter, not the yellow eyed beasts that tore my brethren to ribbons, and not the war, everlasting that we fought. 

Some vampires, the ones in the east, were smart enough to avoid these battles. To live lives that didn't center around war. But us. Us feral creatures of the night too far gone to go back, we didn't know any better. Without war I had nothing. 

The great beast charged across the field on all fours. It ran with its fangs bared and eyes locked onto my neck. As it moved it seemed to glide, passing by other fights and even its own kind being slaughtered without so much as a glance. 

I braced my feet and my boots crunched into the snow beneath me. In this moment I was thankful for it. Warewolves are known to be notoriously ferocious fighters, with the snow I was at an advantage of grounding. 

He closed the distance, faster by the moment. Four powerful legs pulsing with strength. Just as the beast reached me though it was instead scooped out of the air by a massive hand. The wolf struggled for a moment against its captor, its legs floating off the ground. Then with a loud crunch and a breathed yelp it went limp, contorted into an unnatural U shape. 

I looked up to see it. To feel it. A massive, ungodly thing with the head of a deer and the body of a monster. Human, but only in the most basic definition. Strips of rotting discolored flesh hung off its body like ribbons. It looked to me with empty eye sockets and roared, a noise that brought the field to a literal halt. For the first time in a long time I felt fear. 

Some ran, some stayed and fought. It didnt matter. A war that had raged on for decades ended that day, but in its place something new: survival. Fear of the unknown. And knowledge that out there were beasts worse than anything we'd known.
