The day the funnel stopped, the minute the vat ran dry, both names for a catastrophe that all of the underworld hoped would never arrive. But the catastrophe didn't care what we hoped. 

It was the day that that road to hell stopped winding and the queue to get in backed up so long that the waiting room at the top overflowed. Now this wouldn't be such an issue if those poor damned souls had somewhere to go, but they didn't. Some bastard had failed to make a back up in their planning. One waiting room was it. 

"But it has essentially infinite space" I had heard some imp job shadow say in our last meeting. 

*Essentially* being the key word. So, not infinite. Finite, if you will. 

But the waiting room was the least of my concern. The real concern was the road in. They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and well, we ran out of pavement. At some point the good intentions in the world ran pretty much dry. If you ask me I blame the guy who had built the road in to be a 12-laner, but then again nobody was asking me. Well, until now. 

Now that it went unpaved plenty of souls were falling off into  the depths, therefore a shortage in hell and a knees-on-the-ground ass kissing fest to one of the best civil engineers in hell. 

So...I made a suggestion. An end all be all solution to our problems. One that would force humanities "good intentions". Hell on earth. Literally.  

At first well, let's just say the pitch didn't go well. We tried other pavement. Tried bad vibes, self-hatred, even overwhelming positivity, none of it was enough. Good intentions just ran too smooth, was just rare enough but not impossible to find. Self-hatred was all over, it paved like sand, gritty and uneven and only caused more damned to fall into the pit below. A dime a dozen and every hard-working human had it. 

Bad vibes? Poured too thick and stuck to everything it touched. Never cooled down either. Anyone that touched the stuff got glued to the ground, worse than purgatory they say. But those good intentions made sweet music to the road. So hell on earth it was. And what better use to make of those poor backed up souls? I figured the road *back* to where they had come from was already paved anyways. 

But oh boy once it started, it really started. Demons, lost souls, the damned, all fighting in sync to repave that road. And before long the numbers only grew. Every man woman and child that died birthed a new soldier. And every teary eyed face fought to their limit to save the ones they loved. Good intentions. Turns out humanity was full of em' just a little greedy when it came down to it. 

But I'm an engineer. So it was all just another problem to be fixed.
