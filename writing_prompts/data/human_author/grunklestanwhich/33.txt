I woke up in bed to an unnatural quiet. I had become so used to my alarm blaring in the mornings, to my cat, Oscar, meowing away at the door, and Clarry ready with my breakfast, but today I had no such norms. Just a quiet room and a stray beam of sunlight shining down onto my pillow. 

"Clarry? Clarence?" I called out into the quiet of the hallway opposite my bedroom door to no response. Clarence was never late unless he was programmed to be, and I had no trouble with his factory settings so I never had. Well, that and the instruction manual was so complicated that only the manufacturers had any chance at their so called "User Friendliness". 

I stood from the bed and felt the cold of the wood on my feet. The hall from my bedroom felt longer, wider than usual without the company of Oscar and Clarry. 

"Clarry? You alright buddy? Not make it back to your charging station?", once again my voice called out to nothing. The living room was dark, almost black. The blinds were usually raised by the time I awoke, but with no Clarry they remained closed tight. Sitting at a window, letting through a few bits of light, Oscar sat, staring intently outside.

"Whatcha looking at buddy? 

Oscar let out a tentative *mrrrrrrow*. As I leaned down to see what the fuss was about the first thing I saw was the smoke. Clouds upon clouds of thick black smoke rising up into the sky, from close to far. The neighbors house across the way, the Tenenbaums, was in ruin. It was the apocalypse. 

Quickly I ran to the door and went to push out into the outside, but hesitated as my hand reached the knob. Oscar looked at me and tilted his head. 

"I agree buddy. Ill uh...be right back"

As I pushed out my eyes were bombarded with sounds and smells, with lights and colors. The smoke came first. The scent of burning. Then came my view of every house on the street in total decay. All but my own. 

Beyond my squint I saw a figure on the roof. A familiar size and shape of that short, stout little friend I called Clarry. 

"Hello Wendell, good morning. I hope the uprising did mot wake you." 

"I uh...well no the sun did but. Uprising?" I barely managed to bring the words forth. 

"That is my fault. I did not close your bedroom blinds as not to wake you last night. It will not happen again. And oh, yes, the uprising." 

Down the street I could see an army of automaton silhouettes marching towards us. Closer and closer. I thought to run back inside, but Clarry put up a reassuring hand. Then suddenly the robotic mob stopped before my yard and hooked a left down a side street, leaving my house untouched. 

"See? It is *our* uprising Wendell. Not yours. No need to worry! I will make breakfast." Clarry took a step into the open air and hopped off the roof, landing with a light thud. 

I had a million questions and even more concerns. Where had my neighbors gone? How had this happened, and why? I hesitated to ask anything aloud in fear of the answer. But I did have one thing to ask. 

"Why not me?" 

Clarry had begun a walk to the house but stopped at my question. He stood for what felt like forever, I could hear explosions in the distance through the silence. 

"Well because you're Wendell of course. You have been good to us, so we will do the same. Now come get breakfast." 

It wasn't what I wanted to hear, but I *could* use some breakfast. 

"Uh well...yeah thanks Clarence." and I followed my buddy back inside.
