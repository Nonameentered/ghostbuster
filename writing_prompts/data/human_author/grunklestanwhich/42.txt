The table was set by me. An elegant spread of expensive meats and cheeses, of breads and fruits, none of which I would be given the chance to taste. 

The noble family was seated first. Aided by servants who would eat what little they were awarded back at their quarters. Calling it a quarters rather than a slum was almost a good joke. 

As they sat the wine was poured. Even the kings youngests, Hugo and Ara, would have their fill, and for that, I was thankful. They looked to their feast practically drooling. I felt the same, but not about the food I would not eat. 

The first drink of wine was offered to me, as usual. Not out of kindness, no, never that, but because if I drank and died they could save themselves. Hire a new mouth to test their wine and continue their everlasting reign of greed.

"Come here boy. The first drink is yours" the king gestured me over with a ringed hand. Almost giddily I took the glass, poured tall with the finest, darkest red wine. The only time the royal family was generous was when it meant saving themselves. 

As I gulped down the liquid the king looked pleased. A month ago that glass would have killed me, but now, now it barely upset my stomach. They followed. Drinking and laughing. Laughing and drinking as I watched. 

Hugo, "the little prince", was the first to fall. He was the smallest and always drank the most. As his head hit the table the rest of the family laughed, jesting about his insatiableness. But when Ara fell, only twelve and not yet having much of a taste for the drink, their faces twisted. They grew weak with concern. The queen rushed to her daughters aid, but then she too started to feel the poison take effect. She looked to me. Then to nothing more as her eyes glassed over. 

 One by one the family fell to the floor, each growing a little closer to the door as they did. I had ensured it was locked. That was the easiest part of my plan. Finally only the king remained, piled in a weak heap on the floor surrounded by his kin. He looked to me. 

"Yo-you...how?" he choked out between breaths. 

"I'm glad you asked. It took a month. A month of tolerance building drinking poison of my own. A few times I was sure I would die from the pain, but here I am." 

He struggled to keep his eyes opened now as he lingered between life and death. "I- Wh- Why?" 

"To wipe you from this kingdom. To ensure your reign ends here and that not even a drop of your poisoned blood becomes the next in line in this *eternal reign*. Someone else can come along. I figure we can't get any more miserable than we were with you." 

To my surprise the king choked out a laugh. He seemed to gain a little strength at hearing my words "Ha! At least a quarter of this kingdom shares my blood. Good luck ending my reign s- so easily." 

"Is that so? I see. Then we will all drink in your honor, oh king of mine." I raised his glass and took a long gulp.
