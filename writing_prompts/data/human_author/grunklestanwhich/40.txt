Fights in the mages arena were long and drawn. Cast times could take upwards of three minutes, of just watching two guys make ridiculous hand motions and practice their breathing techniques at one another. "An art form" is what other chumps called it. A practice in patience and discipline. I never was much of a patient man. 

So as the mage across from me moved his hands I did not run to stop him. I did not cast a spell of my own to counter his, no, I just walked across that stone floor. I think the audience thought I was getting in range or some other wizard bullshit, because as I stepped up it was like they stopped breathing. They grew so quiet that my footsteps became loud. 

I knew the spell the guy was casting, or at least I thought I did. Just because I didn't buy into the "art" didn't mean I wasn't versed. Destruction Point, I think it was. Nasty bit of wizardry. Took a minute-thirty to cast. Only took fifteen to walk across the field. 

As I approached my opponents eyes grew wide with confusion, or maybe fear. Couldn't tell. Regardless he continued those stupid hand movements at that same snails pace. Little puffs of smoke had begun forming at his fingertips by the time I'd arrived, and for any other mage he'd be trouble. But not me. My school practiced practicality first, magic second. 

So, practically speaking, I was within range to knock his teeth down his throat. So I did. As I pulled my fist back his eyes grew even wider. Then, with as much force as I could I hit him square in the face. The crowd let out a collective gasp. The wizard across from me stumbled backwards clutching his jaw. Bits of blood dripped out of his open mouth and stained his gray silk robes red. 

"You just...did you just hit me?!" 

Rather than reply I strolled up to him and hit him again...and again...and again. He failed to block a single one, I'm not sure he even knew how. The crowd gasped with each one. Between hits he'd bring his hands up to cast something which was cut short every time by another blow to the face. Another jab to the ribs. More punches connecting with a loud  *thwap* every time I swung. 

After a simple barrage of half-assed punches he fell back, his face swollen and bloody. The crowd grew silent once more. From the stands a voice called out to me, a tall and lanky man with a long gown of the finest wealth. Head of Magics, Thom I think he was called.  

"You did not use any magic? Not a single spell." he sounded accusatory. 

"Nope. Turns out I didn't need em." I yelled back. Cleaning the blood on my fist off on my jacket for emphasis. 

"I..I can see that. But, you didn't utilize your skills." 

"Ah yeah. Turns out I didn't need those either." a group of simply dressed mages came out and began performing a group healing cast on my opponent. Five minutes it would take to complete. 

"So...bring out the next guy then!" I yelled. 

The door that led from my opponents quarters to the arena opened with a great deal of hesitancy. Out walked a mage dressed in fine red robes, a large leather bound book strapped to his side just for show. Graythar the Great I think they called him.

 I wondered if he could take a punch.
