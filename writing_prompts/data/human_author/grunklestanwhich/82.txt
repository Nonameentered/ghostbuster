The woods felt light at my feet. Beds of dead leaves under my weight like comfort, like home. Every step my paws indented a new patch of ground. I did not need to hide my marks, for no man in a hundred years had managed to harm me in any way that mattered. In fact, I was aware of a few in these very woods, right at this moment, slow and incompetent. I could hear them far off, trudging through the bush with far too many objects strapped in tow. They ran as if they knew which way to go, which way I lie, but even if they found me they would have no clue what to do next. 

And the thought tempted me to see if my theory was true, but a new scent filled my nose. The thick, sharp scent of blood and metal sonewhere far in the distance, well, far for a man, nothing for me. My step continued steadily through trees and bush. Over fallen logs and down under great natural stone arches. The scent grew until I was lead through to a clearing, an opening within the forest of flat, burnt ground. In the middle a man stood tall donning a cloak illuminated only by the moonlight above. On his hip two guns, and his back another, longer than the others. 

My beast heart fluttered, this was it. A real hunter. A real, bonafide killer of beasts, he even had the trophy to prove it: multiple sets of monsters teeth held on a chain around his neck. He did not even grant me the grace of his gaze. Instead at my arrival he simply drew his rifle and aimed. 

"You are an unholy thing. I will put you out of everyone's misery." There was no line I'd rather he said. Beautiful in every way. 

*Ch-rack!* his rifle went off, echoing deep into the woods. I cold hear the two incompetent ones in the distance change direction to the sound. I guess at the least they had working ears. 

 The bullet struck me true, and had I not moved may have killed me right there. But rather than meet its mark at my chest it instead tore through my shoulder and left a burning trail of bubbling flesh in its wake. Silver. Many hunters tried a blend, one that only left a bee sting of pain for a day at most, but this really fucking hurt. Well done. 

The dance had begun. With more speed than I had mustered in years I charged forward through the burning patches of grass, faster with each bound. *Ch-rack!*, another shot whizzed past my head from the hunter. My momentum only continued, knowing that any sudden moves would send me to my ass as the ash under my feet made for an uneasy balance. 

As if on queue a hunk of metal snapped up at my heels, baring teeth sharp enough to cleave my foot clean off. I had not noticed before but the field must have been full of them, painted black to match the ashen ground. But it did not matter, I was nearly upon him now. I had heard of those as competent as him. Those who considered the hunt of my kind a challenge rather that a chore. 100 years I had been trapped in this body, and 100 years since I had met a man who could do anything about it. Now I had, and I could not have been more enthralled. 

As I pounced I felt the rip of a round through my side, this time from a revolver held at the hunters waist. Even as I bared down his gaze did not widen. Even with the threat of death right before him he seemed cold. As if he couldn't care less. He really was a beautiful creature. 

My teeth found their mark at his neck, pushing straight through before stopping buried within. Another round, this time clean through my chest. For a moment we embraced in the moonlight. Both knowing our purpose was complete. His breath remained calm and steady as his chest rose and fell, pressed to mine. My own husky breaths began to slow, then came to a near stop. Once I died and my jaw unclenched he would bleed out beneath my corpse, a reality I was not quite ready for. 

The last thing I could hear was the other two hunters break the treeline, and it made me glad, as there was someone to witness the greatness of a spectacular hunter.
