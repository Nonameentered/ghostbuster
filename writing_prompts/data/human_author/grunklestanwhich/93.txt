Patient zero. They'd call me that because I was the first to catch the virus, which makes total sense. Then the second person caught what I had, so patient one, obviously. After a few weeks the whole block became a set of misnumbered victims all shambling around until granted death. 

Tina's body was the first to die as I watched on, stuck within my own corpse. I always teased she was smooth-brained when I'd see her at the mailbox. It was only a jest, but considering the way she went out maybe I was right. Fell from the second story onto a fence post. Unnecessarily brutal if you'd asked me, but then again if you really had asked my reanimated corpse probably wouldn't have had much to say. 

Before long the rest of my apartment complex had died off too in equally dumb ways until my body was the only one that remained. Now all I could do was watch on from the beyond as my disgusting remains shambled around the street. They were lucky. Meanwhile I was stuck with this memory of what I used to be. 

"Hey, asshole, go die like the others", I whispered into the ear of my corpse. For a moment it seemed to consider my suggestion, stopping its broken march down the street and becoming still. The brief moment of concentration was broken though as a cat ran by and my body went to chase it. 

"Hey! Don't eat that! I know you don't feel hunger, this is just bloodsport at this point!" 

*Even when I was in my own body I had no chance of catching a cat, so there was no way that I could no- ah...I stand corrected. Oh wait, it got away! Thank god.*

 My body moped at the sight of its feline prize running off down the road. A normal human may frown, slump their head when they're down, but no, not my corpse, it cemented its annoyance by throwing its whole self to the ground all at once in a pancake fashion. "Da-Da-Dammit!" it tested the letters out before letting out a very human roar, to my surprise. It had mumbled things before, oddities and noises that I did my best to ignore, but never a real word.

"Did you just speak? Say something else! Say..uhm...say cat. Yes, say cat!"  I once again whispered my suggestions from the beyond. "Cuh-ah-tuh, like that!" 

Once again my body stopped in seeming understanding.  "Cuhhh-ah-tuh" it replied after a moment, and as it did I could feel my spirit tug away just a little. As if a part of me had begun to fade. "Ok ok yes! Very good. Ok, now try out this. "Kuh-ill Uh-suh". 

My husk tested out the words on its decayed lips a few times before giving up to shamble elsewhere. Run after a new cat or into another door. But at least now I had a mission. Finally a goal other than whispering various ways that my body could die so it may stumble to its death and my freedom: I could teach it. Teach it until it was no longer my body anymore and instead became something new. 

And maybe with that gain my freedom.
