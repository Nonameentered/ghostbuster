Another two people walked out of the attraction looking contently at one another, making googly eyes as new lovers did. I had counted how many had gone in single today, or so I perceived as being such: eighty-two. Out of those eighty-two, seventy-five had come out with that same, content look for their new partners. No longer so single. I scribbled the numbers down on my notepad *82-76. Assumed, not asked* 

The exhibit had only been opened a month. I remember seeing its opening announcement in the news, or maybe the paper... regardless I had seen it: *The Alternate Future Coupling Device* quite a mouthful. Within the first few weeks though the name quickly changed amongst the public to something with a little more spunk: The Ship-O-Matic. And with that name change came the machines new reputation as a match maker rather than a tool of discovery.  

I watched as another couple ran in giddily through the flap that would undoubtedly determine the remainder of their relationship. The rest in line stared onward towards where the two had entered, as if the potential success of others would mean a success of their own when it was their turn. 

As I walked up and down the line I listened in on the various ideas people had about their fate, about why they stood in that line. 

"Well Martha this is cheaper than therapy."-

"Well don't you want to know? I mean it's our future!"-

"It can't hurt eh? Not like we knew each other before today."-

No matter how many I heard though I just didn't understand it. It was like that old question asked often on first dates or in the making of new friends, "If you could know when you would die would you want to?" I always answered no, and thought I was smart for it. But maybe I just didn't like knowing. 

As I passed more faces in line a couple gestured to me, a shorter man with a permanent cheery look on his face and a taller woman with soft features.  A rounded nose, almond shaped eyes, a gentle face to set it all, and I had to do my best not to stare. They continued their manic gesturing despite me already moving towards them. 

"Hey you work here right? Can you hold my spot in line? They'll kick us out if we're waiting solo." the man spoke up first. 

"I uh...well I'm supposed to be taking data ya know. Just writing and stuff." the words came out mumbled and I found myself awkwardly staring at the man trying my best not to look at his accompanyment. 

"Real quick I swear! I'll be right back!" and he left off, leaving me and this woman alone. 

We stood in silence for a while, her looking around the museum and me looking anywhere that wasn't her. After a long moment she broke the silence "Just so you know we're not together, me and him. I just wanted to try this thing out so bad! So, I sort of took anybody who would go." 

The words were not comforting to me as my mind was elsewhere. Focused on making the count as a young couple walked out of the machine looking less than happy with one another. *84-76* "Ah. So then, who is he?" 

"Just some guy I met walking around this place. He said he was in the same situation as me, but I think he just wants this whole thing to go somewhere. God I pray it doesn't" she twiddled her fingers around. 

I couldn't help but laugh out loud at the thought. The thought of wanting to know so bad but fearing the outcome. Of only doing it for the experience to say you did it. On my notepad I scribbled *For the experience*. 

"Why are you laughing! And what did you just write down?" 

Shit. Often I forget others are paying any attention to me, working at the museum it becomes easy to get used to being a fly on the wall. But before I could defend myself we had reached the front of the line. Suddenly I was nervous, my hands sweating. I looked around to where her partner had gone, but no sight of him. I had never thought I'd try this damned thing, let alone with a stranger. 

I recognized the guy montoring the entrance, Gerlad was his name. If I hadn't remembered though his bronze nameplate was a good indicator. He looked up to me quizzically. "Uh...Dave? You goin in there? Didn't think it was your kinda thing but alright." 

"Well it's not but you see I was-" 

"We were just seeing where things went. What it was like in there." the girl cut me off then dragged me into the black opening. I found myself holding my breath for one reason or another, then letting it out upon walking through the entrance. As we entered we were greeted by a set of chairs and helmets resting on top. A screen sat in front just big enough for two people to watch comfortably. Other than a blue light shining down from above the room was entirely empty, entirely underwhelming. I don't know what I expected.  Maybe a grand theatre full of red seats, or a futuristic room of solid obsidian, but not this. 

The girl who's name I still had not gathered ran in excitedly and sat first, then gesturing back to me to join. "Listen shouldn't we wait for that guy? He seemed excited." 

Her voice became stern, "I've waited weeks for this, please don't ruin it for me. It takes a minute and it doesn't mean anything, ok? I just want to know what it's like." this time I caught myself staring at her and quickly looked away. But I joined her. As we put on the helmets the screen immediately came to life in front of us. From a black nothingness to our conbined thoughts displayed. It didn't take any convincing for me to know what showed on the display was true. It was like I already knew, and watching on was only meant to confirm. I looked over to her, but I couldn't make out the expression on her face. Fear? Excitement? Content? Or maybe nothing at all. 

In a minute it was all done. One of the most memorable moments in my life over in sixty seconds. As we walked out we did not hold hands, did not make loving eyes at one another, just walked out back into the dullness of the museum. She turned to me "Gracie. I'm Gracie. I know we didn't really get to that but..." 

"David." I outstretched a hand in an uncomfortable sort of formal gesture. But she took my hand with a smile and shook. 

"It was nice to meet you, David." 

"You too, Gracie". This time I stared, but I did not try to hide it. We were passed that now. As she walked away I scribbled in my book. *86-78 Experienced, not asked*.
