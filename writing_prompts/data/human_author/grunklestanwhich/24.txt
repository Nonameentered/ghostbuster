Sounds of machines whirred steadily, sending a mix of mechanical noises through the factory floor. An olive oil business. Joe hadn't thought much of the idea when it was first pitched to him, but now, months later, he couldn't deny the results. Well, that and it made for a great cover. 

Joe placed a calloused hand down on one of the metal vats. Each finger with a different ring, most for show of wealth, status, a reminder who held the power and why. Across from both him and the metal tank a group of suited men spoke in hushed voices. Sometimes one would glare over another's shoulder to Joe and catch his gaze, to which they would quickly look back to the group. There were stories of men who had died for less. 

 After a moment of quiet deliberation the crowd of suits scattered leaving one, a taller sharp faced man alone to face the one across from him. .

"Alright Joe. Here's the deal, we'll buy. Fifty grand even for a kilo. 

Joe didn't flinch. He sucked his teeth and tapped his rings against the tank letting the sound travel through the tank. He looked down to his hand. 

"Fifty? For a kilo of marinara? Fifty will buy you more than that, but I wont complain." 

A flash of confusion on the mans face opposite. He glared back to his group to be met by similiar expressions. 

"I uh...you do mean "marinara" right?" 

"What other marinara is there? The sauce, what more ya want me to say?" Joe clenched his knuckles. 

"Im sorry I just want to be clear. "Marinara", yes?" 

"The fuck you saying it like that for?! And whats with the fingers? Yes fucking marinara asshole!" Joe yelled loud as to not be drowned out by the sounds of the machines working around them. One of the suited men reached for his waistband but was too late, Joe drew first and placed the chrome barrel of a revolver to the speaker opposite hims head. 

"Whats your name huh? You a fucking cop or something?" 

"Let's calm down Joe ok? Im Rick. And no. Im just here to buy what I came here for. I think there's some confusion." Ricks voice kept steady. He gestured behind him for his men to be calm. 

"I'm here to buy some "marinar- cocaine. A kilo at least." 

Joes look steadily declined from a look of anger to one of confusion. He did not lower the gun, but loostened his grip a little. Rick's shoulders dropped slightly. 

"So, are we good?" 

"Cocaine? Why the hell would you want cocaine? Marinara sauce is where the money is. Oh and olive oil? Ha! Don't even get me started on how much im making there.  Ya know, why dont you all take a step into my office and we'll have a chat."
