The man held the box up on screen for the camera to see, rotating it so that the keyhole was the most visible from the angle. 

"Now this is quite an interesting piece, it appears very intricate. Features are that it holds all of the great evils locked away thousands of years ago and Zeus's vengeance." his voice came through in a precise and analytical way.

Screeching and yelling. The Lockpicking Lawyers calm, white hands stayed on the screen without moving. Then, after a second of hell, they gripped the box and calmly shut it once more. A few bits of smoke leaked from the boxes cracks and wafted into the air. 

"Alright and that was Pandora's box. Archaic, but fun. If your threat level is a toddler with a sharp object then this may not be for you." he held the box closed with two strong hands as it rattled in anger. More smoke slipped out.
