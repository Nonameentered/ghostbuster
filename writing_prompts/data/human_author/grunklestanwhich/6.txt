Greg walked in the door with a long sigh. He looked beat, not mentally tired from work but physically beat as if he'd been at war all day. Blood leaked from a cut on his cheek, one eye was swollen completely shut, and I could've sworn that front tooth of his wasn't chipped yesterday. 

"Ah! Some day huh?" Greg let out a wheezy, pain filled laugh. "So what are we watching?" he stumbled over to an empty spot on the couch next to me. Before I could click away he was staring at the news report on tv, headlines reading. *Defenestrator Strikes Again! Rebeat in Critical Condition*. 

I stared to Greg for some sort of reaction, some sort of chink in the armor at his digestion of the footage of the Defenestrator beating Rebeat in the street, but nothing. He just watched on. If he had seen the string wall in my room he'd known I was onto him months ago. But he hadn't, and I was thankful he was so strict about respecting others privacy. 

"Whatcha think of the new guy? Defenestrator huh? Seems like quite a character. I see you've been watching the news on him a lot." Greg reached to the mini fridge and pulled out a beer, offering up me one too. As I reached to take it though Greg held onto it with a tight grip. We both held on now, me yanking on the neck and him holding steady onto the glass. I looked up and met his eyes, his now cold, steady eyes. 

"You're a smart guy Manny. A really smart guy." he whispered, leaning in closer and closing the distance on the couch. "Being smart is an advantage I'd say. But....sometimes? Well sometimes when you're smart you're curious too. Are you curious Manny?" 

I stared to the tv, where the footage now showed the Defenestrator tossing Rebeat against a window over and over until it broke. 

"I uh...what are you getting at Greg?" 

"I'm just saying that I'm cooking my mothers lasagna recipe for dinner and it'd be a shame if you couldn't join the rest of us. You will join us huh?" his voice grew dark, grated. There was not just an intensity behind it, but a power. 

"You- You're him." I managed to stutter out. 

"Yes. And you're Manuel Viele. Now I'm going to cook, then we'll play Catan with the boys. You in, or out?" 

I thought for a moment, but knew it wasn't a tough decision. Defenestrator or not, he cooked a mean lasagna. And so what? We all have our flaws. I took the beer from him gently now. As I pulled back our eyes stayed cemented to each other, tension built behind them as if at any moment one of us would strike, but no such thing happened. Instead I simply  drank my beer in a gesture of understanding. 

The lasagna was delicious as always, and though it pained me at first, later that night I took down my wall on The Defenestrator. I didn't need it anymore.
