"Ow...ow! Well that fucking hurts.", the man at my side retracted his teeth from my neck and began fanning the blisters that now formed around the corners of his mouth. At my neck I could feel lines of warmed liquid flowing down from my bite wound. Any normal vampire would find the sight of fresh blood irresistible, but this one was too busy tending to his burns to even notice mine. 

"Well what the hell was that?!" the pale man complained between open mouthed breaths. 

"Oh. Well I had the water in my body blessed. So....I sort of figured it would kill you or something. I didn't really think I would have to have this conversation." 

"Well now you do!" The vampires blisters kept growing in both size and number as we spoke. I had heard about their legendary healing ability, but now it all seemed not. "What kind of person gets their blood blessed?! Thats crazy, it's ridiculous, it's- kind of genius to be honest."

"Right? I figured with the growing numbers I couldn't be too safe. Too bad I have to kill you now." I reached down to my side and whipped up a sharp hunk of wood from its holster. Then, with a swift hand brought the stake up into the vampires chest. He staggered back a moment, coughing violently, then stabilized himself rather quickly for a man I had just killed. For a moment a confused looked crossed his face, then he pulled the stake out from his chest and dropped it to the pavement with a hollow *thud*. 

"Ah. You got my lung. Close though." he glared down to the new hole pushed through his chest. 

"Huh. Yeah I guess that figures. Well that was my last one. Dropped the rest back on Third and Main."

"Well, want to go get them? Oh, I'm Nagath Star Eater by the way" he outstretched a bony hand that I took in mine. At my touch a bit of smoke rose from his skin as his hand sizzled, to which he yanked away. I guess I was sweatier than I had realized. 

"Yeah, actually. Wait you'd come with me?" 

"Oh well yeah. For one I'm bored to tears. And two, I figure the water will cycle out of your body or something right? I haven't been human in a while, but I think I remember that being a thing, no?" Nagath played awkwardly with his cape. Down the street a bit of newspaper drifted lazily by before being stuck to a cars hubcap, to which both me and Nagath watched until its halt. 

"Huh. Well I guess your right, but I'll get to my stakes long before that and kill you." 

"Ok, what about a bet? Winner doesn't die a brutal death at the hands of the other. Deal?" After a brief moment of thought I outstretched my hand to cement our bargain, a hand which he avoided, but a deal nonetheless. 

"Ok, now where did you say you left those stakes?"
