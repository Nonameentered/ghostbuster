The lights flickered bright in his eyes, then faded. I had never seen a man turn to godhood, only heard the stories of how cruel the process could be, but I had not *truly* known until now. Maximus doubled over on the stone floor, suddenly crying out in pain with a mouth too wide to be human. Tears welled at the corners of his eyes before leaking paths down his cheeks. 

"Maximus! Do not fight it! They say it is only worse if you fight!" I could hardly bear to watch at his prolonged agony. In the moment I felt helpless, unsure what to do with my hands. "Mortals shall not touch gods unless permitted", one of the commandments of man, but this was not yet a god. This was my friend. I bent down and grabbed him by the shoulders. 

"Maximus! I will not leave your side-" another cry of brutal agony as his eyes flickered, then lit up once more filling the room with a blinding white. I could see for just a moment the flesh around his eyes bubbling before turning black. 

"Maximus...is **no more**. Leave while you can mortal...**Metrodorus run!**" the voice came from his body as a pain-filled symphony. As a series of voices all fighting to control one body, and I hoped that Maximus was winning, but down within I knew better. No man had bested a god. Even if that man was both. 

"Please, don't go! No, no no please..." I heard the cries of the man in my arms. 

The light retracted into his head once more and I could see again, but no longer did I hold my friend. Some features remained the same: the sharpness of his nose, the golden sheen of his hair, but the rest was...wrong. No, a stranger is what I held now. A man fuller, more unreal than Maximus had been. His stature now could only be described as godlike, with muscles like stone and hair that lined his face better than any painting could capture. He wept, and even as lines of tears traveled down his face he appeared more beautiful than any being I had ever seen. 

"I...I cannot" he spoke between sobs. "Maximus! Maximus, come back to me!" The god in my arms reached frantically into the open air until he grasped something invisible to me. His eyes grew wide upon catching it. Then he played with it, letting it twist between his fingers for a moment before letting it go. "Maximus..." the whispered word faded off into the silence of the room. 

He looked up to me with a newfound confidence, the last of his tears drying from his face for the moment. The tears of gods were said to have powers unimaginable to man, and I selfishly wondered what his were worth. But it didn't matter now. They were long gone, dried up into the carpet beneath us. 

"I am sorry about your friend- about Maximus. I am Helva, God of the Bright. In time you will hear my name more." 

As I looked down I realized I had no need to hold up this... thing within my grasp anymore, but if touching a god was a sin surely dropping one was something much worse. Thankfully he stood himself up to his feet on his own, and as he did I realized how massive he truly was. As if he'd grown simply upon standing. But there, past the marveling, beyond the glory that was this being before me, was my dread. Tears welled at my eyes. My throat tightened. 

"Ah. Do not cry mortal. I will always be with you. Your friend, will always be with you. Just look to the light in the room and know that I am yours." he snapped a finger and bright orbs appeared around the room, replacing the candlelight. A marvel to be sure, but my cares were elsewhere. 

"But you are crying still. Your eyes still well with tears. You miss him too!" I accused 

"I do..I do not miss him. I am him. You were a good friend Metrodorus. I pray you never become me." In a flash of blinding light he was gone, leaving me alone in my quarters. 

Alone with my thoughts. Without even a body to grieve over. Just a shower of magical, dancing lights overhead to remember him by. 

And a new god to pray to.
