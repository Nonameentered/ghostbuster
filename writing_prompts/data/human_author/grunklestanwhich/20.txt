I stared at the suit of armor, and strangely enough got the feeling that it was staring back at me. Though as we inspected, it sat motionless. Strange thing. I was no stranger to odd pieces of armor or enchanted weapons, but usually we'd found those things in caves full of greed-filled goblins, or shops on the square, coincidentally also filled with greed-filled goblins. This armor, however, had just been scattered along the dirt path before we put it back together. 

All four of us just sat staring at it, as if at any point the armor would come to life and attack. Tavyr was the first to move, often the bravest and most ignorant of us. He slinked up to the suit and gave a light knock on the helm. 

"Hell... hello? Is someone in there?" 

"No you dunce. We put the damn thing together, nobody's in there." Gregor replied in a whisper. 

But he was mistaken. At the knock the eyes of the helm came to life with a soft blue glow. The armor then announced. *Surrounding scan complete...identifying location...continuing to identify....Ok I have no clue where I am." 

"Accursed thing! You will die unholy beast!" Gregor charged towards the suit, his axe held high above his head. Usually at seeing the 300 pound hulking behemoth most foes ran, but this was quite a brave set of armor as it did not so much as even flinch. He brought the axe down hard into the spirits helm to, well, not much of anything happening. Just a loud *clank* and a small ding in the metal. 

*....Ow* the armor spoke. 

"Ha! Bet you'll think twice next time about trying to best Gregor Gatling. Let this be a lesso-" 

*Yes. I have most definitely learned my lesson. The lesson being that you will not be my new host* 

Host? We all looked at each other in confused unison. After Tavyr and Gregor it was Mallie's time to inspect. She was...well...the smart one of the group if I had to give her a label. At least smarter than Tavyr and Gregor, which often didn't say much. As she went to move I stopped her. 

"Woah woah, slow down. This thing has already proved itself to be immune to our blows. You sure you want to just approach it?" I whispered, so that the armor may not hear me. 

"No. But, we have no clue what it is, so I figured if anyone would be the one to figure it out it's me." 

"I have theories. A mimic maybe? Or a spirit, possessing the thing. It wouldn't be the first time. And the most likely one: Three Goblins stacked on top of each other." at that last one I gave Mallie a grin, which she returned. 

"Ah yes, the dreaded three stacked goblin strategy. It did work on us once, but not likely this ti- Hey! Get away from it!" 

Mallie yelled over to the other two, who had found a long stick and were poking and prodding at the armor to various protests from it. Then she turned, pulled down her goggles, and approached. As she got close the helm turned to face her. *Another local! Hello, could you tell me where I am?*

"Yes, I suppose. You're between Brightrim and Candella. About five miles from each." 

As the suit pondered this reply Mallie got to work, poking and prodding it herself, but with more purpose. She took out a thin metallic razor and tried shaving a bit off of a gauntlet on the suit to no avail, barely even a scratch left on it. Then she conjured a ball of flame in her hands, feeding the larger flame through her fingers until it made a fine cone of blue. Upon placing the cone on the suit, once again, nothing. Hardly a scorch mark left behind. 

*Could you stop that? I can tell you what sort of metal I am. I am a steel and tungsten alloy from the New World. I say New World as I assume this to be the Old World. This may come as a shock to you so I will give you a moment to process....moment passed.* 

We all stared, confused by its words. New World? Our world was as new as it got, or so as far as I knew. What other world could there be? 

"Speak clearly spirit! In words we may understand." 

The suits helm turned and looked me up and down. I readied my hand on my blade, but did not draw. Instead we just sat. I staring at the suit of armor and it staring back. Finally it broke the silence. 

*New Host Found. ID: Unknown. Commence pairing* 

A ray of light akin to a spell shot from its eyes and bathed me in blue light. Then one by one each piece flew from the set and onto me. First the legs, which I desperately tried to pull loose. The rest of my team sprung into action, trying any possible means to remove the pieces as one by one they encompassed me. Finally all that was left was the helm, floating in place before me. 

"Save yourselves! It is no use! Who knows what I'll become when it posessed me. Run!" 

*Oh don't be so dramatic. If I could possess you then I wouldn't integrate. Consider the feeling of anger mutual.* Then with a loud whirring the helmet flew onto my head. 

Words. Red words in my vision. *Initializing*, they read. I felt pressure, then I heard the voices of my group. Tavyr first, "Cut it out Gregor! Hells gate, Maximus is still in there!" 

"Yes and once I break it he will be out!" 

The words faded and once again my sight returned. It was not like seeing through a helmet, where one can miss his vision at the corners. Not like a mask with a full face covered and trouble breathing. No, this was as if I was wearing nothing at all. At the same time the armor and I spoke to Gregor, who was hacking away at me. 

**Cut it out. I'm ok Gregor**

"Maximus! You have not been turned to a sloppy goop!" Gregor hugged the armor and tried to give it a lift, but failed. The group all stared to me with concern from outside my new prison. I tried to look back, then remembered the glowing blue eyes they must be seeing instead. 

"So, what now?" Mallie spoke to both me and the armor. And we replied in unison: 

**We bring it back. So, onto the New World.**
