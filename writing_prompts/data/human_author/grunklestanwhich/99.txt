She looked to me, then to her cat, then back to me, her brow still scrunched with confusion. 

"I reckon' they all say that, no? Why else would we call it a meow then?", in the moment I swear I saw her cat nod in agreement. 

"Ok, follow me along here" as I spoke I did my best to distance myself from her...whatever the hell it was, and it watched closely as I did. "You ever heard a pig say oink? What about a dog, you ever heard one say the word *woof*?" I could see Jessica think for a long moment for the right words, all the while avoiding her cats amber-eyed gaze that still stalked me. She finally settled on: "Well I never been much of a dog person really. That's why I got little Bean here." 

"Ok, well *Bean* is fucked. And I refuse to call that thing a cat. That's a grown ass man in a cat body." 

*meow...I mean uh. Mrroowwww* ,Bean spoke just as a grown ass man would, as if to prove my point. At the sound of a human voice coming from a tiny feline body for a second time I recoiled in shock. Jessica seemed unfazed, even as I aggressively gestured towards Bean the cat. 

"That thing just spoke! That wasn't even meow, it was just human words!" by this point my hand was gripping the door handle at my back. I wanted to leave, but I needed Jessica to be as concerned as I was. It seemed silly to get this worked up over a cat, but then again, at this point I was very convinced it was anything but. The way its eyes followed me. Its movements, more human by the moment. Oh, and the fact that it SPOKE ENGLISH. 

"Hm? I mean Beans meows sometimes *sound* human, but obviously they aren't. Sometimes, when he's whispering into my ear as I sleep, I think it's words to, but no, just meows." For the first time since we started this conversation Jessica looked over to Bean, who failed to return the gesture. Its amber-eyes looked at me smugly, as if it was ready to reveal a big secret that I knew nothing of.

My skin crawled. Crawled at the image of her cat whispering words into her ear as she slept. At the thought of it performing a myriad of unnaturally human acts. 

Before I left I had to be sure. One last trick."Fine, if it's a real cat then it should know tricks. All cats know tricks. Roll over then you weird ass thing." 

"He's not weird! He's just a cat. Ok, roll over Bean" to which Bean listened and followed, its eyes never leaving mine. 

"Now sit" I spoke, and once again the cat obeyed. 

"Ok, finally, backflip." 

"Bean can't possibly backfli-" but Jessica was cut short as he did. 

"Ok well now im really convinced. No cat had ever been taught to do anything, let alone follow commands.The backflip just cemented my thoughts. Thats a demon. A gnarly, disgusting, empty husk of a demon that is bad at pretending to be a cat." 

And Bean began to sweat. Beads of literal sweat formed over its fur and dripped down onto the carpet, more by the moment until the drips became a stream. With a paw it began to fan its face in attempt to cool down. Then we both watched in awe as its posture shifted from more cat to man. Hiking itself up to it hind legs and sitting cross legged on the top of the couch.

"Ah, well it appears the..ahem...'jig is up' as you say. Bean, out" and in a puff of black smoke the cat known as Bean disappeared. Jessica looked unimpressed, I'm sure I looked as I felt, freaked the hell out. 

"Well there he goes I guess. Thanks K." 

"Thanks?! Your cat was a literal monster! The hell was that?" 

"I dunno but he's gone. You got what you wanted. At least I still have Thump." 

On cue a rabbit hopped in the room, small and fluffy. With a long foot it tapped the back of its ear, then, it looked up to us both. 

*Uhh. The fuck does a rabbit say? Raaaabiitt*
