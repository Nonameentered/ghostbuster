A new face walked in, rough and filled with grit. His deep set eyes shifted left, then right, and left again before landing on an empty space at the bar and the barkeep behind. I wasn't the only one watching. Faces all over the sea of experience that saturated the room eyed him down, all of us careful not to make it too obvious. You never knew who could have just walked in. Hell, just last week Jim Howitzer had his head slammed through a table by some dull looking fella; turns out that guy was, or at least had been, Deathsend. Went by Dominic now, but at one point he was among the worst villainy had to offer. Neither the table nor Howitzer had recovered much since. 

So we learned not to stare so much. 

He lumbered over and took his spot. Guy looked mean I suppose, but then again, so did pretty much every face in here. Retired villains, ex-heroes, long decommissioned agents with more kills than I had hours on the clock this week, all gathered here to drink and talk, talk and drink. I found myself to be more of a talker than a drinker in the years. When you work a bar I guess the drinking becomes more of a job than a pleasure. 

Now that his back was turned a few guys began signaling it out as to who he could be. One of em', a slim, elf faced guy who went by Chimney, motioned over to me with a subtle wave and I obliged. As I passed a few of the regulars, seated at tables or otherwise drinking, I could hear most discussing the fresh face. 

*Ya think?* *Yeah well you never know.* 

*What was that one guys name? Uhhhhh...retired not long ago, Blackout I think he was? Could be him.* 

As I arrived to Chimneys table he motioned for me to sit, all the while keeping his eyes cemented to the back of the guys head. 

"Trying to figure him out or burn a hole through him?" I muttered. 

"Maybe a bit of both. Dunno yet." Chimney muttered back, which shouldn't have surprised me but it did anyways. I hadn't thought he was paying anything else any mind. 

"Word around is it might be that one guy, Blackout or something." 

"Blackouts 5'8. That guys 6'3 at least." as I looked up to him he was drinking now, making small talk with the barkeep, Sal. He was a big time hero in the eighties, information it took me a whole year to pry outta him. Called himself Atomic Solomon, and to be honest could probably take everyone in the room. Well, I couldn't speak for new guy.

To my surprise the guy polished off his drink, nodded to Sal, then wandered through the swinging double doors that led to the back. 

"Looks like he's a co-worker then. Give me a minute. Ill figure him out...ten bucks says ex-villain." Chimneys eyes now left the man to meet mine. He slapped a tenner down on the table and outstretched a hand. 

"Deal" I shook, got up, and wandered to the back. As I approached the doors, dodging wobbly patrons and slick spots in the process, Sal glared over to me.  

"He's an enigma. Can't get a bead on him. Good luck.", then got back to pouring drinks. That meant a lot. Sal only had trouble reading a handful of faces, me included. When it came to bets he preferred to stay out, but when he did he cleaned us out. 

As I turned back I qiickly realized the attention had shifted to me. Many hands held ten dollar bills with grins on their faces. 

With a hand gesture back to cement my mocked displeasure, I walked through the doors to the back. New guy was aproned up over the sink. His gloved hands rubbed the dish in front of him. There was something odd though, something off about him. It was as if he was struggling at the meager task before him. In his forearms the veins were just a little too big, his teeth clenched just a tad more than typical. Though his hands moved steady his body read the opposite, like a coiled spring. 

Slowly I approached, beung sure not to make a sound as I did. Not hard, at least not for me. But the moment my foot hit the ground he spoke. 

"What, coming to kill me?" he spoke very matter of factly. 

"You're new, so you must not know. No killing here. I wouldn't make it a foot out the bar before I was taken out. Buried out back. Super hearing?" Damn. If I lost the bet that'd be at least half a check I'd be giving up. 

"Oh, no I wasn't aware. That's almost admirable. And no, just good enough to know I'm being talked about out there." he kept washing that same dish. His hands moving in slow circles. 

"Well. Then you know that I'm the one who's come to figure it out. Nothing personal, just a-" 

"Pinnacle." his voice came out cold. 

"Pardon?" 

Once again, same tone, but this time he turned to face me. His eyes seemed deeper, darker, harder. 

"Pinnacle. That's who I am." 

I tried to control the beat of my heart. Luckily I had gotten good at it, when you're around so many supers any change in it can be a sign of weakness. But keeping it steady in the face off such power? The best poker face. 

Still I could not fully process what I'd been told. Pinnacle? He was still up and running. Still fighting crime with such an efficiency that the world wouldn't run the same without him. And here he was, washing dishes in a dive. 

"Why?" it was the only word I could muster. He grew closer, closer, closer still until we were face to face. His eyes unwavering. His face a solid block of concrete. 

"Why? That's a fair question, why. I'd expect it from anyone else though, not you, Clergy." He knew me. I knew he knew me. We had never encountered each other much, or at all really, but everyone feared the name *Pinnacle*. I was more surprised that he knew me. 

"I came here...to get a break. I can't hardly go anywhere without feeling so alone. Like at any moment if I let loose everything, everyone around me would die. All so-so...fragile. But here. Well at least here I dont have to worry. I can just-" I could see a massive vein in his arm swell. "just wash dishes. So, tell the others if you want, but I'm just here to catch a break." Pinnacle turned around and got back to the dishes. 

Out I wandered from the back, all faces turned to me and stared. I didn't have to think on it. He wanted what we all want. Slowly I reached into my pocket and withdrew a wad of cash neatly folded. The bar erupted in a roar of applause, of yells and screams of excitement. Table to table I went, giving each a slug on the shoulder and a tenner. 

Anonymity was far too expensive.
