He stared at me a moment, my young ward, a stray bit of brown hair floating over his forehead. "Well what the fuck does that mean?" 

"It just means im disappointed. I know you could do better. Did you forget the nitrogen again? You know it's important." 

Behind us what was surely meant to be a giant monster had come out as an angry puddle of jello. It jerked its little jello head back and let out a watery roar. My ward pretended his mistake did not exist and instead continued his now awkward stare at me. 

"Ok, and what if that's what I meant to make?" he replied matter-of-factly. I struggled not to roll my eyes. It was a typical excuse from a budding scientists, one I had used before. The ole *I meant to do that*. And with a scientist there was no refuting it. It just was. I had taught him well. 

"Ok well if you meant to make a mistake then congratulations. You did it. Now clean that thing up." As I spoke I grabbed a blaster from a nearby shelf and set it to the *absolutely anhialate this mistake* setting. The monster now trudged over the concrete floor pretending to topple tiny buildings with its jello body. Cute, admittedly. 

My ward took the blaster with a hesitant hand. He had done away with plenty of other mistakes, of other little monsters or bits of odd creation from his practices, never hesitating. But now he stared to it. To this little gelatinous mistake that paraded as a great threat to nothing but the laboratory floor. I knew that look. 

"Oh no. Gabriel don't tell me..." he looked to me with widened eyes. "Aw hell! You named it didn't you! I told you time and time again, naming is just claiming but without the spoken commitment." 

"No no...ok maybe but I can get rid of it see!" Gabriel raised the weapon to the little yellow blob, which stared back to him with innocent eyes. Dammit. No chance now. But to my surprise his finger began to pull the trigger and I found it was my hand that stopped his. He looked up to me confused. 

"Ugh. Well I guess since you already named it you might as well keep it then. Fine." 

"But sir I was going to-" 

"No, no. No need boy. No need to beg and whine, save it. We can keep it. Call it...Gelly or something I dont know." 

Gabriel smiled a knowing smile, but accepted my agreement. He placed the blaster back on the table. The monster started its imaginary reign once again. 

"You know I could still add that nitrogen, sir." 

"Ah, too late I'm afraid. You've already gone and named it boy. We'll figure it out. Like I said, I'm not a mad scientist, just a very disappointed one. Well, good luck with Gell- I mean your new responsibility." 

But he seemed content. And so was I.
