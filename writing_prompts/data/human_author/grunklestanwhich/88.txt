When the apocalypse arrived I never thought it'd be a blessing, but here I was. It wasn't like real society ever wanted me around anyways. It seemed the undead didn't either. Like I said, blessing in disguise. Now, as the bike beneath me brought me ever closer to the gates of a city I had only heard of in myths, I knew society could no longer reject my gift. 

As I approached the massive stone gates armed guards lining the top yelled down to me. "Something we can do ya for?" A particularly military-esque man yelled down, rifle in hand. 

"Yeah, I have business! Business with Hortold!" yelling back up was both rather demeaning and a huge hazard to anyone that wasn't me, proof shone in the stacks of broken zombie bodies around the gate. The man above and his lackeys all cocked their guns in near sync. Something I'm sure took more practice than the effort was worth. 

"Didn't hear nothing about that! Whaddya say your name wa-" his speech stopped. Even from down where I stood I could feel his mood shift. A calm wind blew, carrying the scents of death with it. Then the noises begun. Clamoring from ten, no fifteen bodies of the undead all lurching my way. The men prepared their rifles. 

"Run! Run you dumb bastard!" a man above yelled. But I did not need to. The rules of most mortals did not apply to me. Instead I let them walk past me and watched their decaying figures hobbled on. One looked over to me with yellowed eyes, then scrunched its face and continued on towards the gate. Before they could reach it a hail of gunfire struck them down. More additions to the pile. 

For a moment we all sat in silence, the only noise the slow whistle of air leaving my bike tire through a fresh bullet hole. 

"Hey man that's how I get around. Y'all will have to-" my words cut short as a small door opened from the bottom of the stone gate. In the doorway a man waved me forward, and upon looking up the guards had since retracted. 

I made my way to the door, doing my best "avoid all of the guts on the pavement" dance until I reached him. "Well...welcome to *huegh* welcome to *heulgh*- dude you fucking stink" the soldier skipped the theatrics of pinching his nose and went straight to throwing on a gas mask. I knew I stunk. Hell Hortold knew it too, but I guess he'd rather parade me around as every member of his society reminded me. 

And that's exactly what occurred. Now within this place beyond the gates, this beacon of civilization, I could not begin to enjoy the wonderment it offered. Instead I could only watch on as I experienced what I had know all too well in my life. Kids ran, mothers ran, men...well they also ran as I walked by, warded off by my uncontrollably stench. Finally after what seemed like hours of uncomfortable walking I arrived to the man himselfs: Hortold. 

His building was unmistakable, a castle among a sea of normal homes. Guards donning thick plating and even thicker weapons guided me in, trying their best not to lose their shit at my smell. I could see tears welling in ones eyes. Another's face turned pale, but they did not falter. And before long I stood before the President of Elysium: Hortold Clastine. A name I was sure he had made up. John Smith's don't become Presidents in pressing times, Hortold Clastine's did 

"What do you want?" I felt ridiculous once again as I yelled up to a bearded man high up on a throne of iron. 

"Straight to it! I like it. So you're the man immune to the infection I hear." His voice rang out as a scripted speech rather than real words. It seemed he stared not to me, but something behind...a lens, a camera. Cameras plenty, all surrounding us. 

"What is this? You called *me* here." 

"Yes, well, I saw how a man of your gifts was being treated. I didn't see it fair. So, lets see what everyone thinks now." 

On cue a door opened into the room and a chained undead came barrelling out, two guards holding it back. At Hortolds command they released it in my direction, to which it ran for a moment, stopped, and ran back to the guards. It then tried to lunge onto them but at my approach it cowered away, clawing at the stone walls for freedom. Hortold laughed. 

"See! This is it ladies and gentlemen. This is the key to our survival. To the survival of the next generation! Behold: Evolution!" the cameras zoomed in, outside voices cheered, and I felt once again that my gift was actually a curse.
