The being before me was one that I was more than familiar with. Bipedal, proportionate (at least on the outside), brains large relative to their bodies, fleshy, and fairly smart  in comparison to some of the other ships residents. I was thankful it was a human who had come to the med bay today rather than something with more limbs or eyes. A day of work with just a human was almost always an easy one. Most of their wounds were superficial, though they did have this *cancer* defect that could manifest in quite a nasty way. 

As he entered I cut him short, "So, homesickness huh? What are the symptoms?" The human began listing off a series of "feelings" babble that I ignored and instead opted to look it up in my holo-pad. Asking patients anything was just a courtesy. 

The holo-pad got to work, flying through a series of medical ailments before landing on a large *information not found in current database*. The database had every sickness, nearly every ailment ever known. Even those odd bits in the far reaches of the outward spiral were catalogued neatly in the database. 

"Do you all have any other names for it where you come from? Other than homesick?" The man stared at me with this dumb look on his pink, fleshy face. After a moment he replied: "Its just that the sickness is not literal"

I paused my scribbles and stared at the holo board in between my hands. I could feel the space inside of my coat heat up as fear spread through me. The words choked out of my throat with fear. "Don't tell me... it's metaphorical." 

"Well it's more of an expression-" 

"Metaphorical sickness in bay 4! Symptoms have begun expressing!" I yelled into a speaker on the wall and my voice blared throughout the ship from above. The humans eyes opened wide and he ran for the door at the sound of an alarm, the flashing of lights, but I was too fast. With a fist I slammed the button on the wall neatly labeled: *Quarantine Protocol, Level 5*. The door he was making his way to bolted closed and he skidded to a halt. For a moment there was silence between us. The only sound was of the alarms outside and their muffled blaring. He took a seat at the far side of the room. 

Just last year a metaphorical sickness had taken hold of half of our crew. I wasn't going to let that happen again. 

"You cannot leave until we fix this I'm afraid. Metaphorically speaking your sickness could be anything. Plus, the data logs have nothing on this 'homesickness', but because it has a name I'm assuming you humans know it well. Tell me." 

He let out a long sigh, a human gesture I have known to mean annoyance, or regret, or deep pain, or acceptance. One of those. 

"No. It's not like a sickness sickness. It's figurative. I miss my home, therefore I am homesick." it took me a moment to register. My kind did not have anything like this. I suppose we missed home, my kind, but not to the point of illness

"Is this homesickness contagious?" I asked. Now he was the one to take a moment. "Uhm. Well. I suppose. But only if you share experiences, share memories of a place." 

As he spoke I let the newly opened entry for "Homesick" in my holo-pad populate itself with his words. I wasn't quite sure what they meant. What the sickness was, but it seemed only humans could catch it, which was of some relief. 

"How do we cure it?" 

"Well. I suppose if I could tell you about it, about home, maybe it would fix itself.", he seemed to grow stiff at his words. 

Listening wasn't my forte, but medicine was. And this was medicine. So I nodded. He began slowly, but picked up steam as he spoke. Spoke of not just a land called "Pennsylvania" but of Earth, of the things he had seen on his home planet. He spoke of its beauty and love. Of oceans and views. And in turn I shared some of my own. Though we did not call it the same I too knew of sunsets and valleys. Of happiness and love. 

After a long while he had seemingly run out of things to say, so he finished with a "Well doc. I think im cured.", and followed it with a smile. A gesture I knew to mean happiness. I returned the gesture in my own awkward way. 

"That's good. But I think I may be coming down with a tinge of it myself. Same time tomorrow?" 

He agreed, and I pressed the button to set him free of the room. Never had I failed to cure a patient. 

*Homesickness: A figurative, metaphorical, abstract ailment of deep missing of ones place of creation. Mostly found in humans, but possible to spread to other beings depending on severity. Cure: A long chat*
