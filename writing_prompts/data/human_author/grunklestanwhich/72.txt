To those pointing out potential plot holes, firstly, you are correct. I decided to take more of a goofy/satirical route here so certain places are less realistic than they are ridiculous. Secondly (and maybe more embarrassing) a user pointed out to me that I initially confused telepathy with telekinesis. So. There's that. Anyways, thanks for reading!
