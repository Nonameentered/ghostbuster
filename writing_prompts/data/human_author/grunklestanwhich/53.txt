The round ripped through the air, finding a neat little lane of atmosphere to glide through undisturbed. After a nearly imperceivable moment the metal jacketed ball of flame met its mark. Like a hot knife through butter, a bat through a glass vase, or some other third simile, the bullet tore through its mark and out the other side, leaving a neat hole in the front end of its target and a larger, messier one out the back. 

My mark roared out in pain, clutching the fresh hole now blown through his arm. "You shot me! I thought you were a pacifist!" 

"You're right about that. You're wrong if you think this means I won't put a bullet into those who try to abuse that."

He stared at me with a mixture of confusion on his face from my response and pain from the hole in his arm. 

"Thats...not pacifism that's-" 

"Protection? Defense? Assurance maybe?" I placed my gun back in its holster on my hip with a light snap. 

"No! It's violence!", by now the wound had begun dripping red onto the concrete. He was no longer paying me any mind as he spoke, just sweating and stressing over his arm. 

"If you call it that then sure. I believe war and violence are unforgivable in the world, for the world, doesn't mean for myself. Especially when it comes to assholes trying to take advantage of that fact." 

Another guy burst through the warehouse doors. I drew my pistol and fired off a single round, straight and true. He fell with a thud. 

"What the fuck! You didn't even let him move!" 

"He had a warning shot. He didn't pay attention. His fault." 

"What warning shot?!" 

I gestured to his arm where he had now gained control over the bleeding, though his sleeve remained soaked. He looked blankly for a minute before his realization. 

"This. This was the warning shot? You're a psychopath." 

"Nah. Im a pacifist." the last words I spoke as I left the room, taking my weapon of choice, my pacifists pistol along with me.
