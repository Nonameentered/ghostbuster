The dinner table, though unchanged from usual, felt incredibly long. Incredibly barren even though it was covered in dishes. It must have been a month...maybe two since we'd all shared a meal, and it showed. Nobody knew what to say that didn't involve work, the only thing we weren't allowed to speak of. The silence in the air was palpable. Room was filled only by the disjointed sounds of silverware scraping against ceramic. Robin picked at her peas, organizing them into what I thought to be some sort of sketch. Meanwhile our daughter seemed to be trying her best not to explode in her seat at the presence of such boredom. 

"So...uh. How has your month been Sweetie?" as the words left my mouth they immediately deflated, but were met by a new energy. Somewhere far off a saxophone played a jazzy tune that wafted into the room. The color on Robin's side of the table melted away until she was left in a strong black and white scene, alone. 

"Two dead, a perp still on the loose and you want to know how my month has been?! Murph has been on my- look out!" 

I didn't need to question the command. Hell I didn't even need to look. With a hunk of steak still on my fork I ducked with little effort as a bullet blasted through the window behind me and over my head. Outside I heard a car peel out and down the road. After a second to compose myself I continued:

"Ah no sweetie I meant not work." I spoke trying to arrange the steak in my mouth to make conceivable words. 

"Oh. Yes of course, not so bad. What about you?" 

"Hm. Good question. Hadn't thought much on it, good too I guess." Once again our daughter looked as if she was going to explode, this time I could have sworn I saw a shower of sparkles burst from her ear. 

"What about you Holly-"

"No offense dad but I'm really trying to keep it together here. If you speak to me again I may just explode." This time the shower of sparkles was obvious

We went back to our food. Back to our awkward silences and our awkward stabbing motions at nothing in particular. I had to cook our dinners, but I didn't mind. After a month of high adrenaline shootouts and red string evidence walls I wasn't even sure Robin knew how to cook anymore; Holly was never much for it to begin with. I was just happy that we were within each other's space, even if nobody knew what to say. Just as I'd almost given up all hope there came a knock at the door. 

"I got it!" I jumped up ready for any excuse to be excused. At the door was a boy, my boy in a way, Joseph, standing taller each day I'd seen him. Upon seeing me his face lit up."Mr Daniels! You'll never believe it, I made the team!" 

"Wow that's great buddy but im kind of in the middle of-" 

"Yeah! You told me I could and I should have listened. Man after G-ma passed away I just didn't know." 

"Yes Joseph that's great, very nice, can we talk later I-"

"But I tried out and boom! You told me to never give up and I didn't!" 

"Yes very good... how'd you get my address? Unimportant I'm sort of in the middle of-" 

Joseph's face contorted into a strange shape. His eyes stared straight passed me and up to something behind. I could hear it. Hear the sounds of sparkles and see the neon lights.

"Uh. Mr Daniels....is that your daughter?" 

I turned to see Holly fully transformed and floating off the ground. So many bows, ribbons, and other unnecessary seeming bits flowing from her outfit; I almost had to shield my eyes at the brightness. Her voice boomed out, not just through our house but so loud that it rattled the houses next door too .

"It's family time, if I have to sit at this table then so do you dad!",then, with a normal voice continued: "Good job on the team by the way Joseph!" 

He stared wide eyed, his hair blown backwards. Outside I could hear car alarms blaring. 

"Alright Mr. Daniels, I'll catch yoouuuu...tomorrow?" 

"Yeah that should be fine. Hey congrats on the team buddy!" with a half-hearted wave Joseph was back off down the sidewalk. 

And so I went back to dinner, escorted by my daughter with her world ending powers. Though the conversation didn't flow as normal, though I may have overcooked the steaks a tad, I was just happy that even if we didn't know what to say we were never boring for long.
