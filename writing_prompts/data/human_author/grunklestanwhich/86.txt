A little of this, a sprig of that, and suddenly you're labeled all sorts of shady things. I tried to tell them of my self studies in herbology. Of my practices in ancient medicines with a dash of my own tweaks, yet they have taken to labeling me a witch. "Wolfsbane" I said. "Witchery" they'd reply. 

Now a line stood at the gate to my garden. The same gate that featured the crudely drawn image of a pointed hatted witch on the front. At first I took it as insult, but when the line grew longer than ever I quickly understood it to be an advertisement. Now the line grew on the sidewalk and around the block, like weeds sprouting up from the cracks in the concrete. All clamoring of their headaches or hurt bones. I did not mind. I am the Witch of Whiteridge after all. 

A small boy approached the gate, his hair a mess and shirt stained with a beautiful tie dye of koolaid and pasta sauce. His big brown eyes were filled with uncertainty. 

"I...my teef hurt. Can you help Witch?" The boy smiled to show several gaps. 

"Why of course." I had to bend down on one knee to reach his level, and as I did his eyes lit up. Plenty of children visited, mostly to see if I was real, but some really needed the help. Of course it was help any store grade benadryl could give but I was happy to oblige.

My cloak dragged behind as I re entered the garden and got to work. At some point the Witch rumors had stuck, and with it the change of outifit. I plucked a few herbs and ground them in the mortar, ensuring to put enough flare into my actions so that those who peeked through the fence posts wouldn't grow bored. Then with a flick of my wrist I sprinkled the dried bits into a vial and gave it a good shake. They whisper beyond the fence. 

*I hear she's magic*....*no, no it's just drugs, tylenol or morphine she puts in there* 

"It's literally just plants. You can see me right now. I could teach you, any of you." I spoke to them without turning. The voices grew silent. They never accepted my proposition. Thought only I had the power, the power to grow plants I guess. 

After a few more stirs my "potion" was complete. A simple painkiller that didn't warrant a trip to the store. Adjusting my pointed hat I opened the gate once again to meet the boy who put in the request, and at my exit the faces buried in the fence jumped back and resecured their spaces in line. 

"Here you are. Rub this on your gums every time it starts to hurt and it'll make the pain go away." 

The boy clutched the vial with tiny hands, holding it as if I had given him a brick of gold. Hesitantly he opened the tube of green liquid and spread a messy bit on his gums. The crowd watched in silence. 

"Hey! It worked! Could I learn how to be a witch too?" 

I couldn't help but smile at the request. Finally, interest in my work. Interest in more than just the final product, but the process too. I could not have said yes faster. 

"Yes of course. We'll get you a cloak and everything. Oh, look our first customer!"

A large man waddled up, his arm very obviously unnaturally sideways in its socket and t-shirt twisted around it. The little boy, my new ward, winced.

"What magic can we do for him?" 

"Uhhh...we don't. He needs the magic of a hospital. Now use my witch phone and call 911."
