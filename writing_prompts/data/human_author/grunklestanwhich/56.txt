Little known fact: cats have no tear ducts. Ok, ok they do, but still I didn't cry when Wylie died, well, was murdered by that copper a dozen killer from Allonton. I only guessed that he came from that slimy place because Wylie always mentioned that the people there hated him for something or another, he was never really clear as to what. 

What he left me in his absence was a greater gift than I could have ever asked for, and I most certainly never had. Power. Potent, peak, plentiful power at the placement of my paws. More than I'd ever know what to do with. Wylie Thundercloud always was a bit on the conceited side. I'm sure his last thoughts were something like: *My power shouldn't go to waste, even if it means giving my years of unmatched experience to my tower cat*. Well, regardless of how it went it was mine now.

Tracking down the man who'd killed my partner was easy, not because I had suddenly become one of the most magically powerful beings in existence, but because I was a cat. Nobody questions a cat. I didn't even have to remove my new pointy wizards hat; all of the skeezy underbelly, slime ridden criminals in Allonton just thought it more cute than suspicious. I didn't sneak. Didn't tiptoe. Just walked up to him and stared. 

He looked different not wearing black. Dressed like a normal man who didn't kill for a living. He looked almost like a human, is what I'd thought at the time. 

But what was really important was realizing what they all hated so much about my late partn-...master. His face. It was drawn on the walls in drawing powder. It was sketched in the worst parts of the city, under it the words. "Let potential be limitless." Of course I didn't think it Wylie's fault, but if I had to stare at that everyday upon waking from the ground maybe I'd want to murder him too. 

But it didn't stop my cat-vengeance. Didn't stop me from using the extension of my master, of my friend, to ensure he was avenged. And it surely didn't stop me from being reminded that cats do have tear ducts after all.
