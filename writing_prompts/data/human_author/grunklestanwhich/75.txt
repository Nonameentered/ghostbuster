I've always loved landscapes, paintings and such. Never really amounted to much I'd reckoned. Just a skill to put on a sheet of talents, stuffed somewhere between "breadmaking" and "whittling". A skill, like the others, that would never see much practical use. But I suppose I had some inkling of pride in my ability nonetheless. Some part of me that grew giddy when a stranger asked to see.

"Ooooo got any pictures of your work could take a look at?" I loved when they called it that. Not my hobby, not my skill, my *work*. And of course I'd always oblige, play coy at it: "Oh I might have a picture stuffed somewhere in my wallet." The looks on their faces when they saw what I could do is what made me want to call it more. But alas it never was, well until I became a god that is. 

When I was summoned by the gods I don't think much was expected of me. The other, elder gods I had only heard of in ancient myths were polite enough, granting me the pleasantries of asking who I was before Olympus and what my passions were. Even Zeus, who I'd heard was a right twat, greeted me with a smile. I told them there must have been some sort of a mistake. They replied that the Three Sisters of Fate did not make mistakes, then lost me with their stories. "Ohho! Poseidon here said the exact same thing don't you recall brother?" 

"Yes, yes, well you were confused too!" he replied with an exaggerated eye roll. Below Poseidon's seat, in a swirling portal view of earth I watched the tides rose at his words. 

"Yes, well I was the first! So you wouldn't know that for sure. You were a close second though." 

"Just because you stared at the clouds all day doesn't mean you're better than anyone." Poseidon's tone shifted. His watery beard went from calm pond to a rippling sea as the waves licked up his face. In the earth view below I stared as the waves only grew. 

"Calm down you two. Let's give our new member a proper welcome, that is why we are gathered here after all. Landscapes, you say you did?" a womans voice cut sharply through their arguing, filled with casual confidence. Her mirror polished, golden armor gleamed with no light. I did my best not to stare in admiration. 

"I uhhh yes...well. I may have something around here somewhere." as I reached to my pocket my wallet was not there; instead I was left grasping empty air and with what was surely an embarrassed look plastered across my face. But the gods around their gilded table stared in awe, not at me, but at the swirling portal below my seat. It showed only blinding brightness at first, then focused to scenes of the countryside. Of mountains and trees, plains and forest, of my drawings come to life in real time. 

The sea gods beard grew steady once again, the storm in the eyes of Zeus faded too, every god lesser and greater watched the view. I watched with pride at the admiration of the greatest beings. But too of men once like me. 

Zeus did not announce my title as I'd expected, instead a sharp faced man with a winged halo spoke with a voice like the breeze: Welcome Grayman, god of the horizon, of the creation of vast stretches of land with your brush, of the plains themselves. Grayman, God of Landscape.
