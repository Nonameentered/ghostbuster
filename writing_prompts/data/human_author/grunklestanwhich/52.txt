Deliverance is not a concept. It is a judgement, an event counted down to by those who believe, and a day of reckoning for those who don't. The heathens, the nonbelievers and blasphemers, will stay stuck forever, while those who are marked with the holy symbol ascend.

*Ascension, however, is but a concept.*

When he was placed on the cross the stories told of his torture and of his resistance. They told of his will. Of the unjust punishment he faced when all he ever intended was to save his people. This is all true. Though what they didn't tell of was the time of day. I mean why would they if they had not known? There was a reason the savior was taken at night. That those iron clad non-believers waited till dark, till their target roamed. Then, they strung him up until morning and watched with fear as the sunlight crept up his body, crisping it. His crackling skin spread like a disease until he was nothing more than a withered husk. Stories say he did not scream. Hardly even flinched. I wished I was there to know for sure. 

Placing his remains in a cave was a fools move; the thought surely being that they would never have to look at him again. But they did. And they were delivered soon after. I knew no man from that time, but one who had lived old enough to know what stories were true and which were not. 

This one was true. 

I stalked above the alley, bounding across rooftops and over stone walls. Below a woman, early twenties maybe, ran with increasing speed. I'm not sure how she saw me, but she had. Intuition maybe. It is easy to forget that mortals have some powers of their own. She hooked a quick left down another continuing maze of thin roads causing me to falter for a moment. But then I was upon her. 

As I dropped down from the sky she let out a strained yelp. As if even her own voice was too scared to react. Her blued eyes wobbled in their sockets, choosing between looking to me and for any semblence of escape. There was none. I was upon her now. Slowly I drifted forward until my shadow ate hers. Her hands fumbled, shakily reaching in to her shirt and withdrawing a symbol. A holy symbol. They pulled forth a small gold cross on a chain. 

"Chri- christ compels you!" she was correct, but not in the way she'd thought. Instead of approach further I grew stiff and stared, interested to see if even she knew what sort of power she now possessed. 

"Christ, compels you! Go away!" her confidence grew at my sudden halt. It seemed she had some semblence of an idea. 

I dropped to a knee before her. "Apologies. I did not know you to be marked." I could smell it in the air now. That musky, overpowering aroma that came from within. "And you've consumed his blood too, yes? I was a fool not to have known sooner." 

I kept my eyes locked to hers as I spoke, watching on as her face grew from fear to confusion. 

"I...yes I'm marked by Jesus I suppose." 

"Yes. Marked by the holy one. Our lord and savior. *Our* creator." I stood once again; she flinched as I did. Out I reached my cold, undead hands and gripped the collar of her shirt, parting the buttons down until I could see the bare of her chest. There, plain as day was the symbol of Christ burned into her. Out she breathed a long, fearful sigh. I could smell that overwhelming scent on her breath once again, of his blood, of his mark. It was unmistakably sharp, stronger than normal blood, stained the air deeper too. There was no other smell like it. 

Somewhere down the alleys I could hear footsteps, voices echoing through the maze of streets. I think she heard them too. She turned and parted her lips with sure intent. I would not silence her. Would not even dare touch one marked by the first of us. 

Instead I leaned in close and whispered in her ear, cutting off the potential of her cry. "Would you join me in prayer?" No reply. Just those blue eyes searching for help. Her knuckles grew white from clutching the cross so hard. 

"Lets begin... Bring her deliverance, holy one. Bring us forward  and make us clean. Allow us your gift so we may move onto, toward greatness. Jesus hallowed be thy name. Amen." 

There was a long silence in the humid summer air. I could hear her breaths grow shorter. "Now you say it." 

She choked the word out: "Amen." 

And just as I'd arrived, I was gone once again.
