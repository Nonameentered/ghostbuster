Demons have a sense of these things. We can feel the heartbeats of mortals. Well, of anything with a heartbeat really. Comes in handy when you can't read the face of someone...or something, even animals heart rates raise when they feel a threat. But this woman. This stalwart statue of a woman before me, as she screamed all kinds of phrases and words even I in my five-thousand years never heard used together, her heart rate stayed just as steady as it had when we'd started. That. Now that scared me. 

And it was hard as fuck to do something like that. 

She, Ethel Graystone, pushed another bony finger into my equally bony chest. "If you think you'll take *my* boy just because some idiot I never met made a deal with you then you're just as dumb as you look!" Sprays of spittle flew from her mouth, to which I just sat and let happen as wiping it proved futile after the first few tries. 

Maybe she was senile and couldn't even tell what I was. Or maybe she had some sort of defect where her heart didn't beat right anymore. I tuned in once more to that sack of flesh in her chest. *Ba-dum......Ba-dum* 

Then I gave it my all, channeling everything I had into a grand display of power. Horns shot forth from my head and curled into gnarly shapes. Heat pulsed behind my eyes as I could feel flames licking at the back of my sight. Even my teeth, which had already been sharp before, shot out even further from my mouth. The small boy positioned behind granny cowered, but she did not move. Her heart kept that same consistent, stubborn beat. *Ba-dum......Ba-dum* 

She looked at me without change, stared passed the fire in my eyes and straight through me. I was sure in that moment if I had a soul the old meat bag would have captured and eaten it. 

She called my bluff. There wasn't much more in the tank but to kill her outright, and lord (literally) knew that an unauthorized killing before someones time was not worth the punishment. Just last week some poor collector had tried it, been having her eylids plucked since. 

The granny let out one final tirade: "Get lost you unholy, trash filled, hell spawn! You will not take my boy!" 

"I...my mistake. I must have the wrong boy. You go about your day then." 

With my tail between my legs, once again literally, I left the way I came.
