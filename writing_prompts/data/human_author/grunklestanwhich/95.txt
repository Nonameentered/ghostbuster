"The miracle man", the tabloids all started calling me. A ridiculous name if you asked me, and believe me, they asked plenty. At this point I was sure all the sites and cameras planned to continue with pestering me until I died, and since nobody knew when that would be this fresh new hell could keep up forever. 

They knocked in the morning, in the evening, at night, all clamoring for a story. None of em' really even had much to ask when I did entertain it. Looked like deer in the headlights at facing the oldest man the world had ever seen. And worst of all I couldn't tell if my crabbiness at it was justified or just because I was geriatric and full of aches. "Give it time" I spoke aloud, only for my cat and an empty room to hear. "You'll be back to your old, or rather, young self." 

*Meew* she replied. Old Tabby always knew what to say. 

As the door knocked for what must have been the third time today I hopped on my electric seat and prepared for my ride downstairs. With the press of a button it whirred to life and I was off to incredible half a mile an hour speeds. Knocking again, this time louder. I put my electric seat into turbo gear, preparing my curse filled rant for the poor bastard who knocked on Albert Worthwits door. I hoped it was that smug, plastic haired, "Chet Masterson" from Channel 5. Last time I mistakenly gave him the time of day he kicked Old Tabby. 

Upon reaching the door my mind drew blank for a moment before being kicked back into gear by yet another bang. My brain was still foggy I guess, not as foggy as when I was 110, but close.  

Peeking out the hole in the door I saw what I assumed I would. Another set of cameras, another crew, another impatient newscaster feeling more than entitled to my existence. This time a tall woman in a grey suit. Fifty years younger and maybe I'd have a shot, too bad in fifty I'd be forty and she'd have a foot in the grave. 

I opened the door quickly, to the surprise of literally everyone outside. The camera man quickly fumbled up to a series of knobs to catch me in focus. Since the first story ran of the, "Oldest man in the world looking younger by the day", I tried my best to avoid these things. 

"Heya. What do ya want then?" I spoke with the confidence of a 130 year old in a 90 year olds body, which I was. 

"I uh. Kathy Harveston here with the oldest man the world has ever seen. The "Miracle Man" as he's been dubbed. Tell us...sir, how do you feel?" she kept a cheesy smile plastered across her face throughout her speech. 

By now a small crowd had gathered round to gawk at both the news casters in the yard and me, I guessed. "I feel like ya only called me sir because ya forgot my name. But thats ok." 

"One-hundred thirty four and full of jokes, what a lively spirit! Tell us, what's your secret." It wasn't the first time I'd been asked, but it was the first that I'd considered answering. It was all anyone truly wanted to know of me. How I had lived, died, then lived again, only younger now. Why the clock ticked in reverse for Albert Worthwits. What I saw in the black. So, I told them. 

"Ah, well. I made a deal with someome- something. And here I am." as I thought of its shape I could feel its strings tug at the back of my neck. Kathy chuckled nervously. 

"A..a deal? Like you have a deal with God? Well thats wonde-" 

"A deal with a god. Not the God. I told him I wanted to go back. Didn't think he'd take it so literal ya know?" I could see the crowd grow awkward. Senile, I assumed they thought of me, but my old mind was sharper than any of theirs. I could feel something growing in the pit of my stomach. 

"What do you mean?" 

The black, goopy vomit came up from my mouth to shocked yells from the crowd; then stained the concrete below in inky darkness. "Ick, ugh. Never get used to that, sorry. Anyways I just hope you all get the choice I did when you kick the bucket. Hey, choose wisely!" and with a wink my interview was over. Hopefully after that display they all would be. If not I'd take fear as a deterrent instead. 

Upon re-entering my home a twisted face stared to me from a corner, a friend now, older than time. An Eldritch horror that knew all. Thane, he told me to call him. With a voice like pure slime he spoke in odd sounds that eventually became English. "How'd it go out there?" 

"Could've been worse, doesn't matter in the long run I guess."

*I will outlive them all anyways*
