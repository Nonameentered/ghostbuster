Above an angel stood. His eyes poked out from just behind the podium that appeared more as a personal shielding than a place of authority. In front of him, in front of me, was a long queue of various bodies, each seeming dressed far too casual for the heaven around. I looked down to my own clothes to verify: a Van Halen shirt and ripped jeans. Yeah, far too casual. 

Despite the lines length it seemed to be running smoothly, with most being quickly admitted to the large silvery gates behind the angel-bouncer. If they weren't then the cloud floor beneath them would drop out in a way that reminded me of old Acme cartoons, all that was missing was a sign in hand that read *Oops*. 

After what felt like only a few short monents there was only one in front of me. Him and the angel were laughing about something I hadn't managed to catch, and with the demeanor I figured he surely would make it beyond the gates. But to my surprise the large angelic mans laughter faded out and his tone went dark: "Ahhh that was a good one...anyways Sorry. You didn't qualify." and with that the man was sent down through the floor. 

"Next! A Mr...Graylon?" the winged man checked an oddly human clipboard. 

"Ah yes. That would be me. How's it going?" As the words left my mouth they felt dumb, but I didnt know what else to say.

"Can't complain, can't complain. So here's the deal, you don't qualify for heaven-" 

"Wait! I don't want to go down there, I'll do anything!" I braced myself for the fall. For the clouds to part and send me to a beyond in the deepest pit if earth, but no such thing occured. Instead the angel laughed, "*Haha!* Slow your roll there buddy I'm not sending you down. What I wanted to say was that unfortunately you do not qualify for eternal salvation in our wing." his tone reminded me of a car salesman telling me he couldn't manage a lower APR rather than a god speaking to a man. 

"But what I've done is compiled a list of other heavens, hells and limbos you are eligible for. Of course, you could always try your luck with the wheel of reincarnation." At his command a large colorful wheel appeared, complete with flashing lights and about a trillion options listed in small slivers. Behind me I heard a few voices chant *ooo the wheel! Pick the wheel!* 

"How long do I have to think about it?" I spoke up to the angel. 

"Oh well as long as you need! You'll just head to limbo and when you're ready I'll send you back up into the line." 

I turned my head to weigh the options. Behind me the line seemed to have grown to infinite proportions, stretching on beyond the clouds in an impressive display of obedience. A few of the chants continued: *the wheel! pick the wheel!* 

"I uhh. I think I'll take the wheel." I eyed the closest slivers to me. In blocky letters they read: *Blue whale*, *Mantis Shrimp*, *House Fly*, not a list of my first picks, but it could be worse I guess. Hopefully if I hated it I could just die fast and come back. 

The angel stepped down from his podium onto cloud-covered stairs. With each step his movement boomed through the infinite space until he reached the wheel, then he placed a massive hand atop it. "Alright Graylon. Ready for round two?" 

I shook my head in approval, then the wheel was flung at warp speed, blending the colored slivers together in one big blur. As they slowed I tried to track my fate *Dung beetle* *Luna Moth* *Centipede* ,ew, not that one *Orangutan* *Sasquatch*, wait really? Finally it came to a slow. A few voices yelled out their guesses from behind until it finally landed: Giant Tortoise. 

"Ah...well it wasn't my first pick but-"before I could finish the angel yelled. 

"Round 537 here you come! Good luck with reincarnation! See you again soon!"

And I was back on earth once again.
