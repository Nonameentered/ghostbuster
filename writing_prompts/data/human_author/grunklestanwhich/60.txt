There was a silence that hung in the air, the kind when two long friends run out of things to say to one another. Not an awkward silence, but rather one that assumes that it will be broken at any moment. And it was. A voice rang out into the darkness inside of my mind. I could hear it, feel it, not quite see it, but I searched through memories and thoughts to locate it. 

"You...are different. A black door guards your mind." it pondered. 

I don't know when it started for sure, maybe last week at that Mexican spot on 49th. I thought that burrito tasted a little "mind-invadey", but it was too good to pass up. Maybe in the cilantro? I always order it without, damn my forgetfulness.

 The voice rung out again, this time speaking to me rather than itself. "So tell me human, how are you doing this?" Its voice echoed in my head somewhere between a childhood memory of me falling off a swing and getting yelled at by a lady in the convenience store for knocking over a display. 

"But the door. I can navigate it. I can..." the parasites voice rang out once again in my head before cutting itself short. I laid in bed my eyes wide, then tried to respond by speaking into the darkness. "Still there? Or did you get got?" 

Silence. My head was still once again, and felt alone. In bed I scrolled through my thoughts, placing some aside and trying my best to look deeply at others. No abnormalities. No parasites or bugs to speak of. But it was still there. Somewhere. I could feel the itch of it within my brain. 

Finally after a few more moments of my search I found it. Not that I didn't already know where to look. A little beasty, more of a concept or a thought really, kneeling before that massive black door in my head. Around him was a vast black expanse, and if the parasite had moved he'd seen that the door expands on forever within the space. At the foot of the door piles upon piles of parasites, abominations, and other bottom-feedihg creatures lied dead in a massive heap of tangled limbs. The newest member of the collection did not pay them any mind, instead he just stated at the door. 

It looked up with multitudes of weary eyes. The vine-like tentacles drifting down its head seems shocked into a stunned state, appearing more wood than appendage. It spoke: "B-b-but. I saw your memories. I was in them! No, what are you?!" 

I almost laughed, but held off in fear of waking the upstairs neighbor. She, Ms. Frunbee, really had it out for me. 

"Me? I am a man. A man who has survived countless of you. Who has learned that sharing your mind may be as simple as making it all up. Won't be able to tell the difference anyway would ya?". 

At this the parasite stayed kneeling, then bowed even more in defeat. "Can you show me?" 

"No. I think I'll get some sleep. Do the same." I replied.
