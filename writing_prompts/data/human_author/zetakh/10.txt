# No Man's Land

I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking. There is a ringing in my ears and something wet on my neck, but I don’t know what that signifies. Everything that has happened to me has been amazing and surprising, that I know. But the details elude me as I stumble forward, my vision hazy, my steps slow and laborious.

The regiment. I have to get back to my regiment.

I look around, trying to orient myself before I resume my sojourn. The shadows are long in the light of dawn, distorted shapes reaching across the pocked soil like hungry ghasts. I let them guide me and follow their pointing fingers as I shamble onward, my steps heavy, my breath laboured.

Why am I so tired?

My hand flexes involuntarily, as if grasping for something. When I look at it, I see the fingers move, searching and flexing beneath the red, sticky sheen they are covered with.

I feel goosebumps tingle on my skin, that colour filling me with dread, though I don’t know why. I hide the tainted hand in my pocket and pick up the pace, vainly begging to leave the sudden fear behind. 

My ears are still ringing.

I half-slide, half-fall into a muddy hollow, slick and cold. My limbs ache as I drag myself back out, my breath heaving with effort. I shudder, the dull numbness I felt earlier replaced by biting, creeping chill.

My mouth tastes of copper.

As I push myself back to my feet with aching slowness, I see a hand reaching up from the mud, catching the low sun. The ghastly sundial points me forward, pale fingers and warped shadow my guide.

Whoever he was, the man in the mud, he was homesick for anywhere but here.

I see more men reach up from the mud, arms outstretched, pale faces staring blankly at me. They leer with bony grins, eyeless looks and grasping hands inviting me to join them.

They are all wearing my regiment’s insignia.

I shake my head, and walk on, denying their invitation, forsaking their companionship. I hear them whispering through the ringing of my ears, and close my eyes. They speak of home, of rest, of warmth. All I have to do is stop.

I am so tired.

I climb another mud-soaked hill, my arms cramping with cold. The ground quakes rhythmically and I hear drums, far in the distance, as shining lights blossom on the horizon, one after another.

Something drips from my forehead into my eye, painting the world red.

I hear a shout and see shapes move in front of me. Unfamiliar ghosts in grey cloaks, their faces skeletal and pale. They murmured words I couldn’t understand, their arms pointing at the ground.

My red hand twitches free of my pocket.

Lights blossom in my vision.

Something tears into my torso, my arms, my legs.

I hear the whispers behind me. I feel cold hands grip my feet, my legs. Feel them tug me down to join them. I let go as the numbness and cold seeps from my body, the warmth of a cosy fire caressing my back.

My knees hit the mud.

Then I turned away from the flashing red lights and hurried to my house.
