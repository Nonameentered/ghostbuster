Rory stood before the huge, gilded altar, his eyes wide with wonder as he looked around at the splendour of the Shrine.

Every wall was covered by tapestries, ancient depictions of the Oracle as they chose those who would stand against the Darkness through the ages.The scent of lavender incense was thick in the air, disciples standing at attention along the walls with lit sticks held high.

The Oracle themselves had yet to show themselves, however. Rory looked to the hooded figure on his right and tugged their sleeve.

The dark hood turned towards him. “Yes, Chosen One?”

“Where’s the Oracle?”

“They are preparing for the ceremony, Chosen One. They shall be here soon, do not fret. Prophecy is not to be rushed, after all.”

“I suppose,” Rory murmured, but his heart was racing with excitement. He was the Chosen One! He was gonna learn how to fight, have adventures, save the *world!* No more school for him!

The huge doors on the far side of the altar thrummed with a heavy knock. The two guards that flanked it stiffened and turned, grasping the large handles and straining against the weight. The hooded figures beside him dropped to their knees in supplication, murmuring something under their breath.

The great doors creaked open and brilliant light spilled out, forcing Rory to squint against the sudden glare. When his vision cleared, a form stood behind the altar before him, hooded and cloaked much like the disciples – only their garments were brilliant white instead of the pure black of their servants.

“Young Rory,” the Oracle said, their voice reverberating through the hall. “Chosen One, Child of Prophecy, Servant of Fate. Are you ready to receive your blessing and begin your journey?”

Rory’s heart hammered in his chest as he drew himself up. “Yes, I–”

His next words were drowned out by the shockingly loud roar of a car engine. He flinched and ducked, sitting down on the floor near the altar.

Then all hell broke loose.

The main doors of the hall were smashed flat as an SUV came charging straight through them, disciples scattering wildly before the roaring machine. It spun, flinging pews and candle-sticks before it like they were matchsticks before it came to a stop beneath the altar steps.

“Who dares?” The Oracle demanded. “This vexing interruption shan’t be tolerated!”

“Do I look like I give a damn what you tolerate!?”

Rory blinked, staring at the suddenly familiar SUV with shock. “Mom?”

A tall blonde stepped out of the driver-side door, a bulging duffel bag dragged along behind her. She glared up at the Oracle, before turning her eyes to Rory.

Her gaze softened. “Good, you’re safe. Come here, Rory, we’re going home. You’ve got homework.”

“But mom!” Rory protested. “I’m the Chosen One! I’m going to go on adventures, see the world, and–”

“You will do *no* such thing, kiddo! I am not young enough to know everything, but I’ve been in your shoes! No son of mine is going to go haring off on mad quests and neglect their schoolwork and future!”

“But *mom!*”

“Don’t you *but mom* me, young man! Get down here and get in the car, that’s final!”

“Hold, Maria, defyer of Prophecy! I, the Oracle, have chosen Rory to be my fated Chosen. You may not intervene!”

Maria spat. “Look, Oracle, I tolerated your flirting when it was just spam mail. But when your goons showed up at Rory’s school to string him along, I finally reached the point where I knew I had to become involved or shut up. Well, I’m involved! You’re not getting my boy.”

“You will not stop us. Disciples, remove her! The ceremony must continue!”

A half-dozen cloaked figures moved in on Maria, hands reaching. She reached into the duffel bag and came up with a baseball bat, swinging it roundhouse with one hand to clock one of the figures in the side of their shrouded head.

Her other hand held an uzi.

The rattle of gunfire from the little machine gun was deafening as Maria fired over the disciples’ heads. They scattered, throwing themselves to the floor. The Oracle yelped and flung themselves down behind the altar, bullets taking chunks of marble and gold out of it as they ricocheted around the hall.

Rory stared at his mother as she flung the uzi away and reached into the duffel again, her hand emerging with a pump-action shotgun.

*Chu-chick.*

“Alright!” Maria yelled. “I foresee an extra-large helping of whup-ass coming up! Any Chosen Ones who want to fulfil that prophecy, step right up!”

No-one moved.

“That’s what I thought.” She turned her attention to her son. “Come on now, sweetie. You’re destined to defeat a terrible darkness at home tonight!”

Rory blinked. “I am?”

Maria grinned. “Yep! Homework!”
