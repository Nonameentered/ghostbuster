Oh, this was a fun one! I loved the escalation as the story progressed! The chair especially was a very fun image, and set the expectations of things going very wrong for our poor portal traveller!

Solid cliffhanger to end on, too! The conversation with the cops can't possibly be a fun one when it happens :D

Thanks for writing!
