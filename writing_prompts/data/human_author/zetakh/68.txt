Jaques looked out over the sea anxiously as the wind picked up, throwing frothing waves onto the coarse sand of the shore. The waves had rapidly grown higher as the day passed into the afternoon, dark clouds gathering on the horizon. Most of the village was hurrying to drag their small fishing boats and nets up into the village proper, laboriously hauling them up the steep, tide-battered slope and onto the safety of the grassy hills.

Not him, however. Jaques was on guard duty. These were perilous waters these days – there had been rumours that monsters had come from the sea to scour entire villages, leaving nary a trace but smashed buildings and scorched fields behind.

He lifted his gaze from the brief look he’d spared for the preparations on the shoreline and resumed his vigil. The sea was still a roiling, dark expanse beneath the rapidly darkening sky, empty but for the spray of the breaking waves–

Until he saw something catch the few rays of sunlight that were still left, reflecting like the finest silver cross he’d seen in their small church. Jaques frowned, leaning forward as he strained to see.

The thing crested a wave and revealed itself clearly, making his blood run cold.

He leapt to his feet and charged down the hillside towards the shore, waving his arms wildly for attention.

“Serpent!” he yelled. “Sea serpent! Get away from the shore!”

People froze as they heard his frantic yelling, turning to look before dropping whatever they held and fleeing for the safety of the higher ground. The serpent was coming on fast, its sinuous body leaping effortlessly over the waves. The long, glimmering sails along its back, tipped with sharp spines waved as it came on, twisting with the wind.

Jaques slowed to a stop at the path from the shore, chivvying the stragglers along even as the serpent’s great head rose from the water to look at the fleeing villagers. It was smooth and pointed, covered with dark blue scales along its face fading to lighter grey under its throat. Wickedly sharp fangs protruded from its upper jaw, as long as a sword and twice as deadly. Its huge yellow eyes blinked once, then it breathed in deeply and roared as it charged towards the shoreline.

And to Jaques’s shock, a score of voices answered.

As the serpent threw itself onto land, its webbed claws digging into the sand as it dragged itself further up the shore, men leapt from what looked like a keel-less boat lashed to the serpent’s back. It was secured snugly between the two great sails, sheltered both from Jaques’s view and the spray of the waves. Now they lined up upon the sand, in no apparent hurry, armoured head-to-toe in iron and gambeson, round shields held ready, swords and axes at their hips.

Jaques wanted to run – but such was his disbelief that he just stood there, staring, as the warriors began marching up the small path towards the village.

One man, long, fair hair poking out from beneath his helmet in intricate braids, his beard also braided and adorned with shining beads of silver, was in the lead. He paused a few paces away from Jaques and nodded cheerily, an easy grin on his face, before saying a few words Jaques couldn’t understand.

“I– I am sorry. I cannot understand you.”

The man grunted, then turned back towards the sea serpent. The beast had dragged most of its bulk onto land and was now standing on four powerful legs as it nosed through the few remnants of fishing nets still left upon the shore.

The man raised his fingers to his lips and blew a sharp, loud whistle. Instantly, the serpent perked up to look at him, before speaking in what sounded like the man’s own tongue. A few more words were exchanged as the man waved a hand in Jacques’ direction and in the direction of the village.

The serpent snorted and bobbed its head, closing the distance in a few short strides to peer down at them. The terror Jaques felt as the massive monster bent towards him *finally* broke through his paralysis. He yelped, turned to run–

Right into the arms of two more of the warriors, who had stepped behind him as he stood transfixed. They caught him by the arms and promptly turned him back around, their iron grips and warning looks brooking no argument. They held him fast as he squirmed and whimpered, the sea serpent’s massive head peering at him.

“Erik Ulvsson wishes that I convey his intentions to you, little man,” it said.

Jaques blinked, too stunned by being thus addressed to still be terrified. “You–” he croaked, “You speak our language?”

“That I do. Now, we wish no bloodshed upon your fine community. Tell your friends and family that no harm will come to them or their homes, so long as they do as Erik Ulvsson commands.”

“And what is it you want from us?”

“We shall take from you enough foodstuffs to restore our supplies, and we shall take your silver and gold from your treasure hall. Once we are satisfied, we shall once again leave you in peace.”

Jaques frowned. “Our treasure hall?”

The serpent bobbed its head. “That tall stone building in the centre of your village. We know it holds significance, and often great treasure.”

Realisation came. *’He means our church.’*

“And what if we refuse?” Jaques asked aloud.

The serpent snorted, smoke hissing from its nostrils. “If you refuse, little man…” It straightened, took a deep breath, and *roared*.

Flames leapt from its open maw, pouring out onto the grassy hill in a torrent so hot it was painful upon Jaques’s skin. The entire hillside caught in an instant, the lush green grass turning to ash in mere moments.

Even the assembled warriors shied away, raising their arms to shield their faces during the display. Only their leader, Erik, stood stoic and unaffected, his grin never wavering.

The serpent turned back towards Jaques and again lowered its head to speak. “If you refuse, then you regrettably force us to burn down your homes, feast upon your livestock, and destroy your treasure hall. And I…” it leaned closer still, so close that Jaques could see his own reflection in the monster’s eyes, the slit pupils fixed upon him.

“And I,” it repeated, “Will feast very well indeed, on flesh and bone.”
