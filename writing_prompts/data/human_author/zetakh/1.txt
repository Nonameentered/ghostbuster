# Cherry Pie

“John? John Doe?”

John looks up from his newspaper, a faint smile on his face. “Yes?”

“I’m Jane.”

John lets his eyes wander over her, taking in the sight of her dark, floral dress. Crimson roses on black, a striking outfit for a simple coffee date – but just the one he had been told to expect.

He folds the paper neatly before standing. “So you are! Here, let me get that.” He neatly steps around his table and pulls the unoccupied chair out for her. “Please, allow me.”

“Such a gentleman,” Jane remarks, her eyes twinkling as she sits. “Thank you, John.”

As he pushes her chair in for her, his eyes wander over the curve of her neck and the smooth ridges of her shoulder blades, her deep-cut dress leaving little to his imagination. “My pleasure, Jane. Shall I order something for you, while I’m still standing?”

“That would be lovely – a flat white and that scrumptious-looking cherry pie, if you would.”

“Certainly.”

He feels her eyes on him as he turns away, a subtle itch along his spine that doesn’t fade as he orders and waits by the counter for their coffee to materialise.

She is still watching him as he turns back towards the table, a tray in his hands and the pleasant aroma of fresh coffee and sweet pie tickling his nostrils.

“Mm,” Jane hums appreciatively as he sets the tray down. “That smells positively *heavenly.*”

“Indeed,” John agrees as he sits down and sips his coffee. “Ah, lovely. How is your pie, my dear?”

“Let’s find out.” 

He watches as her fork stabs through the crisp crust and pierces the steaming filling beneath, a fragrant red river gushing from the cracked pie and onto the plate. She eats it with relish, humming with delight as a small drop of red juices escapes out of the corner of her mouth.

“Here, let me.”

John carefully dabs the offending stain away with his pocket square, the pure white cloth greedily absorbing the crimson juice. She gives him a smile that sends a shiver down his spine and lights a fire in his chest. A mad impulse takes him and he leans closer, his mind briefly seizing on the image of a male spider courting its lethal, hungry female.

*We all go a little mad sometimes.*

Her lips are supple and eager, tasting of cherry and lip gloss. As they part again, she spears another morsel of cherry pie upon her fork and raises it to his mouth.

“Would you like another taste, John?”

“I fear it shan’t compare,” he answers, “but it would be churlish to refuse a second helping.”

“Your truths are worse than your lies,” she says as she slips the pie past his lips. “You charming snake.”

The pie is warm and sweet, the cherry filling sticky and fragrant on his tongue. He nods with appreciation as he chews, his eyes still locked with hers as he swallows.

“They say the way to a man’s heart goes through his stomach,” John says. “I fear it has worked.”

Her only response is laughter, so rich and clear that it takes his breath away. With a pointed smile, she drains her coffee and reaches for his hand.

John needs no further urging. He rises with her and they walk, hand-in-hand, out through the door and into the darkening city, the half-eaten slice of pie left in its tiny pool of sweet cherry juice.

The evening is warm and clear, the streets alive with the first stirrings of the late-night crowd. John and Jane glide through eager club-goers and evening strollers like ghosts, drifting from one shadow to the next.

“Come,” John whispers, pulling Jane towards a shadowed alleyway, “there is a shortcut. My car isn’t far.”

“Lead on, John,” she murmurs back, laying an arm around his waist and leaning closer.

As they pass beyond the streetlights and into the darkness, John’s heart beats faster. Anticipation sends electricity through his very being, his free hand twitching within his jacket pocket.

Fingers running over the handle of the switchblade within.

He stops her beneath the one working light in the alleyway and presses her against a wall, her gasp as her back hits the bricks sending a shock of excitement through him. His knuckles are white around the knife in his pocket.

He leans down to kiss her.

She tilts her head up to meet him.

The blade *clicks* free in his hand. He drives it towards her side–

And feels it slip from his fingers, his hand going numb.

*Quite the jargogle.*

“The way to a man’s heart goes through his stomach,” Jane breathes, stroking his cheek.

Something cold twists between his ribs. His breath rattles wetly.

“But I go through the rib cage.”
