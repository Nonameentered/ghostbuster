# The Caretaker's Journal

## Part One of Two

**Monday, March Seventh, 1864**

Today marks the beginning of my new employment at the Drake Estate. My employer, the reclusive Lady Minerva Drake, has tasked me with the maintenance of the estate grounds. I have yet to meet her Ladyship in person, however, my contract having been outlined entirely by letter. Our correspondence regarding my new duties was brief and markedly nonspecific, giving me more or less free reign of the grounds and house, allowing me to outline my schedule as I see fit.

As it is yet winter and there is little in the gardens to attend to, I shall begin by familiarising myself with the grounds and what tools are at my disposal.

**P.S.** The accommodations are serviceable - a small room in the servant’s annex, well-kept and furnished with a proper bed, a washbasin and a small writing desk. My travel chest fits a little snugly at the foot of the bed, but I am comfortable enough. It is certainly more spacious than Navy quarters.

My initial survey of the estate leaves much to be desired. An old shed proved to be a storeroom for tools, though these were old and neglected. I spent several early hours on Tuesday scrubbing the rust from metal and mending rotten handles. Some things proved beyond saving, however. I inquired with her Ladyship’s seneschal, a decrepit old man named George, about the possibility of having them replaced, but was left discouraged. Suffice to say, any replacement tools will have to come out of my own pay as things stand.

The state of the estate itself left rather a dire picture, as well. Overgrown tangles of rose bushes, hedgerows that show no signs of having been trimmed within the past several years or more, numerous browned weeds in the footpaths. I shall have much to do come spring and the thaw.

For now, I believe I shall focus my attention on the frankly monstrous growth of roses that plague the back wall of the house. I cannot fathom how long they have been left to their own devices, but they will like as not burrow straight through the brickwork if I do not tame them.

**Saturday, March Twelfth, 1864**

My initial assault upon the blighted thorns met with stiff resistance. My coat and hands are bloodied and torn, and the old hedge trimmers I employed have cut their last branch.

Tomorrow is the Sabbath – I shall recover and formulate a proper plan of attack.

**Monday, March Fourteenth, 1864**

The Bosun would have had me flogged had he seen me, but my old ship’s cutlass did the job better than any of the proper tools at my disposal. The worst of the brambles have been cut back and consigned to the tinder stores in the stable loft. I shall cut the rest into some sort of order come the morrow.

Of note was what the overgrowth hid behind its tangled stems – a conservatory, forgotten and neglected much like the rest of the garden. This was not mentioned during my correspondence with her Ladyship, but attending to it during the winter months feels a worthy endeavour. I shall finish the trimming of the rose bushes and then begin, though it seems I shall have to limit my work to the exterior for the time being. I haven’t found any door inside the home itself that enters into the conservatory and the servant girl I asked just stared blankly at my question.

At the very least I can make the windows and metalwork somewhat presentable to whomsoever admires the now subdued rose bushes.

**Tuesday, March Fifteenth, 1864**

I have begun tending to the conservatory’s exterior. It is a terrible shame for it to have been hidden behind so much overgrowth. The design and quality of the craft upon it truly is remarkable, the white-painted metal wrought like fine vines and etched with leaves so intricate it almost feels alive. The glass is also of fine quality, though murky with dirt and somewhat scratched by the shifting of the thorny rose stems. I believe I shall be able to restore much of its former lustre over the next few weeks, however.

**Friday, April First, 1864**

I have cleaned the windows and polished the metalwork. It is already a remarkable transformation, the spring sunlight catching upon the glass and fine metal and lighting up this corner of the garden wonderfully. All that remains is a fresh coat of paint. The old layer has begun to flake and chip in places, exposing the iron beneath to the elements. I shall make it a priority come summer and more stable weather.

I also found a door. The conservatory was seemingly connected to the garden proper in the past, but the path has been removed and the roses allowed to reclaim the entrance. It did not appear to be locked, but the mechanism seems rusted. I shall endeavour to clear the path and restore the lock to working order.

**Monday, April Fourth, 1864**

I fear I was careless and the lock shall have to be replaced entirely.

&#x200B;

**Friday, April Eighth, 1864**

The door has been repaired and I have explored the conservatory’s interior.

It was remarkable indeed. Though the planters lay fallow and cold, they were just as lovingly crafted as the conservatory proper. Planting boxes made to mimic grasping plants, hanging pots lined with leafy filigree. I can scarcely imagine the expense and effort required.

Most impressive of all was the centrepiece – a hollow tree of iron, its interior fashioned into a hidden gazebo of sorts, with a low bench around its circumference and thin rays of light trickling through the gaps in the forged “bark” of the trunk. Several planters and curiously constructed birdhouses hung from its branches, long abandoned.

There is work to be done.
