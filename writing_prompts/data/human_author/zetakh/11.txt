Thank you so much for the kind words, and the award! I'm very happy to hear I found a spin on things that was interesting, and leaning into the news coverage was a fun challenge! Adding Kelly's little personal crisis on top for the personal element felt like a fun way to get some stakes in there, even though it was mostly a background element :D
