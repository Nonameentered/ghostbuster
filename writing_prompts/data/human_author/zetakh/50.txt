# Sword and Harness

“I thank you, my dear friends, for your cooperation and valuable contribution to our livelihood! You have been most gracious hosts! I bid you farewell!”

Dread Rider Flynn bowed gallantly. Then he flung his sack of loot onto his shoulder, stepped over the airship’s railing and fell into the clouds below.

A large, scaled form swooped down with him, dropping from the airship’s keel where she had clung like a humongous reptilian bat. She caught him, gently tucking him against her warm chest as she levelled out.

Flynn clapped her chest affectionately. “A perfect catch as always, my dear!”

“Naturally,” the dragon answered. “Now get yourself latched to the harness and the loot into the belly netting, Flynn.”

“What’s the rush, Grace? We are safely away and I am tucked even more safely into your warm bosom. There is no place I would rather be!”

Grace snorted. “Except nestled within the bosoms of a bar-maid, I’ll wager.” She shifted and tucked him into the wide cargo net that hung beneath her stomach. “Enough snuggles, I need a Captain on my back, not a fop at my breast!”

“Yes dear,” Flynn laughed, expertly climbing through the net to secure their bounty. Then he made his way up the harness to Grace’s back, latching onto the straps at the base of her neck. 

He patted her warm hide with his hand. “Safe and secure, my dear! You may dance at leisure, I shan’t be thrown!”

With a pleased snort, Grace picked up speed and ascended. “Good. Homeward, then!”

They burst through the cloud cover and into the glorious sunlight, her dark scales gleaming. Flynn whooped as the entire sky opened up around them, thumping his dragon’s neck to urge her on.

He lived for these moments, this life. It was something only they could do – disappear into the wide sky, beholden to no-one –

*Roar!*

Grace squawked with alarm and snapped her wings wide, beating furiously backwards to halt her speed. Another dragon passed right in front of her, nearly raking her nose with his claws. 

Their attacker looped around and up in a spinning twirl to pass above them. Flynn saw three figures drop from the dragon’s back, latching onto Grace’s harness with their own carabiners as they drew swords and pistols. She shrieked with distress and bucked – but they had managed to latch on securely, though one lost his pistol as it was shaken from his grip. Grace roared as the enemy dragon came upon them again, breathing a cloud of flame into his face to warn him off.

*‘Adventure calls,’* Flynn thought grimly. 

He stood and drew his own pistols, then aimed and fired. One of the men bellowed and fell limp, the ball taking him in the chest. His companion swore and fired back. Flynn hissed as he felt the hot lead scorch his cheek, gritting his teeth as he fired with his left.

The man who’d shot at him yelped as the round tore through one of his harness straps, the sudden lack of anchor sending him tumbling off Grace’s side to dangle by his one remaining tether.

Flynn dropped his spent pistols and drew his sword to meet the third man.

Steel rang on steel. The boarder was a clear expert, heavier and stronger than Flynn. He forced Flynn back, pushing against the slack in his straps.

“I admit,” Flynn gasped, “You’re better than I.”

“Why thank you,” the man responded, with a grin. “You may still surrender, Captain.”

“Alas, I cannot. Grace would be beside herself if I were to fall into captivity.”

The attacker nodded. “Pity.” His next swing forced Flynn’s sword high to protect his face – then he ducked low and severed one of Flynn’s straps with a lightning-fast slash.

Flynn stumbled as the strap snapped, barely blocking a follow-up swing that would have taken his head off.

“Brilliant move,” he breathed. 

“Again, you may still surrender.”

“I would, good sir – except I know something you do not.”

“And that is?”

Flynn grinned. “I have a dragon, sir.”

The man blinked at him. “I am aware. We are in fact fighting on top of her.”

“Oh no, Grace has *me.* *I* have Gregory! *Behold!”*

Flynn threw his coat wide and reached inside, pulling his hand back out to reveal a tiny dragon clinging to his arm. It puffed up like a bellow and breathed a gout of flame at the boarder’s face.

He yelped and leapt back, stumbling in his straps.

Flynn threw himself at him, burying the tip of his sabre in the man’s shoulder.

His sword fell into the void as he clutched at the wound.

“And now, sir,” Flynn said. “It is *you* who may surrender – and tell your dragon to do the same.”
