# The House

The cold was what awoke it.

Its long-ago boarded-up doors were finally opened, cold winter air seeping in, stirring the old forgotten dust and cobwebs that was all the decoration left upon its interior. Sluggishly, painfully, awareness returned after years of neglect and loneliness.

The old house yawned, walls creaking with age as it flexed in the wind. Dimly, it felt the warmth of life walking through its halls again – the pressure of boots upon floors, a gloved hand upon walls. It was a bright explosion before a return to darkness, a brief dream within dreamless sleep.

Ageing shutters reopened, letting sunlight into the house’s slumbering halls.

Men came and began their work; light touches of broom and rag, removing the dirt and the dust, clearing away the remains of rats and sheds of spiders.

Then came the sting of tools, pain rousing the old house to wake.

Hammers and pliers, saws and pry bars. They dug into the house’s flesh, scraped away rotten timbers and crumbled stone, piling them high outside the house’s halls.

Whole rooms were removed, reshaped. Walls were torn down, floors torn up. The house’s bones creaked and groaned beneath its weight, flesh and tendon torn asunder. It's very heart exposed, its spine revealed – the sacred become secular, men moulding it to their new whims, their new excess.

Wind moaned through its bleeding wounds, speaking of its agony where it could not.

Where the men had taken, now they replaced. Fresh timber, supple and rich, unfamiliar to the house’s senses. Odd proportions and layouts, the new rooms open and airy, pastel-bright and strange. The house felt the light tickle of paintbrushes, the scratch of careful carving upon its new interiors.

Ever so slowly, it began to feel the warmth and care being lavished upon itself. It could taste the life seeping into its walls with each new leaf and flower carved and painted, each new touch upon its budding moulding. It revelled in its new gilding, cherished every drop of paint that left its ornamental touch upon its skin.

The house was well awake. It sang its joy and satisfaction with the spring winds, delighted by its new and extravagant form. It curved in upon itself, folded its rooms into pleasant vistas, its wood like a living forest. The house bloomed in pastel finery, its petals a lure for people finer still. Long robes and flowing gowns swept across the house’s floor, frills and lace brushing its walls and counters. They danced within its grand heart, dreamt within its mind, made love within its secret nooks and crannies.

The house was full of life, and well content.

Well-loved, and loving in return.
