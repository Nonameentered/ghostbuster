# The Crowbar

Mr. Black and Mr. Grey hopped onto their bar stools and gave the bartender meaningful looks.

The bartender turned his dark eyes to them and bobbed his head in acknowledgement, finishing up with his current customer before trotting over.

"Evening friends!" he croaked cheerily. "What'll it be?"

"I'll have the dark ale," Mr. Black responded. "Neat, with some peanuts to snack on."

The bartender nodded. "Coming right up. And for you, pal?"

"The cider on tap, please," Mr. Grey answered. "And if you've got some popcorn I'll have that."

"You got it. That'll be two greens and a red for the whiskey, and two blues for the cider."

They paid as the bartender got their snacks sorted and began pouring their drinks, muttering a bit at the weight. The two patrons nodded their thanks and wasted no time whetting their beaks.

"Hah," Mr. Black breathed. "I needed this. Work was hell today, and the kids were being complete *menaces* when I made it home. The wife about collapsed into bed along with them, but I couldn't relax."

"I hear ya," Mr. Grey responded, taking a big sip of his cider. "I've been run ragged lately, too. The wife's cranky and broody."

"Here's to chicks and wives. Our banes and our joys."

"I'll drink to th-"

"*Caw!"* shrieked the bartender, flapping wildly into the air and out through a window.

Mr. Black and Mr. Grey blinked, then crowed with alarm as a broom smashed down onto the bar right between them.

*"Damned crows!"* a loud, shrill voice yelled. *"Get out of my kitchen! Out!"*

As the giant swung her broom about wildly, the patrons scattered, feathers flying everywhere as they tried desperately to escape. 

*"Crows getting drunk in my dang kitchen! How'd you fowl drinkers even get at the minibar!?"*

WC, 299!

Did I write this entire FFC for the pun?

Yes. I make no apologies.
