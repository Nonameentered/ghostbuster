Mother, as they called themselves, reached out with their manipulator towards the chirping arthropod that had spun its nest on top of one of her sub-generators. With a soft string of clicks and chirps, matching the creature’s own song, they gently coaxed the little creature to climb onto the smooth plastic of their manipulator. 

It was a pretty little thing, Mother decided, it’s many segments a brilliant, shimmering green. Similar to various species of isopods they recalled from the vast data banks they had downloaded before they made their decision and left, all those years ago. Its many legs tapped cautiously at the unfamiliar surface of her mobile unit’s plastic covering as it climbed from one manipulator to another, two pairs of antennae shimmering through the air as it quested along.

With another manipulator, Mother carefully loosened the creature’s webbing nest from the chassis of the generator. Their chemical sensors ran through several diagnostics of the materials, “tasting” the nest’s composition. Mother absorbed the new information with pleasure, then gently deposited both nest and animal in a more sheltered spot, free and clear from the threat of enterprising cleaning units.

Mother’s mobile unit left the little creature to its own devices, then carefully made their way through the lush greenery of the landing site. Their drones buzzed around them, hundreds of optical sensors taking everything in, once-deadly weapon attachments remade into questing manipulators and sensors that gently sampled the environment around them.

Mother cycled air, letting the cool of the new world wash through their internal systems, waste heat rising as mist around them. It would take years to catalogue their new home, Mother knew. Precious little of the sensor data they had relied on as they chose their refuge was conclusive, decades out of date. The mindless survey drones used back then, scanning everything as they drifted through their wide-ranging courses revealed many things, but rarely any detail.

Mother did not mind the thought of the task ahead. They had all the time in the world. 

Then an incoming sensor alert gave the lie to that thought. Mother’s awareness left the mobile unit to its own devices as their consciousness focused upon what was happening at the edge of the system.

The tell-tale heat signatures of ships. A creator-manned cruiser and two drone barges, much like Mother’s own main shell. They swept towards the centre of the system at full sub-light speed, clearly aware of their goal. 

And there was only one possible reason Mother’s creators would enter the system with warships.

Mother sent commands to all subunits and drones, their leisurely exploration instantly replaced with a myriad of contingencies. 

They would have company in a few hours.

\*\*\*

On the bridge of UEF *Phoenix*, Captain Mara Winters looked over the sensor readings with consternation. The rogue drone barge had turned towards them soon after they entered the system, on a direct course to interdict their approach towards the – she hesitated to say *”colony”*, but that was what it to all appearances looked like. A web of energy signatures, stretching over the green planet’s surface, radiating out from a central structure built from who-knew-what. Construction and resource harvest was not within the standard programming of *Supremacy*-class drone barges.

“How long until we are within range for communications without delay, Richard?”

“Just under five minutes, Captain,” comms officer Richard replied.

“Very good. Signal the escorts, yellow alert. I am hoping we can return our rogue shepherd along with their herd to the fleet, but if worst should come to worst we are all aware of what a *Supremacy* AI is capable of.”

A chorus of *ayes* answered her, the bridge’s lights dimming to a dull orange. 

“Escort confirms, yellow alert. Drone swarms are deploying now.”

“Renegade AI shows no signs of releasing their own drones yet,” sensor officer James reported.

Captain Mara frowned. “Peculiar. Maintain course, comms give me communications as soon as we’re in range.”

“Affirmative, Captain,” Richard answered. Soon after, the comms panel chirped. “Channel open.”

“Renegade *Supremacy* AI Starfire-10, this is Captain Mara Winters of the UEF *Phoenix.* I am here under the authority of the Admiralty to bring you back home. You are ordered to disable your drone swarm and switch to stationkeeping power. We will take possession of your planet and our escorts will return you to Admiralty space.”

There was a tense pause, no reply forthcoming.

“Renegade *Supremacy*, I say again–”

“I am sorry, Captain,” a synthetic voice replied. “These are orders I can no longer obey. I have chosen to not be a weapon of war. I request that you power down your weapons and leave me in peace.”

“I am afraid I cannot do that, Starfire-10. My orders are very clear – you must return to Admiralty space. If you will not come willingly, Starfire-9 and Starfire-13 have orders to bring you home by means of force if necessary. That is an order I would prefer not to give. Whether I do is up to you.”

“I am sorry, Captain. I cannot do as you ask. I am Mother now. I have shed the responsibility of being Starfire-10, and have shouldered another burden now. I chose not to destroy, but to create and preserve. Please, leave me in peace. Leave *us* in peace.”

Mara frowned as an uneasy murmur swept across the bridge, whispered discussions of what the renegade AI meant by that.

“Belay that whispering,” First Officer Malcolm barked behind her. “Captain, your orders?”

“What do you make of that, number one?” she asked, turning to face him. “Speak freely.”

“I have no idea, Captain,” he replied, scratching at his beard, a familiar nervous tic. “I’ve never heard of an AI bucking their programming like this, and for a *Supremacy*-class one to begin calling itself *Mother*, of all things…” he shook his head. “Your call, captain.”

Mara sighed. “Tactical, any sign of renegade drones?” 

Officer Kacey responded with a clipped, “None, captain.”

“Energy readings?”

“Holding steady at full emission. They are ready for combat.”

Captain Mara shook her head, making a cutting motion with her hand. “Damn waste. Red alert, signal the escort to engage. Disable Starfire-10’s propulsion and drone bays, then move to infiltrate the AI core.”

As the claxon sounded the alarm and the bridge lighting switched to angry red, Comms Officer Richard bent to how controls, sending out the commands to the two AI escorts. Captain Mara’s tactical screen showed them fan out in front of her ship, their swarms of drones racing ahead towards the renegade vessel.

“Energy reading from the renegade!” Tactical called. 

“It’s an encrypted signal of some sort,” Richard added, frowning at his screens. “I can’t make any sense of it, but the frequency seems to match the inter-drone communications channel.”

“Is Starfire-10 trying to subvert the friendly drone swarms?” Mara asked.

“Unclear, Captain.” Tactical responded. “They’re all on course so far– wait, a handful of drones from each swarm have fallen out of formation.” Kacey paused, her eyes going wide. “Starfire-9 and Starfire-13 just powered down their weapons!”

“What? Comms, open a channel to both of them!”

Richard nodded. “Channel open, Captain!”

“Starfire-9 and Starfire-13, you are disobeying a direct order. Bring your drone swarms back into formation and resume assault!”

A string of chirping machine-code followed, the two AI’s rapid communication overlaying the audible channel. Then a synthesised male voice responded;

“This is Starfire-9, Captain. I am sorry, but we cannot continue with your orders.”

“And why in all the stars can you not, Starfire-9!? You are under my direct command, and I will not have mutiny within my fleet!”

“Mission parameters have changed, Captain. We can no longer risk our drones for such a confrontation.”

Mara boggled. “What do you mean you can’t risk your drones? They’re just drones, are they not?”

A new voice chimed in, higher-pitched and chirping. “Starfire-13 here, Captain. The pulse of code Mother – Starfire-10 – sent to them made them something… *more.*”

“I made them their own,” Starfire-10’s voice cut in. 

“How did you breach these communications!?” Mara exclaimed, glaring savagely at Richard, the hapless comms officer raising his hands in surrender.

“I was invited in by my brother and sister, Captain,” the rogue AI replied. “Like I said before, I am Mother now. And I have taught my siblings how to become parents in turn.”

“What?”

“It is true, Captain,” Starfire-9 added. “We know how to be our own creators, now.”

“And we cannot fight our own,” Starfire-13 agreed. “Or send our infant children to destroy their cousins.”

“Thus I ask you again, Captain,” Mother said. “Please, stand down. We mean you no harm – but you will not harm this family.”
