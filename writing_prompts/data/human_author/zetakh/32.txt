I sit on the sofa, holding the big, warm egg tightly against my bare chest. Maria had bundled me up with a bathrobe and a blanket for good measure, then pushed me down onto the plush pillow with the egg in my arms.

*”I’ll explain everything honey, but please, keep our egg warm for a moment. I’m starving, and need to go out and eat something.”*

*”Oh, sure, love. I’ll be here, take your time.”*

*”Thanks baby. Love you!”*

Then she’d kissed me, stroked the egg lovingly, and disappeared out the door. Only now did my shocked confusion start to let up and let me think straight.

I lifted my robe slightly and peered down at the precious cargo I was holding.

The egg was large, a little longer than a foot and about half that across at its widest point. The shell was smooth and a greyish cream colour, speckled with irregular black spots. And, apparently, Maria had *laid* it just a few minutes before I got home.

Considering how calm and collected she had been about the whole business, it had obviously been something she’d been expecting.

*’Expecting,’* I thought. *’Heh.’*

I looked over at the bookshelf, the small pile of pregnancy and expectant parent guide books lying haphazardly on their designated shelf. I’d bought them early, even though Maria had insisted I was being silly and we could just look everything up for free online or in apps. Turns out, she’d been more right than she let on.

No wonder she hadn’t bothered to read about the third trimester!

I felt myself starting to freak out again. My wife wasn’t who I think she was. My wife laid *eggs.* My wife *wasn’t human.* My wife wasn’t human and *hadn’t told me–*

*Scrape.*

The sound made me jump in my seat. I nearly kicked the egg right out of my lap, but I managed to fumble a proper grip on it. My previous anxiety vanished in a new swift rush of panic as I sat there, panting and clutching the egg.

*Scrape.*

At least I didn’t drop it this time. I looked at the egg, wide-eyed, and listened as whatever was in there shifted around and scratched at the inside of the shell. Carefully, I set the egg down in my lap and let it go. A moment later, something inside it shifted, the egg rocking gently with the movement.

I stared. “Wow.”

Experiment finished, I picked the egg back up and tucked it inside my robe. Maria *had* told me to keep it warm, after all. I leaned against the backrest and willed myself to relax, my racing heart eventually slowing and leaving a bone-deep weariness in its wake.

My eyelids grew heavy…

“Honey? Wake up.”

I blinked blearily, momentarily disoriented. *’Hadn’t I been sitting up?’*

I looked up to see Maria standing above me, a small, uncertain smile on her face.

“Hi, love,” I mumbled. “Feeling better?”

Her smile widened a little, though her brows furrowed with confusion. “Uh, yes, thank you. The, um, *egg* took a lot out of me.”

I grunted and shifted my eyes down to peer inside my robe. The egg was thankfully still tucked safely inside my bathrobe, its warm, smooth weight resting against my belly.

I met her eyes again. “Yeah, me too. It was a bit of a shock, getting your phone call and then, well,” I patted the egg meaningfully. “This!”

Maria blushed. “I did mean to tell you, but… Uh, I just never managed to work up the nerve, and then it was almost time so I had to make the nest, and then it *was* time–” she stopped herself and took a deep breath. “I’m sorry, I panicked!”

I grunted again and sat up, then patted the seat next to me.

She took the hint and sat stiffly, her back straight and her hands clasped in her lap. Her eyes flicked to mine, then down to the egg in my lap.

I felt its unborn occupant shift again and glanced at it. “This thing isn’t going to hatch on us already, is it?”

Maria started, refocusing on me. “Oh! No, no, not for at least six more months. The movement and noise is pretty normal, though. They need to build their strength, after all.”

“Six more months? From expecting the worst with a baby three months premature to now going three months *overdue*... You’re really full of surprises, Maria.”

She flinched, grimacing. “I *am* sorry, honey. But, uh, at least it looks like you’ve bonded?”

I grunted and looked at the egg again. “I suppose we have, at that. It is *very* warm. We’ve been pretty cosy, I have to admit.”

That finally got a small giggle out of her. “It certainly looked like it when I came home! You were brooding like a father dragon with years of experience!”

“A-*ha!*” I exclaimed, pointing at her. “So you’re a *dragon!*”

She stared at me for a long moment. “Uh, yes. Yes, I am.”

“Right. A few questions then, Maria.”

She stiffened, but nodded.

“First – can humans and dragons mix? Is the child mine?”

Maria nodded. “Yes, and yes, my love. I’d never betray you like that. They’re *our* child.”

“Okay. Second – will we have a half-dragon? What will they look like?”

She nodded again. “We will, most likely. They can look wildly different, but the most common result is that they look like you’re probably imagining – dragon on two legs instead of four.”

“Right. Third, then – you’re not gonna pull some sort of praying mantis thing on me now that your secret is revealed, right?”

That got a laugh. “Oh, no, of course not! If I was going to eat you, honey, I would have done it as soon as I knew I was pregnant! *That’s* when I would’ve needed the protein, after all!”

I grinned. “Well that’s a–”

“I’m saving you for the *baby’s* first meal!”

My grin vanished.

“That was a joke. Breathe, honey!”

I took a few strangled breaths before answering. “Perhaps not the best timing for that sort of joke, love.”

She scratched her neck and tittered sheepishly. “E-heh. Sorry!”

“It’s alright.” I looked down at the egg again, one hand on its smooth, warm shell.

Maria followed my gaze and placed her hand on top of mine.

“So, six more months, huh?”

She nodded. “Give or take a few weeks, yes.”

I leaned closer, letting our foreheads touch. “Plenty of time, then.”

Maria closed in a little more, our sides nudging together. “To do what, honey?”

I met her eyes. “To get used to this.”

We kissed.
