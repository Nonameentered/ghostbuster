**Part Two of Two**

“Babe! Babe, are you in there?”

I perk up at the noise, sniffing. The voice and scent is familiar. I uncoil from atop my hoard, my treasure shifting pleasantly against my hide. My tongue flicks out, tasting the air. I know this intruder, though I’m not sure from where. Carefully, I creep forward, my eyes casting about warily in the gloom of my home.

The man that stands in the doorway takes a step back as he sees me. I stop, watching and smelling, waiting to see what he’ll do.

“Babe? Martin, love, it’s me, Dave. You okay? Can I come in?”

I tilt my head. “Daaave?” I taste the word, uncertainly. It feels unfamiliar, but right, somehow.

“Yes! It’s me, Dave!” He takes a careful step forward, arms outstretched. “Is this okay? Can I come in?”

I sit on my haunches and bob my head. He closes the distance, reaching up towards my face with his hand. I sniff at him, then lick his fingers. I know this man, this *Dave.* He’s *my* Dave. “Mmmy Dave?”

“Yes, babe, it’s your Dave! I– whup!”

I grab him around the waist, mindful of my talons, and press him against my chest. Then I withdraw, carrying him back to my nest, a pleasant warmth bubbling in my chest.

We sit down together on top of my hoard. I lay a wing around his back and hold him close, relishing his solid warmth at my side. “Mmmy Dave.”

He makes a funny, rhythmic noise. It makes me happy. “Yes, your Dave. Nice little nest you have here, but a bit hard to sit on!”

I snort, and pick him up to set him on my foreleg. Then I lay my head in his lap and sigh with pleasure as he starts rubbing my head and neck.

“That’s it, hon, go to sleep. I’m here.”

I close my eyes.

When I wake up I’m in a hospital bed. Everything hurts and I’m *completely* exhausted. I blearily look around, and see Dave in a chair in the corner of the room, snoring like a sawmill. “Dave? Hun?”

He’s up and at my bedside so fast I could swear he teleported. “Hey, babe, you’re awake. Relax, you’re okay.”

“What happened? I dreamt I found you in some weird building and picked you up to keep you safe, but it’s all a blur…”

He grimaced. “Uh, yeah, about that. Do you remember your visit with the doctor?”

I blink. “Um. Yes? I got diagnosed with–”

“–*Lycanthropy Draconis.* Yep, were-dragon. Do you remember what happened next?”

I think for a moment, staring blankly at the wall. “Nope. Not until you showed up.”

“Right. Hang on.”

He fishes his phone out, opens Twitter, then hands it to me.

“The good news, babe, is that you’re famous. The bad news, well… Click any of those top trending hashtags there.”

I look at them.

*Book-Dragon Attack*

*Lego Wyrm*

*Board Game Hoarder*

*Gaydragon*

A very quick scroll tells me all I need to know. The videos would honestly be pretty damn cool – if they hadn’t showed me, bare-ass naked and covered in scales, claws, and wings, tearing apart my two favourite hangouts in the city.

I meet Dave’s eyes again. “I’m banned for life, aren’t I?”
