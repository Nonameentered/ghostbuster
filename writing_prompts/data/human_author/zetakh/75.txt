Doctor Harris’s office door burst open and crashed into the wall, so hard one of his trophies toppled. With a practised nonchalance he caught it with one hand and set it right, shooting a mildly reproachful look towards the door.

Director Caddy threw the door shut again behind her with equal force, shaking it in its frame. Harris couldn’t help but wince a little at the fresh hole in the drywall the doorknob had caused through her entrance.

Maintenance had only just gotten it fixed *yesterday.*

“Hi, boss. What’s got your rocs playing at being thunderbirds today?”

“You know damn well what I’m storming about!” Caddy yelled, stomping forward to loom over Harris’s desk. “Your frostbite patient from yesterday!”

“Ah! Yes, that was a fun one! I admit the treatment was a bit unorthodox, but–”

“Unorthodox? *Unorthodox!? You threw a* patient *into a* furnace!”

Harris leaned back in his chair, Caddy’s volume almost solid in its force.

“I’ve given you a lot of leeway with how you manage your patients, Harris, because while you’re the *loosest* cannon since Thor dropped Big Bertha from his chariot, you got results! Your patients had excellent rates of recovery, better numbers than anyone in the hospital! *Most* of them didn’t even try to sue afterwards! *Some* were even on speaking terms with you, though I can scarce believe that! But *this!?”*

“Well, boss, you see–”

Caddy’s fist crashed down on the desk, leaving a knuckle-shaped dent. “Not a damn word, Harris, or I’ll have you out through the damn window myself!”

Harris had seen her wrestle an agitated roc into taking its medicine. He wisely clammed up.

“This is what’s going to happen. You will submit yourself to an inquiry. You will admit *gross* malpractice, assault upon a patient, and I don’t know what else but I’ll think of something! If by some *miracle* you aren’t fired and thrown in prison, you will be on Emergency Room duty for the next *ten years*, with sole responsibility for maintaining the open-air grounds to a respectable level of patient and practitioner safety *in addition* to your other duties! Do I make myself clear!?”

Harris nodded, face blank.

“There. *Now* you may speak, but so help me if you try any of your cheek on me–”

“The patient was a Phoenix.”

Director Caddy blinked. “Pardon?”

“My frostbite patient from yesterday, Little Kindle– he’d accidentally flown into a tree branch while playing beneath his parents’ roost and had fallen into a frozen pond. By the time the poor thing could crawl out of the water he was quite soaked through and barely aflame. His parents nearly flung him into my arms, cold as death, as I passed by the entrance on my rounds. I didn’t think we had anything near hot enough to warm him up in a timely manner, so I ran down to the cellar and chucked him in the furnace, then buried him in the coals.”

Caddy stared.

“I let him sit for about an hour, then took his glowing-hot egg out with a pair of tongs. He should be hatched again, right as rain, in a week. His mum would have hugged me if it hadn’t burnt me to a crisp to do so. She said she’d send me fallen plumes from their nest for my good health.”

Caddy drew a deep breath. Then, without a word, she straightened and turned to go.

She didn’t bother opening the door. She just kicked it down.

Harris sighed and picked up his phone, dialling the nurse’s station. “Hi, Rivet, it’s Harris– oh, yes, you heard that? Caddy is a bit, well, *annoyed*, so I’d spread the word to stay out of sight for a little bit. Could you be a darling and send maintenance up with a new door and some drywall when you can? Thank you, Rivet, you’re an angel. Bye now!”
