“I’m sorry, miss Hýss, but I think I have to call in a veterinary consultation for this. This all seems localised to your *coiffure*, and I’m sorry to say I have no experience at all in snake care.”

Hýss sighed, drooping in her seat and reaching up to stroke the miserable snakes attached to her scalp. They all looked frightful, scales dull and loose, falling off in dry pieces as they rubbed against her fingers. Doctor Mara didn’t have a lot of first-hand experience with snakes, but she’d seen enough of David Attenborough to know *that* was not what a healthy moulting looked like.

Hýss turned towards doctor Mara, her eyes thankfully covered by both a thick blindfold and a pair of dark sunglasses. “Very well, Doctor. Please call whoever you think best suited, my poor dears are terribly itchy and irritable. Why, they nearly bit the snake-dresser when we went in for their monthly bath and scale oil treatment!”

“Don’t worry, miss Hýss. My friend will have this sorted out in two shakes of snake’s tail. Be right back!”

She left the room, closing the door behind her before trotting through the corridor down to the nurse’s station. She nearly slipped on a patch of slippery goo that covered most of an adjoining corridor, leading off to the showers.

“What’s this goop for? Why’s it not cleaned up?”

"Maintenance is on it, Doc,” Nurse Rivet said, not taking her eyes off the monitor as she busily hammered away at a keyboard. “That’s dragon spit. Joy got a little bit eaten earlier.”

“She got– nope, nevermind, I don’t want to know. Can you pass me the phone, Rivet?”

Mara was nearly brained by the handheld as it came flying at her, Rivet not having looked as she tossed it in her general direction. Mara rolled her eyes before poking the numbers in.

It rang thrice before a breathless voice answered. “Hey Mara, what’s up?”

“Hey yourself, Ben. You busy? You sound a bit winded.”

“Oh, nothing much, just wrangled a very irritable hydra through an ultrasound. She hasn’t even had her clutch yet and she’s already broodier than a dragon with a golden egg. But we managed, *without* getting maimed.”

“God to hear. You wanna unwind with an easy consultation? I’ve got a hairdo full of snakes that aren’t doing too well, and they’re outside my area of expertise.”

“A hairdo of– Oh! A medusa? And her *snakes* are feeling poorly?”

“Yep. Think you can have a look?”

“I’ll be right there.”

“Oh, yes, no wonder they’re irritated!” Ben exclaimed as he looked the stricken snakes over. “This is some serious dysecdysis. Poor little guys!”

“Indeed, Doctor,” Hýss answered, wringing her hands worriedly as she turned her blindfolded face towards Ben’s voice. “Can you do anything for them?”

“I shall certainly try. I will have to sedate them, though, they’re far too agitated to handle safely right now… which will probably be a bit tricky in and of itself.”

It took some MacGuyvering, but soon Ben and Mara had managed to wrangle together a sort of hairnet, made out of several face masks stapled together. This they stuck to the end of a nitrous mask, creating a strange sort of balloon.

Poor Hýss looked ridiculous as they wrangled the whole mess over her writhing snakes, nearly getting bitten several times each. Eventually, though, they got the entire leaky mess situated and turned on the gas. The snakes set up a hissing cacophony within as they breathed the nitrous in, then settled into a calm stupor.

“There, that should do it,” Ben said, turning off the gas. “We don’t want to give them too much. I’ll have a quick look now while they’re calm.”

Mara hovered at his shoulder as he gently turned the stunned snakes over in his hands, peering at the scales intently. His frown deepened as he lifted a particularly loose one.

“No sign of skin lesions, discolouration or blisters, so it likely isn’t scale rot. Hmm, have you got a lupe or a magnifying glass, Mara?”

“Aye, here.” 

Ben nodded gratefully, then peered through the glass. He muttered something under his breath, sweeping his gaze slowly over the snake’s stricken scales.

“Aha!” he cried, so loud it made both Mara and Hýss jump. “There you are, you little bastard! Mara, quick, tweezers!”

She slapped them into his flailing hand and watched as he plucked something from beneath a scale, then held the tweezers up in triumph. Mara leaned closer, staring at the clenched tweezers. 

Something tiny and red wiggled in their grip.

“A mite?” she asked.

“Aye, skin mite. Little bastards have been at it for a while, it looks like.”

“Ewww!” Hýss moaned, face twisting into a grimace. “I *hate* bugs!”

“Well, they’re not exactly bugs–”

Mara elbowed him in the side.

“Ow. Anyway, yes, they’re pretty icky. But the good news is they’re pretty easy to treat!”

“Oh,” Hýss sighed, “Such a relief to hear, Doctor. What should I do?”

“You go to your favourite hairdresser, show them the prescription for antiparasitic shampoo I shall write for you, then sit back and relax while they drown the little monsters for you! I’ll throw in a prescription for a good ointment to make sure they’re gone, for good measure. A course of one professional washing per day for a week ought to be enough!”

“Oh, thank you doctor!” 

Hýss stood and fumbled for their hands, shaking them heartily each in turn. “If this works I’ll write a glowing review for you, I promise! Such a relief to hear the treatment is so easy and pleasant!”

“Our pleasure, miss Hýss,” Mara answered.

“Indeed,” Ben added. “And here is your prescriptions – show the pharmacy on the first floor the one for the ointment and they’ll sort you out.”

“Thank you, I will!”

Miss Hýss turned to go, her dazed snakes bouncing as she went for the door, a spring in her step.

Mara blanched. “Wait, miss Hýss, let me get the–”

Hýss walked face-first into the closed door with a *bang.*

“–door.”
