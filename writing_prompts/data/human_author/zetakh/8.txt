<2/3>

There’s a very specific rhythm and sound to your walk when you’re doing this sort of business. The even *click* of hard-soled shoes on asphalt, or the heavy *thud* of combat boots for the more rough-and-tumble customer.

The guy behind sounds all wrong. No calm rhythm, not even the staccato of a run that told me I was about to be jumped. No, this fellow was *weird.*

Step. Shuffle. Squelch. 

People don’t *squelch* in the city unless it rains – and it hadn’t rained for weeks.

I take a sharp turn down an alleyway without looking back or changing my pace. The place is dark, the few lights that aren’t broken dim and flickering. I weave through the detritus on the ground with the ease of familiarity and hurry down a short basement stair, fishing my keys out of my pocket as I go.

With a quick twist, I slip through the steel door and lock it behind me, then pause for a moment to listen.

Step. Shuffle. Squelch.

Yep. Still behind me. No use hanging around.

I get moving again as my tail starts shambling down the stairs – clearly he was closer behind me than I thought. No matter, though. I’ll be out the other side of the old building long before he can get the door open.

The door handle creaks as the guy tries his luck. Soon after there’s an echoing bang of impact as he tries to break it down.

I grin and turn around, not quite able to resist gloating – until I see something red and wet oozing in through the gap between the door and its frame. Writhing strands of meat reach out across the floor, searching, touching, feeling.

Two eyes slip through with audible *pops*, and I start running.
