I stared, dumbfounded, at the little party of humans as they looked up at me.

"So you've come to ask me," I continued, "To attack your village and your fields, burn your livelihoods and steal your cattle - in order to attract bold new adventurers to challenge me?"

Their apparent leader, a tall woman with her greying hair tied in a severe bun, nodded. "Correct, lord Brimstone. Rich adventurers and the loot they bring in was the foundation upon which our entire economy relied. Now most of the young folk have moved away, seeking their fortune elsewhere for there is none to be had in their home. Most of us are near to shutting down their businesses - the alchemist has no customers to sell potions to, the magic shop can't get new inventory-"

I held up my claw for silence. "So you want me to, what - show myself as I ravage the countryside? Steal a few heads of cattle, so you can set up Wanted posters? Do you honestly expect me to risk having my home invaded by hoard-hungry adventurers, just so that your village can prosper again?"

The old lady had the cheek to grin at me. "Yes, indeed! But consider - what will the adventurers bring to *you,* in turn?"

I narrowed my eyes as I considered. "Artefacts, enchanted arms and armour, products of artifice and master-craft. Delivered to my very doorstep, mine for the taking..." 

"Darn tootin'! And likely made right here in town!"

I bared my teeth with anticipation, spreading my wings wide. "Very well then, little humans. We have an accord." I fixed my gaze upon the old woman, bending my neck down to see eye-to-eye. Her scent tickled my nose as I breathed in - forge-soot, ale and bread. "What is your business, crone?"

"Why, I'm mayor. And I run the inn!"

"And who is watching it whilst you parley with me?"

She paused, momentarily taken aback. "My daughters."

My grin of swords grew wider. "And are your daughters yet wedded?"

"They- they are not, my lord."

"Then let our pact be formed. For what better way to announce a dragon is in residence, than with imperilled maidens!?" I spread my wings, legs bunching beneath.

Her face went white. "Wait!"

I leapt over the astonished group, scattering them with the whirlwind force of my wings. As I rose into the air I let my breath lead the way, setting the very sky alight as I spiralled upwards.

I needed to make an *entrance,* after all.

The little village appeared in my vision, in the middle of a cleared section of forest. Gentle smoke rose from chimneys, little figures moved in the fields. In the centre of town lay my prize - a large building flanked by a fenced-in yard, empty stables and forge cold and unused belying the emptiness of the common room.

With a roar, I dove, trailing smoke behind me. People screamed and scattered from my path, bleating livestock stampeding with terror. I lazily snatched a cow and gulped it down whole on my approach. With blooded jaws, I crushed the stables beneath my claws and tore a hole through the thatched roof of the tavern.

Two young women turned to look at me, frozen with terror as I fixed my gaze upon them.

"Your mother sends her regards!" I hissed, snatching them up with my claws.

"Wait wait wait!"

"Our mother!? Wait!"

"Worry not," I hissed. "I am well-fed. *For now.*"

I turned back around and prepared to take flight, the old crone's daughters struggling ineffectually in my grip. As I did, I saw the mayor's party rushing down the street towards me.

"Bring me fitting tribute by the end of the week!" I roared, loud enough to shake windows in their frames. "Or I shall feast on these maidens fair!"

"Lord Brimstone!" The mayor croaked out, gasping and wheezing. "Wait-"

"I have spoken! You know what is required of you! *One week!*" 

I fixed everyone in the mayor's party with my gaze, meeting all of their eyes in turn. Then I winked, sent a theatrical blast of fire into the sky and took off.

As I flew, I looked down upon my hostages, held in my claws.

"Now then," I said, voice much softer and more pleasant, "It has been a long time since last I entertained guests. I do hope you will enjoy your stay!"

The tallest of the two looked up at me, dumbfounded. "Wha-" she coughed, cleared her throat, tried again. "Guests? Our stay?"

"Why yes. Your mother wanted a show. I provided one. Was I not convincing?"

Her sister found her voice. "A little *too* convincing, if you ask me! Did you *have* to ruin the roof!?"

I roared with laughter, smoke billowing from my nostrils. "Perhaps not - but I played my part in your mother's ploy. We shall see if the gambit pays off!"

"And if it doesn't?"

"Why, then I have two fair maidens to eat. It has been a *long* time-"

As they both began kicking, screaming, and biting once again, I considered I may have taken the last joke slightly too far.
