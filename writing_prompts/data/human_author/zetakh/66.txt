*Part Two*

“Uh, hello?” Darryl ventured.


Their apparent leader, a large man wearing gleaming armour of gold and silver, stepped forward and waved a hilariously impractical three-pronged sword at Darryl’s nose. 


“You heard me, beast!” he yelled, oddly muffled behind his closed visor. “Unhand the mayor and leave at once! Never trouble this fine community with your presence again, or we shall slay you where you stand!”


Darryl gaped at him, completely nonplussed. “Uh, pops? Is this a show you’ve put on as a joke?”


Gareth stepped out in between him and the group, one hand pressed against his forehead. “No, no it isn’t, son. These are the Lucky Luckless – a troupe of adventurers who came into town the other day.” He lowered his hand and spread his arms in a placating gesture. “Please, brave heroes, put your weapons away. Darryl here is a friend of our village, always welcome!”


A lady behind the armoured man, clad in a star-spangled robe with so many belts and buckles it must’ve taken hours to don and doff, gasped theatrically and waved a gnarled stick wildly. 


“The monster has bewitched the mayor!” she shrieked. “We must strike, before he turns his powers upon us and the rest of the townsfolk!”


Darryl snorted. “Bewitched? Powers? Lady, I’m married to Gareth’s daughter, who’s waiting for me at home– *ow!*”


Something stung his nose and he shied away, rubbing at the sore spot with his foreleg. A strange arrow clattered to the ground, having apparently bounced off his scales.


“He’s taken the mayor’s daughter hostage!” A cloaked man yelled as he nocked another arrow, this one sparkling with strange lights as he pulled it from his quiver. “We must force him to reveal the location of his lair, and save her forthwith!” 


Darryl snarled and gently pushed his Father-in-Law towards the hall. “Best take cover, pops. These people are nuts.”


“I fear you’re right,” Gareth sighed. “I’ll go get mum, try not to break them.”


“It is *you* who shall break, foul beast!” The knight called, charging forward. “Celeste, with me!”


The last of the party, a woman dressed in a pure white gown, raised a golden star amulet above her head. “By the light of sun and stars, may your strike be blessed! With truth and justice subdue the foul foe!”


A beam of light crashed down from the sky to alight upon the knight’s sword, making it glow with golden radiance. The archer and the magician raised their own weapons as their leader charged at Darryl, all of them yelling incoherently.


Darryl ducked under a bolt of lightning that sizzled through the air, another arrow bouncing harmlessly off the thick scales of his chest. The knight struck and Darryl raised a claw, neatly catching the knight’s arm in his grip. The man yelled and flailed wildly as Darryl lifted him from the ground and raised him to eye level.


“Honestly, if you would just listen for a single moment–”


“He’s gonna eat me!” the knight shrieked. “Shoot him!”


Darryl winced as more arrows and a small fireball struck at him, harmless but annoying little bites that left ugly marks upon his pristine scales.


“Do you have any idea how long it takes for scratched scales to shed and regrow!?” he said, snorting smoke. “Will you please stop trying to kill me!?”


“We’ll stop when you’re felled, you foul flying fiend!” the priestess yelled, her holy symbol glowing so bright it was painful to look at. “I shall burn you with the flames of the sun itself!”


Darryl stepped back, the captured knight held in front of him like a shield. “Okay, that is starting to look a little concerning–”


“By the Light of the Sun, bu–”


*Smack!*


A slipper struck the priestess in the forehead. She went down in a heap, the light snuffing out in an instant. Her companions stared at her in horror.


**“What in the name of all that is good and proper do you *idiots* think you are doing to my Son-in-Law!?”**


Darryl winced at the volume, the knight tumbling to the ground as he instinctively covered his ears even as he breathed a deep sigh of relief. He looked over towards the town hall and saw Gareth peeking out from behind the door frame as a tiny woman dressed in chef’s whites, her hair in a tight braid down to her waist, came stomping out into the yard. She was barefoot, a slipper in her hand and a thunderous expression upon her face as she walked up to Darryl’s side.


“My poor boy,” she cooed, instantly changing her tone. “Did they hurt you?”


Darryl lowered his head and nuzzled into her hand. “I am okay, mum, barely scratched. Please don’t be too hard on them, they’re young and foolish.”


She patted him lovingly on the snout. “My brave boy. You just stand back and let Mum handle this.”


She spun, looming over the still-fallen knight like a vengeful goddess, her shoulders set and the slipper slapping dangerously against her hip. Darryl wisely retreated closer to the house, lying down just outside the door to watch the fireworks with Gareth.


“Good lady, what–” the knight ventured.


*Bong!*


The impact of the slipper against his helmet rang like a church bell, echoing out over the village. Darryl and Gareth winced, grimacing.


“How dare you hurt my poor sweet Son-in-Law!? You all ought to be ashamed of yourselves, coming into a peaceful village and stirring up trouble! Why I ought to smack the names of your parents out of each and every one of you and send strongly worded letters back about your *shocking* conduct, this is outrageous–”


“Uh,” the archer interrupted, one finger raised. “I’m an orphan?”


*Whack!*


The slipper flew with unerring accuracy and struck him in the gut. He folded in half and went down, wheezing.


“Then I will by the Seven Hells adopt you myself so I can beat some manners into you! I have never in all my years seen such disrespect and atrociously dangerous behaviour, I–”


The tirade carried on, the poor adventurers shrinking further and further into the ground with every word, huddled together in a quivering, terrified pile before the onslaught of motherly outrage.


Gareth carefully sidled up to Darryl’s head and bent to whisper into his ear. “They might be a while. Village square by the well, get some lunch?”


“Good idea, pops.”


Gareth easily hopped onto Darryl’s back, holding tightly onto the harness. With a swift bound over the fence, they left the Lucky Luckless to their fate.

*Fin*
