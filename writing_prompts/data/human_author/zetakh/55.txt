“Hurry, hurry!” I hissed as my assistants clambered all over my black hide, armed to the teeth with brushes, scale polish, and silken cloth. “I must be on the runway within ten minutes, and I must be *shining* when I make my entrance! Not a single scale can be anything less than *lustrous!*”

*”Yes, Draco!”* came the staccato chorus of replies as I looked in the mirror, turning my head this way and that to get a good look at my neck and spines.

I had to admit, the ensemble was quite something. My long spines were tipped with shining silver, all joined together by delicate chains that hung down beneath my neck in a beautiful criss-cross web that sparkled with every motion I made. It continued all the way down the length of my neck to my shoulders, where the hanging chains attached to a thick torque set with a single diamond the size of a human’s head. From that hung even more chains, trailing beneath my wings to attach to the larger spines along the ridge of my back, all the way to the base of my tail where they attached to a rather scandalous tail-ring.

Capping the whole thing off were several additional tail rings spaced evenly along the entire length of my tail, joined to the first by yet more chains. I flicked it experimentally and felt them tickle against my scales, catching the light of the dressing room with every motion.

*‘I’m leaving absolutely* **nothing** *to the imagination tonight,* I thought smugly. *”Oh, I look like a right* **snack**.”

”Draco!” the stage manager yelled into the room, waving his arms. “You’re on in five!”

I started. “Ah! You heard the man! Hurry, hurry! Claw-sheaths and the veil, quickly now!”

My assistants hopped to with admirable haste, quickly sliding the pure silver jewellery onto my claws and hoisting the snowy white, massive cloak I was to wear into the air. I stepped beneath it and shrugged my wings to make it settle comfortably along my back, my assistants quickly drawing its silken belt around my waist.

The last very last thing I put on was the pure white porcelain mask. I grinned at myself in the mirror as I looked the pure ensemble over. Fetching, in its way, but certainly not anything one would expect to see *me*, of all dragons, to wear.

*’Oh, they were in for a surprise.’*

I stepped out of the dressing room just as the announcer began speaking, my claws clicking on the polished marble floor as I strode towards the runway. My posture was calm and stiff, tail held still and low to the ground, my neck bowed. The only hint at what I was wearing beneath the cloak were the sparkling claw sheaths of my front claws, not quite hidden by the dragging cloak.

*”And now, the main event! My wonderful guests, you all know him. Draco Dragoon, the Onyx Pearl, the Master of Midnight, the Black Diamond! Featuring an ensemble by none other than Lady Mode, herself!”*

Choral music sang out over the hall as I stepped out, an actual live choir in the orchestra pit with the rest of the musicians. I strode forward calmly, regally, one claw at a time in time with the rise and fall of the chorus.

I let my eyes drift over the hushed crowd as I walked, delighting in the puzzlement I saw upon every face. Men, elf and dragon alike bent to their companions to whisper, animatedly discussing my understated looks.

“But his wings aren’t even free!” I heard one large dam murmur, slightly too loud to be called a whisper even by dragon standards. “He looks like a hatchling dressed like a wraith for Halloween!”

It took a very serious effort not to grin at that, but I kept my cool, only letting the barest twitch of my tail show my amusement.

The music swelled as I stopped at the end of the runway, motionless in the centre of the round platform at which it ended. Around me the assembled crowd frowned up at me, studying me with puzzlement.

All except one.

Right in front of me, looking up with a manic grin through her huge round glasses, Miss Mode was standing in her chair, the little kobold designer nearly vibrating with excitement.

I saw her wink at me and mouth her catch-phrase.

*”No capes.”*

As the choir sang out their crescendo and fell silent, I acted. I reared up onto my haunches and tore the belt off. I threw my wings open, the cloak billowing away, ripped the mask from my face, and *roared*, breathing fire towards the ceiling.

A gasp swept over the crowd as my *true* dress was revealed, glittering brilliantly upon my glossy black hide. The music roared to life again, now an upbeat techno that somehow still worked with a live chorus and orchestra.

I came back down to all fours with a stomp, then began to circle the central platform. I swept my tail back and forth in slow and deliberate arcs, even touching the muzzle of one large dam who squawked with shock as my tail brushed over her scales.

I heard several envious sighs and saw a young drake swoon whilst his date glared daggers at him.

My slow, show-off spin came to an end and I began to walk back towards the dressing rooms, making sure to sashay as much as I possibly could, wings spread wide and tail held high.

Then as I was nearly at the door, I leapt. I kicked off the wall and launched myself backwards into the sky, taking wing with another gout of flame. I whirled around the grand hall over the crowd, spinning through the air as the spotlights tracked my every move. My silver dress cast glittering reflections over every surface, turning me into something like the world’s most expensive disco ball.

Miss Mode was bouncing like mad in her seat, her tail wagging as she cheered me on.

I finished my flight as the music once again swelled, landing hard on the runway, my claws sliding over the polished marble with my momentum.

I came to a perfect stop on the central platform. With a slow, languid stretch that showed absolutely *everything*, I struck my pose. Wings spread wide, tail in a coil around me, chest pushed forward and head held high.

The music stopped.

The room was silent.

Then the large dam I had heard earlier coughed, a small gout of flame illuminating her rosy pink features.

“My,” she said, not even attempting to whisper now. “I’m having that drake for *breakfast.*”

She stood, eyes fixed upon me, her tail lashing dangerously behind her as she began to spread her wings to leap.

*’Uh-oh.’*
