The roar of the engine and shriek of the sirens was a familiar cacophony in my ears as I struggled to get the smoke diving kit onto myself.

“We’ve got a whole neighbourhood aflame!” Captain Reynolds was shouting over the din. “Suspected gas leak, several buildings completely engulfed. Assume people are trapped and in serious danger! Be aware of anything that may cause flashes or backdrafts – gas tanks, windows, you know the drill! I want to see all of you alive at the end of this, you hear!?”

*”Yes sir!”* we shouted in unison.

“Right! Divers, finish your prep, I want you in full kit and out the door the second we stop!”

I nodded and tightened the last few straps on my harness, the familiar weight of my air tank settling between my shoulders. I pulled my mask down and took a deep breath to test the rebreather’s action – all good – then turned to my partner, Max.

She nodded at me from behind her own mask and gave me a thumbs-up. I returned the gesture, then extended my fist towards her. She bumped it, the skin around her eyes crinkling as she grinned at me.

I raised an eyebrow at her, then shook my head. My hands moved over my gear, checking every buckle and seal. A nervous gesture I’d never quite gotten rid of, no matter how many infernos I’d been through.

The truck jolted, the wheels bumping hard over something.

“Whoa!” the Captain called. “Easy, you idiot!”

“Sorry Cap,” Joe, the driver, yelled back. “Had to jump the curb – tons of debris on the road!”

“Debris?” He turned and looked through into the driver’s compartment. “What the hell happened here?”

“Dunno, Cap. Must’ve been one hell of a bang.”

“This ain’t no damn gas leak. Get us closer, Joe, but careful-like, we don’t want to fuck up the truck– what the fuck is that?”

“Holy–”

The world went mad.

I heard a roar, unlike anything I’d ever experienced, so loud I had to clap my hands over my ears. Then a wave of heat, worse than the hottest fire I’d ever felt. Light poured in through the windshield, blazing like the sun.

Then the truck rolled over and all hell broke loose.

I went flying forward, landing in a heap on my back like a kicked tortoise. Max tumbled past me, screaming. I flailed and got a hand on her harness and braced myself, holding on for dear life to whatever hand and footholds I could reach. The rear doors flew open, the view outside an insane whirl of fire, concrete, and smoke.

I had no idea where Cap or Joe were.

Finally, the truck came to a jarring stop. My arms and legs burned. I wanted to rip my mask off, but the flames and thick black smoke that were already starting to engulf the truck told me that was a *terrible* idea.

I struggled to my feet and bent down to give Max a hand. She took it, but as she moved to stand she winced, her scream muffled inside her mask. I bent down.

Her left foot was twisted. Broken. Grimly, I got her arm around my shoulder and heaved, bodily dragging her upright and towards the door as she limped along best she could.

Still no sign of Cap or Joe.

We staggered outside and away from the engine. Everything around us was on fire, buildings, cars, the damn *asphalt.* I took aim for the few buildings I could see still unharmed and hurried on.

Then a shadow passed overhead. I looked up just in time to see a massive, winged shape billow out of the smoke and thunder to the ground, the entire block quaking with its weight.

“Fuck me,” I whispered.

The dragon – because that was what it was, unmistakably – regarded the burning engine with cool disinterest. Its tongue flicked out as it raised its head to look about.

I didn’t wait to be seen. I threw us down into the feeble shelter of a burnt-out police van, still smouldering.

Max whimpered as her foot got jostled, but managed to not scream. She’d seen it too. She looked at me with wild eyes.

I held a finger up in front of my mask, where my mouth was. *Hush.* She nodded. Then, I took a deep breath and peered out from behind the car.

The dragon was still there, casting its huge head about, searching. It must not have seen us. I breathed a quick sigh of relief and kept watching. With any luck it’d lose interest and wander away, letting us escape.

Then I heard a scream.

I looked up. In a window, high in one of the buildings that wasn’t completely engulfed, someone was waving desperately. I could see smoke billowing out of several windows closer to the ground and through the building’s main entrance.

They were trapped.

And, to my great horror, the dragon’s head whipped around to stare at them. It must have heard the shout. It started stalking forward, crouched low to the ground, tongue flicking out as it cast about.

Fuck.
