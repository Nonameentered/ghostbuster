# The Fair

“Hey, look! The fair’s in town!”

I blinked, following my brother’s pointed finger. He was right - in the fallow field outside town stood a fairground. Red-and-white circus tents, a ferris wheel spinning merrily in its reach for the firmament. Faint shrieks of shrill steam organs.

“When’d that show up?” I muttered. “There’s been no flyers, no announcement-”

“Who cares? It’s here now! Let’s go before the lines become too long!”

He dragged me along, trampling the reddish foxglove in his rush to reach the entryway. A clown stood in attendance by the entrance, painted red lips leering at us as we approached. 

“Welcome, my fair folk!” he greeted, with a flourishing bow. “Entry is free, for everything else there’s a fee. We have food, fancy and fright aplenty! Do enjoy yourselves, my friends!”

“Thanks!” my brother chirped. “Come on!”

“Hey wait-” I saw him disappear into the flowing crowd, following the fancy of the fair. With a curse, I pulled out my phone and tapped his contact. 

My annoyance began to turn to fear as the call remained cold and dead. Faulty connection. Of all the damn times for him to disappear…

I grabbed the flapping frock-sleeve of a clown as he ambled past.

“Hi, sorry, but my brother just ran off - is there a place where I can make an announcement?” 

I might have imagined it, but for just a moment the painted face flashed from freakish grin to fearful frown. 

“How old is your brother?” he asked in a hush.

I blinked. “Ten?”

The frown was back. “Fear the ferment. And hurry.”

“What?”

But he was gone. 

*Ferment, ferment…*

A bar tent. Right next to a cotton candy stand. Fairy floss flowed freely, people clamouring for the red and sticky treat. I forced myself through, pushing to the alehouse entrance.

“Fancy a taste? First one’s free!”

I accepted the proffered candy without thinking, biting into it as I went. The flavour was sweet, the sugar sticky on my lips, the juice thick and ferrous-

*Juice?*

Dark red liquid, far too warm, stained my hands.

Somewhere inside the tent, I heard my brother scream.
