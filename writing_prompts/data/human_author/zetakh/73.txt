***The Trapper and the Butcher***

“These are the finest scales and furs I’ve seen in years, sir. Where did you get them?”

The burly trapper fixed his one eye on Trader Joe, saying nothing.

“Well,” the man continued awkwardly, “I will most certainly be glad to purchase them, sir. The condition, size, and quality of these is remarkable. A hundred dollars.”

A low sound, more akin to a beast than a man.

“...Hundred and fifty?”

“And two boxes of cartridges.” The trapper’s voice was a gravelly rumble. “And that bottle of Empire Whiskey.”

Joe hesitated, smiled. “Deal, sir!” He half-stretched his hand to shake, thought better. “I’ll just put that together for you…”

The moment the trapper had his coin and his goods, he turned without a word, disappearing into the cold Arizona winter.

“Well, sure did he absquatulate as soon as he were able.”

“Leave off the fancy words, Billy.” Joe spat. “Get your posse together and track him. These scales are from a heavyweight and no mistake. Find out where he got them – and get my damned money back while you’re at it.”

Billy touched his hat. “An… *innovative* way to conserve your wealth, boss, but I do not argue with the man who keeps me fed. I suppose a clash is inevitable.”

“Best make sure he never gets to fire a shot. I feel I’ve seen him before, but I can’t for the life of me recall…” Joe trailed off, touching his side.

“Old Gettysburg bothering you again?”

“None of your beeswax. Now git before his trail is gone!”

Billy nodded and left, slipping around to the back of the store. Jack, Daniel, and Adam were already mounted, Billy’s own horse saddled and waiting.

“You marked his route, boys?”

“Straight north-west soon as he left town,” Daniel answered. “Headed towards the plateau.”

Billy spat. “Bastard *would* live up there, in the damn cold. Right, let’s get after him before the trail snows over.”

They rode.

But, damn the trapper’s eyes, he had to be riding his horse half to death. They didn’t lose the trail, but neither did they close in. He kept ahead, at most a mere speck on the horizon as the cold and barren shrublands gradually rose into the freezing and snow-covered heights of Colorado Plateau. As night began to fall, they settled in for a miserably cold night within the feeble shelter of a rocky outcropping. The low, smoky fire they could manage barely served to thaw their tasteless cans of beans.

“Hey, Billy,” Jack said, pointing. “What’s this, do you reckon?”

He looked over. Three deep scores in the rock side, evenly spaced. A clear mark.

“Territory marking. Big beast. Makes sense the trapper would find ‘em up here. The world is shrinking, driving the old ones out and beyond man’s reach. We are sure on the right track–”

*“Right track to your grave, boy.”*

Abruptly, the trapper was there. Standing over their fire, a rifle resting on their shoulder. They all froze, staring at him.

It was as if he’d appeared out of thin air.

“Ho there, friend–” Billy ventured.

“I ain’t your friend, boy. You been following me. You will turn around and leave at first light.”

Billy didn’t move. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Adam’s coat shift as his hand reached for the revolver at his hip beneath it–

# Bang!

The rapport of the rifle was deafeningly loud. The horses shrieked and Adam howled, his hand a bloody ruin. Billy drew his own gun and fired, Daniel and Jack’s Colts ringing out a second later.

The trapper grunted, falling back out of the firelight. They fired wildly after him, cursing.

# Roar!

The sound was unlike anything Billy had ever heard, so loud he threw himself down, cowering. The horses shrieked again and reared up, abruptly insane with panic. Something massive shook the ground, invisible in the darkness beyond the firelight.

Billy scrambled back, his back flattened against the rock-face. His scrabbling hand passed over the marks Jack had pointed out earlier and his blood ran cold.

The dragon loomed out of the darkness, one eye narrow with hatred, the other a blind white, scarred over and useless. Arm-length teeth poked out of a torn upper lip, one fang shattered by battle. Everywhere upon the skin were the marks of rifles, bayonets, cannonballs. 

Billy’s heart nearly stopped as recognition dawned. The Butcher of Gettysburg, who had devoured Picket and broken the remnants of his shattered division under his claws. The monster in all the Union's nightmares, snatching men in the night.

His revolver fell from limp hands. He heard the other men sobbing with terror.

“There ain’t worse than him in all of hell,” the trapper said, in the dark.

The terrible jaws opened wide.

*“Go and look.”*
