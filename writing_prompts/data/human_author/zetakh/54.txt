Since both you and u/Watermelonpear prompted this one, I did you both in one!

Also, if I had a nickel for [every time](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZetakhWritesStuff/comments/ocl5ls/hatchling_dentistry/) I wrote a story involving [dentistry and dragons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZetakhWritesStuff/comments/pwr5gh/draconic_dentistry_2/) I'd have three nickles. Which isn't a lot, but it's funny that it happened *thrice!*

# The Dragon Dentist

Asaph buzzed around his examination room, flitting this way and that as he made sure all was in order for his first patient. The instruments were clean, the chair in working order, his stash of toys and sweets (sugar-free, naturally) freshly stocked. He nodded and chirped, pleased, taking one last look over his various diplomas and awards in the display cabinet.

He flicked his tongue over one particular trophy briefly, then rubbed it with a talon to make it shine *properly*. Satisfied, he buzzed over to his comfortable perch in front of his mirror. He turned this way and that as he inspected himself, making sure his iridescent, gossamer wings and glossy purple hide was just as shiny as the room was.

After a quick preen, he was finally happy. He grabbed his coat from its hook upon the wall, put on his glasses, then settled down upon his desk and stepped on the call button of his intercom.

“Janet, dear, I’m ready for our first patient. Tell Nurse Joy to bring them in for the examination.”

The intercom crackled. *”Of course, doctor!”*

A few minutes later, Nurse Joy pulled the door open and gestured inside. “Come in, dear. There’s nothing to worry about – Doctor Asaph is really nice and rather cute!”

Asaph buzzed his wings and snorted. “Yes, yes I am. Come in, come in!”

A shock of dark curly hair and two huge eyes appeared in the doorway as his patient peeked into the room. “Are you the tooth fairy?” a small voice asked.

“Perish the thought! I’m a Tooth Fairy *Dragon!* I don’t just steal teeth, I *fix* them! Which is even better!”

The little patient giggled, taking Nurse Joy’s offered hand and stepping fully into the room. “The Tooth Fairy doesn’t *steal* teeth, silly! She gives you a dollar in return!”

Asaph yowled and flung his head back, one claw upon his forehead. “A single dollar! What has the economy come to!? Highway *robbery* for a fine, fresh tooth, I tell you! No, young lady, you simply *must* demand better pay for your worth in future. But, that is neither here nor there.” He hopped into the air and buzzed over to the examination chair’s armrest. “Now, I am Doctor Aseph and I shall take very good care of you today. Please have a seat – may I have your name, young lady?”

Nurse Joy helped her into the seat. “I’m Emma!”

“Emma! What a fine name. Now, Emma, we have only planned a simple examination for you today – nothing scary at all, I promise you. But before we begin, I must ask if you’ve noticed anything I should pay extra close attention to? Does anything hurt, or feel funny?”

Emma shook her head.

“Very good. Then I shall get ready, whilst Nurse Joy helps you lie down comfortably…”

“Just lean back, sweetie,” Nurse Joy said, gently lowering the chair so that Emma lay flat. “Raise your head a little, just gonna clip this cover on so your pretty shirt doesn’t get ruined–”

Aseph hummed happily to himself as he swiftly flew over to the boxes of disposable masks and gloves (reinforced hypoallergenic rubber, claw-safe), tuning out the gentle instructions of Nurse Joy as he suited up. If he was the Tooth Fairy, then she was the Fairy Godmother. Not a single young soul left his clinic in tears with her on duty.

Finished, he fluttered back over to the chair and sat on Emma’s shoulder.

“Now then,” he chirped, “I shall begin my examination. Say *aah!*”

“Aaah–”

“Nurse, my poker, please.”

“One scaler,” Joy admonished, using the correct term for the implement.

“I use it for poking, so it is a poker.”

Emma giggled.

“That’s a good girl. Now, here we go. Mirror, please, Nurse Joy…”

Ever so gently, Aseph began to feel poke and scratch at Emma’s teeth with the metal scaler, humming and buzzing as Joy held the mirror and directed the light. The procedure was so routine for them both they barely spoke all throughout, save for Joy’s constant praise for their patient for being so brave.

Then, as Aseph nudged one of Emma’s molars, he felt and saw it shift.

“Mmf,” came his patient’s muffled protest. “Th’ ‘ickls!”

The little dragon’s eyes were huge and gleaming as he stared at the offending, oh-so-loose baby tooth. “Yes, yes I would imagine it would! Your baby tooth back here is very loose indeed, Emma. Do you want me to get rid of it for you?” He pulled back to let her answer.

“What about my dollar?” she said, squinting at him.

“Didn’t I say you really should charge a lot more for your teeth, young lady? Let me make you a counter-offer.”

He buzzed away to his stash of toys and sweets, returning with several choice pieces held in his claws.

“Now, if you let *me* handle your fine tooth back there… I’ll give you a *toy!*” He held up a tiny toy dragon made of plastic, sparkly pink and holding a pretty yellow flower.

Emma looked from the toy he held to the other prices Aseph had put down on the chair’s armrest. “Just one?” She asked sweetly.

“Oh, very good! I see you’re taking my lessons to heart!” He fluttered his wings. “Fine, two toys and a lollipop.”

“Three of each!”

“Ack! You’ll leave me destitute! Three toys and two sweets, final offer! Too much candy is bad for you, after all!”

“Deal!”

Aseph nodded solemnly and raised one of his claws. “Then we shall shake on it, young lady.”

Emma giggled again and held up her hand. Aseph grabbed her index finger with both of his claws, shook once, then let go with a buzz of his wings and a flick of his tail.

“Then our pact is sealed. Now, young lady, if you would be so kind as to open wide again – nurse, a clean tray, please…”

Joy rolled her eyes but reached for one of the small metal trays prepared for just this purpose as Aseph grabbed a pair of tongs, holding them with both claws as Emma once again opened wide.

“Now then Emma,” he said, lining the tongs up with his prize, “on three! One –”

*Pop.*

Aseph dropped the tooth into the waiting tray with a chirp. “All done!”

“You said on three!” Emma exclaimed.

“Oh did I? Oh how terribly foolish of me to forget!”

His patient pouted, not believing a word of it. “Can I have my toys now?”

“Very soon, young lady! We’re just going to give your teeth a bit of a polish first, then we’ll be all done!”

The door closed on Emma happily skipping away, accompanied by Nurse Joy back to reception and her waiting parents. Aseph hummed happily as he cleaned her tooth with disinfectant and polish.

*‘A very fine baby molar for the hoard,’* he thought, buffing the clean tooth against his scaly chest. *’Truly young lady Emma was an exemplary patient.’*

He fluttered over to his desk and stepped on the intercom, juggling the tooth absently.

“Janet, be a doll and recommend a discounted follow-up visit for young lady Emma in, oh, three months’ time. Just to make sure the new tooth is coming in properly, of course.”

*”Just for that, huh?”* came the staticky reply. *”Took a shine to her, did you boss?”*

“I have no idea what you’re implying, Janet, but she was indeed a most *delightful* patient.”

He held the tooth up so that it shone in the light.

“Most delightful indeed…”
