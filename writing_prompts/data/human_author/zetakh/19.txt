*Part One of Two*

“How are we doing, Snack?” Ravash whispered, crouched low to the ground in the rough-hewn, darkened tunnel. 

“Almost got it,” his little companion replied behind him as they worked on the heavy lock, their picks making soft clicking and scraping noises. “Just a little–* a satisfying *clack* of smoothly connecting tumblers rang out. “There!”

“Right, go!”

They slipped through the small servant’s door, thanking their lucky stars that the hinges were well-oiled and quiet. Ravash looked around the large, darkened space beyond as Snack eased the door shut behind them. As it clicked shut, they paused, listening for the tell-tale noise of the lair’s owner.

Nothing.

With a small sigh of relief, Ravash reached for the little lyre that hung from his hip. He plucked a short, gentle melody and murmured lyrics under his breath, willing a handful of softly glowing lights into being. They bobbed away from his instrument and deeper into the cavern, their flickering pools of light illuminating the rough granite floor and dozens of huge, stacked piles of glittering shapes.

“Jackpot!” Snack said, scampering over to the nearest pile eagerly, his light frame pattering soundlessly over the stone.

Ravash, far taller, followed his little friend at a more measured pace, tip-toeing on bare feet, his claws clicking softly.

“Hey, what gives?”

He looked up to see Snack digging animatedly through the first pile, the little Kobold hissing with displeasure as he scooped handfuls of little shapes out of the pile. 

“What’s up, Snack?” 

“These aren’t gems!” he exclaimed, holding up a handful of the little things. “They’re just rocks with numbers on them!”

Ravash blinked, picking up his pace to get a closer look – then yelped, as something sharp stuck him in the foot.

“Ow!” he blurted, clutching at his foot as he hopped along. “What the hell?” He knelt to have a look, and saw a tiny stone pyramid embedded in the pad of his foot, stuck like a caltrop. With a grimace, he pulled it free and looked at the offending thing.

It was, indeed, a tiny pyramid, minute numbers etched into the stone on each side so that each point showed a value from one to four. 

Ravash boggled. “It’s a bloody *die!*”

“What?” Snack squeaked, hurrying over, his tail wagging worriedly. “You’re going to die!? Was it poisoned? Can I have your–”

“No, I said *this* –” he held out the pyramid for emphasis, “Is *a die.* As in the singular of *dice!* That pile is a giant pile of four-sided dice!”

Snack blinked, his large eyes wide with surprise. “But why’d a dragon have a giant pile of caltrop dice in their hoard?”

“Seven Hells if I know,” Ravash said, looking at the rest of the towering stacks in the cave. “Unless…”

The Dragonborn grunted and heaved himself up, mindful of his stinging foot. He limped closer to the next pile and withdrew a handful of rocks from it, lifting them to his face to inspect them.

“More dice,” he confirmed. “Six-sided ones this time.”

Snack made a face, then scampered over to repeat Ravash's inspection. “One, two… these have eight!”

And so it went. Each pile was a different type of dice, of every shape and size. There was even a stacked tower of what looked like coins, but turned out to be “dice” with just two sides, marked with a one and a two as opposed to heads or tails. Also made of common, cheap stone.

The last pile held some truly bizarre things that looked like balls, with so many different numbers laid out on so many “sides” neither Dragonborn or Kobold could make any sense of them.

“Well, this looks like a bust,” Ravash said, tossing one of the strange things back into the stack. “Just dice, not even made of anything of decent value. I’d have taken some made of *copper* by now.”

Snack nodded, his tail flicking with annoyance. “Yep. After all that effort, too…” he trailed off, looking around. “Hey, what’s that?”

Ravash followed the Kobold’s gaze and pointing finger. At first he didn’t see anything, but as he sent a light in the indicated direction, he noticed what Snack had seen.

A section of wall that was just slightly *off* in colour and texture compared to the rest of the cavern’s rough granite wall. Snack perked up as they got a better look at it, running over and running his fingers all across it.

“Here we go, a secret wall!” he said, tail wagging. “This has to be where the good stuff is!”

Ravash grinned. “Now we’re talking. Let me have a look!”

He strummed his instrument again, a cloud of little notes leaping from the strings and into the air to settle around the discoloured wall. They glowed softly, chimed, then faded away – taking the wall with them, revealing another door hidden by the illusion.

Snack was on it immediately, his tools appearing as if from thin air. Within a minute, the lock gave up with another pleasant *clunk*, and the door swung open on smooth hinges.

After a quick fist-bump, the pair went inside.
