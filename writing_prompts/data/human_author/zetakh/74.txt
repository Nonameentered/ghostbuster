“I don’t understand, Doc,” Mister Lupin said as his clawed foot was looked over, a red and angry wound, hot to the touch, standing out clearly even through the fur. “I’ve never had a wound last this long – usually we heal up as soon as the moon rises again, but this has lingered for nearly a week! I can barely walk!”

Doctor Garak frowned, nearly equally puzzled. “Aye, this almost looks infected, which is unheard of in a werewolf. Can’t see any sign of silver burns either!”

“Had I thought it had been silver I would’ve been in a lot sooner, Doc. Can’t mess with *that* stuff.”

Garak nodded. “Right enough. Alright, let’s see if we can’t figure this out. I’ll take a few blood and tissue samples to start with.”

He drew a few vials of dark, thick blood, and scraped some foul-smelling tissue from the centre of the wound. Lupin didn’t even flinch, merely sat with his tail held stiffly straight behind him, watching with slightly bared teeth.

“Right, let me pop these off to the lab for analysis and, then I’ll clean the wound up and get some fresh bandages on. I think that’s as much as I dare attempt before we get the test results back.”

He pawed the samples off to a nurse as they rushed past, ignoring the gimlet look this earnt him. Lupin snorted, observing the proceedings with wry amusement.

“Caught yourself a runner, did you?”

Garak grinned. “It’s good to throw some extra work around now and again. Keeps them on their toes! Now then, I’ll start with a wash and some drainage of that pus we’ve got built up, then a round of disinfectant and fresh bandages.”

He set a pan on the floor beneath Lupin’s outstretched foot, then knelt to reach properly. He gently grabbed the paw, the werewolf twitching a little as he did.

“Does that hurt?”

Lupin huffed. “Nah. Tickles.”

Garak smirked. “I’ll be very gentle.”

He carefully pried the toes apart again and rinsed the wound with sterilised water from a spray bottle, blood dripping into the pan. Then he grabbed a metal probe, and carefully began to scrape the milky-white pus out of the puffy, inflamed injury.

Lupin wrinkled his nose with disgust, laying a hand over his snout. “Guh. That’s awful.”

“Sorry. It smells bad enough for *me*, can’t imagine how awful it is with *your* nose.”

“Thanks, Doc. I’ll live, and I promise not to vomit on you.”

“Appreciated–”

The probe caught on something, and Lupin winced, growling.

“Hang on. What’s this?”

Garak tapped his probe, feeling it strike hard resistance.

“Gah! Careful, doc, that *stings!*”

“I don’t understand. I’m nowhere near the bone and I can’t see anything… I gotta get a pair of tweezers and a torch.”

Lupin regarded Garak with some concern as he started rummaging through drawers, muttering to himself. He eventually emerged with a tiny flashlight and a pair of tweezers that looked far too big for Lupin’s comfort.

“Right, let’s have another poke!”

Lupin blanched, his tail trying to curl beneath him but only flattening onto the bed. Still, he managed to hold still as Doctor Garak once again came at his aching foot, digging his clawed fingers into the bed’s mattress.

Garak turned the torch on and held it with his teeth, then set to work. He probed gently, feeling his way to the hard obstruction again. Then he carefully worked the tweezers in, brow creased with concentration. Lupin clenched his teeth, growling softly as his injury was agitated again.

“There, you little bastard–”

He pulled at something, working it this way and that until it slid loose, stinging all the way. He held it up to the ceiling light, peering at it.

Lupin leaned in for a look. “A shard of glass?”

Garak grabbed a paper towel and wiped the shard clean. “Not just glass. A shard from a *mirror.*” He gave Lupin a wry smile. “Bet you dollars to dog treats this is an old *silvered* mirror. Been to any antiques shops lately?”

“Aw, hell. I knew dropping that damn thing was going to be seven year’s bad luck!”

Doctor Garak guffawed, slapping Lupin on the shoulder. “Thankfully just a week, with any luck! Let’s get you bandaged up.”
