# The Library Student

Sylvia hurried down the darkened street, clutching her book bag and staying as close to the few working streetlights as she could.

She'd stayed at the library for far too long, engrossed in her schoolwork. A *hefty* report was due for her literature class and she’d lost track of time, buried in her notes and the pages of *Tolkien’s* works. The sun had already begun to set when she finally left, leaving her to rush home through the darkening streets of Bradburyville.

She looked around uneasily as she passed from one feeble pool of light to another, brief glimpses showing the pitted remnants of clashing words. The worst of the *Book Battles* had passed with most of the serial offenders behind bars with not even a picture book to their name, but the city still bore the marks.

Not too much farther to the tram station. She turned the last corner, quickening her steps–

And jumped back with a scream as a burning tram car came hurtling down the street, tumbling end over end with an ear-splitting roar of twisting metal and crushing everything in its path. She felt the hot wind of it as it scraped past, dust and sparks showering her coat as she covered her head.

”The beginning!” she heard someone shout, ”Is always today!”

“Very pretty words,” another voice answered scornfully, “But just as meaningless as all this destruction. Lay down your thesaurus and surrender before I take you in by force!”

Sylvia dared a peek around the corner and saw two people facing off further up the ruined street, heavy leather-bound books held open and at the ready.

Facing away from Sylvia was a young lady, well-dressed in durable tweed, her hair in a severe bun and gleaming horn-rimmed glasses barely visible on her profiled, flame-lit face.

Her apparent opponent looked nothing alike. A young man dressed in jeans and a short-sleeved denim shirt over a long-sleeved striped tee, with round-rimmed metal glasses and a wildly unkempt beard. A smoking, military-green tube lay on the street behind him.

“And who are you to stop me,” he went on, “When I wield *The Written Word* as my very weapon?”

“I am Caroline, Librarian,” the woman answered, “And that book you’re holding is *overdue!*”

She pulled something from the open pages and pointed it at the young man. Belatedly, Sylvia recognized it as a pistol. The man, on the other hand, didn’t waste a second. He swung his own book through the air even as the shots started ringing out, concrete walls springing from the pages and falling to the ground in front of him as he dashed for cover. Sylvia ducked back behind her corner as she heard the ricochets, bullets skipping over rock wildly.

The staccato gunfire ceased abruptly, replaced by running footsteps and the ringing of metal on metal. She dared look out again to see the two combatants locked in close quarters, the Librarian jabbing skillfully with a rapier as the man backpedalled, a wooden roundshield in his right hand. He rushed forward and slammed his shield into the point of the rapier, trapping it in the wood. With a grin, he wrenched it out of Caroline's hand.

“You’re good,” he said, tossing shield and sword aside, “I’ll give you that, Librarian.”

Caroline glared proverbial daggers as she drew a *literal* one from the thesaurus. “Flattery will not endear me to lenience, you purple-prosed prick!”

“Perhaps not,” he answered, tugging a small paperback from his back pocket. “But perhaps *Herbert* will *spice things up!*

Sylvia felt the ground rumble as asphalt cracked. “Look out!” she screamed.

The Librarian leapt backwards just in time to avoid getting swallowed whole as the worm burst through the street and tore buildings down, the force of the blow sending her tumbling towards Sylvia. She gasped with pain as she fetched up hard against a car.

“May His passing cleanse the street,” the man said, withdrawing his own pistol from his thesaurus as he came ambling towards the fallen Librarian. He stopped a few feet away and pointed it at her heart. “Goodbye, Librarian.”

*”My armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death!"*

As Sylvia’s quote rang out across the street, each line adding strength to her intent, a terrifying roar shook the city as the sky lit with fire. The young man froze and looked up–

Just in time for the terrible jaws to snatch him up. With a *gulp* and gale-force flap of wings, he was gone.

“Well girl,” Caroline gasped, “That was some quick reading. Ever thought about becoming a Librarian?”

*The Hobbit* fell from Sylvia’s shaking hands. “Ask me over a cup of tea.”
