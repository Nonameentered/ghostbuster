“Wonky, master?” Apprentice Hilliya asked quizzically, frowning at her teacher. “Please forgive me, ma’am, but that doesn’t sound like a proper answer. I can see several places here where the syntax could be cleaned up to make the spell easier without affecting its effects!”

Master Mara nodded, her pointed hat bouncing on her head. “I always knew you were too clever for your own good, Hilliya. You are in theory correct – the incantations here are overtly flowery, and these subtexts and rhythm notes are, at a glance, wholly superfluous. However!” She tapped the open spread in the spellbook, her gaze fixed on her apprentice’s face. “It is like I said, *imperative* that they not be altered. I am sorry to say I have no proper answer for *why* the spells are transcribed like they are – most of them are far older than the academy is – but it is an accepted fact that once a spell is devised, meddling with its transcription leads to… *unpredictable* results.”

“But that doesn’t make–”

“–any sense,” Master Mara chuckled, rubbing Hilliya’s head affectionately. “I know, I know. But I need you to trust me on this, my girl. Magic is a science, but it is a *temperamental* science. You’ll figure it out when we start working on creating your own spells from scratch in year three. Now run along, dinner will be served in just a few minutes, and then I’m sure you have assignments from the general studies classes to take care of.”

Hilliya pouted. “*Fi~ine.* See you tomorrow, Master!”

“Have a good evening, Hilliya!”

She tried, she really did. But the poor logic of what Master Mara had told her kept swirling through Hilliya’s head for hours after their conversation. She barely spoke to her classmates during dinner and couldn’t focus on her studies, no matter how much she tried.

Now that she’d noticed it, every single spell she studied was a *mess*. So much superfluous code, so many contradictory incantations and weird intonations! She felt like a kid in primary school, suddenly having to learn what *grammar* was!

Language had been *easy* until she knew it had *rules!* Rules that didn’t even make sense!

“Ugh!”

She pushed her pile of assignments to the side and opened her spellbook to the spell she’d been working on earlier with Master Mara. A simple enough spell, meant to create a Magelight, a completely harmless ball of hovering light.

And its formula was still several paragraphs long.

Completely out of proportion.

Illogical.

*Untidy.*

She grabbed her quill and fresh parchment, then got to work. 

\* \* \*

She stumbled into Master Mara’s study the next morning, red-eyed and frizzy-haired.

Mara cocked a concerned eyebrow at her. “Good morning, Hilliya. Is everything okay?”

Hilliya yawned, waving her master’s concern off. “Morning, Master. Sorry, just a bit tired, I had a lot of trouble sleeping last night.”

Mara tutted. “Early to bed tonight then, girl, can’t have you sleeping on your feet!”

“Yes Master.”

“Good. Now then, yesterday we were looking at Magelight. I believe you had it more or less figured out, but if you’d care to show me again, dear?”

Hilliya saluted cheekily. “Of course, Master! Easily done!”

Mara grinned. “That’s the spirit! You may cast when ready.”

*Right,* Hilliya thought. *Showtime.*

She quickly ran through the streamlined formula she’d devised in her head. By her calculations it should still do the exact same thing, in under half the time. She licked her lips, raised her hand, and began chanting.

Master Mara nodded as she heard the first few syllables – then blanched, as Hilliya skipped ahead in the incantation, “fluff” forgotten. 

She jumped from her seat. “Hilliya, no!”

Too late.

As the last word of the abbreviated spell rang out, a little ball of light did indeed pop into being above Hilliya’s outstretched hand, shining clearly. The apprentice grinned at it, pleased, as her master stared in shock at the tableau.

“What have you done, girl?” Mara demanded, voice tight.

“I made the spell easier, Master!” Hilliya answered cheerfully. “Look, it worked!”

As she turned to face Master Mara, Magelight in her hand, she noticed something *weird.*

The Magelight did indeed follow her motion, bobbing up and down merrily through the air… but it left more light *behind*, in an unbroken, arcing stream that hovered, frozen, in the same spot it had just been. Ghostly afterimages, shining just as bright as the Magelight itself.

Hilliya blinked. She moved her hand experimentally, painting the air with light – then she noticed her own arm was leaving the same sort of trail after it, afterimages layered on top of each other where her arm had been.

A chill ran down her spine. “Uh-oh.” 

“Indeed, Hilliya. *Uh-oh.*”

She looked up to meet her Master’s eyes – and was faced by a disappointed glare, smeared all across the chamber by the path her Master had taken as she approached. Like someone had dipped Master Mara in paint and dragged her across a canvas.

“And that, girl,” the Master continued, “Is why we do not do away with the “fluff.” Like I said yesterday – it makes things *wonky.*”

Hilliya cringed, nodding – then stopped, as she found herself nodding through the afterimages of her own skull and eyeballs. She quickly took a step to the side and froze before she lost her lunch.

She’d already seen more of her own mind than she’d ever wanted in her life.

“I’m sorry, Master,” she said, ashamed and miserable. “What do we do now?”

Mara sighed. “We thank the lucky stars that you didn’t experiment with anything more violent than a Magelight. Then we go to the cafeteria, have some tea and cake, and wait for this little mishap to burn itself out. With a low-level spell like this it should only take a few hours.”

“Oh! Okay. That sounds good! So I’m not in trouble?”

“Oh you’re in more trouble than you could possibly imagine, *Hilliya. Marasdaughter. Flamewright.”*

Hilliya cringed, layer upon layer of terror falling onto her with each part of her Full Name.

“But that comes later, after this mess runs its course. So come on – time for tea.”

Mara opened the door and motioned for Hilliya to step ahead of her, smeared images of her form and that of the door left in her wake.

Her daughter did as told, walking through the ghostly layers of door and towards her doom.
