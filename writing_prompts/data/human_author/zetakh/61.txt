Aww, thank you! Dragons as the protanists is something I'm very fond of doing, so knowing people like my portrayals is always a delight!

And fair critique - I could have extended the actual fight a little longer, with a couple more back and forths... But I was too eager to throw the slippers into the mix! :D

And there's plenty more dragons, both friendly and fierce, on my sub, so feel free to take a look :3
