Firelight lay curled on the soft turf outside her cave’s entrance, overlooking the valley. Far below, in the light of the slowly setting sun, she could see the emerald treetops of her territory and the shining blue string of jewels that was the river.

And beyond that, the thatched roofs of her village, pale smoke drifting gently up from the chimneys. Tiny figures moving about.

Her village. Her people. Her *hoard.*

With a soft whine, she rested her chin upon the ground, her great head bending in towards her side to watch the small, sleeping figure who lay on a soft bedroll beneath her wing, wrapped in blankets. Firelight’s claws dug into the ground, scoring long tracks in the grass as she listened to her friend’s laboured breathing.

Her *oldest* friend.

“Firelight?”

“Martin!” Firelight said. She eased forward, gently nosing at Martin’s side. “You are awake.”

“I am.” He smiled at her, laying his hands upon her soft nose. “How are you, my dear?”

Firelight closed her eyes, humming softly as she leaned into his touch. “That should be my question, old friend. Are you feeling better?”

“Oh, Firelight. You know there is no getting better for me. I–”

“Of course there is! You need only to rest a while, Martin. You will be hale again in mere days! Then we shall go for a flight again, out to the ocean, as we always do!”

Martin laughed, though it quickly turned to rattling, hacking coughs. Firelight keened with worry, carefully lifting him to sit upright against her flank.

He sat like that for several minutes, taking deep breaths, his lips pale and his hands shaking.

“Firelight,” he said at last, “I am *old*, my dear.”

She shook her head, smoke drifting from her nostrils. “You are *not!* You are younger than I by far!”

Another rattling laugh. “You know as well as I do that’s not how humans work.” He smiled sadly at her. “Come here.”

She lay down again, her head in Martin’s lap. He stroked her face gently, his fingers soft like feathers upon her scales. She closed her eyes, for a moment imagining those hands like they once were – strong, warm. Her oldest friend, the crowning jewel in her hoard.

“You cannot go,” she whispered. “You are the last. The only founder of the village left. If you go… I will be alone.”

“Oh, Firelight,” Martin murmured. He bent forward and placed a soft kiss between her eyes. “You won’t be alone. You have the entire village still. Derek, Mara, their kids–”

“It will not be the same!” Firelight’s tail thumped against the grass. “You were the first! My first treasure, my–” she faltered for a moment, then curled tighter still around him. “My first friend.”

“I know, my dear. I know.” He stroked her again, letting his fingers trace the contours of her face. “That is the way of life. We are born, we live our allotted time, and then we return to whence we came.”

“But it is not *fair!* Why should I be gifted such a wealth of life, when those I love get so little!?”

“That I cannot say.” He leaned back against Firelight’s warm side again, one hand left on her snout. “Firelight?”

She opened her eyes to meet his gaze. “Yes, Martin?”

“Can you show me the view? I’d like to see the sunset.”

Her wings drooped, but she nodded. “Very well, my friend. Come, let us watch our home again, together.”

Ever so gently, she held out one of her front claws for him, palm up. He eased himself into her grasp, letting her bear his weight as she turned. Then they settled down once again, looking out over the vista below.

“It is beautiful, my dear,” Martin breathed.

“Yes. It truly is.”

“We built this together, you and I.”

Her claws dug into the grass. “Aye, we did.”

“Remember that, Firelight. I, and all of our friends, remain.” He pointed at the distant village. “In our village. In our people.” He placed a hand upon her chest. “And in you, my dear. In your heart, and memory.”

Firelight met his gaze. 

“We are with you, my dear. I am with you. Promise me you will not despair.”

She leaned down. She rubbed her snout into his chest, drawing deeply of his scent. Committing the sensations to memory. “I promise, Martin.”

“That’s a good girl. Come here.”

She lay down comfortably, her head in his lap.

He stroked her silently, the movements of his hands gradually slowing.

His breaths grew shallow, laboured.

Then they stilled.

Firelight curled around him, her wings over her head.

Keening softly to herself as the sun set.
