# Saint George's Protection

The dragon reared up and hissed, inky black venom dripping from its fangs onto the bone-strewn rocks below. George’s horse shrieked and shied away in the face of the monster’s anger, nearly throwing him in her panic. With a muttered word and a tug on the reins, George soothed her again, though she stamped and snorted around her foamy bit.

The dragon took a deep breath and spread its wings wide, unfurling them like a great ship does its sails. With a roar, the dragon breathed out, hellfire boiling roiling over the hillside towards George.

His horse shrieked with renewed terror as he spurred her into a gallop, ducking low in his saddle and urging her on. He felt the hellish heat upon his armour and smelled burning horsehair as the flames singed his mount’s tail. She whinnied with fright and pain, but kept her footing as he tugged on the reins to turn towards the dragon as it came crashing back to the ground.

George clutched his lance tight, tucking it close to his body beneath his armpit. He roared and took aim, the bladed tip of his lance fixed upon the dragon’s chest. He snapped the reins and urged his horse on, her hooves thundering upon the turf through the charge.

The dragon swiped at him with its great talons. He raised his shield in desperate defence, the impact nearly throwing him from his saddle. He winced with pain as his arm was wrenched painfully, his shield torn away.

But his aim remained true.

His lance struck true, punching through the hardened scales with a shock of impact. The dragon screamed and struck again, its massive talons striking George’s mount.

She shrieked and reared, kicking her hooves desperately as the dragon writhed below her. George let go of his lance and grabbed his sword, raising it high over his head for the coup de grâce–

“Does it please you, my Lord Regent?”

Sten jumped, shaken from his revelry by the sudden question. He turned to the gaunt, bald man who hovered at his elbow, still clutching a pot of paint.

“It does, Master Notke,” Sten replied, turning back towards the grand sculpture.

The view was breathtaking. Saint George, larger than life, clad in golden armour with his sword raised high, astride his snowy-white horse. The dragon, pierced by George’s lance, writhing beneath the iron-shod hooves in its death-throes atop the bones of its previous victims. A fitting end to the monster that had oppressed, killed, destroyed.

“It does indeed please me,” he repeated. “When shall it be completed, Master Notke?”

“Mere weeks hence, Lord Regent. It shall be completed in good time for the inauguration.”

Sten nodded. “Excellent. It is already a masterpiece, Master Notke. I look forward to seeing it finished.”

Master Notke bowed. “You are too kind, my Lord Regent, and I am humbled by your kind words.”

“Yes. I shall let you get back to your work, Master Notke.”

The artist bowed and hurried away, shouting for his assistants.

Sten stepped forward and lay a hand on the plinth the great sculpture stood upon. He closed his eyes.

And abruptly, he was there.

Upon the field of battle by Brunkenberg, the chaos of war all around him. The ring of metal upon metal. The screams of the dying. The acrid taste of musket smoke, the smell of blood. The bone-deep weariness of combat, an exhaustion to which none could compare.

His eyes opened again. He’d known that when he was elected Lord Protector of Sweden, life would never be the same. Such a heavy blow to the Kalmar Union could never have been allowed to stand. His position had needed to be secured with blood.

He looked up to Saint George’s carven face.

“Thank you, Saint George,” he murmured. “May this monument to your great victory mark the blessing you have granted my reign.”

Sten Sture, Lord Regent of Sweden, bowed low before his patron saint, then turned and walked away.

Ironic. Word count clocks in at 666!

This little moment was inspired by the sculpture that depicts [Saint George and the Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon_(Notke)). A really remarkable work that's kept in Storkyrkan in Stockholm!
