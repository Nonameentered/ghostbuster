“Gah! Stupid thing!” Derek gave his computer tower a thump for good measure, but the percussive maintenance had no effect. The thing just buzzed, beeped once, and shut down again.

With a grunt of frustration he crawled in under his desk and into the dusty mess of cables behind the tower.

“Ain’t my first rodeo,” he muttered as he dug around for the power cable. “Let’s see if ol’ reliable works…”

The fossilised power brick sparked a little as he pulled the power cable free, a few mummified spiders tumbling to the carpeted floor.

“Hey, Derek, have you read my– uh, whatcha doing down there?”

Derek looked over his shoulder and saw Snicker standing in his office door, a mug of coffee in his clawed hand. The little kobold peered at him, as if studying a particularly fiendish puzzle.

“Hey Snicker. Computer’s on the fritz, trying a power cycle. Hold on a second.”

He plugged the cable back in with another spark and a small puff of smoke as some cobweb caught. He brushed the tiny flame out and crawled back out, brushing his suit off.

“Looks like they haven’t cleaned under your desk in a few centuries, Derek,” Snicker remarked, grimacing.

“You can say that again. Right, let’s see if this worked.”

Derek bent to start the computer again.

*Buzz.* A few LED’s blinked awake. *Buzz. Beep.*

He swore. “Aaand it’s dead again.”

“Shit,” Snicker agreed, sipping his coffee. “Well, time to call IT, I guess.”

“Never had to do that before. Should I be worried?”

“Nah, looks like you’ve done pretty good due diligence, and Fafnir is pretty patient. His extension is 999. You go ahead and I’ll let the boss know your work might be a bit delayed until your station’s fixed.”

“Cheers, Snicker.”

As Snicker scampered off, Derek reached for the phone and dialled the number. It rang thrice before he heard the click of someone picking up and a deep voice murmuring “**IT.**”

“Hi, this is Derek from up in accounting. I can’t get my workstation started – I’ve checked the cables, tried turning it on and off again, and cycled the power by unplugging the cable and plugging it back in. It makes a few buzzing noises then shuts down, not reaching the boot menu from what I can tell – the screen doesn’t even react.”

There was a long pause. **”Well. A user who actually attempts the easy solutions before calling. What an unexpected treat. You said the computer made a few noises but did not reach the boot menu. Any lights?”**

“Yes, a few LED’s blink while the tower buzzes and beeps, but then they shut down again.”

**”Buzzes? I expected a beep or two, but I rarely hear of computers that buzz. Does it have a disk drive?”**

“Let me check… no, not that I can see.”

**”Very well. I shall be there in a moment. Which is your office number, and does it have a window?”**

Derek frowned. “Number 514, and yes it does?”

**”Good. Do not be alarmed when I show up, I am perfectly happy to assist. See you soon.”**

The line clicked.

Derek put the receiver down. ‘Alarmed? Why would I be alarmed?’

Then he heard a thunderous sound, rhythmic beats high above and coming closer rapidly. He peered out through the window and up, to see a massive shadow block out the sun as it dove down between the city skyscrapers, the unmistakable silhouette of a truly *gargantuan* dragon eclipsing all light.

He leapt for cover under the window, out of sight as the giant creature landed in the streets with a *thump* that shook the entire building. Shrieks and the sound of honking car-horns echoed through the street as Derek hugged the wall, breathing heavily.

Something tapped at his window. He risked a glance up and saw the dragon’s claw, as long Derek’s arm, gently scratching at the thick glass. Then a massive eye appeared in the window, turning this way and that as it peered into his office.

**”Accountant Derek?”** The dragon’s voice was so loud it rattled Derek’s teeth. **”I did tell you not to be alarmed.**”

“Fafnir from IT?” Derek croaked, slowly getting to his feet.

**”Ah, there you are. I am here about the computer. Would you please show me what happens when you try to turn it on?”**

Derek nodded and obliged, turning the computer on to the same result as before.

*Buzz, buzz, beep.*

**”Most interesting. Might you unplug everything from it and bring it here for me, please? I fear trying to reach in would rather ruin the window.”**

“Uh, sure, no problem–”

After a few minutes of struggle in the dust, Derek had the tower free. He walked over to the window, pulled it open, and placed the computer in Fafnir’s waiting, massive claws.

The huge dragon put on a pair of humongous spectacles and peered at the thing, somehow managing to hold it without crushing it. He rumbled, sniffed, and shook it gently, then held it up near his ear.

**”Ah. I believe I have found the issue.”**

With a quick flick of his talons, one side of the computer came off. Derek blinked as he saw something colourful flicker inside it, along with a loud buzz and hissing noise.

**”Now now,”** Fafnir rumbled, snorting at the opened computer. **”No reason to be rude. Out you get, you know better than to live in computers that are in active use.”**

Another hiss, then a few streaks of rainbow colour shot out of the computer and away to disappear into the sky.

“Uh,” Derek ventured, “What was that?”

**”Oh, a family of faerie dragons who’d picked your workstation as a comfy nest. They quite like chomping on circuit boards. I’m afraid the computer is a lost cause until I can get some replacement components sorted.”** He reached down to something out of Derek’s view and straightened again, a laptop held in his other claw. **”Have a backup in the meantime. It is ready to go with the company network credentials, just login as normal. I will have a new computer sorted for you in a week or two.”**

“Well, thanks for the assist! Never heard of dragons in computers before, but I’m glad I didn’t make a fool of myself.”

Fafnir rumbled with laughter. **”Apart from cowering a little bit, you were rather commendable in your due diligence. Have a good day, Accountant Derek.”**

“Uh, same to you, Fafnir! Thank you!”

With a nod, Fafnir took off, the force of his wings sending Derek tumbling to the floor and out the door.

“Get that computer issue sorted, Derek?” Snicker asked as he grinned down at him.

“For now. But you’re buying lunch.”
