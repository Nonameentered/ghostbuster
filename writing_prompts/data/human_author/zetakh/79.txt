*Horn Puzzle*

Doctor Carline looked up as she heard the distinct clopping of hooves upon the clean tile floor, Nurse Jackson murmuring gently to the patient as he led them to the examination stable.

She hadn’t had time to read the triage notes before she was called in, so all she knew was that it was urgent. But as a specialist in the treatment of most things on four legs, from Hippogriff to Dragon, she felt confident in herself and in her team.

That was, until her patient walked in with a soaked-through bandage covering her horn, the presumed upper half carried in an equally soiled cloth wrapping by a person Carline assumed had to be a friend.

“Oh you poor dear,” she exclaimed, hurrying forward to help Jackson steady the patient, two more nurses at her heels without having to be told. “Come, onto the couch. Rest your head on the neck brace, there’s a good dear. Restraints and a saline drip if you please, everyone, you know the drill.”

Together, they managed to get the stricken unicorn onto the specially-designed stretcher. Carline’s nurses quickly got the soft fences set up against the patient’s side and a loose restraint around the back of her head, just behind the ears. The unicorn whickered and stamped a little, as his neck was swiftly shaved, disinfected, and the cannula inserted, but stayed calm.

“Very good. May I have your name?”

“Sundance,” the patient replied, voice thready with pain.

Carline nodded, and reached out a hand for the chart from triage that Jackson handed her.

“Well, Sundance, I promise you we shall do our very best to help you. We will start with a small dose of local anaesthetic for the pain, before we examine further. Any allergies we should be aware of?” She was already skimming the chart for that very information, but it never hurt to be certain.

“None, Doctor.”

“Very good.” The chart had said the same thing. “Jackson, we will have two standard doses of local, if you please. One at the base of the horn to begin with, then another into the breakage itself post-examination.”

As Jackson hurried to comply, she turned to the presumed friend standing anxiously a few paces away, still holding the bloodied bundle. “Are you Sundance’s friend? Is that the remaining half of the horn?”

“Yes, Doctor,” she squeaked, face pale. “I’m Mary and it’s– that is– yes.”

Carline waved to Simmons, who hurried forward to take the horn. “Very good. If you would please wait outside, we shall call you when you can speak to Sundance again.”

Mary shot Sundance an anguished look, then fled without argument.

As she turned back, Carline was offered a syringe, already filled and prepped, with the second one waiting on a tray. She nodded gratefully to Jackson, then stepped forward.

“Very well, Sundance, I shall administer the first injection. We will tighten your neck restraint slightly as I do, please try not to be alarmed.”

A flick of the ears and a soft whicker signalled assent. Simmons and Berkeley gently drew the neck strap tight, one hand each placed soothingly upon Sundance’s back. Carline stepped forward and stooped, lining the needle up with the soft skin around the base of the horn. She slid the point in, Sundance barely stirring, then gently began to depress the plunger.

Nearly straight away she felt her patient relax as the numbing agent took hold.

“Oh,” he sighed, “Thank you, Doctor.”

“Don’t thank me yet, Sundance. We have yet to attend to the horn itself. Gentlemen, undo those wrappings, if you please. Let us have a look.”

Jackson eased one half of the large fabric scissors under the wrappings, metal scraping slightly against the horn, then started cutting. The bandages dripped as they came unwound, Berkeley pushing clean cotton wads in to catch the blood.

Then the wound was uncovered and Carline couldn't quite suppress her wince. Not a particularly clean break. A jagged, sharp mess of shards and cracks around the breach, blood slowly oozing from the severed vessels around the central magical core. Even as she watched she saw feeble sparks arc from the stricken marrow, burning out as fast as they came.

“Large loss of blood and magical potential,” she murmured. “Simmons, a standard quadruped unit of blood, if you please. Jackson, the second injection, then we shall have to clean the wound.”

They set to work, picking loose bits of horn free with tweezers and gently rinsing the break with saline and disinfectant, the larger pieces cleaned and placed safely in a pan. Then they packed the wound with gauze to stem the bleeding, before repeating their ministrations upon the broken-off half of horn.

“Very well. The plaster gun, please, Jackson.”

Carline set the tip of the implement to the cracks in the horn, and carefully began to fill them with the swiftly-hardening plaster, Jackson smoothing any excess out with a clean wipe as she went. Soon the major damage beneath the break itself was mended, fresh blaster standing out stark white against the yellowish cream of the horn.

As she finished, she inspected the other half of the horn. Simmons had done fine work on it as she attended Sundance, the cracks neatly sealed and the bloodied core protected by a fine film of moisturising cream.

“Good job, Simmons.” She bent to check on her patient, still lying calm on his couch, his eyes closed. “The dangerous part is over with, Sundance. Now we are going to attempt to reattach the broken-off part and puzzle together as many of the pieces as we can. Are you still comfortable?”

He whickered and flicked an ear. “Yes, Doctor. Can’t feel a thing!”

“Very good. You let us know if that changes so we can top you off. This might take a while.”

The work was tricky and laborious. Simmons and Berkeley held the loose half steady as Carline carefully sewed the severed blood vessels back together, reaching into the horn stumps with tweezers to stretch the veins and arteries out into reach. It was nerve-wracking, tense work. Sweat dripped down Carline’s forehead, dabbed away every so often by Jackson.

Finally, she was finished. “So far, so good. Now for the jigsaws.”

The rest was mostly tedium, lining the edges of the broken horn up with the detached shards and applying more plaster to the cracks. A wretched puzzle with the patient’s future health on the line.

Finally, *finally*, the last crack was sealed. They wrapped the freshly-mended horn in thick layers of gauze, from base to tip, then added more plaster and several thin rods of metal mixed into the whole package to keep the horn still as it healed.

The final result had added at least an inch in girth around poor Sundance’s horn, the beautifully spiralling structure hidden in its entirety.

“There, Sundance,” Carline breathed. “That should hold while the horn heals. The internal plaster should be pushed out by the new bone growth if all goes well. We will confirm when you return for an X-ray consultation in two weeks. If all seems well, we should be able to remove the outer plaster in a further four weeks. We will, however, keep you in observation overnight, to make sure the blood loss and stress hasn’t caused any issues.”

Simmons and Berkeley undid the restraints, then helped Sundance stand.

He wobbled slightly, but soon found his hooves. “Thank you, Doctor.”

“My pleasure, Sundance. I will call for some orderlies to see you to Observation.”

Soon he was led out, drip wheeled along his side. Mary’s worried voice came drifting in through the open doorway, muffled by the din of the hospital.

With a sigh, Carline turned back to her team. “Good work, everyone. Let’s see about getting this mess cleaned up before the next patient trots in.”
