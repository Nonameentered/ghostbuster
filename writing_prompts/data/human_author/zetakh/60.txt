Oh wow, you went all the way back to my first ever prompt! Good lord, a whole year ago! Happy to hear it still holds up, even though I've noticed so many edits I could make as I looked it over again now!

And yes, the updoots dropped sharply for the last parts, likely because they took several more hours to materialise after the first! I'd never expected the story to blow up like it did, so I certainly had no sequels planned for it way back then!
