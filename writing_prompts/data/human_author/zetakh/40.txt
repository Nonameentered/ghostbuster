## Part Two of Two

**Tuesday, May Third, 1864**

My apologies for neglecting this journal once again. I have toiled within the conservatory like a man possessed and am now beginning to see the fruits of my labours.

I found an old book detailing dozens of exotic species of plants and their care, as well as a cupboard of meticulously labelled and preserved seeds. After cleaning up and replacing the old soil in the planters, the first sprouts are beginning to emerge.

The weather has also begun to clear up, so I have opened the conservatory’s skylights to let in more fresh air. Tomorrow I will head into the township for some paint and begin working on the repainting of the exterior, forecast permitting.

**Friday, May Thirteenth, 1864**

Old sailor or no, I do not consider myself a superstitious man. But today was indeed an ill-favoured day.

I was engaged with the finishing touches upon the conservatory’s exterior, high upon a ladder, when I heard such a shriek that I lost my footing upon the ladder. I crashed into the rose bushes below and would surely have been shredded, had the air not taken a chill and necessitated the wearing of my coat.

Thus I at long last met my employer, Lady Drake, as she looked upon me where I lay in her rose bushes like an upturned turtle.

Her Ladyship was covered head to toe in mourner’s black, her face only just visible beneath her veil from the strange angle I occupied, pale as a ghost. She seemed bewildered, looking first to me, then to the conservatory, then back again. Had I not known better, I would have thought she had seen a ghost.

Then she fled, weeping, from my sight.

**Monday, May Fifteenth, 1864**

I believe I remain employed. I spent the day quietly, tending to the shoots and new growth in the planters.

I have not seen her Ladyship.

**Friday, May Twentieth, 1864**

I found her Ladyship sitting within the iron tree this morning.

She greeted me with a shaky, ethereal voice, seemingly unused to exercising it. She was still dressed in her mourning garb, even in the budding heat of the spring.

I paid my respects awkwardly and asked whether she was happy with the work done so far. Her reply – or rather, lack thereof – left me rather perplexed.

*“I had quite forgotten you”*, she said, before standing up to leave.

&#x200B;

**Monday, May Twenty-Third, 1864**

Her Ladyship was once again waiting as I began my work this morning, standing over one of the planters and examining the tender shoots. She did not address me for several moments after my murmured greeting, merely observing as I began the day’s work.

*“Why are you here?”* she finally asked me.

My answer, that I was in her employ and working to restore her grounds and this fine conservatory, elicited another strange comment. Her Ladyship shook her head, then told me;

*“No, that’s not it.”*

Then she departed, leaving me once again confounded.

**Wednesday, June Second, 1864**

The conservatory is beginning to resemble the oasis of green it was always supposed to be. Thriving plants crawl from the planters and into the ironwork, green life tangling with white metal. Tiny lizards with scales like sparkling emeralds hide in the nooks and crannies, and iridescent birds nest in the hanging bird houses. It is a beautiful haven, and I find myself wondering how it could ever have fallen into such disrepair as it had before I began my employment here.

I shan’t let it happen again.

**Thursday, June Third, 1864**

Her Ladyship was once again waiting for me this morning.

*“Why are you here?”* she asked once again.

This time, I told her it was because I wanted to be. Because a place of such beauty ought not be forgotten.

Her Ladyship’s entire posture changed. She seemed to age a decade, and with a sigh, she bade me sit with her within the tree. As I seated myself, she spoke at length – more than I had ever heard her say.

*“This place,”* she began, *“was to be a gift for my husband. Commissioned during his final voyage, it was meant to house his passion when he retired. An oasis just for us.*

*“Yet he never made it home. For years I hoped, prayed, but his ship was never seen again. My grief broke me. I retreated into my memories and let the real world fall away, let the house crumple around me.*

*“I do not know how I reached out from my seclusion to employ you, Mister Andersson. But I am glad I did. This place, this legacy, will not be forgotten again, with you as its caretaker. Even when I am gone.”*

With a smile, she handed me a letter, stamped with the Drake seal.

Then she looked up into the branches.

Closed her eyes.

And was gone.
