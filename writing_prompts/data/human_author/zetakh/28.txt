# Raptor Ranch

The sun had just risen as I was pouring myself my morning coffee, listening to the radio’s weather forecast absently and peering out my kitchen window critically. A few puffy white clouds, barely a hint of wind – in a few hours it would be a proper scorcher.

A shuffling and creak of floorboards heralded Yoshi’s arrival. He snuffled at my feet, his smooth beak and tiny horn nubs nudging me affectionately.

“Hey Yoshi,” I said, bending down to scratch his neck, just behind his bony frill. “Good trike. You sleep well? You hungry?”

Yoshi bleated in response, nudging me again. I chuckled. Baby trikes were ravenous, and small wonder, when he’d need to add a good six tonnes of mass over the next few years. He was a compact little bugger right now, barely half a metre long. He’d be at least sixteen times that long when he was all grown up.

“Alright, alright! Let’s get you some chow.”

A few minutes later Yoshi is all set up in the garage with a big pile of hay and leafy greens, happily munching away. I return to the kitchen and my cooling coffee, taking a sip before it's entirely unsalvageable.

*”...that was the weather. Continuing the news, a heads-up for the local ranchers – a pair of Alioramus have been seen in the county, estimated at subadults about four to five metres long. Keep an eye on your herds and your kids today, just in case! You know the Theropod Patrol’s number already, but just in case…*”

I tune the rest out, frowning. I have the number on speed dial, if worst comes to it, but I’d better have a look at the fencing around the veloci–

*CRASH!*

I jump at the sound, then jump again as a huge bellow shakes the entire house. Then a higher-pitched shriek, followed by another – and all hell breaks loose, with the sound of tearing wood and another massive crash.

“Fuck!” I dash into the garage, finding Yoshi huddled in a corner, terrified by the noise. With some effort I manage to pick the poor guy up, hushing him and stroking his back as I hurry back into the house and down into the basement. I put him down on his bed and hush him again. “Stay here, I’ll be right back!”

Then I’m back up the stairs and in the living room, wrestling my gun cabinet open and grabbing my hunting Winchester. I’ve got five shells in the chamber before I’m out the door, a handful more hastily stuffed into my jeans pocket as I run for the stables.

As I come around the corner, I see chaos. Terry, my big bull, is bellowing to high heaven, pawing at the ground as he stomps back and forth in front of what’s left of the barn. Something spooked him, along with Mary and Rose, my two cows, enough that he tore straight through the wall to get away.

Damn good thing Yoshi had been with me for his stomach bug, or he might’ve gotten trampled. He usually slept in his dad's stable box...

Terry bellows again as I approach. I murmur soothingly, keeping an eye on his head as he looks at me. He’s tossing and snorting, but hasn’t turned to charge. Mary and Rose are standing nearby, Yoshi’s brother Tricky and sister Tinkerbell huddled between them.

“Woah, woah.” I put my hand on Terry’s beak and rub him, continuing my wordless murmurs. He’s breathing heavily and his eyes are wide, clearly still spooked. I hurry into what’s left of the stables and get his reins, not bothering with a saddle – probably haven’t got time for that.

I’ve just got the harness on him when I hear that high-pitched shriek from earlier again. Terry snorts, wild-eyed, looking around angrily.

Then the ear-piercing shrieks of terrified velociraptors kick up from the same direction.

“Shit!” I swing myself up onto Terry’s neck and click my tongue. “Giddyup!”

He snorts and shakes his head, reluctant to leave his herd, but I get him going with some gentle chivvying. The screams and shrieks are still going on as we stomp along, and soon I see why.

A large-two legged figure, classic theropod with a relatively long, narrow snout is running over the field. My flock of velociraptors shriek and flap with terror as they try to get away, ducking and weaving in a mad fracas of feathers and claws. One barely manages to get its tail out of the way as the rogue Alioramus snaps at it, needle-like teeth ripping a feather loose as the velociraptor squawks with alarm.

“F-k,” I mumble through the reins, holding them with my teeth as I thumb the safety back from my shotgun. The buckshot will likely not do much more than piss it off, but together with Terry I might spook it enough for it to leave and try for something easier to snack on.

Terry roars, deafeningly loud, as he lowers his head to point his massive horns at the intruder. The Alioramus jerks with surprise, then turns to face us, hissing angrily.

The shotgun kicks my shoulder as I pull the trigger. I see the theropod flinch at the sound, ducking its head down. I work the slide, chambering another round.

This time, I hit properly. The Alioramus shrieks with proper pain now, the buckshot peppering its hip. Terry bellows again in response, and picks up speed beneath me.

That was clearly enough for the theropod. It veers off, running full tilt towards a fresh hole in the distant fence. I breathe a sigh of relief, then frown.

*’The radio had said two, hadn’t it?’*

I hear glass break in the direction of the house.

My blood runs cold. “Yoshi!”

I kick Terry hard in the side of the neck, pulling on his reins to turn him around. He grumbles, but starts to pick up speed quickly as I urge him on, back towards the house.

Sure enough, the other one is trying to get in through the front door, clearly smelling the baby triceratops within. I see its big feet scrabbling over the turf of my front lawn, tail swinging wildly.

Yoshi bleats, terrified.

I don’t even have to urge Terry on. He heard the cry, and sees *red.*

My third shot misses completely as he charges full tilt, horns-first.

Not that I needed to help. The impact tears the Alioramus free from my doorway and flings it end-over-end to crash into the turf several metres away, tearing swathes in the grass as it claws and roars with pain.

Terry is ready to go right after it, snorting and roaring, nearly shaking me clean off as he tosses his head in challenge. I barely manage to hold him back as the theropod staggers back to its feet, a large wound in its shoulder and hip from Terry’s horns.

It hisses at us, then starts to limp away.

I fire into the air to really hammer the message in – then I pat Terry on the flank, thumb the safety back on the gun, and head inside to calm down Yoshi.

He’s freaked out, cowering in the farthest corner of the basement. I gently wrap him in a blanket and pick him up, hugging him tightly as I head back outside, not keen on leaving him alone. I get him settled with his mama and siblings under Terry’s watchful eye, then give Theropod Patrol a call to report the incident.

That done, I got to work.

I was *not* looking forward to catching and calming a dozen terrified velociraptor hens.
