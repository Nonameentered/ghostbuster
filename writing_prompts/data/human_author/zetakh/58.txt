# Master and Apprentice

Mirial Crystalheart was more nervous than she’d ever been in her life. She’d trained for this moment since she was out of the shell, but she still felt her tail twitch involuntarily and her wings flutter with nervousness.

Today was her aptitude test to become an Apprentice.

She checked the little leather satchel that hung from her shoulders for what must have been the hundredth time. Tongs, claw sheaths, eye protection, all the tools she’d need. Had she missed anything? She couldn’t tell, but that just made it even more worrying, oh no she must have forgotten *something–*

“Aspirant Crystalheart? Master Crystalheart is ready for you.”

Mirial squawked and leapt into the air with a startled flutter before settling back down on her haunches. She looked up and saw a large green dragon grinning down at her, one wing extended towards the open cave entrance that led to the workshop proper.

“Thank you,” she squeaked, settling her wings back against her sides. “Please lead the way, Master…?”

“Journeydrake Emerald, Aspirant. Follow me.”

Mirial had to hurry to keep up with Emerald’s huge stride as he led the way into the depths of the cave. The aspirant could feel the temperature of the air rising with every moment, warm light barely visible somewhere far ahead. The heat was nearly sweltering by the time the tunnel ended and the cave opened up into the Grand Glassworks.

Dozens of crucibles stood along the far walls, carefully tended by dragons who used their own breath to stoke the flames. Smaller Apprentices ran two and fro, carting raw material and freshly cooled glassware from the workshop to be packed and stored. Mirial saw one dragon expertly forming a huge glob of glass with her talons as she blew a continuous, low flame at it, its colours flowing between red and orange and white where the fire touched the half-melted glass.

Mirial had seen it before, of course. But to do so as an Aspirant was something else entirely. She followed Emerald through the busy workshop, towards the huge central area where the Master was waiting for them.

Master Virial Crystalheart looked down at them coolly as they approached, Emerald stopping at a respectful distance and bowing low, his wings spread wide. Belatedly Mirial caught herself and mimicked the genuflection, Master Crystalheart giving a short nod of approval.

“Thank you, Journeydrake,” she rumbled, “I shall take it from here. You may return to your own work.”

“As you wish, Master,” Emerald replied. He turned to go, nudging Mirial gently with his tail as he did. “Good luck, little lady.”

“Very well, Aspirant Crystalheart,” the Master continued, “are you prepared?”

“Yes, moth–” Mirial coughed, “I mean, yes, Master Crystalheart!”

“Then let us begin.”

Master Crystalheart bent down, dipping a shoulder low towards the ground. Mirial wasted no time, but fluttered up to perch upon the great dragon’s shoulder, holding on to the thick leather tool harness the Master wore with her rear claws. The Master began to walk across the hall towards a huge, glowing crucible tended by several Journeydrakes, settling her large dark goggles over her eyes as she did.

“Is the glass ready?” she asked.

“Yes, Master!” the smallest of the Journeydrakes chirped. “Hot and ready to be worked!”

“Good. Very well, Aspirant Crystalheart, we shall start things simple. I think we will make… A scrying orb. I shall work the glass, you shall be responsible for maintaining its temperature and adding engravings suitable for enchantment.”

Mirial gulped. ‘Simple, she says.’ She put on her goggles, tail twitching, and said aloud, “As you wish, Master, I am ready.”

With that, Master Crystalheart reached into the crucible, sparks and smoke billowing up through the chimney. She emerged again with a huge glob of malleable, white-hot glass held in her unprotected claws, her dark-red scales impervious to the heat. She sat back on her haunches and held the glass up, inserting a long hollow rod into its centre.

She took a deep breath, then set the rod to her lips. “Begin!”

The Master blew into the glass, gently inflating the mass as she smoothed it down with her claws. Mirial scrambled down from her spot on Virial’s shoulder and sat in the crook of her elbow, studying the glass intently as she gulped down huge lungfuls of air, her chest expanding like a bellows.

Then she breathed out, letting her fire dance over the cooling surface of the glass. The mass shifted between red and orange and white with each lick of her flame as her Master blew, the smooth expanding mass beginning to form a smooth, perfectly round sphere.

It was likely only mere minutes, but to Mirial it felt like hours. Her heart thundered in her chest and her blood thumped in her ears with her as she concentrated, staring into the glass mass and breathing in and out in long, even breaths.

Finally satisfied with the size and shape, Master Crystalheart pulled the rod free and twisted, smoothing the edge of the glass into a smooth seal, leaving the orb perfectly round in her claws.

“Not bad, Aspirant,” she murmured, looking at Mirial where the Aspirant perched upon her arm. “Now the engravings.”

Mirial panted, her forked tongue lolling as she huffed and puffed air after her long exertion. “Yes, Master.”

She quickly dug through her little satchel and extracted her talon sheaths, slipping her claws into them and tying them tight with her teeth. Thus armed, she once again set to her work.

‘Now for the tricky bit.’

She blew fire onto her talon sheaths, making the forged steel glow white-hot. The heat stung her claws a little, but she ignored the twinge and set to work. The fresh glass of the orb flowed like butter around the glowing point of her sheathed claws as she ran them over its surface, carving smooth, swirling lines into its surface.

‘Scrying. To see, to know. Across both time and space.’

Stylised eyes and the image of sun and stars. Symbols of knowledge and far-sight, of magic and secrets revealed. Mirial let the work consume her, the roar of the workshop fading until all she could hear was the beat of her own heart and the roar of flame in her lungs.

Finally, after another interminable length of time, she added the last symbol. The spread wings and stylised flame that was her Master’s symbol, set within a heart of crystal.

Her final flame left her and she collapsed, nearly toppling from Master Crystalheart’s elbow.

“Steady there, Apprentice,” she murmured, gently picking Mirial up with her mouth and setting her more securely upon her back, between her wings. “Catch your breath, dear.”

“Thank you, Master,” Mirial gasped, out of breath. Then she blinked, realising what she’d just heard. “Wait, Apprentice?”

The Master laughed as she looked back at the smaller dragon on her back, eyes twinkling with amusement. “Why yes, Apprentice. You did well.”

With a squeal, Apprentice Mirial leapt from her perch and flung herself at her Master’s face. The larger dragon squawked with surprise and caught her, holding her up as Mirial laughed and rubbed her face into the larger dragon’s muzzle.

“I did it! I did it, mother! Thank you thank you thank you!”

Virial Crystalheart rumbled, returning her daughter’s affection. “You did, my daughter. Well done – I’m so proud of you.

“And now,” she continued, “It is time for your welcome. Everyone!” She spread her wings wide as she called and held her daughter up. “My new Apprentice – Mirial Crystalheart, my firstborn!”

As the roars and click of talons upon stone and metal thundered their approval, Virial fixed her daughter with a grin.

“But don’t think this means I shall go easy on you, Apprentice. I shall work you to the bone and wring every spark of flame out of you, as I do with all the hatchlings under my care!”

Mirial gulped. “Understood, moth– Master Crystalheart!”

“That’s my girl.”
