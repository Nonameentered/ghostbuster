*Part Two of Two*

Within were even more piles, but these ones looked more promising – instead of dull stone, they sparkled in the magical light as it shone down on them. With a grin, Snack ran over to the nearest one, Ravash hot on his heels.

They got to the first stack and grabbed a handful each, examining them closely.

“These are pretty,” Snack said, “but I can’t really tell what they’re… uh, made, of?”

“Yeah,” Ravash agreed, his head abruptly feeling strange. “They look… *odd*, don’t they?”

He shook his head to clear his vision, then looked closer. Odd was the right word. The things looked *wrong*, and he couldn’t get the sides to add up to a balanced dice, no matter how many times he turned them around and counted them. He counted seventeen sides on one, twenty-one on another… and another had just *one.* His head swam, a throbbing headache beginning to pulse behind his eyes.

A single side on a die. That should be impossible.

Snack bent over by his side and vomited, the handful of dice he’d been holding falling to the floor, their mismatched numbers flashing as they bounced over the stone.

Ravash saw them fall in seeming slow-motion, abruptly terrified. He didn’t know how, but he was certain that whatever number they came up as would be *bad news.*

He grabbed Snack by the scruff of the neck, strummed his lyre, and willed them away.

With a puff of smoke, they were abruptly outside the hidden room. Ravash picked Snack up and turned to stagger away–

Then the world went mad.

He heard something explode behind them and an unholy screech as the floor abruptly *tilted*, sending them tumbling end over end through the collapsing towers of dice. Little dodecahedrons went bouncing madly through the cavern with a deafening clatter like a tide of random numbers, carrying Ravash and Snack with them.

The cavern shook again as *something* roared inside the hidden chamber. Ravash looked towards the opening and saw a *tear*, colours he couldn’t even name swirling within it.

And a *thing* with far too many angles, eyes, and tentacles stared back at him.

It was his turn to vomit now as just looking at it destroyed his sense of balance.

A madly curling, impossibly-shaped appendage reached towards them, sweeping dice away as it quested along the cavern floor.

Snack made a gurgling, terrified squeak and clutched at Ravash’s arm, terrified. Ravash swept him up with one arm and reached shakily for his lyre with the other, though his mind was blank. 

He closed his eyes and strummed, willing *something* to happen.

“I roll to ***banish!***”

The new voice was so loud it rattled Ravash’s skull. He tore his gaze from the abomination that was trying to eat him, and looked up just in time to see what looked like a huge boulder come hurtling from above, crashing down onto the horror’s reaching, impossible tentacle with a thunderous crash. The thing roared with rage and pain as the boulder squished its limb and bounced, tumbling end over end through the ruined hall.

As Ravash watched, the boulder began to slow, its smooth sides revealing brilliantly glowing numbers upon it. It rolled, rolled, rolled…

And stopped.

A beautifully etched *20* shining from its face-up side.

The monster shrieked in a million discordant tones as its ruined arm abruptly began glowing in the same light as the dice, then started to unravel like balled yarn rolled by a cat. It began to fold in upon itself, over and over, glowing brighter and brighter with each second until the mad kaleidoscope of colours became painful to look at. Ravash curled up tighter around the insensate Snack as the shrieking continued, the light so bright he could see it through his eyelids –

Then, with a sound like silk tearing in reverse and a *pop*, it was over.

The cavern rights itself, the tide of dice settling gently as everything goes back to normal. The dragon’s even wing-beats stop as they settle back onto the hoard’s floor, snorting with displeasure at the mess that surrounds them.

“Well, little thieves,” they rumble, “A very fine mess you’ve managed here.”

Ravash swallows as he looks up at the angry dragon, their huge head staring down at him. He feels Snack stir in his arms, the little Kobold slowly coming to.

“Uh–” Ravash croaked. “We are very sorry, great dragon–”

The dragon hissed angrily. “Sorry? Sorry! You break into my hoard, into my repository of Cursed Dice, nearly *break the world,* and you are *sorry!?*” They slam their tail into the ground hard, smoke drifting from their jaws as they growl. “Give me one good reason, little thieves, why I should not devour you alive right now for this affront!?”

Ravash licked his lips. He had no idea what to say.

Then Snack pushed himself free of the hug and squeaked, “I am a little Kobold, I am very cute, and I roll to charm!”

*Clatter.*

Ravash looked down and saw a minute twenty-sided die bouncing over the floor towards the dragon.

They snorted. “You cannot possibly hope to–”

*20.*

*Flash!*

The dragon froze, blinking. Then they bent forward to inspect Snack more closely, sniffing at him.

“On second thought,” they rumbled, “You *are* awfully cute…”

“Yes I am!” Snack preened. “Now who’s a good dragon? You are! Yes, you are!”

Ravash stared, dumbfounded, as the dragon laid down in front of Snack like a kitten, purring with pleasure as the little Kobold rubbed their snout.

“Snack, what in the Seven Hells–”

“Hush, Ravash!” the Kobold said, scratching away. “Just roll with it!”

*Fin*
