*”We’re live in three… two… one…”*

“Welcome to this unprecedented breaking news segment of the *Daily Briefing!* I am your host, Samuel Johnson, as always joined by my co-host…”

“Thank you, Sam. I am of course Kelly Chambers, joining Samuel here in the studio. Our main story concerns the new, rather alarming developments of the so-called ‘forehead plague.’ Sam?”

“Indeed, Kelly. The ailment has spread rapidly throughout the population. Emergency rooms are filled to bursting with worried people who have woken up to notice the distinctive bumps on their foreheads!”

“Correct, Sam. So far, all indications are that the bumps appear benign. Statements from WHO researchers claim they have found no correlation between them and – as was initially feared by many – cancer. For all intents and purposes, they appear to be inexplicably rapid bone growth.”

“Indeed. There you have it folks! Authorities stress that for now there is no cause for alarm. Please remain calm, and we will be here to guide you through developments as they progress. This has been the *Daily Briefing*, I’m Samuel Johnson–”

“–And I’m Kelly Chambers. This has been your *Daily Briefing*, signing off.

*“Cut!”*

*”We’re going live in 3… 2… 1…”*

“Welcome back to the *Daily Briefing!*” I am, as always, your host, Samuel Johnson, joined by–”

“Thank you, Sam. I’m Kelly Chambers, with you today on Day Three of this unprecedented global medical event.”

“Indeed, Kelly, things have continued to escalate rapidly. As our viewers can doubtless tell, we – along with the rest of the team in the studio – haven’t escaped our own brush with the Bump Plague, as common vernacular now calls it.”

“Tell me about it, Sam. Brushing my hair this morning was an experience, when my hairline grew two mountains overnight!”

“I’ll bet, Kelly! For myself, my troubles were more located in the waist department. I seem to have reached stage two already, with rather a large lengthening of my tail-bone overnight.”

“I hope your wife knows how to adjust your waist size, Sam!”

“She does, Kelly, but I’m afraid this seat will get more uncomfortable than it already is before today’s show is out.”

“As our viewers can probably tell, the escalation has kept apace all across the world. The majority of the population now seems infected, though there are still no reports of actual dangers, or any causes.”

“Correct, Kelly. As of now no fatalities or even adverse health effects have been reported, though WHO and other medical organisations remain baffled. So to our viewers – remain calm and listen to official announcements.”

“You heard it here, folks. We will of course be with you every step of the way. This has been Kelly Chambers–”

“–And Samuel Johnson with your *Daily Briefing,* signing off.”

*”Cut!”*

*”Live in three, Samuel. 2…1…”*

“This is Samuel Johnson, here with today’s *Daily Briefing* on Day Four of the current crisis. I am sorry to report my co-host is absent today – as many will have been aware, Kelly is expecting her first child, and as her condition has progressed, she has been admitted to hospital for close monitoring. Everyone in the studio wishes the best for her and her family. 

“As for the Bump Plague, you can likely tell by now that I, and most in the studio, have progressed to the stage where wearing pants and hats has become problematic in the extreme. My new tail is nothing but a nuisance, and these horns… Let’s just say the driver’s seat in my car needed some major adjustments this morning.”

“Now, I wish I had better news, but so far there is no indication that the progress of the disease is slowing. Estimations put 100% of the world’s population as infected, but authorities are still baffled. No vector of infection has yet been discovered, and no treatment has proven effective. On that note, please, whatever home remedies or online supplements have been recommended to you as cures – don’t believe them. You are likely to harm yourselves and your loved ones if you attempt unproven and unverified cures. Wait for official instruction, and remain calm. I, like the rest of the studio, will of course be here to guide you through this difficult time.”

“This has been Samuel Johnson with the *Daily Briefing*, signing off.”

*”Cut!*”

*Three fingers are held in front of the camera’s view. One folds, then another, and the hand is moved away from the lens.*

“Schamuel Johnschon ere wif the *Daily Briething.* Parhon me, folksch, my jaw ischn’t wha id usched t’ be. Schord schegment fo’ you tohday, ash I ‘ave th’ moscht terrahble heard-burn.”

“Kelly isch schtill in hoschpidal. We ‘ish hehr well. Wee Eitch Oh schtill ovehwhelmed. Pheasche schtay calm. We all in thisch togehehr. Schamuek Johnschon, schignen ohff.”

*A clapper slams shut in front of the camera.*

*“Alright Sam, live in three… two… one…”*

“Samuel Johnson here, back with your *Daily Briefing.* Pardon the performance yesterday, folks, I was still getting used to the new jaws and chompers, as it were. Now on Day 5 of Dragon Week, as people have started calling it, I believe I speak for all of us when I say the writing is on the wall. I shed my old skin overnight and ruined the bedding in the process. The wife and I decided it was better to throw the lot out than to try and wash it up. And the less said about the husk, the better!”

“You’ll be happy to hear we’ve heard from Kelly! Both she and the baby seem in fine health, apart from, well, the *obvious.* We expect her back in the studio any day now!”

“On the global stage, WHO and most other organisations have more or less given up. It seems we’re all leaving our old mortal shells behind, folks.”

“Best get used to it!”

*”And cut!”*

*”Good to have you back, Kelly! Looking good, Sam! Spread them a little more, yeah, like that! Right, live in three… two… one…”*

“Welcome back to the *Daily Briefing*, Day Six of Dragon Week! I am, as always, Samuel Johnson, here with another exciting development – wings! I have yet to try anything as daring as flying, but my son launched himself from the roof the second he woke up this morning sporting his own pair. Thankfully the doctor says he suffered nothing more than a sprained foot and bruised ego.”

“Furthermore, I am as you can tell once again joined by my co-host! Welcome back, Kelly! I must say, your makeover went rather well, you look quite fetching!”

“Thank you, Sam, you don’t look half-bad yourself! First, to the audience, thank you all for your kind words and your concern on Twitter and our other socials while I was in hospital. I read every word, and knowing you all thought of me gave me strength through a very stressful time.”

“We’re all very glad to have you back with us safe, Kelly. On the grand stage, I believe we all know where we stand right now. Not a single person on the planet has escaped the transformation, and all evidence points to it being permanent. We’re dragons for the long haul.”

“So it seems, Sam. We have a lot of things to get used to, and centuries of medical knowledge to rewrite.”

“As you say, Kelly. But we’re all in it together. I’m Samuel Johnson–”

“–And I’m Kelly Chambers. This has been your *Daily Briefing*, signing off.”

*”Cut!”*

“And live in three Sam! Three… two… one…”*

“Samuel Johnson here with a very brief special announcement. As you can see I am once again alone in the studio, though I am thankful to say under much more pleasant circumstances. It seems my co-host and good friend delivered a healthy *egg* during the night, to the shock of both herself and her wife! They are all in hospital now for a checkup, but as far as the doctors can tell all is well.”

“So there you have it folks. It’s a whole new world, with new rules. But life still goes on. I’m Samuel Johnson. This has been your *Daily Briefing,* signing off.”
