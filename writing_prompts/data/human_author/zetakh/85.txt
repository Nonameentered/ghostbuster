# Countdown

*Based on Project Hail Mary, by Andy Weir*

‘*You have to be a bit of a liar,*’ I reflected, ‘*to save the human race.*’

And as far as the lies I’d told during the execution of this project, this one didn’t even rate amongst the hardest to pull off in my collection. Loading a sedated Dr. Grace onto the *Hail Mary* under the cover story of not wanting to risk a panic attack before launch wasn’t even a lie.

The fact that he’d likely suffer said panic attack because he was being *forced* into the mission was where the lie came in.

‘*A bit of a liar – and a complete monster.*’

No matter. What was one man against the fate of billions?

I spared him one last look as they wheeled him out of the cell on his gurney, eyes closed in dreamless, drug-induced sleep. Just a few hours left until the Soyuz launched for the ascent to the *Hail Mary.* Yáo and Ilyukhina would already be at the pad, suiting up whilst the ground crew ran through the final few checks. 

“Good luck, Dr. Grace. You are a coward - but you are the coward Earth needs right now.”

I turned and walked away, back to my office. I’d have a good view of the launchpad from there.

The burly Russian guard at the door saluted as I approached, pulling the door open for me. I didn’t even spare him a glance as I stepped through, the door closing again with a soft click.

The report was still waiting for me on my desk – I hadn’t bothered to file it away. I picked it up and leafed through it, though I’d already read the dense pages several times over. Final checks before the mission was to begin. Tests from the *Hail Mary*, interviews with Yáo and Ilyukhina, the transcript from my last discussion with Dr. Grace. Records that under any other circumstances would have seen me stripped of all authority and most likely imprisoned.

But not today. Not while the entire world, the entire human race, was at stake. It was proof of our shame – but that was all it was. There would be no consequences for me, or anyone that carried my orders out.

At least, no consequences beyond the ones I placed on myself.

I sat by the window and looked out onto the pad, watching as the timer ticked inexorably towards launch.

As three people were condemned to death in space.

As three people were sent to unravel the greatest and most important mystery in history.

“Godspeed, *Hail Mary* crew. I’m sorry.”
