Thank you! I had a lot of fun with it, and I typically write in present tense. It feels more natural for me. I'll double check those tense issues a little later though. Tense is a reoccurring villain of mine and I choose to believe we have some pretty epic battles. Although, I'm still not sure which of us is the villain ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤£

Thanks again!
