Death's Witness

&#x200B;

The doctor shakes his head. *Another loss*, he thinks, as he continues the operation. He chances a glance up, looking through the plastic shield over his face. His eyes rest on the shadow cloaked figure across from him. His eyes linger only a moment, then pass to the aid there as he accepts a tool from her. He doesn't know if there are consequences for being able to see the creature but its best that he doesn't draw attention by staring.

He continues the surgery on autopilot, just going through the motions. In previous years, the creature had spurred the doctor into overdrive. Once, he realized what the creature implied, the doctor flew into action, always trying to snatch the person back from Death's clutches. Yet, time and time again, his own clutches were the ones left wanting. In time, his competitiveness abated for it was a creature he could not best, no matter how tireless his effort.

What was the score now, he often wondered. The question is only ever about Death's score though. He doesn't need a calculator to know his tally is zero. As he continues through the procedure, his mind is on the various versions of a conversation. "I'm sorry for your loss...we did all that we could...he/she fought the good fight but in the end..." It always ends the same so when the heart monitor's tone rings out, the doctor just shakes his head and calls it before the aids buzz into motion.

The doctor disposes of his protective equipment as he mentally acknowledges how jaded he has become. Those lost matches between him and Death had converted into something new over the years. He once wanted to sabotage the procedures to ease the patient's suffering but knew he couldn't. That would have had dire consequences which would catch up to him at some point. No, the patients were already gone, so the only thing he could do was something ever so small, it barely existed at all. Every time he sees that creature, that entity hovering over a patient's table, he focuses on getting through the procedure as efficiently as possible. If he conserves supplies and doesn't spend extra time in the operating room...those are things that the family won't get billed for.

Time and hallways pass by him in a blur, and he now stands in front of the family, reciting the words he had already prepared. After the family is leveled by their personalized hurricane and after the doctor receives the plethora of accusations, he returns to his office, alone. The position isn't a thankless one. There are countless instances where he gets showered with thank you, congratulations, and good work...but they are all just noise now. He knows that this most genuine effort to help the family will never be appreciated because it will never be known. This resigned feeling also makes him aware of one other eventuality. When Death finally shows up at his own bedside, he won't struggle or delay, instead just nodding silently, then following after.
