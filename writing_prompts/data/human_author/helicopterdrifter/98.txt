Lol well, my brain is going pretty haywire with ideas lately. I've been adding to these prompts for the past week and some have them have been pretty powerful. This one has probably been the most hopeful but yesterday's (about a guardian elf) was a positive story too. Most of my others have been pretty violent though. It's kind of hard to know how it's going to come out until it's done because I haven't really been planning these.

I think this story would be appealing to a lot of people if they found it but I doubt many will. If you're not squeamish about violence, you might find some other stories you'll like by checking out my profile!
