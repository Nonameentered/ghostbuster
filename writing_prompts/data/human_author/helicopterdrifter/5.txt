**One Power to Rule them All**

&#x200B;

Hamsterbreath is a Hymalayan cat with a white coat, accented by an ashen face and tale. She's sitting in a lap, receiving pets. They're a little rougher than usual, but she doesn't feel it's a battle worth fighting, so she just continues blinking her baby-blue eyes. It just means her purr isn't consistent, ramping up then receding like a tide as the heavy hand moves across her side.

The lap belongs to a man with a big bushy mustache in a high-back chair. His mouth is completely concealed, and his facial expressions are just different mustache positions. Its current configuration is frustration and looks like the tilde key as his face rests against his fist, his arm being a kickstand as his elbow rests on the chair's arm.

"Just who do they think they are?" the man complains. "You don't see me strolling onto Pharmtech Global's properties and marching in to show them how to do their job. What makes them think they can do that to me? It seems like someone needs to be taught the value of staying in one's lane."

The man's mustache twists into a snarl as he shakes his head, moving his arm like a windshield wiper and jostling the chair back and forth. "This is all going to be more annoying than anything else. Some of these kids showed zero imagination or initiative. I mean, they had thirty days to come up with a couple of power options, knowing full well that they can't pick a power that's already been chosen."

"Anyone could have guessed that the usually suspects would be chosen first...flight, strength, speed, x-ray vision, invisibility, *invincibility*, fire, ice, teleportation. Were they forgetting that the intent was to conquer the world? How much is that girl really going to accomplish with flight as her only power?"

The man laughs. "And then that one brat...he actually thought that playboy-billionaire was a superpower. Oh, the look on his face...*priceless!*"

"There were a couple towards the middle that may be a concern though. Genius intellect can be tricky, but I'm not sure if it's a specialized knowledge or if it's in all things. I'll have to keep my eye on that one. He could be *very* useful."

"The twitchy girl that can now turn any substance into a combustible...that's a bit concerning. I think the only play there is to keep our distance, because the only thing more volatile than her power is her temperament--a great deal to be troubled about for sure."

"Controlling blackholes seems rather useful. That boy would be great at making things and people disappear. Heck, from the looks of this, I may have need of several disappearances."

"It's the last one that's most troubling. I mean, it's Pharmtech's own fault. They're the ones that set up the parameters. They should have had safety measures in place. Injecting a formula and then having the powers activate by the candidate's declaration...well that's just asking for trouble. That kid knew exactly what he was doing when he looked at them and said he'd take all of them."

"*But you can't do that*, the stupid tech said in response. Of course, he knew that you idiot!" The man slams his fist down on the arm of his chair, causing Hamsterbreath to jump down, then up onto the console across from him. "It's just frustrating, Hamsterbreath. To think, this is the place that's giving these kids powers to compete for my job. And they can't even recognize when a kid is stepping up to the plate and pointing his bat over the far fence."

The man sighs. "Maybe it's time to throw in the towel. What to do you say, Hamsterbreath? Call it quits?"

Hamsterbreath blinks back slowly, her tail curling up and flopping back over the counter's edge every few seconds.

"This new kid, what was his name? Deven, Kevin, Francis?...wait, why can't I think of his name?" The man begins looking through his notes on the console, causing Hamsterbreath to move once again as he pulls a file out from under her. She hops up on top of the monitors and looks back down with a growing patience deficit.

"Here it is, but..." As he looks over the file, a lot of the ink has started to run even thought it was printed yesterday. The boy's face is no longer discernable. He pinches his eyebrow and squeezes his eyes shut, trying to picture the boy's face.

His eyes suddenly shoot open. "It's gone," he says. He flips a piece of paper over and frantically grabs a permanent marker to write down his power. *The power to manifest my imagination.* He sets his marker back down and looks at his written note, then back to his file. "He's doing this somehow. He's erasing the knowledge of his existence!"

The man reaches up and grabs the horseshoe of white hair on his otherwise balding head. "Ok, I quit. *We* quit. I want no part of this madness." The man freezes, his eyes growing wider. "If I forget him, does that mean I'll forget that we quit too?"

He picks up the note that he had just written and sees the ink running the full length of the paper, staining his thumb where he holds it in the corner. His eyes narrow at the ink and then his gaze flicks up to his cat. "Hamsterbreath, how many times do I have to tell you *not* to go potty on the console? Just look at this mess," he says gesturing to the stained page. "How am I supposed to know if this was important or not?"

The man sighs, plopping the paper down onto a similarly stained folder, then deposits them both in the trash. He stacks up the remaining folders, then takes the top one. "So, let's see. Which of these ninety-nine brats might be useful to us?"
