I've got two worlds I'm building right now and both of these story-worlds contain multiple internal ones.

**Redux Riding Hood**

The first world came about from a Writing Prompt about Red Riding Hood and Zombies. Since Red & Zombies seem to come from separate worlds, this led me to creating something around the MC that crosses to other, more familiar worlds. The primary world is supposed to be our real-world but there's a threat to this world. The MC has a method to cross over into other movie/game worlds so she does this in order to get strong enough to beat the big baddie in the primary world. These secondary worlds are meant to be pop culture references, so she drops in and out of these places as the story progresses. I don't deal with any of the characters of these worlds, aside from referencing them. I mainly want to focus on those environments.

**Duality Dissonance**

This world has a dual nature, as the title suggests. The main characters exist in a post apocalyptic environment where the nature has a meaning for both worlds. The main world is predominately covered by a growing swamp which is populated by trees known as the Jaaku. There is another species of tree known as the Yoi. While the Yoi are increasingly rare, they are encountered across the story.

Something unique about the story has to do with the day/night cycles. The characters make assumptions about the sun (Mezameru) and the moon (Nemuri). Their world has a tendency to create tears/rifts in their reality, causing other worlds/events to overlap their own world for a time. These rifts only occur at night so the characters assume that Nemuri is some sort of trickster god that's out to get them, while Mezameru is a sort of protector that keeps Nemuri's tricks at bay.

There's also something unique with the water of the world, but that isn't tackled until the end of the story.

That's the gist of the world. The characters assume that something happened in the past that destroyed humanity and the man-made things. They also believe that the world is on the verge of dying, so they set out in an attempt to stop it.
