I've had several writing prompts that I really enjoyed during November. Most of my October stories were pretty grizzly so I tried to stick with a theme related to dream/imagination magic for this month. I enjoyed the act of writing them but I don't think they were seen by many. ðŸ˜…

This is two that i felt were really satisfying to write:

I think this whole theme came from me writing a story in response to a comment that said: "Anything can be a prompt if you're creating enough."

After my story-reply I was told I was a Picasso of writing ðŸ¥°
