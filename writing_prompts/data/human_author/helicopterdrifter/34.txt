"Is this guy legit, Becca?" the cameraman asks his partner.

"How many times do we need to go over this, Stan?" Becca relies. "It's Rebecca so stop trying to shorten it."

"Whatever you say, Rebeccaroni."

Rebecca rolls her eyes and looks around to the other news crews gathering in the Community Center. "A lot of crews sure think he's legit. Whatever he's announcing, it seems like he wanted to get the information out to as large an audience as possible. Even the national gang is here."

"Well, I ain't worried about the national blow hards. I brought Samantha along for this one," Stan says,  rubbing his camera affectionately.

"That's your new one?"

"Seriously? You can't tell the difference between Samantha and that previous dumpster fire that kept me company? Rachel was way less classy than my new girl."

Rebecca shakes her head. "You're a strange little man."

"Greatings and thank you all for coming," the man begins, standing at a podium that is over looking the crowd.

Rebecca gives a rolling gesture to Stan and turns back to the stage. 

"I appreciate you all being able to make it out here at such a late hour," the speaker in the white coat continues. "My name is not important, but I bring to you my fi--" He is interrupted, raising his hand in front of his face and looking towards one end of the crowd. "Please, I requested no flash photography."

Stan is tapping the view finder and turning dials as the speaker addresses the other side of the room. 

"What's going on?" Rebecca asks in a forced whisper. 

Stan shakes his head. "I'm not picking him up in the view finder for some reason."

"Do we still have audio?"

"Yeah."

"Well just keep rolling."

"As I was saying," the speaker continues. "I've made a discovery that will benefit all life in Earth. Human kind and animal alike. For starters, it should be said...Vampires are real and I have proof."

A large commotion comes over the crowd and the speaker raises his hands in a calming gesture. "Please, allow me to continue for that's not the reason for my calling this conference."

Stan shakes his head. "Come on girl, don't do me like this. I need this on film. He flips two more switches and turns on the cam lights, assuming it might be a lighting issue. 

The speaker turns toward the light, raises a hand to shield his face, screams, then catches fire and turns to dust. 

Rebecca turns back to Stan with a glare as Stan looks back and forth between the camera and the vacant podium. "Ooohhh," Stan finally says, nodding in understanding. He taps the side of his camera as he looks back to Rebecca. "UV lamps."
