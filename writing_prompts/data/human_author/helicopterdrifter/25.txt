I feel like I have a unique visual style, plus it seems my use of present tense in 3rd person is not preferred. I'm not sure how widespread the 3rd person-present tense belief is, but it works for me. I have a very active imagination when it comes to choreographing my scenes, both with and without a fight taking place. It allows me to tell some fairly epic tales, and I think I'll end up bringing 3rd person-present tense into favor once my current novel is complete :)

Back to the visual style, I use simile *a lot*. It just feels natural in my story telling and some of my unlike parings are pretty interesting. Someone may later equate my simile use to another author, but I really have no notion of who that might be. That isn't to say that I'm not like an existing author. I could be, I just don't know it. 

I recently had a kind user reply to one of my prompts, saying that I am "a Picasso of literature imagery," which really made my day. My writing style might not be widely embraced, but for some, it'll be a visual shot of adrenalin. And if my writing can be compared to Picasso??...well, I'll consider that plenty unique enough haha
