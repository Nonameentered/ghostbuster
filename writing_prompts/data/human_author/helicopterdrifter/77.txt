The Barber -WC: 791


“You’re taking that All Shave October, pretty seriously huh, Dan?”

Dan smiles, nodding to his co-anchor. “Right you are, Kate. Even as October nears its end, I doubt there’s a sane man alive that would risk The Barber’s visit.”

“And leading right into No Shave November, no doubt.”

The news plays as the girl eats cereal at the kitchen bar. Her frayed, brown braid rests over her shoulder and she periodically pushes up the sleeves on her over-sized flannel shirt. “Hey Jenny,” her mother calls. Her mom rounds the corner then pauses seeing the news. “That’s all they ever talk about this time of year. No wonder everyone’s always in an uproar over it.”

Jenny turns up the bowl, draining the milk and slurping loudly as her mom begins talking about her father. “I gotta go. I don’t want to miss the bus.”

“You have something for lunch, hun?”

“Yeah, I got it covered.”

---

Jenny steps off the bus, and a gleeful friend approaches quickly, her blond pigtails swaying behind her. “Jen!”

“Hey Beth.”

“Did you secure the goods for tonight?”

Jen slings her bag around, then reveals the concealed Lincoln beard. “You, bet I did. Don’t know why they even stock them, cause no one ever buys 'em.”

“Well, all the better for us, right? Hey, you wouldn’t have an extra ponytail holder, would you? One of my bands broke.”

“Ugh, maybe—yeah, here.”

“Thanks, you’re a life saver.”

“Hey, don’t forget I’m going to need a ride.”

“Oh, no worries. I’ll hook back and grab you after last bell.” Jen nods and Beth runs off to class.

Jen sits on the school sidewalk long after the last bus departed. Everyone already gone, the school flag is rendering the only sounds as it whips in the wind, its metal rings periodic colliding with the pole. *They said he was killed by a copycat, but who cares if it was true or not? This is still going to happen.*

A red TransAm skids around the corner, then brakes aggressively, skidding to a stop. Jen grabs her bag and climbs in. “Sorry, I’m a little late, Jenny-poo.”

“It’s fine,” Jen says, leaning against the door and side of her fist. The tires howl briefly before Jen is pulled further into her seat as they take off.

Once they’re outside of town, Beth broaches the topic “I know they’ve retold the shaving bit, like a thousand times but why do you think he does it? The barber I mean.”

*Why did he take my dad is what you mean.* Jen sighs. "He doesn’t have the lower part of his face, just upper teeth and a hanging tongue. Supposedly, The Barber thinks that anyone wearing a beard in October is ashamed of their face, so he takes from them, what he doesn’t have.”

“Ew, that’s so gross.” Jenny nods. “You really think this’ll work?”

“I’ve read that both were here during the civil war, but no one remembers when it started exactly. Some think it’s him though, so this is better than doing nothing.”

Approaching midnight and the two of them make their way through a wooded area, their flashlights cutting out swaths of darkness. “Are you sure about this Jen?” An owl hoots and Beth quickly turns to cut away more darkness. 

“It shouldn’t be much further.”

Beth hurries to walk closer to Jen, just as Jen’s light finds a lone statue. They exchange uneasy glances, then Jen nods. “Right then.” She orients the bag to gain access when she’s nudged by Beth.

“Ugh Jen?”

Jen turns to see a shadowy figure standing nearby. She jerks the beard from her bag and hurriedly loops it over the ears on the statue. The two of them begin backing away as the shadow approaches the statue. It reaches out with yearning fingers, a curved blade in the other hand. It touches the beard, then disappears with the statue. The girls look to one another, then the figure reappears right in front of them. They turn their flashlights to its face, seeing the worn Lincoln beard, then it vanishes.

Jen exhales. “It’s done.”

The next morning, Jen walks into her house. Exhausted, she flings her bag up on the counter, then stops abruptly. The bottom of some sneakers can be seen as someone lays in the floor, around the corner. “Mom!”

“Sadly, Dan won’t be joining us today. In a startling turn of events, we enter November with an emerging crisis. All across the nation, bodies are being discovered, men and women alike, their scalp cut away, then placed over their mouth. Is this the work of some fanatical cult? Some even speculate that The Barber may play a role. Stay tuned to find out more.”
