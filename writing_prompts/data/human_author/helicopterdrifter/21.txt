Oh, there wasn't a comment before this. I was referring to the story itself. I had some issues in trying to submit the post and the story ended up being longer than I intended so I was apologizing for it being longer than I expected ðŸ˜…

I received a 404 error multiple times while trying to submit it. I thought the story might be too long but it's still under 8k characters, so I'm not sure why it gave me fits.

The post itself only "stuck" when I posted a simple test comment, then edited my comment to paste the story in the comment's place.
