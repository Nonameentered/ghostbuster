##Nemesis


Jack swings his axe haft across the face of a zombie, then swings over and down to sink the bearded axe down into chest of another, triggering the ice effect and causing an explosion of ice that sends shards into the surrounding undead. He quickly pulls the hatchet from his belt and buries it in the skull of the first zombie.

"We're going to need to get out of her soon, Sarah," he says, calling back over his shoulder.

A girl with a black braid and red-leathered trench coat is fighting behind him. She has a pair of pistols and alternates shots into the heads of collapsing zombies. She tucks one of the pistols into the back of her coat, then replaces the other's mag before drawing the katana sheathed within the back of her coat.

Sarah swings the blade in a blur, causing limbs to become discarded accessories when the undead reach for her. Haircuts are passed out freely as the tops of skulls become detached, and a subsequent shot is fired into other walking corpses directly behind the ones receiving the trim. She swings the blade in a low slice to her flank and a portal opens in the ground where zombies absently step into it only to fall from the sky further outside of the fight.

Another portal opens that isn't hers. A giant creature steps out of it wearing a Robocop helmet. His Hulk-like stature is riddled with stitching causing his flesh to look like the seams of a quilt, while a large "Y" stitching runs up the center of his torso.

Jack and Sarah see him step onto the field and he soon begins shoving the undead aside as he stomps towards Sarah.

"Sarah," Jack starts, "that looks like a mighty good reason to be getting out of here." He looks back to her, seeing her transfixed with her sword and pistol gripped in white-knuckled fists as she glares at the approaching creature.

"Destroy Dux," the creature croaks as oscillating servos whine as it advances.

Sarah loses her mind, screaming as she charges at the creature. She thrusts the gun forward and expends the magazine in its direction. She swings the blade in a crossbody sweep, batting at the undead as if she were wielding a club. The gun leaves her hand, thrown at a zombie's face as she begins to charge with both hands gripped around the katana's grip.

The Robocop knockoff swings a machete and Sarah rolls under, rising to repeatedly strike at the side of its leg as if she had an axe and was chopping at a tree. A zombie reaches for her from behind and she quickly elbows it before continuing to strike at the Robocorpse.

Its swinging arm comes around and she steps closer, avoiding the blade but getting struck by the fist closed around the handle. She leaves her feet, knocking over some approaching undead, but quickly twists back to her feet.

"Sarah!" Jack calls as he continues to cut down undead on the outside of her duel. "What are you doing? We have to get out of here!"

She doesn't hear him as she dashes back in to exchange blows. Several attacks pass back and forth as Robocorpse's attacks come at a faster pace. She opens a portal behind her and steps back into it, repositioning herself further away. The creature steps towards the portal as it closes, then turns to see her twenty yards in another direction.

He turns and charges at her and she charges as well. It raises the machete, preparing to swing as she opens a portal at its feet. The monster leaps to pass over and she slides under him and drops through.

The creature lands and turns as she falls from another portal behind it. The machete is swinging upwards as her katana comes down. She sees the incoming blade too late in her fall and tries to turn as she shields with her offhand. The machete moves through her left arm, above the elbow and causing it to separate and tumble one way as she rolls the other.

"Sarah!" Jack yells, charging at the creature. He leaps, his axe pulled back like a tomahawk and brings it down into the back of the creature. The ice effect triggers a massive explosion, sending ice shards forward through the creature and into the ground. He pulls his axe back as the creature tries to look around from its ice prison and begins to struggle, causing the ice to snap and pop.

He turns back to Sarah's prone form to see her katana next to her along with a foreign green portal. A sound like gunshots ring out as Robocorpse breaks an ice shard then another.

Jack rushes forward and scoops up Sarah and her katana, then steps through the portal where it closes behind him.
