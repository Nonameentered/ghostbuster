Haha yeah. I went ahead and added this post as a link to the other post. What I'm thinking is that the Shadow Lord (Shades) was the the overseer for Fenrir's prison but since Shades became bound to Aubrey, his powers have been diminishing as more and more of it becomes Aubrey's to control.

So Fenrir is able to escape when Shades isn't able to do anything about it and Shades likely won't even know about the escape for some time ðŸ™ƒ 

And Ty, Ty!
