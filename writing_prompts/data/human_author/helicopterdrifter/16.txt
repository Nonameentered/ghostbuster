Thank you! I was pretty bummed that no one said anything because I thought it was a really fun piece. I just figured everyone was too busy participating in that other story to see what else was going on lol

I thought this might be something that some would want to see more of but given that I already have 2 works in progress and another waiting after that, I really don't have the time to put into furthering another story outside of flash fiction from writing prompts.

If you want to carry on the story, all I ask is to be acknowledged for its conception. Outside of that, you're welcome to use it and I'm flattered that you consider my story worth continuing.
