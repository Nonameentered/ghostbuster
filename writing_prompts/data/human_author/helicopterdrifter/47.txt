Haha you got it! Yeah, I do like what several of the things I've put together outside of these posts. I've had the story in the background since I did the Chocolate bar post in September.

I'll probably start working on it deliberately since it's getting so much interest. I just wish that there was as much interest for the Red Riding Hood story lol

I'll definitely shoot you an update though! Thanks for the support!
