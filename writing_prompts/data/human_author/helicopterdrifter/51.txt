Wow, thank you so much! It was meant to be just a one-off story, but I'm thinking about making this the main antagonist for another story that I've been tinkering with among Writing Prompts lol

I'm actively trying not to work on it though because I'm already working on two others ðŸ˜…

Here's the other side of the story that I'm thinking about linking. It seems like it could make for a really intriguing story.
