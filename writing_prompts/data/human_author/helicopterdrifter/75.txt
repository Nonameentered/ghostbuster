Thank you and yes you are absolutely right! I kept juggling several things going on this time of year, the All Shave October, Halloween, no shave November. I changed the "All shave" month from September to October and didn't catch this missed revision! Thanks for seeing that!

Quotation suggestion is accurate too!
