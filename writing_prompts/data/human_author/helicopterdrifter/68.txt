Hey Jayn! I liked your story. It sounds like Amy got what she deserved. When I'm out and about, I encounter a lot of drivers that I wish would also wreck this witch's house. lol

I agree with Ginger and don't have much to add on top of that aside from a few grammar things that tripped me up during my reading. You might could add that tension by adding some sort of punishment if Amy doesn't do something a certain way or if she doesn't progress to a certain point by a certain time.

>merely nodded to acknowledge

I don't feel like you needed the "acknowledge" so it felt redundant for me.

> those words, for though barely aware her body had started to move

Something isn't working quite right here either, though I'm not sure what exactly. Maybe consider rewording this bit.

That's all I've got! Thanks for the story, Jayn!
