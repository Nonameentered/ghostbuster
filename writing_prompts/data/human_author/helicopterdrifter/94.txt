Hey, I've got an Off Topic for your...Off Topic ðŸ˜…

I'm looking for more of a suggestion or guidance. I'm still new to this community and relatively new to posting comments on writing prompts here. I say new to making comments but I've made 13 unique stories and posted them to the relative prompts. I've enjoyed doing them all and each of them were rewarding to create. The problem is that, I don't believe many are seeing my stories. 

I feel like my stories have been quite powerful but I'm wanting advice in that regard. Is there a way to increase visibility? Or is there a method to getting informed advice on the stories I'm submitting? I'm also thinking that maybe my stories aren't what people are looking for so I'm trying to figure out if it's a visibility thing or if it's the way my stories are told.

I would greatly appreciate a point in the right direction. If there's a better place to ask this sort of thing, let me know and I'll happily shift to over there. 

Ultimately, I just want to write stories that readers will enjoy but I also want to make sure they can find them!
