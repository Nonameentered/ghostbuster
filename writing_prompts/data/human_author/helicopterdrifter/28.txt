Hey! I'm so happy you enjoyed it. That's funny about Aubrey Plaza and a fun thought. Personally, I picture Cara Delevingne, similar to how she looks in Carnival Row. Definitely not her personality there though. It's just her physical depiction. 

I really like this character and story, as have several others when I've posted similar tidbits. Feel free to check out the mentioned sub and you'll see similar prompts that revolve around Aubrey and Shades in the Path of Shadow posts.
