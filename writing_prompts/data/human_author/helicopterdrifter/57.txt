Thanks! So far, Wolf went to a world for some agility training. A trainer named Patches was mentioned and then a wrench tumbles out of the portal lol So Wolf trains agility (off screen) in the movie Dodgeball. Meanwhile, Red and Jack (the huntsman) step into Devil May Cry 1 where they fight off a few mobs before encountering that first spider boss. 

They're currently in Skyrim, although it isn't mentioned my name. They're close to Whiterun and Wolf is being sent to train with the Companions while Jack gathers some resources. Red is supposed to be making hear at the blacksmith but she's a bit rebellious and dips into a new, unique world while the Whiterun BS takes care of her orders. 

That's where I'm currently at in the story which is chapter 5. It's been a really fun story so far and I'm enjoying it! The characters have become a lot richer than I intended for them to be.
