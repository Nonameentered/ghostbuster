Hey NicomacheanOrc!

I'm suspiciously glaring at you right now, with your 1 Post Karma and your great story. Something here is amiss!

Anywho, this was an interesting story. I had to reread the first bit. It wasn't due to the writing, rather for the complex relationship between the characters and the additional mention of Anna. Again, not bad, just complex.

I thought this section was great! You sure checked off a lot of blocks with those reference words lol Well played!

The only part I wonder about, might not even be an issue. I know people break down paragraphs to make them easier to read, and that's actually something that I've had to focus on, but I wonder if this bit is intentional:

>“I want you to imagine yourself standing with Anne on a hill in a desert. The sand is pale yellow and is blowing softly in the breeze. The sun is setting and rather dim, and just on the horizon, there is a low pyramid.”

Both of these are the teacher. I think it does work this way, but the break had me initial think the dialogue was switching back to Zach. I just wanted to point it out in case it *wasn't* intentional.

That's all I've got.

Thanks for the story!
