Hey! You've certainly been busy, and it seems you had far more knowledge on the subject than I did ðŸ˜…

One thing that I think you can improve is the setting intro because I didn't really know where Kyle was in the beginning. I might have missed where you specified this, but I didn't really have an idea until he collapsed.

Outside of that, it looks great! I think you're taking it in an interesting direction with trying to figure out the details that are missing from her history, the endeavor to reinstall her as a deity, and the strain on a mortal with a close connection to her. Keep up the good work!

But put aside the concern for *butchering* of ***my*** story because I don't claim this to be my story. My goal is to create stories worth reading and that was accomplished when you liked the story. It was then exceeded when you liked the story enough to continue writing on it, without just running away and pretending it was yours all along.

So, I don't claim that's my story and you don't have to sweat me disapproving of what you do with it. Everything outside of my initial prompt is ***your*** story.

My only ask is that you give me a nod of acknowledgment if the story's origin comes up. I ask that because ***your*** story gaining popularity would help my own projects be noticed.

So just own it and make ***your*** story whatever you desire it to be! Just don't forget me if it makes you popular! ðŸ˜…
