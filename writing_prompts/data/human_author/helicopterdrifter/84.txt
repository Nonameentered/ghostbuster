Shadows and Rain

&#x200B;

Rain falls as the sky's crocodile tears mix with his own, his face turned up towards the black, featureless void. *So are we too to become just mere tears in the rain*, he wonders. He lowers his gaze, resting it on the second story window above him. The light in her window is out, the time being well beyond a reasonable time for wakefulness, and yet, he could not himself, sleep, his heart so swelled as it was.

*We didn't deserve this but then again, who would? Who are they to decide? What gives them the right?* His gaze falls again as his hands curl into fists. The rain continues to thrash against his long coat, erupting on his shoulders as the rain drops collide with a coat so saturated, it too is like standing water. Ripples reverberate around the coat as if it were a contorted surface of a pond.

"We'd always been best friends Callie, but I hoped it would be more...someday. I dreamed of this, one day being outside your window, but I had pictured sunshine and a boombox held over my head." The stolen future infuriates him causing the water of his coat to slowly pool as it's pushed out of the fabric. "Just look at us now. You and your life's journey, your pilgrimage, just to become a living sacrifice. And then there's me, chosen by the same assholes to project you until the appointed time. To keep you from harm until...you're useful. To see what isn't supposed to be seen. A watcher, just watching unless their plans start to run afoul." He laughs then. "What a joke. It's all just a bad joke."

He turns walking back to the street as thunder growls in the distance. When his foot descends to the asphalt, the water separates, making way for his steps. The rain no longer strikes him, instead, colliding and trailing away from some invisible barrier. A blade of shadow extends from his hand and shadowy smoke peels out from under his coat as his stride lengthens, his pace quickening. *I can't...I won't allow them to take you. They can't have you!*

His intent known, lightning streaks overhead and betrays the pretense of a featureless sky. Beyond the horizon, the lightning flash illuminates a colossal thing of shadow and cosmic intentions. With his weapon in tow and the water passing around, he is a rock defying the current of all things. The lightning strikes again and he glares at the creature. *I'm coming for you.*
