First Month's tasks: I'm going to check mark these so hard that the note below is going to look like a topographical map...which is going to be awkward since I've been taking notes on my smartphone ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤£

1. WP Western Story.
2. Share plot concept. (Easy Mode)
3. Complete at least one Writing Prompt for each day of the month. Multiple on same day is OK to create off days. 
4. Write 3 scenes per week for Red Riding Hood story (Prompt inspire) and rewrite 2 scenes for main novel.

Supplemental:
1. Continue to upload all of the above to my new website/blog so that others will have plenty of content once they reach site.
2. Join/contribute to new discord channel.

...Mission Accepted.
