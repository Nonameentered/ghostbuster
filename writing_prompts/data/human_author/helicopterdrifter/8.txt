The city of rainbows. That's what they call my city now. But it used to not be so...illustrious. There was a bit of a learning curve, but hey, there were omelets to be made!

Let me start again. It's hard to pick a beginning when time is a revolving door, allowing you to come and go as you please. So, me perhaps? Yeah, *me!*

Ok, so there I was...am? Wait, I haven't gotten back to that time yet so technically it's in the future from now. Let's just call it *was.* Right! Ok, so when was I? Oh, yes! I *was* star skating. It was just me in some irrelevant, backwater galaxy, with my star skates...but I guess you might better equate them to roller blades. So, my roller blades and my paint.

The beautiful canvas was just sitting there, spinning and waiting for me to come along. It had this lovely blue-gray hue to it with other darker gray variations. Our meeting was destiny! But there was also an interesting piece in its background, a sphere marbled with blues, greens, browns and whites. Whoever tagged that one did a marvelous job. It would become an excellent backdrop.

So, I set into my work. It turns out that my canvas was rotating with that other background piece, so it was like they were in a continuous waltz, dancing around the galaxy. It was inspiring!

Since they were dancing and all, I figured my canvas should be happy about it. I painted a massively cheesy grin that was winking at its partner. It looked something like the Cheshire Cat's smile suspended in the air...if the cat was simultaneously tipping its hat and winking, of course.

Despite my phenomenal work, the powers that be didn't seem so thrilled about it. They decided to imprison me within the bounds of an Earth city. Something about learning my lesson by hearing the complaints of the inhabitants there or some such? I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention.

Anyhoo! It turns out that my backdrop piece was that Earth place, and my canvas was its moon. So now, confined to my city, I get to see my artwork winking at me every twenty-seven days or so.

But this was when I got my city! It wasn't much at that time though. Apparently, these Earth creatures couldn't see me as I spent a great deal of my time just skating around the sky, along the boundaries of my confinement.

Eventually, I realized that my city had a jet stream passing over it and my star skates were interfering with that somehow. Apparently, I was diverting the airflow, preventing clouds from forming over my city. There was a drought, things dried up, my city deteriorated, there were riots, and worst of all...I even heard one of them slander my moon painting. Yeah, it got bad.

So, I started over. I mentioned the time thing, right? I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if the powers that be just knew I'd fudge everything up and need to start again. I went back to before I was imprisoned. That time sucked though, because, you know...no moon painting and what not.

But I learned about the jet stream, so that was something. Next, I learned about disturbing the wind in another way because there were *a lot* of storms. This Earth prison was so dang fickle. Storms! So, I started over again. It took a little bit of trial and error but eventually I got back to my moon painting.

I learned to control the jet stream, only diverting it a little bit at a time. My city had massive commercial buildings when we got back to my moon painting. Sometimes I would take bits of the jet stream down with me and just skate through the buildings, winding back and forth as I moved frontwards, backwards, sideways, and upside down.

I still had my paint too. Hard to take that away from me unless you cut off my fingers...and they didn't do that so *win!*

I avoided painting on the buildings, tempting as it was. I was already in trouble so I didn't know what this could escalate to. So, one of these jet stream skating times, I leaned down and brushed my fingers across the air. It was kind of like water skiing where you're being pulled along and you lean down to stick your hand in the water. That's what I did, but it was with air!

And my paint zipped away from my touch! It was like I dropped ink in a river. When I looked back, I could see the red and blue trailing behind me. Apparently, I wasn't the only one that could see it because it caused quite the uproar from my city dwellers. Magic? God, even? Nah, it was just me...figuring out that I could paint on Earth's air.

That's what led to the good times! I would still bring the jet stream down with me and I would paint along the way. I liked doing a figure '8' while winding through the commercial buildings. It basically created a suspended, '8' shaped rainbow there.

I couldn't do it all the time though! I had to let it dissipate so the weather could recover. Imagine making this phenomenal artwork on the sidewalk with chalk, only to have it be washed away in the rain. It was a lot like that. It hurt and initially, I just stayed in that time before the rain washed my chalk away.

But I got over it. Even learned to appreciate it, eventually. That chalk painting is still there if I want to go back. They all are, actually. It was necessary for the rain to come and for me to start over. It gave me the chance to begin again. Fresh starts and what not. So, I did.

My rainbow jet streams became a hit! People from other places started going out of their way just to come to *my* city. Some of the locals built towers and platforms off buildings when they discovered the wind current that followed my rainbow paintings. They would then take hang gliders and wing suits off them...it made for quite the ride!

I later pathed the jet streams off their platforms and my city became its very own theme park! I probably don't have a great safety rating, and I may or may not have gone back and erased my painting when I experienced someone dying on my jet streams. Removing the painting made them assume the jet stream was gone so they quit jumping. Eventually, they realized that just certain people were getting turned away, encountering a sign that said they weren't tall enough to ride.

My city dwellers are scary smart. I'm not really sure how they figure this stuff out. But oh, I'm leaving off the best part! You remember how I couldn't leave my city? Well, my rainbow sky is such a hit that they keep having to expand the city and you know what else? My prison keeps expanding too!

I may or may not have discovered a loophole, but I won't tell if you won't.

Oh crap. I guess it looks like it's about time to remove the jet streams again so my city can get a little rain. Ah well, this is just part of it. But I like you...Glitter? Twinkles?...hmm, I'll figure out a name, then come back and let you know.

My city dwellers say you're something called a unicorn. Although, I don't think I got your eyes quite right. So, I'll work on that. I think it would be really neat to make you a lot of brothers and sisters, then spread you along my rainbow streams.

Well, I better get to it. I'll come back and let you know how it's going!
