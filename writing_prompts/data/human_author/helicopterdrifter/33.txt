"Geez, Aubrey," the girls says, walking up the steps to school. "Is your wardrobe allergic to color or something?"

"Get bent, Lilly," Aubrey replies, walking ahead of her. She gets to the top of the steps and turns back when Lilly doesn't respond further. *Ugh, what's her deal?* she thinks, seeing Lilly reach the bottom of the steps as she walks away from school.

*Aubs*, the Shadow Lord replies in her mind. *You need to go stop her and right now!*

"Hey, I'm not responsible for what she does with her time. If she wants to skip school, that's on her."

*Uh, this time, you are responsible for what she's doing. You just used the persuasive power on her, so she's on her way to get bent.*

*Wait, what?* Aubrey looks at the back Lilly as she steps off the front sidewalk and continues through the line of vehicles that are dropping off students. Several of Lilly's friends turn to greet her, but she ignores everyone as she begins walking across the parking lot.

*What he hell, Shades? You need to get me an instruction manual on this stuff!*

*Well, influence is part of the subtlety nature that's associated with shadow powers. You really could have guessed that much.*

"Hey, Lilly!" Aubry calls, rushing down the steps. "Wait up!" She brushes against several students who complain as they roll away from her collision with them. She steps off the sidewalk to a horn blaring as the vehicle began to roll forward.

"Screw you," Aubrey yells at the driver, then freezes as her eyes widen. She turns back and raises her palm in a stop gesture. "Wait, forget I said that." Her expression is one of apology as she returns to chasing Lilly.

*He couldn't hear you, Aubs. All of his windows were up and besides, you two weren't even engaged in conversations.*

*Why does any of that relevant, Shades?* Aubrey adjusts her bag and pulls the slack out of her straps to keep it from bouncing against the small of her back.

*Because you have to be in conversation to influence someone.*

"Ugh," Aubrey groans. "We're seriously going to need to work on your communication skills after this."

As she catches up to Lilly, she wraps an arm around her neck to slow her. "Hey, hey, Lilly. Where are you off to all of a sudden?" Lilly doesn't respond, instead continuing to pull against Aubrey's grasp, in the direction of the busy street ahead of them.

*You have to command her,* Shades says.

"Lilly, stop." As soon as the statement leaves Aubery's mouth, Lilly quits pulling against her." Aubrey breathes a sigh of relief and releases the grip on her shoulder.

*Ugh, you better tell her to forget everything you've said today.*

"Why?" Aubrey asks as she notices Lilly's face turning blue. "Oh gosh! Lilly, forget everything I said today."

Lilly suddenly looks at Aubrey and pulls her arm away. "Ow," she complains from Aubrey having started gripping her arm. Lilly looks at the nearby traffic and then turns to look back towards school. "What is this," Lilly asks with an accusing glare. "Is this an abduction. Are you abducting me for one of your rituals or something? How did I even get here?"

Aubrey exhales and smiles. "Oh, thank goodness. It's good to you have you back, Lilly."

Lilly stares back at her without knowing how to respond. She finally shakes her head and turns to walk back to school. "You are so weird," she says under her breath, walking away.
