>What keeps your writing fresh and interesting when you, as the author, start losing steam in a particular project?

I think the way to keep the story from going stale is by keeping the writer from going stale and infecting the work with this contagion. A good way, that has been working for me, is to write on another project while letting the first one simmer somewhere in your subconscious.

There is a plethora of WP available to allow you to spin up new short stories to distract you for a short while. Incorporating these new story experiences may yield some new angle that you can then roll into that original story.
