>Hope that mega info dump helps

Yep! You rock! I would be happy to drop into some discord meetings. I'm currently in a different writing discord but I don't mind picking up more. I'm actively pursuing this full time so your discord suggestion sounds right up my alley.

I'd like to join tonight but I'm currently in town for dinner so I don't think I'll be back in time to participate.

I plan to continue writing these prompts, because as I said, I am enjoying them and they're giving me a different mental exceecise for each one I do.

I'll look more into all of your suggestions once I get home! Thank you for the very detailed response!
