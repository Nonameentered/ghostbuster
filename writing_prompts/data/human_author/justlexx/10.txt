Hi u/elliottristis, this submission has been removed.

**Existing Content**: It looks like you are sharing something you have already written. On this subreddit we are trying to encourage users to write something new, based on a prompt they find here - not just post something for people to read. Check our [related link wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/links) for more relevant subreddits. We want to inspire new writing here. Try a prompt that takes authors on a new journey. Not a journey that has already been made
