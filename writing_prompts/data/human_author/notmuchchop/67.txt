“And then-and then-and then-the uh, the Goblin says...wait. Was it the goblin? I finks its the goblin. Yeah, anyways, the goblin ‘e says: well, at least me ears aints pointy! And then the Sate...sator...satyr—No! Wait! Wait! No, the umm. Ah, Oh! Its the other one. The...the *centaur*! ‘E says, uh, ‘e says...Fuck. Was ‘e say, again? Umm. Oh, right! The centaur, ‘e says: well, forgive me for being a bit horse, but..um...fuck...yeah! A bit horse, but I fink we cans all agree that... vampires....*suck*!”

The Gnome hacked and gurgled a laugh that sounded like a pack-a-day smoking, janitorial toad was taking inventory of his belt ring.

“Khey-khey-khey-khey-khey-”

Twenty minutes ago, Gasgar the Gnome (a creature who was small in stature but large in self-professed comedy chops) had announced that he had learned a new joke. At this, the half-orc barman — Dunn — had poured a shot for himself and another for Wenda the Witch. She was the only other patron in the tavern and was sat next to the gnome at the bar.

Wenda and Dunn had a game. 

Every time Gasgarr forgot the joke as he was telling it, they’d drink. The problem was that Gasgarr loved long jokes and, as he was nearing his fifteen-hundredth summer, he had the memory of a senile old coot...because he was one.

“Khey-khey-khey. ‘Sgood one, roight?”

“The plunsh pline...punsh —hic— punch pline wash...kay.” Said Wenda. Her forehead was on the bar and her black and pointed traditional hat was on the back of her head. “Dunn?”

The half orc had both his hands on the bar, his eyes were wide and watery, and his light-graygreen jaw was clenched tight. There was the careful breathing of someone trying not to think about throwing up.

“I fink you should shut the Tav, Dunn. You looks like shit, you do!” Said Gasgarr, good friend and worlds worst comedian.
