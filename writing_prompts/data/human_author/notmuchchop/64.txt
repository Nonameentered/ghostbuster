Holy shit. *Holy* shit! 

Leaves. 

Individual leaves...at a *distance*. The old view of green blob-topped kids crayon drawing styled trees is *gone*. Leaves!

Signage! I can read that shit!

Grit, grime, dirt and dust! My apartment is a *fucking* mess! But, I can see that shit now. Hi-def. Holy crap, I never thought I’d be so excited to see the visible squalor in which I’ve been living! No wonder the women I never get into my apartment also don’t stay.

Okay, yeah, the lustre is starting to fade a bit on the whole seeing my own uncleanliness — but, still! I can see, Bitches. Look at me go!

I can see the cat hair on the carpet and the detail in the pattern of the curtains (I thought they were just off-white) and I can see the paint chipping on the edge of my bedroom door and I can see that ghost in the corner and I can see the rain marks on the window and I can see—wait...hold on.

...um.

...ummmmmm.

Okay. Glasses off. What’s in that corner? Nothing. Nothingness and not a see-through lady with wet dark hair, empty-eye sockets, and a white gown.

Glasses on and-Glasses off! Off forever. Or just for now, walking away now, leaving with the fast running.

Glasses off and no thankyou corner or bedroom or apartment and I am off to my Mum’s place—she’s in another country, shhhhit-fuck! Okay-okay-okay, so I’ll go to the movies or maybe somewhere better lit. 

Yep.

Yep-yep.

“Hello?” I say into the apartment from the safety of the frontdoor. A day has passed and I have returned in the brightness of mid-day. “Hello?”

I hold my glasses by their arms as I slowly step up the hallway, ready at any moment to throw my spectacles at any spooky spectres that might show themselves. I am working off the very scientific notion that if I can’t see them then they can’t harm me.

“Hello?”

Did I close my bedroom door as I so bravely ran the fuck away?

Can’t remember. Shit-shit-shit.

I knock. Why am I knocking? This is ridiculous. I open the door and I see her immediately. I squeal and clench just in time to stop myself from voiding my bowels and voiding my bond through carpet damage.

I’d seen her before and now I focused I could see the details. He dark hair and dark eyes. The pattern of her dress. She was a shadow of a plant and the pattern of light through the curtains. So many little details and my mind was playing tricks. Making monsters out of nothing.

I feel so dumb.

“You squeal a lot for a man.” said the dead Goth Girl to my left. 

I passed out and soiled myself (though I only know the results and not the order of operations). She’d wake me up a few minutes later.
