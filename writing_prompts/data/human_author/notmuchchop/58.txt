A flurry of gentle knocks followed by a cheery — albeit door-muffled — introduction. Something about Rangers and Girls and Cookies and charity. I hadn’t quite caught what had been said. My focus was on the breakfast in the two small fry-pans before me. In one: an egg-white omelette with chives and some sweated baby spinach; and in the other: a spicy chickpea and corn hash — for crunch. I’d wash it all down with a vanilla protein shake and a black coffee.

As I plated up, my unwanted and unacknowledged guest knocked again.

I had hoped that they had either given up or noticed my ‘No Soliciting or Sales People’ sign. The one on the very door with which they were locked in polite, one-sided combat. I sighed, snapped a few pics of the dish for my insta and then ate a forkful. So good. 

More knocking.

I snatched up my pre-loaded protein shaker and made my way to the under assault front door. Just as another rap of knuckles started, I opened the door enough to fit in the gap between it and the frame. 

A short girl in a uniform smiled. “Hello, I’m-” 

“Can you read?” I asked, one hand at the ready to slam the door in her face the other shaking the lumps out of flavoured whey and water.

“I sure can!” She pointed to an embroided  circle on her sash. It depicted a flattened M on a flat line. Either an open book or a badly drawn bird. “I’m a Wilderness Ranger Girl from Club Two-Five—”

“Do you know what ‘No Soliciting or Sales People’ means?”

The Wilderness Ranger Girl scrunched her freckled nose and then turned her hazel eyes to the sign once more. She looked like she stepped straight out of a cookie commercial. A militarised ball of cute. It’s sick what people will do for a profit. She probably thinks she’s earning money for a charity or for her...what was it? Wilderness Club. Someone else is no doubt taking the lions share. 

Child labor is fine if it’s cute, I guess.

I’d give her a moment to figure out the apparently cryptic sign. Not my job to teach.

“Ummm.” She squinted at it like focus alone could supply an answer.

The cookie-dealer was a small creature clad in a vaguely militaristic uniform. A beige-green shirt with insignia on the sleeves — a chipmunk smiled from a circle on her left shoulder and the right had a tree encircled by words that I didn’t bother to read. A dark green shorts and a matching sash which was polka-dotted with pictographic pucks of fabric.  

Atop her head was a wide-brimmed hat that kept her pigtails down, also green. The hat not the pigtails. 

“Um. Does it mean...you don’t want any cookies?”

Having little experience with brats of any size, I’m not sure if she’s just dumb or hasn’t reached critical thinking age. Kids are the worst. Either way, she needs to go...but I guess I shouldn’t be too rude.

“It means I don’t want *anything*. I don’t want people knocking on my door and asking for things.”

 The quiet joy that kept the pressure up in her face began to leak and her cheery smile started to deflate and sag. Before I knew it words fell out of my mouth.

“Fine. One box and then you go.”

There was a jump and a squeal and then she leapt the four stairs from the deck to to the red hand-cart she left on the path after coming through the gate. All the while a rapid fire inventory was blurted out.

I heard vanilla and said “That one”.

She said “Chocolate Coconut is popular!”

So, I got one of those as well. We exchanged cash — I got the correct change, first try — and then she grabbed the handle on her travelling shop and started away. A wave, a smile, and she was out the gate and off to use cuteness to peddle sugary crap to the next dumb idiot who dared to open their door.

Should have just let her keep knocking.

\* * *

I wiped the sweat off my face with the towel draped across my shoulders as I continued to stare at the contents of my fridge. Post workout snack time. Bit of gurt and some berries. 

It’ll do.

As I turned, a punnet of blue berries in one hand and a tub of plain Greek yoghurt in the other, I saw the cookies. Two green boxes on the kitchen island where I had tossed them before taking breakfast to the living room.

I put down my unconstructed snack and picked up the Wilderness Girls Vanilla Cream Crunch-Bite Cookie box. *Maybe not good for a snack, but a sometimes treat. What’s the sugar like*, I thought. 

“Not bad, actually.”

I opened the box and to my surprise, within a plastic pack there was a family of cookies that looked very much like the ones on the packet. Each cookie was constructed of two thin, off-white discs held together by a glue of bright white creme. An albino Oreo without the textured embossment.

Eh, what the hell. Why not? 

I popped one in my mouth. Bit down.

Nirvana. A satisfying crunch and crumble of biscuit and a sweet and earthy hit of vanilla creme.

Well well. Not bad at all.

“But,” I said to myself “There’s a difference between treats and snacks. Crap and nourishment.”

I put the pack down and turned my attention back to yoghurt and berries...

“But...what’s life without a bit of fun every now and then? Cookies, meet berries and yoghurt.”

\* * *

The gate creaked as she opened it and had to pull hard to get the cart to move across the grass eaten path. This place was familiar. 

As she skipped up the front steps she noticed a small rectangle of dirt on the front door. The same thing happened when her brother had taken all the Ben 10 stickers of his bunk bed. Something sticky had been peeled off, but what? A sign?

That sounded familiar to her.

The door opened a crack.

“Hello! I’m from the Wilderness Ranger G-”

“It’s...*you*.” Said a voice from the dark beyond the door. “You. Just. Just bring them up here. Leave them by the door.”

“Oh! Okay, what would you like, Mister? Chocolate Coconut is pop—”

“All of them. Everything you’ve got.”

“All—”

“All of them!”

The step backwards she had taken in fright became a stumble, she caught herself before falling down the steps.

It took a few trips, armfuls of boxes at a time, but she made it. The whole cart, save the cart itself, was now to the left of the door.

“How much?”

“Umm.” She did the math on her fingers. The voice beyond wheezed as it waited. As she said the sum aloud, she was worried there would be anger.

Instead. “Okay. I’ll get some money.”

The door closed and she heard a heavy thud. And then another. Wheezing, coughing, cussing. The screech of furniture being pushed aside.

More thuds. More grunts. The door shook and rumbled...and then it opened once more. A cookies width of darkness in which the Wilderness Ranger Girl could see the glint of a hungry eye in a sweat-shined face. 

“Your money’s right here. Just reach in and grab it.”
