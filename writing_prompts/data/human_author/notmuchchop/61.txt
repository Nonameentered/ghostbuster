There are many problems that I have with magic. Many many, in fact. Primarily: it doesn’t make sense or stay in keeping with the natural laws that make this world possible.

Making something from nothing? Doesn’t make sense! 

Not to mention the syntax is arbitrary. How does magic know what fireball means? Or if its said slightly wrong? Why does it care how I swing my wand?

Also, it’s all a bit elitist isn’t it? Why of course the rich families have the most famous and most powerful Casters. It’s in their blood, you see! 

Puh! In their *privilege*, more like.

Heh. Hehehe. 

I pull a small, red-covered notebook and a black pen from my robe — I’m not one for the whole PocketScroll and PortiQuill thing. Among my sketched and other notes I jot down my latest quip.

In their privilege. Classic.

Screams? As they are quite common in the mayhem of a haunted castle filled with untrained student magic users, we’ve all acclimatised and ignore it. Usually. But, these screams are coming down the hallway towards me.

At speed.

Ahead of me is the rapidly approaching form of Liam Quimbleton, boy prodigy, orphan, and likely some form of chosen one. Behind him is a ghost bear giving chase.

Wait.

The hall is empty save us three. Crap. In my contemplations I had wandered of the populated path of the main halls. You don’t want to be alone in the Castle. There’s danger, sure, but more likely you’ll get swept up in a story.

And stories have endings.

I step aside.

And, despite my better judgement, stick out a foot.

Liam topples over, face plants the ground. The bear keeps running and fades away.

“He was chasing because you were running.”

“You saved my life!”

“I absolutely did not!”

“Why, I owe you a huge debt!”

No. No-no-no. Can’t get caught up in his wake. It’ll get me killed. Quick Daff! Run away!

 “Anyways, I’m off. Bu-bye now!” And with that I ran back to the main hallways, hoping beyond hope that my part in his day was short enough to be forgettable. 

But...to my dismay I heard Liam, center of the story of the Schools latest spate of mysteries, say: “What a mysterious girl. I wonder who she is?”

Blast it!
