There was a *sizzle*. A sparkle!

But — alas — no pop. No ball of light.

No spell.

Glambert deflated — his robed shoulders drooped, his pointy-hatted head lolled forward, and his breath escaped passed his beard in a drawn-out sigh that started high and dawdled into a guttural groan. 

Yet *another* failed spell. The exam was in a few days time and they — his classmates and The Academy at large — would soon find out that he couldn’t complete even the most rudimentary of spells: Sanzall’s Floating Night Light. The teen snatched the star-stitched cone-shaped lie off of his head, shrugged of the unearned long-sleeved silk casters robe, and plucked the scratchy mass off of his chin.

The beard (a mix of varied rodent shavings) snapped back into place when he let it go. Glambert had forgotten his recent upgrade from the “hooks over the ears” model of fake facial hair to the more modern and secure “elastic around the head” variety.

“Can’t even take a beard off right.” He said, his mouth full of ratfur-based faux-beard and sour defeat. He lifted the chinchilla-skin chin-warmer off and dropped it next to the discarded hat by his feet.

He was no wizard — despite his efforts and his wishes. Through luck and ample application of excuse, Glambert had avoided casting spells in class and had kept his ineptitude and inability a secret.

And in a few days...his failure would be laid bare for all to see. With his uniform strewn about the floor, he was once more an ordinary, spotty-faced lad of fourteen. He was a bit too clean to be a farmer. Maybe a store boy or clerks apprentice.

His small Academy Quarters had little in the way of niceties — some of the Professors grumbled that the students were being given things like *beds* these days — but, he did have a mirror on the back of his door. This he trudged the two steps towards. He wanted to see if he could guess what sort of ordinary loser he was going to become when the Academy boot—

“Gyah!” Glambert took a step back and lifted his hands in self defense. Not being much of a fighter, his defensive stance was much like his swimming posture (that is: limp hands, up front and at shoulder height, ready to doggy-paddle).

The source of his shock had echoed his dance, but not his expression. In the mirror was a Glambert, leaned back, hands up and floppy...though, instead of shock this non-wizard wore...a grin.

A wide and toothy crescent that screamed, well, if not crazy...certainly crazed.

The boy touched his face and the reflection did the same to itself. Glambert felt no smile. So, he blinked. A trick of the light? A symptom of stress? Tiredness?

A...a spell?

“Yes, a spell.” Said Mirror Glambert.

Non-mirror Glambert stepped backwards, slipped on a pile of weasel whiskers and sat heavily on his discarded silk robe. The cloth did little to cushion his flat arse from the flagstone floor.

“Kind of amazed it took this long!" Said a voice from the mirror. "I Hid this little trick in the Night Light *years* ago.” The boy in the mirror had sat too, but it had seemed deliberate and less calamitous to his coccyx. “I’m Sanzall, by the way. And I’m going to help you out with your magic, or lack there of, for a favor...or twelve.”
