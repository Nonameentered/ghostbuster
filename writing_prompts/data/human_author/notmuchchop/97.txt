“Listen.”

There were four of them with their arms around me. Their heads were low. Their eyes shut. The embrace tightened.

“We owe you much.”

“I-look, I think you have me mistaken-”

“There is no mistake.”

“It is you. Not the you we knew.”

“One we have just now found.”

“I don’t-”

“Shh. Listen. In another life you were our friend.”

“Our leader.”

“Our saviour.”

“Our *brother*.”

“I...what is happening?”

“We are giving thanks.”

“What little we can in this life.”

“We ran out of time in the last one.”

“Let us not smother him. We shall go, but know we will return to you. In this life or the next.”

And with that they were gone, off into the night without another word or glance back at me. No answers to the mystery they instilled in me. Just the warmth of a tight group hug.

Just gone.

Gone...like my phone and wallet! Shit! Fuck! Shit! God damn pick-pockets!
