They had met again by chance, as lost lovers often do. Gone, however, were the moments they had shared. Now they met in an abandoned house that had been blown half to hell. United this time by a different kind of chase. Time had passed and things had happened.

What once was was no more.

“You said you’d never be one of them. Now look at you. In the very uniform you *spat* at. Representing the same ideas you *despised* and fought against.” Evelyn shook her head but kept her eyes on his. A search was under way. Surely...surely he was still in there. Somewhere deep, maybe, but still there.

The peepers she probed offered only dour disinterest.

“So?” She abandoned the search and looked away. “What happened?”

His jackboots clacked as he closed the gap between them in careful steps. A calloused hand gently touched her chin and lifted her jaw, instinct drove her eyes off the floor and back to staring into his.

They were still the same eyes she saw a moment ago. Dull. Quiet. The glow and joy she’d known so long go was now only a memory.

“What happened?” He said in a quiet, tired rasp. “War happened. *Needs* happened.”

A tear ran down her cheek and onto his hand. He didn’t move to smudge its path or motion that the emotion was noted at all. A twin droplet escaped her other eye. “So. Hunger made you a bastard, then?”

“Hunger? No.” He drew nearer, put his mouth to her ear and in a warm whisper added: “I needed Dental Cover.”

A blink. A moment. She turned and saw for the briefest of flashes a man she thought she lost — a glint in the eye, a wry smile, a bad joke. And then he was gone again.

They were so near. Their lips so close. Millimetres in distance and three years in time. 

“Do you know what a spy is, Evelyn?”
