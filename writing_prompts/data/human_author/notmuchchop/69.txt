The screaming ever. The endless lament. The void of pain. The land of flame. The domain of darkness and despair.

Hell.

That was where I had been sent. And sent for good reason, I will admit. However, I had arrived and found a land unlike anything I had imagined. My judgement had been served in a vast and unfathomable plane of existence, one that lacked dimension and form, and that was mostly incomprehensible to me.

So, I had gathered that hell would be something equally disorienting and endlessly more...torturous.

Instead...

Before me was a vast and empty world of flat, grey mud which spread all the way to the horizon and was capped with dark and pregnant clouds that rolled on and on overhead. I discovered, as I turned in place, that I had had my bodily directionality returned to me and that this empty view extended in all directions.

“Ahem.” Said a voice at my feet.

As I looked down in Hell for the first time, I met the yellow eyes of a rust-brown beast about the size (and as I would later discover, the disposition) of a Canadian Goose.

“Welcome to Hell.” Said the Imp...and then he stabbed me in the thigh with a fork.
