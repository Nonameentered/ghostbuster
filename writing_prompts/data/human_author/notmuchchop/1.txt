The shimmer streaks of light-drive travel, a starburst of passing suns, stopped as I dropped out of L-Space. I had reached my destination. Pin pricks of light, some brighter than others. The stars relatively still and not flying by.

Something was missing.

“Damn nav-system, dropped me out of L-Space to early again.” I thought as I gave the StarScanner a firm yet friendly slap. The display set to work drawing lines and shapes between the dots in the dark.

A ping sounded and the system confirmed I was where I was meant to be. Earth orbit. Problem was there was no big blue marble, just empty space.

“Maybe it’s miscalibrated?” This thought fled as I took evasive action at the behest of screaming proximity alarms. I put some distance between me and the surprise space debris and turned the ship around...

There’s the old globe I called home. Just. Less globe shaped. And just less in general.

She’d been destroyed. Goodbye, Gaia. They’d gone early, those bastards. According to the eviction order I had until...oh. I got the time conversion wrong.

So I’m....*two* hours late? Heh. Well. At least no one knows. Not like anyone can—

“You bastard! You bastard idiot bastard!”

My comms lines are blowing up. Seems there be ships among the shards of the once spherical Earth. I have the rent in my cargo. This could have been avoided if I—evasive manoeuvres!

Whelp, not safe out here anymore. People are so quick to anger these days. Light-drive, take me out of here!
