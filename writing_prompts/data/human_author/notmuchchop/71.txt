“Those poor, poor bastards.”

“Who?”

“The bipeds.”

“Chickens?”

“The *big* bipeds.”

“Emus?”

“Humans.”

“Ostriches?”

“I said *humans*!”

“What about ‘em?”

“They’re nearing extinction. So few of them left now.”

“Oh, snap! Really?”

“Yeah. Poor things.”

“What’s causing it?”

“The extinction? Looks like a mixture of things. Environmental factors and a bit of over farming on our part.”

“Your part.”

“Its a combo effort, bud.”

“...wait. What we gonna do when they’re gone?”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean...we use all of ‘em pretty thoroughly. What’re we gonna use next?”

“...umm.”

“Ostriches?”

“...yeah. Maybe.”

“Anyway, I’m off to hang out on a chopping board. You busy today?”

“Gonna read this paper and then I’ve got a sneeze to catch.”

“Cool cool. Catch ya!”

There are five million trillion trillion bacteria and more than a quadrillion quadrillion individual viruses on Earth. We are, in comparison, near extinction.
