“The Vorpus SK-1500 S-Series is a milspec droid capable of guided and independent operations. The unit in question, example on screen, is a 1550 model with a custom long range rail weapon, adaptive gilly technology, and is Sat-check capable.” His suit was black and custom. Beneath it there was a broad shouldered body, likely modified. He was the sort to wear sunglasses indoors.

“Sat-check?” His suit was cheap and blue. He wasn’t as broad as the presenter, but there was no maybe about modifications. Both hands were metallic. His eyes mirrored orb optic arrays. “What’s sat-check?”

“He means it’s aware of satellite orbits and the advanced optics enable it to detect hi-mobility low-Earth-orbit surveillance satellites.” Her suit was navy and screamed corporate. Subtle lines traced under her eyes and down her cheeks. Her body was a top of the line full-cyber.

“So, it knows when we’re looking?” Said steel hands.

“Correct.” Said the Corporate Cyborg. “And that new gilly tech lets it hide in plain view.”

“Okay. So, there’s a robotic sniper-rifle on legs doing a Predator alien impression in the forest? Why’s that our problem?”

“We’ve lost contact and control.” Said the big presentation gorilla. “The few times we’ve got eyes on it...the trajectory leads us to believe it is heading towards a populated civilian center.”

Blue suits optics showed no change in the presenters heartrate, but he didn’t need a synthetic nose to smell bullshit. “You lost control of it?” 

“Yes.”

“Control was *taken*.” The Corporate rep sunk the lie.

“Bess—”

“They have the clearance and they’ve signed NDAs, Buck. The unit was accessed by an external party three days ago. We know that a software payload was implanted. One hour later the droid disabled remote access and damaged its remote antennae system.”

“A military spec droid got hacked?”

“Hence...private contractors like you and your team.”

“Interesting. About our fee.”
