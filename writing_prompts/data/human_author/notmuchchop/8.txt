There was a man-sized Rooster — complete with vast and proportioned red head-comb — and he was in the throws of a ribald bit of revelry. The Rockette to whom he prattled, who was actually quite receptive to his rude humour, stood with a hand on her rhinestone studded hip — every now and then she’d delight the room with a twirl and a head-high kick. The kick was given with a wink to the cock that had her attention. 

Not far from those two, on the cusp of joining their circle, stood the front and rear ends of a rhino. The grey-clad couple chuckled and spoke to a stripey shirted, dark-masked robber.

There was a scattering of Robin Hoods, only one of which matched Mr Disney’s vision and was both gentleman thief and renard (a fox for those who don’t know french). There was a bi-pedal rolling-pin, a lined and numbered ruler, a King (that is, a ruler of another sort), a rather sub-par raccoon called Gary who wore a grey shirt and had painted a black bar across his eyes, a yellow carboard tube with ridges that was supposedly rigatoni...

And there was a rat that was just a rat, and a smaller rat woman who kept jumping on peoples backs and screaming “Ratatouille!” The only way to cease the random rat-backpack ruckus was for the victim to allow the rodent girl to steer them to the kitchen and the beer fridge.

It was a good party.

A figure glided past the front windows and a moment later Benjamin knocked at the front door and then let himself in, skateboard under one arm ten-pack of hard-cider in the other. His friends turned to greet him and fell silent. Incredulous stares fell upon him, judgement from all the other party goers (except for Gary the Crap Raccoon, who was currently blind due to the sweat and paint in his eyes). 

What could Benjamin be?

If one didn’t dress for the theme? Then you couldn’t stay at the party. That was the rule and it seemed quite obvious that Benjamin was dressed...as Benjamin. Draped in his usual outdated, vaguely surfer faire.

“What ARE you?” Asked one of the many non-fox Robin Hoods.

Benjamin put his drinks on the coffee table, hopped back on his skateboard, and executed a perfect kick flip. He then, with practised carelessness, kicked the board back up into his hand, and then said with a sly grin: “Down with the patriarchy.”

Remy the attack Rat, who was trying to ride a blind crap-tier raccoon to the restroom, roared with laughter. She was the first to realise that Benjamin was a Radical Feminist.
