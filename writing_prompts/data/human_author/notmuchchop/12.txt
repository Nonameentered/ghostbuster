The headache struck like a flash of lightning and blasted the spreadsheet I had been eyeballing out of my thoughts entirely. A rhythmic thud of agony began and radiated out from the dead centre of my brain, a pain so strong that my eyes clamped shut on their own and my mouth swung open and offered a wounded “Guh!” to the empty office.

An aneurysm. The only one not working from home and I was going to die of a popped vessel in the brain. Alone. As swiftly as it had come...the pain disappeared.

I tentatively unclenched an eye and peeked at what would either be the office or heaven. What about hell? My version of the land of flames and torture would just be the office again.

What I found when my eye focused was a dim room. I was sat at a table, lit by a single, naked, incandescent bulb that buzzed and shined. There wasn’t much to light, however. Just me, the table and an empty chair across from me...all of this hung in an inky, formless void. The space was either to vast to light or the bulb was too weak.

Maybe the joint was painted black, a goths interrogation room?

I blinked again and sat down across from me. I mean: I blinked, and as I opened my eyes another me sat in the once empty chair.

Other me was much fitter, was better dressed, and had a stylish beard and a shaved and polished head.

I, that is the me that is me, well. I’m a rounder fella. I wear what fits. I keep my hair long to cover the parts where hair stopped sprouting.

“Shocked?” Said the Suited Me.

“Is this a dream? Did...did I—”

“Did you die? No. I’m you from another reality, I’ve got resources at my disposal and I’ve pulled your consciousness into this nexus space. Your body is fine and when we are finished here, only a few seconds will have passed in your world.”

“Wha-wha-wha...wha?”

“..articulate, aren’t you?” He smiled and shook his head. “Look, here’s the thing. I’m looking for a change. I want to swap places.”

“Swap?”

“Yes.”

“With me?” I pointed a finger at my own chest so we both knew which me was the me he wanted.

“Yes.” He said as he leaned in and pointed at me with a manicured finger. “You.”

He wanted to swap? Swap with an overweight, friendless, broke, fuck-up? “Why?”

“Because I’m bored and over-worked and tired of all these people needing me and wanting me. It’s exhausting. I searched the near by realities and cut down the list until I got...you. You, my perfect opposite.”

“You do realise—”

“That you have no money, no friends, a crap job and a tiny apartment you barely managed to pay rent for? Yes. Yes I do.”

“But—”

“This offer isn’t a long negotiation and lots of questions kind of deal. This kind of connection takes a lot to pull off. One time offer and I need an answer: do you want to swap places.”

It was too quick. All to quick. What would happen? Would I learn what he knew? Do I get his body? Pin codes, friends names, addresses? How—

“Now or never, bud.” He held out a hand and something in me cut through the panic and questions...my hand was in his before I realised I had done it.

He smiled and I smiled back. And then his smile was a little to wide and a little to wild. “Excellent! I’ll see you...well, never.”

The headache returned and my eyes clenched shut. I heard a laugh that faded into ringing.

When I opened my eyes I saw I was in a swanky apartment. A vast space with elaborate sculptures, paintings on the walls, furniture made of leather clad wooden swoops and prisms.

Something was on my head. I took it off. A loop of white plastic that was smoking, on which was a yellow and familiar square — a post it note. The message: Thanks, sucker.

The police barged in and pain returned. I was being tased.

Seems that I — he — was a con-artist and fraudster. Had stolen billions. Now he was off and free in a reality I couldn’t locate or identify. And he was in a place to start over, in a crap version of himself they wouldn’t think to look in. And I was here and someone had to go to prison...fuck my lifes.
