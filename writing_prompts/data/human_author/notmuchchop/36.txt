The problem, as is so often the case, was one of scope. We had thought up this fun little gift, thought up some fun ways it could be used to benefit the universe, and let Fate know how to play with this new game piece. Then fired it off.

The power manifested and...the kid died.

You see, he would learn about whatever he came into contact with. It turned on and he learned everything about what he was touching. *Everything*. Clothing, air, his Grandfather’s pocket watch (the intended first target), but...it didn’t stop there. The power drilled down. He learned about the molecules that made up the things he felt, the atoms that made up those, the subatomic particles that made up those, the hidden things that make those work, and then...well, Danny the intern calls it “The Knowledge Bounce”.

The kid now understood the fundamentals of the universe and the mysterious rules that make it work, and as a result....he realised that all of everything is just part of the universe and so touching a watch was really no different than touching a distant star. 

He learned *everything*.

Tiny little head couldn’t handle it and...pop! We quickly did an undo and tamped that power down a bit. Made him promise not to tell anyone. Yeah, he still remembers that he knew it all. Turns out Omnipotence is hard to scrape out of a head.

Anyways, things are going okay, but we could use more funding. How goes the Speculative Species Department?
