“A gravitationally locked, telepathic pseudo-dimension. Very fascinating. We use something similar for simple reminder systems, where you might use a—what was it called? Paste-it node?”

“Post-it Note.” Said St. Peter. He had an  elbow on his lectern and his chin in his hand. On his face was small grin below his tired eyes. “Gotta say, you are my first non-Earthling non-corporeal form. I am very excited.”

In spite of Peter’s words his tone suggested boredom.

“Odd. Your species shows no telepathic traits when alive.”

“Loss of chemical and physical constraint  coupled with societal indoctrination and simplified hyper-focus nearing brain death. It’s a stack of improbable bull that can be hand-waved with the Q-word.”

“...quantum, correct?”

Peter gave a hard blink and a smile. Nodding would have risked dislodging his head from its perch. “But, hey...it’s a living. Or rather non-living, I guess.”

“Of your human socio-linguistic quirks, I think sarcasm is my favourite.”

“Mine too. Anyways, welcome to heaven, there ain’t many folk here. Got any plans?”

“My race are largely telepathic. My physical form must have been destroyed in an accident. I shan’t stay long.”

“Gonna dissipate into the ether.”

“No. I have spare bodies on my ship.”

“...spares?” Peter stood upright for the first time in centuries. “Any chance I could...”

“Do. Do you want to come with m-”

“Hell fucking yes I do!”
