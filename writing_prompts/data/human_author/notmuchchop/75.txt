There was the usual walk-out through the crowd. Music blared. People cheered. The fighters wore silk kimonos. The ropes were held apart by each combatants respective team. The two beefcakes crouched through the gap made by their trainers and towelmen, and then they stood upright. The ropes were released, the kimonos were collected, and the men were sealed into the battleground.

The ring.

Just them. Alone.

With the referee. And a camera man and the announcer guy. In full view of fifty thousand people in the arena and millions accross the world via pay-per-probably-pirated.

There was the usual spiel about who in what corner had what colour pants. Also, how much did each man way and what were there last win streaks and then...it was time to fight. 

There had been mention of a title and a belt.

No mention of prize money. No mention of bribe money. The latter would have been useful to many folks, the boxers included.

A bell rings and things begin.

Earlier, there had been something of a snafu. There was this Boss, you see, who was the kind of boss that runs a “family” and gives bespoke and heavy shoes to people who also get a free ride to the pier. You know. That kind of Boss. Well, said Boss had sent a lackey to fix the presently occurring fight. 

The problem was, he had also told another lackey to “get it sorted” the day before. And that lackey had gotten the goal mixed up. 

So, what we have now is two bribed boxers dancing around each other. Both want to get a good, convincing hit and go down in the first round. Neither want to throw a punch, just in case they win.

When the booing started, the twin mobile piles of muscle stared into each other’s eyes. And they knew. Knew why the other wasn’t throwing punches. Knew why were both waiting to get hit. And knew who was a wore the tiny shorts better.

And then the bell rang on the most boring first round of boxing ever.

And now they knew that all bribes were off. And the fight was back on. Winner takes all.

NOTE: that went nowhere! Ahh well.
