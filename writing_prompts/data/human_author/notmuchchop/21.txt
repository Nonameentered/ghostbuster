“And with that...smoking is now illegal!”

There was practised applause and a general murmuring of consent and approval. “Yes yes. Very good. Well done, all. Well done.”

Hand shaking and photo ops followed and then the politicians receded into their offices to make deals with each other and money bag wielding lobbyists. Outside, news teams filmed their summaries in eerily clear diction, and then jumped in their vans and fled off to the nearest tragedy or local fluff piece.

Between the empty car-park and the piggy bank that is a government building, sits a bright-eyed intern on the white steps. She is reading what was signed. She may be the first to read it and understand the legal knots and vague phrases.

They had banned smoking.

All smoking. Anything and everything that causes smoke was now banned. Tobacco, barbecue, candles, guns...

This...was going to be a mess.
