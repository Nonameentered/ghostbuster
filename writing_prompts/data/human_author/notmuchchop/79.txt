*Mushrooms. Mushrooms? Gad-damn mushrooms!? In my lawn? I think flippin not!*

Kyle — eighty-five year old curmudgeon — knelt down on his ancient knees, which popped and crackled like a whip on gravel. He wasn’t meant to be gardening anymore. His knees were shot, his hips were bad, his back kept freezing up, and he had had a string of heart attacks, but...to blast with them darned doctors! What do they know! 

Besides, there were mushrooms in the garden. A bloody plague of the things, encircling his lawn! Well. A small encirclement.

A few inches. 

Eight mushrooms in a vague ring shape...but it’s the matter of the thing! It was Kyle’s garden and he should be allowed to garden it.

The first mushroom had bolted itself tight to the soil. Blasted bulb-topped bastard.

It was about fifteen minutes later, when Kyle was on to attacking the third mushroom, that things grew...

Not odd — well, a little odd — they just grew. Almost endlessly. And yet, they always had room to grow and were the same size they’d always been. The grass at the centre of the circle throbbed and breathed and never stopped shaking. 

And then, he realised the grass was much further away then it looked. Were those trees from far above?

Kyle reached towards the portal.

“Is he okay!?”

“He’s fine, Cass, he’s fine. No heart attack. Just...a broken wrist.”

“Wha-how? Did he fall?”

“He was gardening-"

"Oh for crying out loud."

"And...he had a contact reaction to a mildly psychotropic mushroom. In a daze...he punched the lawn.”
