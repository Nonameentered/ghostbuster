“Excuse me—”

The man turned and the look of utter shock he served stilled me. For a moment I wondered if I had somehow said something significantly more sinister, but as I checked my mental records this thinking passed and I found my hand had lifted and touched my face, checking for some unnoticed mask or monstrous transformation.

Nothing out of the ordinary.

Still shaken by the shoplifters shock, I decided to continue: “Excuse me, you haven’t paid for that—”

“How?”

“If you come this way, I can—”

“No, *how* can you *see* me?”

At this question I realised his initial world-shaken stare was earnest. His reality had been disturbed by my presence — a pond set to mayhem splashing by a pebble...such is the effect of an outsider on the waters made of madness or other lesser mental maladies.

His silent surprise continued and did not warp or veer into fear.

“How? The handbook...”

“The handbook?” I did not necessarily want to engage in the shoplifters worldview, but did not know how to proceed. I gestured towards my manager and saw her turn her gaze towards the armoured cabinets that held the cigarettes. I was alone.

“The employee handbook, lad.” Said the Shoplifter who turned once more towards his cart. “It says you have to keep an eye on the customers.”

“...Correct.”

“Did I pay?”

“No, that’s why I stopped—”

“Then, I ain’t a customer am I. Mind your business.”

I heard what sounded like my manager laugh. This was an interaction she had no doubt had before and one I had to handle to learn the job. 

I hate this place.
