Some deliverypersons ring the bell or push the button — they let chimes and dings and dongs sing their arrival. Others shout and announce their presence in the present with your presents.

There are those, the evil ones, that leave a slip in the door and say they missed you...despite the car in the driveway and voices from within your home. In this day and age there are those that wave at cameras, those that leave the parcel on the porch, and those that frisbee boxes on the lawn.

Me? I’m the one who knocks. I rap my knuckles on the door frame with a rat-a-tat-tat, or if I’m in a cheery mood: a shave and a hair cut (two bits).

The others? Mere Delivery People.

Me? I’m the god-damned Mailman.

Also, a Uber Eats driver.
