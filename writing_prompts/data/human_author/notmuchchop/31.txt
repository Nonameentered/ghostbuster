“Open the door!”

“Whooo is it?”

“Fuck off, James! Open the *fucking* door! Help for crying out—”

“What’s the matter, Mark, forgot your keys and need to shit again?”

"I'm being chased by a Roomba!"

“Ha! What!?—” It was then James heard what sounded like a tank — as in a big armored mobile gun, a *tank* — trundling down their suburban cul-de-sac. Out of curiosity he opened the door and was immediately run over — not by a military vehicle, sadly, but by a panicked, cuss-spitting, irate housemate.

When James sat up he saw a black prism the width of several tanks and branded with Roomba. And it was moving at speed. 

Towards him. 

James screamed, slammed the door shut and was relieved that as he pressed himself against the flimsy wooden barrier...he was shoulder to shoulder with his bestest friend: Mark. Mark, whom he had never tortured and even if he had it was only ever a joke, even if Mark did shit himself that time, and God — who they’d both be seeing shortly — would know that. Right? 

They realised they were embraced.

They realised the noise had stopped.

Each took their vision from tight closed lids to almost as tight squints, expecting to find pain and maimery. Instead: pals and memories. They were alive, together, and in their undestroyed house, filled as it was with junk, photos and a stack of dishes that grew on spite and now...a certain scientific bent.

How high *can* unwashed dished go?

A sigh of relief escaped them in unison and was quickly sucked back in and clenched as a red laser scanned through the window to the left of the door. Through the window to the right of the door. 

Stopped.

The Roomba started! But, mercifully, it turned and went to hoover up the streets once-prized garden beds and custom mailboxes.

“What. The *fuck*, Mark?!”

“I.” There was a pause. Mark was still in shock and very out of breath. He’d run a long way. A long way for him. “I. Was. Was at—”

“Your stupid gadget convention? They made that!?”

“They. They ordered...an upscaled model. You-you know? For the booth...the manufacturer...misunderstooooo—” Mark's body, realising the running was done (for now) switched him off, which is a clever thing biology can do. 

Shame that some biology doesn’t thoroughly read spec documents.
