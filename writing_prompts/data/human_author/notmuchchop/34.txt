The bridge was little more than a pile of stacked and mangled plastisteel, snaked with ruptured conduits that spewed either sparks or fog. The crumpled mass was painted red with warning lights and blasted with sirens and a garbled computerised voice.

“Warning. War-ning. Warn-worr-ar-arn-ning.”

“Computer: silence all.” He couldn’t hear himself above the cacophony, but hoped she would. “Clear alerts.”

“Warn-war...” The Bridge of the Juniper 8 fell silent and the crimson flashes ceased and let the sparks and few remaining pieces of equipment light the Captains final moments.

What a mess. What a God damned mess. His crew had called him a cave man, lovingly, for that kind of thing. The old cuss words. Old phrases. At least they were safe.

“Suh. Suh-sir.” Said the ship in a far calmer tone than she had used but ten seconds before. “We are-are-are being hailed.”

Rescue? There were no other ships out here save that blasted Valar Pirate. And the escape pods. The fools! He opened his mouth and had to wheeze past something in his chest: “Open. Comms.”

“Earth Captain.” The distinct chatter of vibrated micro-incisors overlayed with and auto-translators monotone. The Valar Captain. He’d survived the ramming. What a bastard.

“Earth Captain?”

“Call to gloat?”

“Hardly. Your...” There was a squeak, a hiss, and no translation. Hopefully the prick was in pain. “Your gambit cost me dearly.”

“Me too.”

“Your crew survives. They fled at your order.”

“Your weapons didn’t lock?”

“Weapon systems were down by then. And.” Another squeak, now a squelch, and almost human cough. “And we don’t attack lifeboats.”

“Good to know.” His own lungs gave in, made a harmony with the pirate’s. A few moments of wet splutters filled the comm lines. “I’ll remember. For next time.”

“Humour? Correct?”

“Yeah. A joke.”

“So you know then. Where you and...” A grind, a squeal. “Where we are headed? You know?”

“It was. Agh! The *plan*.”

“I see.”

“Get my crew out. Make sure your ship couldn’t attack. Prevent scrappers. No Terra-tech and or codes in the wrong hands.”

The reply came in Valar insectile chortles and clicks, no translation. Idioms were not instantaneous. Then: “A neat bow on a horseshit cake.”

“...yeah.” The captain couldn’t help but laugh. There was only so much the computer could do.

There was silence for a while, save the sparks and hissing gas lines. He didn’t know why but the Earth Captain asked: “What about your guys. Your crew? They. Ak. They get out okay?”

“They did. They ejected via gauss-sling. We can survive —zyack!— survive the vacuum of space. The hive shall find them. One day.”

“Good.”

“Yes.”

“If. If you didn’t. Call to. Gloat.”

“You sound weak, Earth Captain.”

“And you. Sound like shit...in a blender.”

Silence. A moment. Then a musical buzz and robotic laughter.

“Analogies don’t work, do they?”

“No. They do not.”

“What. What’d it say. In Valarian.”

“Our language is Valari. I couldn’t translate. You lack the anatomy.”

The Earth Captain laughed, coughed, hacked, and then felt the drip of what he’d spat fall back on his face from the debris. He was trapped. A punctured lung and likely worse. Trapped in a ship that had been impact-welded to an alien vessel, and this new hybrid was powerless.

...Adrift and being pulled towards a blackhole.

“Any. Any idea on when?” Asked the Human.

“No. I barely got comms online.”

“You gonna tell me. Tell. Why?”

“...Why call?”

“Mm.”

“The Valar are a hive in *function*. Sing-yarrrshzht-agh! Ah. Ah. *Single* in *mind*. To die alone. It is not our way.”

“Well. What. What’s your story? You always. Always want’d to be...a pirate?”

“No. I wanted-”

“Name.”

“Pardon?”

“Your name.”

“Cavanock.”

“Nice. Nice to meet you. Cava...cavanock. I’m. Cap’n. Bill Trem.”

“A pleasure, Earth Captain, Bill Trem.”

“So. Start.” He breathed in the soup made from and in his own lungs and coughed out “from...from the start.”

“...I was...*born* on a planet called Asberack, a colony.”

And so they talked and waited and when eternity came, they were not alone.
