There is a place for those who have lost what the Owner calls: a that or a they. A place one can sit and wonder where their “what”s went or whet their whistle with a whisky and wish their “who”s were walking with them still.

This story starts in this specialised speakeasy, but the star is not the usual clientele. No no. Give them a moment, they’re just coming down the stairs. They’ll be a moment yet.

The jazz band plays soft and sullen. A snare like sprinkle, spittle, specks of rain; the piano slow and meandering, lost and lonesome; the sax had had it’s heart broken and so: mumbles, hums and sobs. The singer, similarly disposed to her band and their instruments, susurrates some sad siren song of...well...loss. 

An ode — not one to a soul...but, instead...a sock. She, like many at the bar, had lost a That and not a They.

And then our star arrived. 

In this age of prohibition, anxiety is an asset. No one spun or glared when the door was opened, but each took their turn to take a peek and decide to stay or run. Most often this was subtle. Worry is uncool.

Everyone stared. The silence spread. The vocalist squeaked as her instrument shut-up shop in shock. The snare rattled on for a moment before the rhythm released the drummer.

In the doorway of the Lost Souls Bar stood...a solitary sock.

It did not belong to a patron or the band. No grand reunion was to happen in this moment. None could call it theirs. The Singer had recognised it immediately, however. That Monogram!

It couldn’t be...

“Where in the *fuck* is Henry.” Asked Rightsock. Evidently a That that lost a They.
