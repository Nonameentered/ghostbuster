“No-what!? No. No! No way — what!? No. Nooo. Nuh-uh. Are you-what!? No!”

Hal stood frozen. His back straight, one hand low and near the ground with the opposite leg stuck out and stretched in the brisk morning air — a “golfers pickup” his father called it. Better for your posture than a back-hunched bend and easier on the knees than the oft-touted knee-based crouch.

Lucifer continued to present his disbelief at the cause of this sudden display of country club yoga; and did so with a poorly shuffled deck of no’s and other monosyllabic noise: “No-eyurk! No! No, Hal-urk-no way! Byrk!”

The non-golfball bounty now collected, Hal stood upright. He tied a knot in the plastic dog-doo bag. “I mean. I can’t just leave it-”

“Why! Why not!? It’s-Hal! *Hal*! It came *out* of it!”

“Yeah. What if someone step-”

“How can you jus-urk! You touched it!”

“It’s in a bag, mate.” Hal lifted the (thankfully opaque) green baggy, but the knowledge of the contents and the warmth born condensation made the Prince of Darkness dry-heave.

“Eurk! Hide the b-urk! Hide-the-bag-hide-the-bag! Oh, fuck me-yurrk! I’m-gonna-hurl-I’m-gonna-*fuckin*-hurl.” The horned gent turned his back and placed his hands on his knees and he braced for whatever might come forth from his other-worldly oesophagus. “Fffuck!”

“Sorry.”

“Why would you le-urk-let that *thing* do that? Hal! Why!?”

That thing — an elderly Pomeranian called Gustaf — blinked and then yipped. 

“I don’t *let* him, he *has* to.”

“Wha-!?” Lucifer turned to face his guide and quickly returned to pre-vomit formation on catching sight of a certain baggy again. “Hoo-boooy. Ffffuck. Why-*WHY* would it *have* to?”

“It’s...wait, it’s part of digestion. Do you...do you not?”

“I come from a *civilised* time! We don’t do-wait-wait-wait.” The thought struck like  a slap. “Oh, fuck! Fuck no! Do...do you? Hal, do you do that too?”

Hal didn’t know what to say. But, given how green the red-skinned hell-dweller looked, the silence had been answer enough.
