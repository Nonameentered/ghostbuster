*And so it is,*

*My special Miss:*

*I wish to peck,*

*Upon your neck—*

"No. *Terrible*.” 

He crumpled up the sheet and threw it over his shoulder. The wad of paper landed on the rug, nestled next to its balled up brethren, another in the flock of discarded, rhyming, courtship.

Behind him, beyond the meadow of mangled devotional verses, there was a fireplace that lay cold, empty, and lifeless. Were it lit, one would see his quarters to be a spacious room, albeit one filled with dust and clutter, and styled in a manner of some century passed.

Heavy velvet curtains stayed the world beyond the windows and most of the furniture slumbered under dusty sheets. At his small writing desk there was a solitary candle that struggled at it’s work.

*Thou beauty does beguil,*

*Whips my fancy, lust is riled—*

Scrunch scrunch.

“Blasted bloody words.” The writer, a lean and soft featured fellow, puts down his quill and rubs his eyes. The pale white of his skin almost glows in the dark and by the candles flickered light one can see he is quite beautiful. There is a delicateness to his visage, a poise and grace in his movement, and under this all there is a sense of coldness, of mystery...of danger.

Such it always is with Vampires.

Once more, he takes up his quill, dabs it in the inkwell, and finds a fresh and empty sheet. Silence. The words would come. Surely there are words for how he is feeling and they surely would rhyme, because she is a song that sings within his heart...always.

*You are in my beating heart,*

*And so I try this rhyming art.*

*I wish to taste your loving kiss...*

"Kiss...hmm.”

He tapped his chin with the feather end of his pen.

“I wish to taste your loving kiss...

And...and...urgh!”

Scrunch scrunch.

At this rate she was going to have lived a long and happy life and died of old age without him ever saying how he felt. His father had warned him, always rambled on about not falling for a human. And what did he do?

He fell and fell hard for a creature who paid him the slightest kindness, treated him like a man and not a monster. Such a beautiful thing. Her form and her heart.

“You are a siren.” Wrote the Vampire. “And I be ‘mirin’...”

A moment passed and he fed the sheet to the candle. This one could never ever be found. Ever.
