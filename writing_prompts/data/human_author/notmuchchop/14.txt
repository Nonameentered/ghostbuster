“I just wanted to say that...its okay.” Her arms were wrapped around him, her head nestled under his chin.

“Um. What’s okay?”

“I know it’s likely a compulsion.”

“What are you—ohh. You found the...”

“Yes, the gloves. All of your gloves, the piles and piles and...why aren’t you hugging me back?”

“Hm?” He had kept his hands high and out of reach. No sense in accidentally touching her and...

“Why are your hands up? Oh! You’re...not wearing any. Do you want me to fetch a pair. Another compulsion? Germaphobia? Please, babe, I know about the gloves in the attic. Share with me. Open up. I don’t *care* about problems, I *love* you.”

“I’m not a germaphobe. Or compulsive.”

She let go but kept her forehead on his chest. A soft voice reached his ears. “Do...do you not trust me?”

His heart ached at the phrase, at the hurt it held. He lifted her chin and met her gaze.

“Babe, I love and trust you more than—crap!”

“...more than crap?”

“No, I — shit, I wasn’t thinking!” He lifted his eyes and beyond his girlfriends auburn haired head was his girlfriend. Again. 

A clone.

Just like the gloves.

“Ohhhh, man. And I had been sooo careful.”

“Who the hell is that?”

“Me? Who the hell are you?”

“Fffffuck.”
