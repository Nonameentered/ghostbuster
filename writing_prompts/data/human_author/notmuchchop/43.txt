There are many hidden places in the Storm Shawl Mountains...rumours abound of Elves in ice-crystal palaces and of buried deep-rock Dwarven cities. Cliffs alive with whole societies that have ne’er been seen. There are many mystic monasteries hidden among the cliffs and storms if the songs are to be believed.

And we haven’t gotten to the beasts and evils that call that wild, frozen wasteland home. Ice-Wyrm. Frost Witches. Snow Golems. Bleak wolves. Abominable giants. Cave trolls...

Vast dragons that rest for millennia, disguised as a string of snow-capped peaks. Waiting for some poor fool to wake them and know their wrath...

Sir Plemmot had, like many Knights before him, announced his plan to pass through these lands; so unworried was he by the songs and stories and maps and first-hand accounts of loss and misery, that he sought to accomplish this with no army or backing save himself, his steed, and his squire. Those of the tavern who had heard his words knew that he was either brave or foolish. They raised cups to his efforts and cheered his name.

Blarn — Sir Plemmot’s Squire — knew, like many that lived a life in the orbit of heroes, that bravery and foolishness were often synonyms. Thankfully, he also knew that Sir Plemmot was all talk.

Well. Not *all* talk.

Some of the stories were true. Plemmot *had* fought in battles and rescued maidens and sought and found treasures...

...but the glory had been polished. The danger embellished. The maidens...made fairer...and free.

Blarn slurped his gruel. Yes: Sir Plemmot was *mostly* talk. And *completely* risk averse. There was no way they’d be going through the Storm Shawls just for the sake of glory and adventure.

\* * *

The winds whipped and howled. There was a thin and icy path that ran the border between blue-grey cliff-rock and grey-blue sky. Somewhere through the fog and snow-filled emptiness to their right — far far below — there was either jagged rocks or, as Blarn hoped and dreamed, there was some lost and ancient temple. One with natural hot springs. If one fell one would simply splash — not splat — and be quite fine indeed...

Also: said safe secret steamy sanctuary would no doubt be tended by beautiful peoples of all shapes and sizes...and each would be attracted to the novelty of a grimy outsider; why, they’d love to get to know someone with that certain servile quality one finds only in a once-serf now-squire. 

Blarn had learned years ago that fantasy was a useful barrier to both weather and worry.

The gusts and bellows, enjoying their game of “Let’s Knock Idiots off Places They Shouldn’t Be”, buffeted the party with a sudden flurry of changed wind directions.

As soon as they were out of sight, Sir Plemmot had lead his steed and squire off the path that lead to the Storm Shawl Mountains. They would not pass, despite his proclamations, through that frozen hellscape. Instead: they would hurry *around* those deadly peaks and arrive on the other side with some unverifiable tales to tell and riches lost, sadly, to the storms.

The problem was that Sir Plemmot had misunderstood the natures of cartography, meteorology, geology, and orology (which is the study of Mountains). Sir Plemmot does not know what orology is. 

Blarn does, however.

You see, the Knight was of the impression that the Storm Shawl Mountains were contained within a limited space per the border markings on his map. Said border determined where taxes flowed and did not mark the end of dangers or show where one could find safer, calmer ranges. 

And now they were on a thin and icy path, with a rock-slide ready cliff on one side and on the other...a long fall onto jagged, weather-veiled rocks...Or possibly a gentle splash into a risque resort. The wind screamed, the ice lashed, and the blizzard blinded.

The Steed lead the way. Sure footed creatures, you see. That had been the Knight’s reasoning. And quietly, if the path gave way at a step, oh well. Better a horse than a hero.

It happened — as life so often does — in a blink. Blarn had been behind Sir Plemmot one moment and then in the next...there was a knight-sized gap and the vague storm-veiled shape of a horses hind-quarters getting further away and more invisible by the second. The Squire stopped — none-to-soon — and looked down. 

The path had given way.

Sir Plemmot had fallen and likely his scream had mixed with wind and gone unnoticed by steed or squire alike.

Blarn waited for a splash...and heard a distant *gong*. Someone’s act was over. When the fellow looked up he saw only storm. The Steed had continued on — disappeared into the white-out winds and deserted him.

He hoped the old trotter would get somewhere safe and warm and green. A good, long retirement. The unnamed beast deserved it after carrying around that bloated sack of self-congratulatory, armored ego for all those years.

All those years as just The Steed.

Behind Blarn was a path lost to the storm. Ahead? No way to progress as there was no longer a path to take. And the truth of the matter was, as much as Blarn had fought the realisation with near-erotic fantasy, he knew he was near frozen and near death anyway.

Maybe he’d be included in the song about the brave Sir Plemmot who was lost to the Storm Shawls. It was unlikely, though. Squires rarely made the songs and when they did it was usually the oft skipped and forgotten later verses.

The serf, now no longer a squire, realised he had toppled, *nestled* into the snowy path. He felt strangely warm. Ah, well. All in all it hadn’t been a bad life. He’d been fed. He had travelled.

Could have gone without the beatings and the insults...

The winds placed their hands beneath him, lifted him, coddled him. They said things in his tongue to him. Can’t be dying out here like this, traveller.

Strange, thought Blarn, why would the wind have ropes with which to pull me up the mountain?

He hoped there were hot-springs in the Great Beyond. As he ascended he heard angels talk and grumble...a bless-ed wing-ed one was complaining about having to pull a horse up here. Un-bloody-fair, how comes you gets the wee fella, Gav? Why’s I gotta pul up da bloody ‘orse?

Oh good, thought Blarn, there’s a working class of angel. I shall get along with them well, I think.
