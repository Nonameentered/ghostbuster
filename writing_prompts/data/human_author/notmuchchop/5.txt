Warning, device mismanagement detected. TempusTech Property has entered improper time-stream. Property is in possession of unauthorised party.

Home path routing. Time-line convergence pattern found. Initialising. Estimated temporal-actions needed to arrive at TempusTech home-base: eighteen jumps.

He’d be able to sell it. He would need a good fence — and they’d take a good cut of the cash — but he’d still come out ahead. Way ahead. These TempusTech Units, hoo-boy. They look shmancy as all hell and are a wrist-mounted pocket of folded up spacetime filled to the brim with—

The device had made no sound and gave no indication. It just took itself and the thief to a day three months in the past. A day when there was a bus coming along the street at high-speed. The bus was often there at similar times and at similar speds — this was its route. The variable was the passing vagrant who approached the bus broken man, ostensibly to help... 

The vagrant slyly snatched the timepiece and, amidst mid-street mayhem, fled. He walked a few blocks, jumped onto a train and was away. A later train than he would have otherwise boarded. As the watch had planned.

The time-machine calibrated, checked its route, and was satisfied. It’d kill the unauthorised party at his destination — a falling sign would do the trick.

Estimated temporal-actions remaining until destination: seventeen.

One moment he was in the elevator and then, he was falling down the shaft.

Twelve jumps remaining.

A golfball hit her in the temple and she toppled. The impact of her skull on the cement finished what the golfball started.

Six jumps remaining.

\* * *

He hit the pavement and became a pancake.  Fear and screaming had pushed away the question of where the balcony and building had gone.

One jump remaining. Space-time Convergence approaching.

I have never seen a corpse before. It is a mess of...of red. So much red and pink and bits of white bone. I fumble with my phone and see zero bars. Not even the emergency network is being picked up.

What happened? This wasn’t an animal attack. He’s in a fucking crater right in the middle of the hiking trail!

Did he fall out of a plane or—huh? What’s that? Came off the body, maybe its a phone and he has signal so I can—

“Initiating Jump.”

“What?”

\* * *

He blinked and found the world had gone mad. The wilderness has become a busy street, before him was a bright, glass clad building. TempusTech was emblazoned above the automatic doors. And far above the doors, near the top of the sky-scraper, shiny prisms zipped about at break neck speeds.

Drones. Big drones.

There was talk of a huge development plan in the papers, he remembered. Someone wanted to take the nature reserve and turn it into a business precinct. How? It had happened in...zero seconds?

A tall woman in a white bodysuit exited the TempusTech building and approached him. She held out a hand and offered a look of disinterest. “Why did you come to the bottom entrance? Eh, I don’t care, hand it over.”

“What?”

The white-clad worker slouched and sighed. “The TempusTech Time-Shifter Z-Series you’re holding.” She tapped the TempusTech double-T on her left clavicle, light danced around her head proclaiming her a certified representative and product returns officer. One called Chloe.

“Where...wh-where?”

Chloe, the terse TempusTech worker, snatched the time machine and began to poke and prod. It had alerted her to its presence and need for collection. Why was the owner being a jack...ass.

Her eyebrows crept upwards.

“What...what is, uh...wha?”

*He* wasn’t the owner or the authoised-party. He was just a poor shmuck from a near convergent time-line that the device had used to get home. The machines aren’t allowed to and, in fact, *can’t* travel without a living party in contact. Life is the secret key to time-travel.

“I...I...I...”

He was swaying. He was confused and scared.

He had been *used*.

And the poor shmoe could never go back home. He’d been torn from his timeline. If he went back...he’d just dissipate — fought off by the space-time continuum like he was a virus in the blood stream.

Poor guy.

“I-I-I-I-I c-c-c-an’t b-breath!”

Chloe touched his neck, the emitter in the fingertips of her glove applied a mild-sedative. The once panicked stare he held glazed over. Technically, he was now her responsibility. 

TempusTech would pay to have him integrated.

“Come along, pal. It’s your first day of work.”
