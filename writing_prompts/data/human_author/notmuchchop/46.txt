At every turn of the page my stomach fell further. Different pictures held the same faces in different places...and different times. This shouldn’t be a worry, photo albums track the slip of years and the travels of people.

The problem I have is that the faces do not wear the wounds of calendar pages, but the photos do. Printed digital pictures, crisp chemical photography, harsh flashes, washed colours, black and white, and then what appeared to be a copy of a silver plate photograph. Then a sketch.

The faces stayed the same — the people stared and smiled through the ages — the manner of their dress matched the era of the photo. How? How is it that they can go unchanged and yet...

As I close the photo album I choose to forget this all and never mention this manic moment of near madness. The cover label had acted at once as both salve and razor, and had turned my burgeoning insanity into burning shame.
