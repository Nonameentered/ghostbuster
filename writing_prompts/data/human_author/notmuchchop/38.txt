The teen took a few deep breaths and then pulled his hood up and got out of the car he’d burrowed from his step-dad. Liam hoped the shadow of the jacket would hide the horror on his face. Why did he agree to this? As he walked he tried to zip the coat up but couldn’t get it to run, he had caught his shirt.

Shit-fuck-shit.

Liam turned, cussed, fumbled about, and at last got the hoodie zipped. Thubidah-thubidah-thubidah. Nerves. Heart? A million beats a second. Pits? Drenched. Mouth? Drier than a sunbaked shammy.

Why the hell was he in this part of town?

He knew the answer...and it was a two parter: he wanted to impress Chloe and he’d promised he’d get her some...fun *stuff*.

The dealer was in a lamplit doorway just a few steps into the alleyway, right where Chloe said he would be. The criminal wore a hoody, too, but his manner was more relaxed than Liam’s. Just another day at the office. He was leaned against the door at his back, his hands were deep in his pockets. *His* hood hid his features from view as his head turned from left to right, a slow scan of area, first the deeper alley and then the street...

The dealers gaze didn’t seem to stop on Liam at all. The kid wasn’t even on his fucking radar.

“Hey.” Said Liam.

The dealer stayed quiet, kept up his surveillance.

Liam took a few steps nearer, cleared his throat and offered a deeper “Sup?”

The gentle pan of the street pharmacist’s head stopped. A silent moment filled Liam with dread. “Sup.” Said the Dealer to the alleyway.

“I’m look—” The teens voice gave out. He coughed, spluttered.

“Jesus, the fuck you want?” He turned his head to Liam, his eyes still shadowed buy his hood. “Come over here and give me the Sickness. S’wrong with you?”

“Sorry! Sorry! I, uh, I want—” He realised he was shouting and quieted himself. “I want some...*stuff*.”

The dealer sighed, took one hand out of a pocket and scratched his chin with it. The sound of stubble.

“Stuff, eh? What sort of...*stuff*?”

Liam froze. His heart had come to a complete stop and the air left his lungs and his brain, and his head spun. He had no idea what sort of drugs she wanted. What had Chloe said? 

An eon passed. Pills? Pills, wasn’t it?

He blinked and realised that the dealer was before him still, they had stayed despite the silence and years.

“P-p-pills?”

“Puh-puh-puh-pills? Wuh-wuh-wuh-what sort, cha-cha-cha-champ?”

“...what...what’s good?”

“Je-zus Christ on a bike. Go home, kid. Shit ain’t for you.”

“I have cash.”

“Then *fucking* pick something!”

“What do you have?”

“Sheesh! The usual man. Eckies, kay, milk-bone. The usual, you know. Some new stuff too.”

“New stuff?”

“Yeah, feelers man. Big right now.”

“Feel—”

“Fucking hell. Ahab, Hyde, Alice, Gandalf. Real ego-shakers. Make you feel like someone else. So whaddya want?”

“Okay okay...umm. I want...” and then Liam was saying things. He wasn’t sure what, he just said them.

“Cool, cool.” The dealer reached a hand back and knocked on the door he had been leaned against. It opened a crack and he whispered words over his shoulder. It closed.

They stared at each other.

“You ain’t gonna be stupid and do all this yourself at once, right?”

“No! I mean...no. I’ve...got a girl and-and friends.”

“Well well, kiddo’s havin’ a par-*tay*. Nice. *Niiiice*. Going to be two-fifty for this, you got cash?”

“Yeah.” He had three hundred in his wallet and as he reached the dealer shook his head.

“Not yet. Not yet.” He looked down the alley. Then down the street.

The door opened once more and a paper bag was put into the dealers hand without him looking.

“First.” He opened the bag and plucked out a pill, a red and blue capsule. “Heh. Hyde. Might do you good.” He reached out and offered it to Liam.

“..what?”

“If you’re a narc or a cop: you won’t take the pill. You want to buy? Prove you ain’t a narc. Take it.”

“But I...I have to drive—”

“Takes half an hour to kick in, that enough time? Cause either you take this now and a transaction occurs, or you get nothing...and your girl knows you’re a loser.”

“...I.” The girl of his dreams was waiting. This was his only chance. He grabbed the pill and swallowed it.

“Fuckin hell. Didn’t think you had it in you. Nice. Bit snatchy, but nice. Alright, cash me up, Casanova.”

Liam didn’t think. Just passed the wad from his wallet, took the bag, wedged it in his pocket, and turned away. Two steps later and someone grabbed his elbow.

“Hey now.” Said the dealer. Liam turned. He was about to be robbed or killed or...the dealer handed him his change. “Fifty too much. I ain’t a scab.”

“Thanks...”

“No problem.” The dealer made his way back to his sales stoop.

“Hey...uh...what...what’s this Hyde going to...do to me?”

The dealer took off his hood and revealed a bald head, a patchy beard, and a Cheshire grin. “Oh, your going to have fun. Say goodbye to nervous Casanova. Tonight...hoo-boy. That girl is going to meet the version of you that ain’t a little wimp.”

\* * *

Liam sat upright. There was no hangover. No headache. He felt...he felt *good*. A bathroom? A bathtub? The teen patted his sides and found no telltale signs of kidney theft. Also, found no clothes save a pair of satin boxers...that weren’t his.

It dawned on him that he remembered...he remembered walking into the party. That the everything seemed very distant. That colours were more. Just *more*.

He found Chloe and had given her the bag...

And then nothing. Here’s your drugs and then good morning to a bathroom. A strangers bathroom. There was marker on his left fore-arm, block letters: Call Chloe phone in sink.

Chloe had been crossed out. Beneath it, in looped letters, was the word Girlfriend.

“What the *hell* did I do last night?”
