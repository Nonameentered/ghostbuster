“Hey.”

She stirred the steaming tea and turned her head away from the voice. Why wouldn’t he take the hint?

“Hey. Hey you.”

With one hand she made a show of selecting a song on her phone and with the other she brushed her auburn hair away from her ear...and the bluetooth earbud it held. This, she thought, can't be a more obvious hint. A half second later she wondered if he’d take it as a flirtatious reveal of her face and neck. Creeps tended to misread-

“Hey! Hotstuff!”

Aw, crap. Her shoulders sank as she turned further from him, practically sitting sideways in the diner booth.

“Hey! Come onnnn. I know you can hear me, sexy. I just wanna chat. I won’t bite, sexy sweater foxy mama. Hey. Hey hey hey!”

This peaceful pit-stop wasn’t meant to be. She took out one earbud and turned to the pestering creep. She did not turn to face the diner proper, and instead faced the wall. Up on said wall was a novelty bass with a hat that, for some reason, had human feet.

“What?” Curtness was the best language to use on guys like this.

The fish lifted its head off the mounting plate and grinned. 

“Hey, sexy, why don’t you and I get acquainted. I’m exactly what you need, baby-doll!”

For the first time she read his hat: Fish want me, and women fear me.

Dear lord. He was definitely a fincel.
