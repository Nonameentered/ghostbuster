“A pox! *No*! A *Plllague* upon ye!” The old crone kneaded the air with her long, age-gnarled, black-taloned fingers. She whipped the green fog into whirls and waves — green fog that lay between *her* (the kindly witch who kept to herself) and the toppled over *brat* who had broken in to *her* house and tried to make off with a jar of Newts Eye-b— “No-no! A! Oh, ah—ummm. A-a curse! Yes. Yessss. A *curse* upon your ‘ousssses!”

Dear old Ms Drinkrum is a *powerful* witch. She looks the part, she lives in a swamp, is a brilliant brewer of potions, offers great personal advice, and a warm — as well as sticky — shoulder to cry on. But she struggles to make up her mind.

“No! No that’s not fair at all is it. Whole ‘ouses being acurse-ed. Poor Ma and Da dealin’ wit yer messes. Though. Shoulda raised you betta, they should’ve and...and where’d you go?”

The teen had seized his chance and bolted off into the swamp, and was practically running on water (aided by logs and logs that looked a lot like alligators in more light).

“Blast it!” Said the dear old Witch. But, she knew the curse would stick so long as he was in ear-shot. “A curse! A curse upon yer...mouthseses!...Mouthsees? Mouthzez...Ahhhh, sod it. Hope ya bloody food tastes o’ nuffin!”

And so it did.

\* * *

Now, despite what one might think — with Dear Ms Dreenkrom living deep in the Abysmal swamp and being a cuss and curse slinging witch, she is actually quite well liked and respected by the local townships. Many a localfolk had turned to her aid when misfortune struck. More than a few borrowed her ear when life seemed a bit...and potions! Oh, the potions!

Potions for crops, potions for making wind for fishing boats, potions for making less of the other more personal kind of wind (which, in a way, is a sort of love potion). Potions!

Why, more than once had a local lad run headlong into another lad on the long damp way back from her cottage something secret held tight, wrapped in brown paper.

“Oh, ah, Duncan. ‘Allo.”

“Oh! Its you, Phillip.”

“Aye. Just I. You...fetchin’ something from...you know?”

“Yeah. Yeah! For, ah, the crops.”

“Smells like Swamp Cedar and Brown Frog to me.”

“Oh...does it? Don’t know, ne’er had it before? For the corn crop you see there’s these mites and-”

“Yeah! Yeah. Ahem. Um. Works wonders.”

“...”

“For the corn crops, I mean. Mine were. Um. Not. Up to it. After the potion...stand-up crop, you know. Great stuff.”

“Oh..oh! Really?”

“Yes! Ahem. Yes.”

“...”

“Strong *all* session—season!”

“Yes, the-the season. Almost over it is. Best be off!”

“Ta-ta!”

“Bye!”

“Wrong direction...”

“Got turned around, thanks!”

All this to say that when she stepped out of the fog at the edge of the forest and into the festivities at the Summer Festival...no one was alarmed. Witches, in this part of the world, can make themselves invisible (so powerful is their paranormal ability to blend in).

Or...

Depending on the witches mood: they may want the village to hiss and whisper and then quietly, and a little later, quickly walk away from her.

A small girl tugged the Dear Old Witch’s skirt. Ms Drinkrum looked down and saw a snotty face.

“Hi, witchy!”

“Allo, Eunice. How’s dat ear o’ yours.”

“All betta is is!”

“...”

“O! Fank you, witchy.”

“No fanks yet, Eunice, lemme look.”

The crone grabbed said ear, turned it towards her view and leaned in. All without force on or fear in to the child.

“Hmmm. One more course.”

“Kay!”

“Send ya mum tomorr-no. Not tomorrow. Post festival cleanin’. Two days...wait! Busy I is in two days. Um. Tell ‘er come and see me.”

“Kay!” And Eunice, ear released, escaped and left the Dear Old Witch to be invisible.

Ms Drinkrum pulled her cowl down, stuffed  her cold hands into her warm sleeves, wriggled into a good hunch...and was off! At a slow waddle into the festival.

As she went, she was given space or welcomed as a passing stranger soon mysteriously forgotten. She also heard a few people get elbowed in the ribs when they said hello to someone with a very similar name to hers. Rules is rules. And rules in these parts is: Witches are invisible...if they say they is or look like they wanna be.

\* * *

She had mostly forgotten that damned nearly eye-ball nickin’ no-good-for-nuthin’ lad. But he was there. At the festival. Hadn’t come and begged for forgiveness or cried for the curse to be lifted.

She had assumed her magic had rendered him so shaken she’d find him comatose, or hear word that he’d changed course and joined a convent. Hold a tick, dear, he wouldsa...joined the boy...vent? No, that’s not it, is it? Thought the Witch through the narrator.

Could you please not do that?

Needed space to fink, I did. Bit flustered I is.

You’re getting in the way of the descriptions!

Right-oh, right-oh, sheesh! Keep yer knickers on. ‘for I go, was a boy convent called?

Monastery.

Manast-what?

Monastery!

No need to take dat tone, young man.

Oh for—SHE SAW THE LAD, QUITE ALIVE AND WELL.

Okay-okay, I can takes a ‘int.

He had not, in fact, taken himself to a convent or a man-a-stare—oh, for—*MONAS*-tery. The lad had taken his curse...and drank lemonade. Here and now in the festival, rather than lamenting on the outskirts unable to revel in the flavours of the bounty...he was on stage.

Eating and drinking.

For a mere Bit of a Snell (a fraction of a coin) you could go up against the No-Taste lad! Eat what he eats, drink what he drinks...and if you keep a straighter face, and keep it down, well then! You win one-hundred times what you bet.

Now, one-hundred times in these parts just means: a large amount. Could be ten Snell. Or, just as likely, Could be forty-eight Bits of a Snell...which is...nine Grabs of Snell. I think.

Eight and tree-quarts o’ a grab.

Shoo! You’re off being incensed (angered) by the fact the boy you cursed being so happy with the situation.

Oh! *Wait*. ‘Appy!?!

*There* she goes.
