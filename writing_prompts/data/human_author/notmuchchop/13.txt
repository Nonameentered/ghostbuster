The humble rubber duck: Bathtub friend for young and old, and home decor for those with kitschy tastes...or folks desperate to prove how quirky they are. Many a rubber duck spends little time in the water.

And why would you take a buoyant lump of plastic with you? Distraction for young and nostalgia for old? Puh! An idea struck when my niece handed me her favourite flexible floating faux-fowl friend and asked me, her inventor Uncle, if I could make him talk. She may have meant a squeaker...but I could do better.

Why take a lump of plastic into the bath? What if it could talk and socialise and swim about and kept track of your hygiene habits and was compatible with your phone for shopping and digital-assistants and...

I was at home and at my work bench soldering things together when the phone rang. My niece wanted to say goodnight and I had run off mumbling — which my family are used to...but I apologised and wished sweet dreams none-the-less.

A sweet idea. An actual little bathtub duck friend. One that could talk and learn and...what if it could socialise with other rubber ducks? 

This is where things went too far. I thought it would be cool to have the ducks be able to upgrade regular rubber ducks — not full features just communications.

What could go wrong?

A lot. A lot could go wrong.

In the world of Science Fiction and paranoid science fact, there is an end of the world scenario called The Grey Goo. It comes about when a nanite — a nano-scaled robot — starts to self-replicate in an unchecked and unstoppable fashion, taking apart the world around it to make a copy of its self that can and will do the same. 

Results: all the world, or a significant portion of it at least, reduced to little more than piles of grey and formless nanites.

Hence: Grey Goo.

My ducks, the buoyant bath buddies with batteries and brains...well, the end result was less grey goo and more...bright-yellow machine-toy uprising. They started getting smarter and smarter. And then they made friends out of rubber ducks. And then they realised they could make more things into rubber ducks and make those into friends.

And that’s a quick overview of how I ended the world...and why my niece is to blame.
