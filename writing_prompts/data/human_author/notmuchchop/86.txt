First and foremost let me get the obvious out of the way: yes, the ability to synthetically sprout spermatozoa spheres and successfully stitch said sets surgically on to whomsoever should ask — be they: they, she, he, or otherwise — was a huge accomplishment and a massive culture shock...

...it really changed the whole *ball* game. There. Are you happy? Anyways, on to my anecdote.

My aunt, a self-proclaimed member of the same-sex and double-x sisterhood of women lovers, thought the new procedure to be just wonderful indeed. Couples like her and her wife could — with a bit of cash and surgery — update there equipment and have themselves a baby in a ye olde and yet kinda sci-fi way. 

My aunt’s better half, who rolled her eyes at the sisterhood of women lovers line every time she heard it, held less adoration for the plum implanting procedure. In her opinion, plenty of kids needed adoption or fostering. Why, as well, is the world obsessed with the teste?

The technology could return what was lost  and adorn those whom Fate had robbed. But, getting testicles simply to produce a child seemed...

The counter argument was fertility treatments already exist, so on and so forth, and a lot of time was spent feeling out and getting a firm grip on how societies new nuts felt.

None of us could guess at how things would go.

Within a few short years it became all the rage to grow a pair. It was affordable, reversible, and easy. A month wait time and a day surgery. It became...the style of the times. 

Fashion balls where balls were fashion. What a time to be alive.
