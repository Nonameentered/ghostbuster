He put the helmet on, clipped the buckle, and pulled the strap tight.

“You do realise you have no need of helmet or other armor here. No harm can come to you.”

The skater turned and smiled. “I don’t feel right without it. Would’ve been here a *lot* sooner without it.” And with that he leaned forward and descended into the half-pipe.

Death watched as the fellow used momentum to launch himself from the other side of the pipe, out into the air where he performed a measure of acrobatics, before descending once more. Back and forth the once mortal went. Others of the now-deceased that stood atop the half-pipe watched and a few around the park in general cheered the skater on.

After a while the dead man landed, board under his arm, and trotted back beside Death.

“That was rad.”

“Adrenalin. I understand it can be an enjoyable sensation.”

“It’s more than that.”

“How so?”

They talked as they walked down the eight flights of stairs. They could have floated down or willed themselves somewhere else, but Death had noticed that the newly dead liked to move the old fashioned way.

“It’s...well, for me, it’s meditation as well. Pipes and big hills, sure: get the blood pumping. But, just pushing about town, or practising a trick. The repetition and the focus. I could find a calm...I mean, if I wasn’t getting frustrated at least.”

“I see.” He had always found this idea of calm to be fascinating. Humans were flames that flickered and spat and shined...and went out. How in that short and chaotic existence could there be any semblance of “calm”.

“So...you ever skate?”

Death in his current state was a ten foot tall, dirt-clotted skeleton that was draped in a fog of ash-coloured gnats. No. He did not skate. He did not need to walk. His form was symbolic. Where ever he was needed: he was.

“I’ll take the stare as a no.” Said the skater. “Do you want to?”

“...” Death tried to think of a reason not to. But, there was plenty of time here and no other excuses came to mind. “I...shall try it.”

“Okay, good good! Remember, keep *that* foot straight. Lift the other one, now push off. Good! Keep going, dudeski, you got this! Look I’m not even holding you!”

They sat at a small picnic table and were eating fries. A few others had joined them. Some of these newcomers had been here a while and others were almost as new as the Skater.

It was almost time for Death to leave.

“Hey, D-man. Do you poke into afterlifes often?” Asked a man in tiny shorts, whose board was long and thin.

“No. Not often.” Death ate another fry, or rather dropped it into the gnat-smoke that filled his mouth. “This was merely a curiosity. I shall need to be leaving soon.”

“Reckon you’ll come back?” Asked a small girl. Her board was wide and neon coloured.

“...” the spirit surprised himself. “Yes. I think. I shall.”

The table nodded in approval and offered the words of acceptance and support from their eras.

Death nodded. “Rad.”

And with that they laughed.

They were back by the gate to the park, just Skater and Death. The others had already said their see-you-laters.

“So,” said Skater, his eyes on the made for scale board under the arm of the ten foot tall skeleton. “I got you hooked, huh?”

“I found a little calm, yes.”

The young man offered his hand and Death took it. Shook it. And then left.

Such strange things that these humans do. And so many lessons to learn.
