“My first born?”

The hunched and hooded man made a series of rhythmic, repetitive, hiss noises — which to Greg sounded like someone using a hand pump to inflate a bike tire. The beast threw back it’s hood and revealed that the sound had been a laugh...

The serpentine head and fanged grin gave it away. 

The creature was some kind of demon-snake-man-thing. Mostly snakey in the head and speech, human in body, and atop it’s scaled noggin were the tell tale horns worn by udder havers or underworlders.

*Wait. Demon cows probably exist. Should be and/or. Oop, he’s staring. Greg, do something!*

“Sup?”

“Ssssup? Sssup!? You owe me a firsssstborn, that’sss whasssup.”

“Jesus, did you get elocution lessons from a kettle?” *Ow, that was mean, Greg. Also, what’s a Jesus?* “And that’s a no go on the baby, mate.”

“Ah, many a man hasss tried to forgo-”

“I’ve had a vasectomy.”

“A vas-whatomy?”

*Yeah, a vas-wait-one-tic-* And although they had met at a crossroads, both were surprised by the sound of distant hooves and the distinct clatter of horse drawn carriage. *You’ve got time to explain. Draw it out a bit as a distraction, you can jump in the carriage with Annabelle.*

“Who’s Annabelle?”

“What?” Asked the Snake-man-possibly-cow-demon.

“Doesn’t matter. Anyway, I can’t have kids. I had a procedure that means I shoot...my quiver of arrows is empty...does that work?”

“Wha-oh! Ohhhh!” Said Snake-face as his shoulders sagged and his eyes fell to Greg’s nethers. “You poor thing. You’re a Eunuch?”

“What? No! I just. My bits don’t let me have kids.”

“Ssssure sssoundsss like a eunuch to me.”

*It does sound like you're grapeless, Greg.*

“I am *not* grapeless, I *have* grapes! They just...don’t have seeds!”

*Put out your right hand and grab hold...now!*

And with that Greg the seedless, but not grapeless eunuch was whisked away by a the passing, galloping carriage of Annabelle.

“...just Annabelle. No additive nomenclature, Mr Narrator.”

...Annabelle the man-killer.

“Welllll. Fuck.”

“Whomever are you talking to, Sir?” Said Annabelle, the pretty and innocent and pretty innocent (lawfully speaking) maiden.

“...lawfully innocent?” Whispered Greg to the wind.

*She’s never officially been charged.*
