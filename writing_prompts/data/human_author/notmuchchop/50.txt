Jeremy doesn’t see the appeal.

Rocks and plants and some rocks that work like plants but aren’t actually either of those...and *fish*. Woopty-doo. Oh. And a couple of sharks of different shapes and sizes.

Some strange and circular flat shark floats by. Odd, sure, but not anymore interesting to Jeremy then say...a trashcan’s lid.

The guide asks if they know what it is...and mistake’s Jeremy’s reading ability for knowledge. Pictures and labels were everywhere. The boy wins himself an aquarium-branded, pirate-themed bandanna. When the guide happily tells him to put it on she flees his firm no and leads them on.

“Off to the crab tanks!”

Yipee. Pools and pods of hard-shelled *things* that have more legs than people do. Hooray?

He watches as his classmates ooh and aah and giggle and are reminded not to run. They pull at each other and point: “Look! Look!”

*Why? What’s so interesting?*

Fish? The shapes? The colours? Why should *he* care about any of this? Because its underwater?

*It’s as bad as the zoo,* thinks Jeremy. *They liked it there, too. At least it doesn’t stink here.*

Mrs Walters tells him to “stop standing back” and to “go have some fun”. “Explore the wonders of the oceans!” she says.

*Wonders? Of what? Trapped critters in buckets? It isn’t* real. *This isn’t sea* life *its sea* prison. *And even if we did get magic-school-bussed under the ocean, so what?* 

If he wanted to see colourful things floating about...he could just have a bowl of Froot Loops.

It was just...

Floaty...

Swimming...

*Stuff*.

Mrs. Walters walks the empty bus — one last sweep before it leaves. Despite assurances: two lunch boxes, a backpack...and a bandanna.

She sighs. It wasn’t lost. It was *left*. Cast adrift, like its owner.

“Poor lad.”
