“You’ll never guess who I’m related to!” Said Klayne as he stepped through the mist that wrapped about the newly returned time machine. He closed the vertical tube’s silver door with his heel. “Go on, guess!”

“Neraspom the Bastard, Deceased Inter-System Warlord, and the almost Emperor of the Galaxy.” Said Nav and Coll in unison. They were in their respective bunks in what was labelled the Older Kids Dormitory, but known by the children of the orphanage as The Back of The Fridge.

Because most people forget what’s in there and they are surprised to find how much it’s grown when they do look. Also no one wants any of that and so the only time it leaves is if it gets thrown out.

Klayne was stood, mouth agape, and thunder thoroughly stolen. The twins were — as was often the case — completely correct. The ancestor he had found *had* been *that* Neraspom. The bastard one. With the killing and the armies and the near total galactic control. After a minutes silence, in which Nav and Coll had continued to read in happy quietude, Klayne spoke: “How’d you know!”

“Firstly,” started Nav.

“You seemed a bit shocked.” Continued Coll. “But,”

“You also seemed pretty chuffed. So, it was someone famous,”

“But also dangerous. Secondly,”

“You don’t read books. So,”

“The reason you’d be surprised is because you’re stupid.”

Klayne squinted and offered an unconvinced rebuttal: “No I’m not.”

He wasn’t a moron moron. But, compared to the twins...

Coll lowered his book and stared at the time travelling teen. “Do you know who Ghengis Khan is?”

“Or Charlemagne?” Added Nav.

“Um. Charlie-thing was one of the original-original pokemons, I think.”

As Coll sighed and lifted his book, Nav sighed and lowered hers.

“They were both people from history that we are now all related to.”

“As the result of prolific progeny production.”

“And their position in the significant past.”

Klayne nodded and offered a “hmm” which was seasoned heavily with false interest. Behind his back, his left hand was busy blindly grabbing for the Time Machines door handle.

“It disappeared already,” Said Coll.

“You’ll have to wait for it to pop back through.” Said Nav.

Again, they were correct. The silvertube that was Klaynes time machine had left as it often did, seemingly at random and without fanfare. Coming brought fog and mist. Leaving? Nada.

The twins had returned to reading the moment it had once more became apparent that Klayne didn’t want to learn anything. The other boy sighed, waddled to his bed, and collapsed into it.

A half hour went by and Klayne rolled onto his back. He couldn’t believe boredom was about to make him ask a question. “So, what does this Denis Clam and a cartoon fire-lizard have to do with my great grandpa?”

The twins crumpled in unison. Klaynes stupidity very often hurt them both.

“He wouldn’t be your great grandpa.”

“There’d be more greats. And he wouldn’t just be your grandpa.”

“He’s everyone’s ancestor — just about, anyway. That’s what happens when you have a clone army,”

“Space Travel Time-dilation, and—"

"—an interstellar array of concubines.”
