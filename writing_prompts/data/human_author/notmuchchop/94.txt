“I...am feeling a mixture of...*three* things, I guess.” The Demon stared about at the grassy field into which he had been summoned, and then back to the kid that had brought him here. The beast lifted a hand and then extended a red-scaled, black-taloned finger “Firstly: Confused.”

The hellbeast looked down at his cloven hooves which were planted in the middle of stomped grass and gathered rocks...which made up the pentagram and sigils of a Circle of Summoning. He nodded and then extended another talon. “Secondly: *Impressed*.”

The eight foot tall torturer of the damned made eye contact with the kid. The bloody-nosed kid. The bloody-nosed kid who was staring him down and had summoned him in broad daylight with no candles and nothing but twigs, rocks, flattened grass and gumption. The Demon raised a third finger and smiled.

“And, lastly...I’m a little afraid, buddy. And...I. Am. *Loving* it.” 

The kid bleated. The kid — a baby goat — had summoned him to the mortal plane. This, whatever this was, was going to be good. Well, good for the Demon. So, bad for everything else.
