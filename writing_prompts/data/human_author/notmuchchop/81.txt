They first thought the boy was deaf or at least hard of hearing: he did not react to sudden sounds and paid no mind to shouts or screams. Othewrise he seemed to hear just fine. 

And so it was: the boy was not deaf. He just wasn’t worried by the ruckus.

And then they noticed that he didn’t fuss or care or even stop his play if his knees were scuffed and bloodied by a trip and fall. “Perhaps,” they (His Parents) thought “He may be one of those quirks of genetics? Born free of pain.”

Pin-pricks and electric shocks. He felt pain alright, but didn’t seem to worry at the damage that was wrought. Nor did the code within his blood show any sign of anything other than the ordinary...

A psychiatrist, one of many that the lad would meet, noted that the lack of worry wasn’t the least of it. There was no fear. No empathy. No desire to harm, for now, but also no real desire to do *anything*.

Odd. Odd child.

As the child grew from a boy into a teen and then into a man...things went swiftly south. Mental illness of the variety and depth that takes one out of society. 

A creature who could not comprehend consequences could not coexist with the caring masses. He never really harmed anyone, though. He was just...annoyingly, disruptively odd. 

Too difficult. 

The question is: was this madness in him all along? Or was it something brought forth by a life lived under the microscope and constant blood tests — was it something forced upon the boy by anxious parents who wanted a pill to make their child ordinary instead of...odd.

Nature or nurture? A touch of one, but mostly the other? Some form of layered genetics and trauma, perhaps? 

A personality lasagna. Ha. Ha ha.

Either way he was left to sit and fester, to rot forgotten by the world in a place once called Nuthouse — now called a Psychiatric Assistance Facility.

He didn’t — in fact: *couldn’t* — care.

“Things just are.” He said, again. And again. And again.

The Depths is where the Demon had been...before. 

It is a place not dissimilar in appearance and function to the Evangelical Christian’s view of Hell. It differs only in two ways. One: there is no Satan nor other ties to that religion in The Depths; and two: unlike Hell, The Depths is very very real.

It was here, among the flames and time dilating torture, that the Demon spent its early aeons. There it clawed at its brethren and the other unfortunate souls, writhing to free itself of the agony it had always known.

I shall not go into detail here, there isn’t time, but you must know for this story that the Demon succeeded at it’s escape. There was a time of floundering and near dissipation — death for the non-corporeal — before the creature managed do grab a hold upon our world and writhe and wriggle its way into our reality. 

Form, at last. 

But forms needs food. Sustenance. And so, the battle to remain unalive and existing continued. 

The smell of it enraptured the Demin. The taste? Divine! Though, it did not quench the hunger. To eat of this bounty kept the beast whole. Food at last. 

Fear, an emotion quite rich and pungent in the human soul, was to be the beasts fuel. 

He had known such delights in his home lands of the Depths. How strange it was to feel nostalgia for the endless shriek, the pain hidden at the edges of all things...

...home.

Sadly — for the Demon, at least — he found each tree of fear could bear only so much fruit. Some more than others, but still.

A few human decades passed and the Fear-feaster found itself in what was sometimes called an Insane Assylum or, more commonly, the Nuthouse. A buffet of anxiety and terror. An Eden of fear. New trees arrived almost every day.

There is a quirk of the parasitic pairing of possession. To exit one must either be expelled by external forces or, through draining the host, over-power the body and escape the dying husk for greener pastures.

It was in this strangely calm fellow that the third option was met by the fear-feaster.

Nobody cared to check on the host. No one noticed the possession. So, no investigation was made and no non-denominational holyfigure was summoned nor was a peer-rejected paranormal scientist was called. Expulsion via exorcism? No chance.

Worst still was that no one could have have noticed the demon as the host had no reaction.

And even worse still was that this tree was barren. There was no fear here. Not even a whisp of worry. The Demon could not drain the host and so could not weaken him, march this body to the next victim and spread.

The Demon was entombed in a stoic, unfeeling, oddity. Doomed to listen to a muttered mantra: Things just are.
