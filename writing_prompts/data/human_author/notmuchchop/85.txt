The first give away that I had been somehow horsified...horsificated?...that is to say, I am now a horse. Wasn’t always a horse. Quite a recent development for me. Either way, the first give away was when my morning alarm went off.

It wasn’t that I reached out with a hoof instead of hand — no-no: it was the fact that my bed was broken and had a *horse* in it. And said horse was staring into my eyes via the reflection in my ceiling mirror.

Ah, quick thing. I know what a ceiling mirror implies. And, I could lie to you and say with a wink and a smile that I am *eh-hex-ACTLY* the kinda fella that gets *use* out of ceiling mirror. If ya know what I mean. But to that lie, I say...nay.

...ahem. 

Look, it was there when I moved in. The mirror not the horse. I mean, well, I was there when I moved in and I am the horse, but at the time I wasn’t-

So, there I am at the we hours of a Tuesday morn and I awoke to find myself a little horse. My voice was fine and, thankfully, still human, because I used it to scream at the top of my lungs.

I’ve spent the past few hours laying here, scared to stand up lest I break a leg and get sent to the glue and meatball factory. Mostly thinking about horse puns, really.

Have I done a “why the long face” joke, yet?

Well, no time like the present. Can’t wait here all day, no one’s finding me unless I wait a few months. Right. Off to the races!

Har-har.
