He had his all knowing head in his all present hands. You see, in order to be a God of beings that possess Free Will, one must be at least a bit detached from them.

Sure, He was everywhere and knew everything, but he'd taken great strides to make sure he forgot some things and took his eyes of the prize every now and then. Otherwise it’s just an invisible loner having a game of dollies by himself.

And that’s just sad.

The creatures of this sector of time and space had seen his face in many places (a surprising number of times he’d been spotted on toast or in soups) and they had gathered his words and teachings into songs and stories and sculptures and...

And...

They had gotten some things wrong. Major things. His goal this entire time had been missed completely, relegated to a single line whose meaning had been destroyed by a typo. Those he had wanted to be lifted, to be ascended, had been neglected instead.

This whole thing was meant to lead to the creation of his chosen people. A slow process, but one from which an independent and peaceful race could have sprouted. 

He lifted his multi-pronged, green-leafed head out of his light-green and white hands.

“Blessed are the *meek*? The Meek!?”

There was only one choice. He’d have to start over again. God picked up a hunk of space rock and threw it at the planet.

This time he’d hang about a bit more. Less proxy words via angels and prophets, too. And less of those thinking apes, they were no help at all.

God, the Leek at the center of it all, got to work.
