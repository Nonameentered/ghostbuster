Beyond the muck-marred window there is mayhem. The once blue sky, now stained yellow-green by high-altitude pollutants and the ever rising smoulder-smoke of human ruins, caps the carnage in a fitting fashion. So broken is the world that the very sky we once pointed to as base facts, the sky is blue, now shows us an eerie and horrible *new* truth.

The whole thing is a mess.

A man is running for his life out there. In the distance. I can see him, just. I watch as the horde gives chase in shuffled steps. The tortoise and the hare. The hare will tire. Will stop. Will rest. 

And then the tortoise will catch and eat it.

In this new world dynamic the old and trite adages have new and bloody endings. Old hearts have new aches. Should I help the fleeing fellow? Probably not. This is the way of things now. We are prey. We are the cattle being mass consumed. What right do I have to interrupt the way of this twisted nature?

Does morality matter or even exist within this new apocalyptic context?

“Do you ever wish you’d studied, say, Engineering, Mr Paulson?” Says Callum, the last of my students and my only compatriot. He stands beside me at the fourth floor office window.

“Doctor, Callum. *Doctor* Paulson. I didn’t spend years of studying and decades in academia to be called *Mister*. And whether it’s the end of the world or not, my doctorate still holds value. Who better to make sense of all this than a Philosopher.”
