“No-no.” She raised her hand and smiled. “Let me guess.”

A grin pops on my face and I place my hands flat on the bar. “Do you need to stare into my eyes or palm read or—”

“Shush.” The bartender raises a finger to her lips. “I must consult the Bar Gods.”

And with that she closes her eyes and turns her face up to the ceiling. Her hair is silver and kept up with a red bandanna, her makeup is subtle save a deliberate slash of eyebrow pencil with some crisscrosses that travels down one cheek to her jaw. The manner of her dress, to put it plainly, is...pirate. A white long-sleeved shirt, a black leather vest, and a very piratey pair of blue jeans.

She is not a maniac. She works in a pirate-themed karaoke bar.

“A pint of Pool Duck IPA?” Says the mystic marauder of the high seas from the other side of the bar.

The title mystic had been earned, afterall, as she was was dead right. Pool Duck IPA is my poison of choice. “Now that’s a heck of a guess.”

 “Not a guess.” She said as she angled a glass beneath the tap and started to pour. A frown crossed her face a second later and she added. “Me hearty.”

“So. Do ye be a psychic or a psycho, ye salty-”

“You don’t have to pirate talk.” She said with a glare.

“Ah. Right. Anyways, care to share you secret, old bean?”

“Old bean?” A confused stare met with a wide smile on her face. She put the finished beer before me on the bar, then tapped the touchscreen on her register.

“You said no pirate talk and I...panicked.”

The laugh she gave me was short and polite, likely born of service industry practice. “I knew you liked that beer like I know you watch hockey, were born in December, work as an accountant and hate cilantro.”

I squinted at her. Oh no. Oh no, was this someone I know and didn’t recognise them?

“Two things.” She said. “Can you tap your card and pay, please? Aaaand also did you not pay attention to your shirt?”

I look down and saw a string of text above a skeletal Alvin the Chipmunk. With a sheepish look on my face and cheeks as hot as fire, I tap my watch on a puck near the register. At the *ping*, I know my beer has been paid for. 

“The shirts ironic. Its..its a play on those stupid elaborately specific shirts dickheads seem to get.” I pick up my beer and add salt to my own wound. “My Mum got it for me.”

“Oof! Come on dude, you just called yourself a dickhead and admitted that your mother dresses you.”

I lower my head and offer a sad: “..yarr.”

She laughs and I join in.

“Cass.”

“Trev.”
