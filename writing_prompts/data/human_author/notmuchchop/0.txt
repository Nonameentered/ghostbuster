The sky is blue and the trees are green. There are oceans and rivers and mountains and valleys. This is a world much like our own, save the fact that though the trees are green, they — like all life on this alien world — look and function vastly different to ours.

The tall sentinels that make up what looks at a distance to be a forest are in fact piles of knotted vines with green, inch-long, razor-sharp, barbed thorns. The brown leafy mulch of the forest floor is actually alive and not as leafy as one might think. It writhes with plated bugs and pseudo-crabs. The vine piles whip out and steal a snack back into their knotted mounds as they please.

Unseen beaks crunch and chew.

The Apex Aliens, the masters of this planet, evolved from a local variety of jelly fish. Time, chance, and evolution rolled them out of the oceans and onto land. Soon, geologically speaking, their bodily mass of busy cells began to connect, and fibrous forms of memory and thought took shape.

Tools and language. Agriculture and regular culture. Math work and mayhem war. Eventually...peaceful space exploration.

Mostly peaceful.

The Flump-Time-Lever, a gelatinous Faster-than-light engine, allowed them to step over the vast emptiness of space. The Auto-Splat-Detector let the Jelly-People calculate the nearest local planets with life-probability, and a few  FTL probes later...

An array of worlds ripe for life to begin. Some starting out. And a few that were already lush.

One planet in particular was of interest. At a distance it looked not too dissimilar to their own. Except this one had a rather boney view of life. A view that was large and sometimes feathered and...and...cool?

Dino-fever blew up for the Jelly People, not one soggy-sphere among them could avoid it. More and more of the strange beasts from the Third Planet of the Single Starred System were collected.

And soon...the reason for the caveat of “mostly” for the peaceful space exploration. The discoverer of the planet of the Dinosaurs had brought a swathe of them and huge hunk of their habitat back, and was making a fortune by charging an entry fee.

To protect its investment and prevent others from getting access to the source of his money making scheme, the capitalist blob used a probe to push a meteor into to impact path with the planet. And boom!

No more dino-source.

The park was now the only place in the universe where one could sate one’s dino-fever. Ticket prices tripled.
