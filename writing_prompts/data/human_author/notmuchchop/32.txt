As you well know, magic and your...techy-stuff...don’t mix. Does it? No-no. Don’t mix it, they says. I know it. You know it. We allll know it.

Don’t mix. It’s the metal, you see. Magic on a wood bow. Not a problem. On yer own hands. Same-same.

You try and push magic on a sword. Big No-no. Magic’ll remind you, quite directly, it don’t hold to that kind of thing. Doesn’t like to be trapped up and stoppered in the steel. In the iron. Gets mad the magic does. Gets *direct*. Quite direct. Seen it happen. Foolish to try. 

Now, now, hush. I hears ya. Enchanted weapons. Divine weapons. Magic armor.

Two ways that happens. One, the magic chooses. Seeps in. Nestles. *Wants* to be there. No way of knowing when or where or why or what. As likely to get a magic scourer than anything of use on the battlefield. 

Then...there’s option two for enchanted items...

Bigguns do it. Gods. Demons. Angels. They remember the secrets — know why Metal and Magic don’t mix when forced. They can get ‘em talking. Weave ‘em all pretty like in knots so they ain’t really touching, that’s how I reckons they do it. Them Gods.

Mmm.

Be a hell of a thing to have a man or, hypothetically, lets say...oh, an old Goblin...anyway, be a hell of a thing to have have someone on your staff who could make magic and metal...work. Be a *Hell* of a thing...wouldn’t it?

I leave my card right here. Made of fine human steel, I admit...stolen. The glow? Stolen too, I’m afraid, but a piecemeal man makes do. Card sings a pretty song if ya shake it. I’ll show myself out.

The card knows where to find me.
