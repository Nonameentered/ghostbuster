<2/3>

Rowena was piping some fresh cream into the apple-caramel turnovers when the door creaked and chimed. She looked up and gave her practised smile to the young woman who entered.

The customer grinned back...but the worry in her eyes, sweat on her brow, and redness of her cheeks and neck flagged the facial arc as false. Poor dear needed more practice.

“How can I help you today?” Was what Rowena said. What she thought was: you better not be here for witchery.

“I was wondering...um. I. If you would...”

Rowena smiled. Blinked. Waited. Love potion. This one was going to ask about a love potion. *Idiots*. She was a sweet young lady in a yellow dress and matching broad hat, with a face full of warm embarrassment and a stomach that was no doubt filled to the brim with butterflies.

“Umm...I...What...” The love-sick lass leaned in and — despite them being alone — whispered: “What would you recommend for...a date?”

The baker lifted an eyebrow. Maybe she had been wrong. First date jitters? A picnic with the boy the parents forbade?

“To get one, I mean.”

Oh, for crying out loud.

“My friend Mark. He. He bought your magic donuts and—”

Rowena’s fists hit the bench with a mighty thud...and a moist *splat*. Alas, one hand had kept a firm grip on the piping bag of whipped cream.

“Donuts!” There was venom in the shout that the baker quickly buried in sweet sugar. “They were *just* donuts, dear. No magic.”

“But he got the pro—”

“It *wasn’t*!...magic. If you’d like something sweet to share, these turnovers are fresh.”

The nervous girl watched the bakers kind and smiling face. There was no anger there. Just a smile...with some whipped cream and an eyebrow twitch.
