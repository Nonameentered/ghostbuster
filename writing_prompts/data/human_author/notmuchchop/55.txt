“Since that damned alien Dr Dolittle space-wave shit hit us—”

“He means the Extraterrestrial Sentience Enhancement Beam, Mr President.”

“I think he understood me, kid. Since then, shits been hittin’ the fan near round the clock — from Reveille to my goodnight prayers. My wristwatch don’t tick no more, Sir. Just lets out a little splat every second.”

“What the General is trying to say, Mr President, is these are tumultuous times—”

“I know what I’m saying, kid, don’t put words in my mouth. Shits FUBAR’d, Sir.”

“Mr President, FUBAR is an acro—”

“Sir, it means Fucked Up Beyond All Recog—”

“Enough! Would the two of you be quiet, please?”

“Sir, Yes Sir.”

“Sorry, Mr President.”

“The population of sentient life on this planet has exploded. I don’t need a three star general to tell me that and I don’t need an analyst to translate for him. Stop wasting my time. Are you here for a reason?”

“...tell him, General.”

“I’m gettin to it, I’m gettin to it. Mr President. When I’m not balls deep in the defence of this country...I keep bees.”

“Bees?”

“Honey and wax, Sir. Family trade. Goes back generations.”

“And...what? Your bees have something to say, General? Have they asked us to stop taking their wares without compensation?”

“Actually, things on the farm are runnin’ better than ever, you see—”

“General, sir, um, maybe we should focus.”

“...right. Anyways. They want to vote.”

“Oh.”

“And it is my opinion that we should give them only one vote, Sir.”

“One vote for all of the bees, General?”

“He means one per hive, Mr President.”

“You see, sir, them bees are hive minds. Each one o’ the buzzers is sentient, but they think together.”

“If each can think, General, than shouldn’t we—”

“Mr President, he's trying to say that we are *drastically* out numbered. If every ant and bee gets a vote...”

“...Ohhh.”

“I dare say we’d be up to our ears in sugar cube manufacturin’ before you could say how many lumps, sir.”
