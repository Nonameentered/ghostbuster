“-aaand...*there*! Ha-ha!” Naked Mole Rat Man stood back and, with a flourish of his hands, showed off his accomplishment.

Dr Odd-Task, PhD in Evil Sciences, remained silent. He sat on a stool next to Naked Mole Rat Man, one leg crossed over the other, chin rested on his fist, eyes wide and locked with those of Mini-Mole via the salon mirror.

“So...you’re blind, yeah?” Said Dr Odd-Task to his scissor-wielding counterpart. “Like. Actually blind.” 

“Ha! From birth — My other senses and super-abilities make up for it, though! And now you know my secret. Unfortunately for you and your evil games-"

"Odd Tasks."

"-I've given my dear Mini-Mole many a haircut. This was no challenge at all!”

The young mole-lad, his hair lop-sided and somehow half-frizzy, half-limp, and half-sheared, had a look of utter defeat on his face that suggested this had happened before. And this wasn’t the worse version.

“Is it a good one, Mini-Mole? I think it’s very modern.” Said the hero.

“Sure is, boss.” 

Dr Odd-Task opened his mouth but the young Mini-Mole gave a small shake of his head and pleaded with the one eye not covered by an asymmetric frizzed-up fringe. The bad guy quietly handed the side-kick an electric hair-clipper and then turned to the hair-crime committing hero. 

“Well, I...can’t argue against your results, Naked Mole Rat Man. Let’s go release that bus full of pangolins I stole from the zoo.”

“Excellent! Come along Mini-Mole!”

“No! No. He’s going to...contact the police, right Mini?”

“Yep.”

“What’s that buzzing sound.

“Ah...My phone’s vibrating? The police are calling me, boss.”

“Oh. Good work!”

“Let’s run along now, mighty hero. You earned some pangolins their freedom.”
