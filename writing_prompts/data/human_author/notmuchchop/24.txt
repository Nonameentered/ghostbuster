“So what’s the deal with the Ol’ Fat Man?”

“Shh! You shouldn’t call him that, Twinkle Peepers. What if Mrs Claus hears?

“First, it’s Peep. Secondly, if you’d ever worked with her you’d know she mutters worse under her breath all day.”

“She does not!”

“Does too. Never met a woman who hated baking cookies more. Couple hundred years of doing it every night would make any once-mortal a bit sour.”

“Nah-uh! She is sweet year round!”

“Sure she is, Buddy. Sure she is. Anyways, what’s the Jolly Bastards deal? Too old and fat?”

“No, he has...Reindeer Pox.”

“Oh! Ohhh...well, shit.”

“Twinkle! That’s a cuss!”

“Yeah, well, the one prick quick enough to do the presents is going to be quarantined for the one day of the year he does anything. Now’s the time to cuss.”

“It’ll...it’ll be fine.”

“Buddy. No presents means no Christmas magic. No Christmas Magic means no *us*. No *us* means no presents, means no Santa, means no Christmas Magic. The whole thing falls the flip over.”

“I...I know that! Thanks for not cussing, Peep. Anyways, we’ve got a plan!”

“We?”

“Some of the Elder Elves and Mr and Mrs Saint Nick.”

“Really now?”

“Yeah, we’re going to...Deli...meat. Mate?”

“Delegate?”

“That! Yes. Delegate. We need a bunch of mortals to do the work locally in Nick’s stead. We’re going to search about and find a lot of local Nickers.”

“You look like you’d like some lady’s nickers.”

“I’m an equal opportunity Elf, yes.”

“...remember when I said you need to pay attention to human language?”

“Yes, when you told me to stop calling you Twink...because...it means something else.”

“Yeah.”

“...nickers?”

“In some regions: underwear.”

“Oh...Anyways, each Elf is being assigned a sector and will be responsible for finding ah...er...a deputy.”

“Oh. Fun. Wait, where’d I get?”

“Let me check...just a village. A place called...Blorncestershire Upon Menk?”

“Ha! Ha-hah! Great, just...great. Well, I’ve got a guy.”

“That quick?”

“Yep. Yep.”

“Believer?”

“Ah-ha. Coal receiver.”

“No!”

“Yes.”

“No!”

“Yep. He was an absolute shithead as a lad.”

“Cuss!”

“Now he’s a cat-burglar.”

“You...you can’t!”

“He can get in and out real quick and unnoticed. He’s perfect.”

“But-but-but-but-but—”

“It’ll be fine! See ya, Buddy. I got a Snowflake to catch.”
