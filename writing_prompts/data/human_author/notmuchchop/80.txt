“And the nanobots can do...anything! Anything we set our minds too! Want to fly? Nanobots!

Wanna run real fast? Nanobots!

Heal wounds? Grow wings? Shoot fire from your hands? N-n-n-*nano*—you all know the answer; say it with me, now—*nano*bots!

The lights came on and the projector swapped the Powerpoint slide for empty black nothingness. This had happened at a simple hand gesture from the head of the table.

The twenty executives and their assistants sat in silence. The Man at The Head of the Table spoke: “Dr Marlow-”

“-I know it sounds-”

“Do not interrupt me again.” The Head of the Table said without inflection or emphasis. There was power in the cold monotone of his diction. “You seem to have forgotten that I am a scientist. I know the capabilities of these machines.”

Dr Marlow wanted to speak but his mouth was frozen shut — not by nanites, but by the manner and the stare of The Head of the Table.

“Nanites are not magic. Invisibility? Super healing?” The Head paused. In the silence he seemed to dare Dr Marlow to speak. His stare promised the Dr a swift reprisal should that happen. “These things need energy. Matter. There is not flight without lift. No fire without fuel. Your salesmanship and passion may have fooled a few million into your hands already. You shall see none from me.”

The Head of the Table and the business, stood. The executives followed suit and then their assistants did the same. 

They left without further word.

Dr Marlow stood a moment in the empty room to collect his thoughts. A young gentleman in a headset opened another door and stood aside, pointedly offering silent directions to the exit.
