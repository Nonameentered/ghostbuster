Villainy. 

Well known to have many causes. Madness wrought by society’s failings. Inter-dimensional differences of morality. A vendetta against the system for some childhood slight. Love of mayhem. Desire for power. Ego.

Greed.

Very common for it to be greed, actually. 

Me? That’s difficult. I like it. To be evil. It scratches some deep-seated itch at my core. I like it and I like being good at it. And I will be the *best* there ever was.

The competition...some are alright — can weave a wonderful web of destruction out of the tapestry of this city. But, most are just costumed goons with powers bought off the black market. Too much competition.

As always, however...I have a plan.

A devious plan that will put me at the top of a class of which I am the only member. Will *always* be the only member.

Villain singular ad infinitum.

“He’s made the healthcare free, too.”

“Oop, sorry! Wasn’t watching—”

“Sorry-sorry! No, that was my bad! Really. That’s...that’s on me...wait.”

“Are you okay? Oh! Heyyy. Um, you’re...what was it? The Blastronaut, right?”

“Was. Yeah.”

“Right, right. Yeah. Strange times, yeah?”

“You used to be Mr...Milkman?”

“Hooboy, don’t remind me. *Manic* Milkman.”

“That was it. So...you seem...”

“Stable?”

“Yeah, sorry.”

“Nah, all good. Its true. I’m on meds. You?”

“Therapy and criminal rehabilitation. Paid for by...you know who.”

“Same, same. What a weird world, right? Anyways, I’ll see ya round.”

“Yeah. See ya...hey? Ah, one thing before you go.”

“Yeah?”

“What...do you think his plan is? Why do all of this?”

“You know what? I have no idea. But, I don’t think anyone’s heard the last of...what stupid name did he move to?”

“The sing-”

“The Singular Evil! That’s the one! What a weirdo.”

“I know, right?”

There. Now there is equality. No hunger. All needs being met. Communication.

Peace.

Now to act. And any that rise against me must be on the side of good. I win. I win at last.
