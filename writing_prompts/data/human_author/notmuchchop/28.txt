The group term for cats is a clowder. Sometimes a pounce or a clutter. I’ve always called them a Cacophony of Cats — on account of their unabashed and unquiet battles...and bonking. Ever since we moved here when I was a kid, my nights are filled with hisses, shrieks, wails, and mrowls that seemed to cluster like a choir of the cat-damned just outside my bedroom window.

My town has a near-wild stray cat slash almost-stray outdoor “pet” cat problem. A problem no one wants to address because it’s cute and supposedly good for pest control. Too bad for native birds and other huntable crunchable native fauna.

In my view: it’s a *big* problem. For local wildlife, sure, but mostly for my sleep. No matter where I move, they seem to follow... 

Or the four-legged furry fucks are just *every*where and no one else seems to notice. It was two-thirty in the morning and I had just woken up to that nights rendition of “Reee-arowwwwlrarowl! Hisssss!” After offering my anti-encore (“Shut up! Shut! Up!”), I had gone to fetch a glass of water.

Outside my kitchen window the night was dark and, in addition to being filled with cats, it was filled to the brim with stars. And I saw one fall. A big one. A huge streak that burned for a few seconds and then faded.

I smiled and made a wish: I wish everyone in this neighborhood had a big cat problem, too. As I slugged another cup of gloriously cool, late-night water I wondered if fate, with it’s monkey paw of wish twisting irony, would deliver something unexpected.

Big cat problem. Mountain lions, knowing my luck. I chuckled and shuffled off to bed as track twelve of the cat cacophony started: Friend or Foe (Let’s get Hissy with it), in the key of shriek.

Somewhere, a finger curled. Big cats, yes. Yes that *would* show them.

The morning would come and my little town would have a very big cat problem indeed. Bus-sized problems.
