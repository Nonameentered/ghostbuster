What does it mean? All of it? What does it mean and why is it here? Why not something else?

The answers, the true and deep answers, etched as they are into the mathematics of this reality...are simple. Basic. Without whimsy or enlightenment.

It doesn’t *mean* anything.

It *is* because it *is*. And something else will come before and after and adjacent to it. In the vast infinity of physically unbound timelessness: *everything* will *be* at some point. And *this* just happens to be the when and where of our reality.

There is no plan.

There is no thought.

No magic or hidden meaning.

Just...existence. And I’ve done the math to back it up. I had wanted answers — profound truths — to glimpse behind the curtain and see the wizard at his work.

Instead...

Reams of mathematical formulae that add up to: might as well live in the moment.

Fuck. At least I got all that grant money.
