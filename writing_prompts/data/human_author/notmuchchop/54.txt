Nate descended the stairs in a methodical fashion. First one foot down, then the other foot such that both feet would be on the step. Then he’d sway, grip the banister, and breathe through is gritted teeth with a deep groan on the exhale.

It took him a few minutes to make it down into the basement-slash-winecellar proper. His ill-pale skin shined with cold sweat.

“How many?”

Thomas, similarly looking like shit, was spread like a puddle made of hangover on the cool cement floor. “Six. Six bottles.”

“Damn that demon.” Said Nate as he lay down next to Thomas.

“Want to order delivery?”

“No. Saving money. Eating healthy.”

“...oh. Oh no. The Uber Eats Gremlin. He ordered burritos on my phone.”

“...damn that Gremlin.”

“...he ordered you some churros, too.”

“...and this. Is why. I *love* him.”

Silence for a while. Silence, that is, broken up by two queasy people carefully breathing so as to not throw up.

“Nate. I must confess. *I* am the Uber Eats Gremlin.”

“I. Am shooketh.”

“Also...I think *we* drank the wine.”

“Disagree. No proof.” Nate placed his head on Thomas’ shoulder and Thomas wrapped his arm around his partner.

One day. One day they’d find and defeat that demon that periodically drinks too much wine in their house.
