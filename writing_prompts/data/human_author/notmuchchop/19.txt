“Also...I — he — can teleport. *Anywhere* in the universe.”

“Okay, well—”

“And-and he can also, like, breath and live in space and stuff.”

“I mean, that’s—”

“Wait! Um, also, like, he can summon a weapon — that-only-he-can-use-and-touch — and it, like, matches his personality at that moment, so, like, sometimes it’s a sword or a gun or sword-gun or-or-or a scythe!”

“Mood-weapon? Cool. Anyway—”

“Oh! And there’s this dimension that’s, like, bright white and it slows down time there and I — he — can put things in it.”

“Ok...And my—”

“Like, three — NO! — *five* times slower. Rad. So, rad, right? Right?”

“...Yeah. Rad. Anyways, my character—”

“And his name—”

“Oh, for crying out loud.”

“His name is Shadow Death Crow Mayhem. And he's the bastard son of a demon and the Angel of Death, but he doesn’t get along with them, but they taught him all their powers and skills and he's better than them at it despite not being as old as them, but, like, really old as well, but he still looks fourteen and kinda acts like it because he is fourteen in, like, demon years.”

“...”

“...”

“Are you done?”

“Yeah, I was done ages ago, why haven’t you dropped your character yet? Scared?”

“Wha—...nevermind. My character is a sixty year-old human warrior who — up until five years ago — was a melon farmer. His village was attacked and razed, and with nothing left to live for he strikes out into the world to aid others. He uses his age and assumed expertise to help younger adventurers get work. With one such group, the team bites off more than they can chew. Comedy adventure.”

“Booooring! Who would read that? My character has so much more going on. he’s such a bad-ass! Seriously, who would read your stuff? Hey! Hey everyone, hands up who would rather read my story?”

“...”

“Guys? Come on, don’t be dicks just to be funny...”

“Anyways, I’ll probably do a chapter a week—”

“This is bullshit, you guys wouldn’t know a good story if it hit you in the balls! And I can do a chapter a day! A day! Fuck this, I’m out. Stupid ass writing club anyway.”

"Okay, see ya. Who's next?"
