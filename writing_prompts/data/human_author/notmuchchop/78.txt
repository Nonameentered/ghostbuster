“Have at thee!”

The usual response to the vast Sir Quibbly’s sudden arrival and helmet-muffled catchphrase was, most often, the rustle and clatter of foes taking up arms. For some of the specialist jobs there might be a serpentine hiss, a un-deathly groan, or a guttural roar (oft with fire accompaniment). 

This time, however, he received a chorus of very human sighs followed by a gruff and curt: “Fuck off.”

There were five ordinary folks sat around a fire. And not one seemed concerned about the horse-back Knight that had pounced out of the night-dark forest. After the short and crude unwelcome offered by the stockier of their count, the group had returned to their soup — more of which bubbled in the cauldron that lived above the fire they grimly encircled. 

Back through the trees and down the rock-addled, rain-rutted, *sneaky* way up the hill was a town. A town that had hired Sir Quibbly to slay Dragonses.

Dragons? Or is Dragon singular and plural, like sheep?

Either way, Sir Quibbly had trekked up here only to discover he was very likely going unpaid. Where was this so called family of Dragons? And what of their riches to which he was allowed to help himself as means of a bonus?

The knight pulled a cord on his shoulder and a short whinny was followed by a heavy thud, which shook the cauldron. A different non-dragon spoke up as he steadied the pot: “Oy! Easy!”

The horse stood and shook itself of the dirt it had gathered on impact. With little effort, it’s bright white fur was once more pristine.

“Seemses youse don’ts knows whats horses backs meanses.”

“One couldst not silently approach this place on horseback and thou wouldst not leave a stallion such as Chester down in yonder village.” Said Sir Quibbly. He took off his helmet and coal-black hair toppled down his back, draped his shoulders, and covered half his face. “So. Thou are not Dragons, then?”

“Well..we *is*.”

Quibbly drew his sword.

“Easy! Easy! Wha’ Duncan meanded was: we calls us-selves ‘The Dragons’.”

“Why wouldst thou choose such a name?” The knight sheathed his blade and stared them down. “Dragons are harbingers of death.”

“Puh! Why? Why *not*! It is name that fetches the eyes and *steals* attention...which we adore.” Said a lanky man whose hands flitted about like horny sparrows as he spoke. He stood and struck a pose. One bird-hand took flight and the other took short respite on his cocked hip. “For we — good Sir Knight — are...thespians!”

Quibbly raised the eyebrow not hidden by his pitch black and suspiciously straight mane.

“*Performers*, he means.”

The large fellow who had spoken (quite rudely) and had remained supping and slurping since, put down his bowl. Quibbly watched him closely. What was he up to? The man lifted a small water pouch to his lips, grabbed a piece of lit wood from beneath the percolating pot...and brought the flame to his face. 

Odd. Thought the knight. Chester the horse thought nothing. (Not because horses are stupid, mind you. His mind is clear because he is a zen master. This isn’t important to the story at all, just a fun fact).

And then...the big man tilted his head back and spit forth a ball of flame almost as big as Quibbly. The knight drew his sword and the soupmen groaned.

“It’s called fire-breathing! It’s a trick. Part of our act!”

“I know.” Said Quibbly. “But that ain’t why I drew the sword.”

“Wheres dids thoses thouses goeses?”

“Oh, I do that when I’m knighting.” Said Darren Quibbly. “This is personal. I can’t *stand* carnies.”
