Cam looked at the ingredients Mish had placed before him. The hopeful expectation on his face escaped with a sigh, and the deflated expression that was left suggested boredom.

“Whats the matter, hotshot? My little cooking invention test too much for you? Can’t think of anything to do with these ingredients?”

“No — I mean, yeah sure I can...it’s...” Cam shook his head. “It’s just pretty clear what you want me to make. Not really an invention test. Not much of a challenge at all.”

“What? You could go anywhere with these ingredients!”

“I mean. I could try, but...Chicken breasts, eggs, flour, salt, pepper, panko breadcrumbs, herbs, Parmesan cheese, and vegetable oil. You want me to make you schnitzels, again. Specifically the herb and cheese ones I did that time.” 

“Nuh-uh.”

“I mean. It’s okay if that’s what you want, Mish. Just. I dunno. If you want that and you’ve clearly got the specifics figured out, why not make it yourself?”

“It’s a challenge!”

“No, it’s a request hidden as a challenge.”

“Bock-bock! Chicken-boy! You’re too chicken.”

Jandar the Grey Cloak burst into the small barracks kitchen, his hands were gripped to the brim of his hat, which was almost pulled down over his eyes. He leaped about and screamed some panicked and incoherent nonsense about the primal forces and something being only theoretical until now. All the while the pair of Guardians kept darting their eyes between the bearded kook and the unbreaded chook.

As swiftly as the shouty Jandar storm had come, it fluttered away in a mess of flowy robes and profanity.

Cam and Mish stared at the door that the wizard had rudely left open. A moment later and the conversation had gone back to lunch and Mish’s unsubtle requests.

And then: “Come on, you bastards!” said a returning red-faced wizard “The bloody worlds fuckin’ endin’!”
