I awoke and found myself awake. By which I mean that this body was almost immediately responsive and alert. My original body was not a morning person body. A shower and coffee was needed before thought could flow in any consistent stream.

This body, however...

I kicked off the sheets and practically leapt out of bed. Energetic. Athletic. What fun! I approached a mirrored closet door and saw a rather stunning figure shuffle awkwardly towards me.

The original owner would move with a grace and poise that I can not hope to employ. Despite the many times I had been athletic or feminine or lithe, I could not harness the movements of these forms; stuck, I am, with my graceless waddle.

A phone by the bed rang, a soothing babbling brook with piano accompaniment.

“Hello.” I say, with a squeak. It’d take me a few minutes to get used to this voicebox.

As I had expected, it was the original owner. We talked for a bit about this form. Lactose intolerant. Allergic to bees. Built for yoga and jogging.

Be careful of the left ankle and please no tattoos. That kind of thing.

She was currently a she in Morocco and was tending goats. She’d appreciate me not making a mess of her place and body. A few assurances later and after a quick chat about the weirdness of our world, we bid each other good day and got on with living.

This habit of calling your old life and giving some pointers and maybe making a request was a rather sweet thing, in my opinion. Thankfully, I would not need to make such a call.

My original body was...well, not available anymore. We’ll leave it at that. My time these days is spent maintaining bodily forms per their original owners wishes, or trying my best to put them right if previous tenants had taken them astray.

I opened the drawer of a bedside dresser and extracted a diary. Within was a meal plan and activity schedule. Fit *and* a punctilious planner. I set to work on the mornings yoga. Another month without ice-cream, but, oh well.

Can’t have everything when you’re anyone.
