There was nothing that could be done for him. 

The blade had pierced my master’s breast and run him through and at the Necromancer’s beckon, the bonds that kept my Master’s Mortal Form whole...gave way. His body turned to stone, green light shined from his mouth and eyes, and then this statue cracked, shattered and the pieces disappeared into black smoke on the wind.

He was gone. Beyond dead. Disintegrated. The Necromancer eyed me, the familiar of his now dead arch-enemy. What could a parrot made of light do to him. Especially when said parrot wasn’t long for this world either.

I exist at my masters beckon, at the call of his heart and soul. Both were gone now and soon I would dissipate.

The necromancer turned and left, laughing in the night. I watched. What could I do?

There was nothing that could be done to him.

As the sun rose on another day I was stirred from my stupor. The dark horizon had been where my eyes were focused, but my mind was off in memories. The first day I cam into being, all those years ago. Learning each other beyond our inherent connection. The adventures. The *decades*.

All this and a new day dawns without my oldest friend. Without the soul that made me manifest.

How? Hours had passed and I was here still. How?

Something in me? A warmth. A spark.

A gift. A slither more of his light than I should have. How?

I take to the morning sky. Someone at the academy would know. Someone needs to know that he has fallen and that darkness will fall upon these lands. Someone needs to take vengeance.

Odd. No tether now. No limit to how far I can travel. I will avenge you, Hasber. You will know peace.
