My hands are cuffed to a T-shaped bar. The bottom of the T is bolted to the seat, between my legs, my wrists are bolted to either end of the T’s top cross bar. Me ankles are bolted to the bench as well. 

The heavy steel ring collar which had only a few chain links of slack between the back loop and the wall was a nice touch. Without it I could have leaned forward and picked the wrist cuffs with the wire I keep hidden in my gums. From there, I’d be out and away in no time.

But, instead I get to hang out with these bastards.

There are twelve of us all strapped the same way in the back of this big metal box. A prison carriage — top of the line and custom built for thieves and blaggards like us. Seems the Kingswatch had caught on better than the Towns Guards could. Better budget also helps. This is no cheap thing to build and haul about the place. 

They thought of everything. I’m not escaping from this. Not this time.

What’s that sound?

Bloody well insulated, this box. Few airvents, but they’re bent. Can’t see out...side.

Did he just say...no. Sounded like Drag-arghhhhhh!

The carriage was a brick of black steel. Inside were twelve of the worst thieves ever nabbed for knicking. And the Dragon needed them. Needed them alive.

The beast tried not to shake the box of goons too much as it flew into the golden afternoon sky. Thieves. Yes, they’d do nicely. They’d know how to get into and out of a heavily guarded, dragon-proof fortress.

The riches the boxed-up bastards were to fetch for the Dragon? Her friend and pilot: Gastor Phleng. Imprisoned by an enemy warlord.

Yes. Yes this would work out nicely. The thieves would be thankful for freedom, and she’d offer a free ride or two...they’d rescue Gastor and all would be well.

As she flapped higher she swore she could hear distant screaming. Probably the Kingswatch who had been leading the carriage along and keeping guard. Surely it wasn’t the thieves. 

They’d be a hearty and brave lot, no doubt.

Up and away she went, more sure of her plan with every flap.
