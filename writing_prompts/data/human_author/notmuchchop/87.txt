Thank you, thank you. Give it up for Jay-See, everyone. Son of God, gives a good speech, yeah? Okay, okay. Let’s calm it down, now. I know, I know: ‘Agh! The devil! Agh!’ all that jazz.

Here’s the thing re: The End of Days. I don’t want your planet. Or you. I’m happy with hell, thanks. Nuh! Ah-no! Joshy, baby, my turn to talk.

Whose return brought forth the day of judgement? Wasn’t me. First time visitin’ — big fan of smut, drugs, and music, though. Loooove it. I got dragged out here, against my will by *Him*. Capital aitch Him. The big fella. I ain’t gonna fight. I’m goin’ home after finishin’ this speech.

The only question you gotta ask yourself is: who judges you? 

I don’t. 

I have my brand of fun — which, I know, not to everyone’s tastes — but I do it to whomever turns up in my pad. And I don’t drag you in.

You get *sent*.

I’m just a machine that enjoys making mayhem in my neck of the woods. I don’t need more than that. I’m content with what I have and if someone turns up, I don’t ask why or how, I just do what I do. Because that’s what I do. Why I was made.

Who Judges you? Who sends you my way?

If and when one of the wingy gits asks you to take up arms and fight in a war that Joshy-boy here started by turnin’ up...ask ‘em why. Me and my guys? We’re staying where we always were.

Why is their side startin’ shit and expectin’ you — the people they punish at any given opportunity — to do the fightin’?

Anyways. Peace! Lucifer out!
