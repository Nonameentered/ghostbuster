Write what you know.

Problem is: I don’t know jack. And also: stories about lonely fat guys binge watching shows (with a beer in one hand whilst the other scratches personal itches)...well, stories like that ain’t selling at the moment.

Besides. I like crime-fiction. Mystery, suspense and action. A bit of grit and grime, you know? Realism. Ain’t no superheroes in my world. Just people. Some making do, some taking what they want, and others trying to keep the balance and the peace.

But...I ain’t a cop. Ain’t a crim, either.

Write what you know and I don’t know jack.

But...maybe...

Maybe I should expand my horizons. No way I can be a cop — couldn’t pass the physical and I don’t want that sort of responsibility.

Hmm.

Maybe a bit of...I mean, nothing huge. No *really* bad stuff. Bit of thievery. Small stuff. Shoplifting and the like. Bit of destruction of property. Maybe a brick through the window of condemned house — something along those lines, anyway. 

Never did stuff like that before. Wasn’t a truant or a vandal growing up. If I’m careful...who’d know?

Nothing major. No felonies. No *real* harm.

Just a bit of victimless, low-tier...fun. Some experiences to inform a story or two.

First came the spray paint dicks in the alleyway. And when the aerosol stopped pushing blue, the empty can was pitched through a dirty window. He hadn’t thought of a target. He had just...thrown.

Now there was a jagged hole...next to a door. He reached in and unlatched the rusted lock. Pulled open the wood-rotted door.

Break and entry on his first day of misbehaving. A slippery slope. But, fast falls summon adrenaline. It’s why we build rollercoasters.

Within was an empty, musky, dusty industrial space. Maybe it had been mechanics workshop or some other kind of fabrication business. All that was left was yellow light from dirty windows, rat gathered trash, and an empty spray-paint can.

This part of the city was dead. It wasn’t even a corpse anymore. Not even withered bones. Just fossils that hinted at some long-passed epoch.

Fossils. 

Fossil Fuels. Inspiration.

Among the trash is paper. In the trunk of his car, safe and in the alley, there is a gas can for his lawn mower. He’d been meaning to take it out, but had been lazy. Now he was glad.

Nothing out here, he thought. No one out here. Really, what’s a bit of fire if not a chance to start fresh?

He shook his head and laughed at himself. What had gotten into him? He walked forward and kicked the empty aerosol that had preceded his entry.

This had been surprisingly fun. But, it was time to go home. Someone would no doubt spring out at any second. Maybe, he thought, maybe I just needed to get out of the house. Do something with my time, you know?

As he walked towards the exit he stopped. Turned. And gave a shout to the empty space. No reply, save the echo of his own voice.

\* * *

He was sat in the car. Sat in the car and  gaze fixed on the re-closed and re-locked door. At the empty and abandoned warehouse. The smell of gas — faint but present, tickled at his nose.

It whispered in his ear like a cartoon devil.

He had been meaning to take the gas can out of the trunk...

\* * *

The small green gas can was plonked on the work bench with a heavy thud. I should really clean out the garage, said the writer to himself. Fuck it. I’ll grab a beer, chuck on some tunes and get it done.

As he walked into the house he took his wallet out of his pocket and dropped it and the car keys in their bowl. The receipt for a new gas can fluttered as it dropped, dragged free by the action.

“Should have bought a bigger one” Said the arsonist.
