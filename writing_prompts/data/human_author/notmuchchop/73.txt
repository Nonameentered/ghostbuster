Mrs Libbins,

Attached is the chapters that you had asked for. I would offer you my apology for the delay, but I would guess you have grown weary of my sorrys. I will say instead that the work is going swimmingly and the university will be delighted with the depth of my research.

For your own eyes, I offer here a glimpse of an entertaining micro-facet of what I have found on this exploration of trade. It is a small segment that delighted me and I hope will delight you as well.

Firstly, we must discuss the currency system commonly called Money. In non-barter societies the mode of value transport and exchange is, most commonly, a currency medium that can take the form of metallic discs called coins and certified promissory notes, often Kingdom specified and controlled, called bills.

(There is a chapter on this with further details).

It is a traditional practice to supply children with small sums of this currency, as well as a means for them to contain and collect these givings. The purpose of this practice is to teach the young about money and the process of earning, saving, budgeting, and eventual spending of it. I have in my travels found many varieties of these “Savings” repositories. As these are for children, they are often colourful and themed in some way.

There are clay pig-formed jars, gilt model castles, and even some with clockwork and music powered by the action of the token rolling along a path towards the inner repository. There is a thorough list of these in a future chapter, including historical and cultural significance of each regions chosen “banks”.

This, however, is a quick note on my personal favourite: the Dragon Bank. In my travels I had encountered many animal themed coin collectors for children and had presupposed that said Dragon Bank would be some brightly coloured clay beast with a slit in its head and a cork in it’s belly (the slit being for coin to enter and the cork to allow said coins retrieval). 

I was delighted to find this was not the case.

The children of Neetwah Fell — a village on the Brossen Coast, which sits on movable pillars on the ever shifting dunes (I shall cover this intriguing moving city in the book) — had taken to making a simple terrarium for their coinage.

(The peoples of Neetwah Fell are celebrated glass-makers and even at a young age they engage in the practice.)

These glass domes, which would vary in size, would be made such that there was a slit in the top (too be expected) and a small U-bend entry near the base. The whole thing could be lifted off the bottom wooden plate by a handle at the top.

Now, the intent here is to not only “save money”, but to also lure in one of the local varieties of micro-dragon. (These are not to be mistaken with lizards such as skinks, as they possess flight, fire-breath, and a modicum of magic). Presumably one could gather a hoard the dragon would deem fit to claim, and so the child would save their money, and in so doing, earn a pet.

And to my delight: it very often worked. I have seen many a micro-dragon slumbering on a child’s allowance (more on allowances in the book). These beasts serve not only as a delight to watch, but also: lower the amount of pests in the home via their hunting and, for the varieties that glow, provide the child with some soothing light in the darkness of night. Some even become a companion to the child! Will follow them about and return to their hoard only to check and to sleep.

I wish only that these species were endemic to my home region, as my own children would surely adore them. As would I.

Well, I must be off. I must be sparing with my paper.

Best Wishes,

Artenard Bilsop

P.S. There will be, unfortunately, some delays for the next chapters. Maybe three to eight months.
