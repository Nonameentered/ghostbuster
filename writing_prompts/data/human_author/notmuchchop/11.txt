Landon descended out of the clear blue sky. He floated like a leaf and let the gentle breezes sway and shift him as he fell. While he made his way to terra firma, Landon’s focus was on the last half of a baby-sized burrito. Flight and falls were par for his course and no longer phased him. The burrito? It was so-so, but more interesting than his primary means of transport.

The propeller on his hat spun in a lazy fashion — however, it wasn’t the propeller that did the work, no-no...

It was the hat *and* Landon *together* that made this flit and flutter flight and fall possible. The ridiculous head garb was the man’s Magical Totem and with it: he could fly. It could do this for him and only him. Landon had found the hat and learned of the magic unlocked in him by its presence when he was just eleven years old. Since that day, he drifted about as his heart desired and the winds allowed...and, in the twenty years since, he has come to view flight as banal. Ordinary. *Boring*. 

Much to Cece’s chagran...

Cece, who watched as her friend Landon landed in her lilacs (again!), often wished she had a silly hat that could make her fly. It’d be better than what she had been gifted by fate and magic — even if it meant she’d touch down and crumple the garden on accident from time to time.

Landon always says he can’t control his landing all that much, and Cece believes him...for the sake of their friendship. The spinny-hatted flower stomper turned and made eye contact with the slightly very jealous gardener, a pane of window glass between them. 

He looked down, shrugged and met her gaze with a silent, nose-scrunched and unenthused “sore-ree”. Her reply came formatted as a taut smile and a nod towards the front door (coupled with a glare that could wither a sequoia). 

\* * *

They were drinking tea and spilling it. In addition to being a gravity defying ball of congealed foodtruck leavings, Landon was also one heck of a gossip. He had eyes and ears in the sky, after all.

“And then guess who should come out of the house?” Said Landon, his eyebrows raised, mouth puckered into a pout, and head tilted forward — the scandal merchants mien of sass, the forebear of gasps. 

“No!” Said Cece who put her cup down a tad too hard and whose jaw had fallen slack. “I thought—”

“She was still in France?” He lifted his cup. “So did *he* and her sister the mistress—Oh! Sistress!”

“Ha!”

“But get this.” He leaned in. No. Somehow this was about to get juicier. “Their shouting on the front lawn, all you said you were in France, well, you said you were away for work...and bam. *His* sister comes out the house in nought but ruffled bedding.”

“Oh, damn!”

“I know!”

“Shit!”

“I *know*!” Landon took off and floated towards the pantry. “Bikkie?”

“Yeah, grab the tim-tams.”

“Can do.” He was on his way back, feet an inch of the floor, when he asked: “Any good material?”

“All of it. All of it’s good. Great even. I’ll get a few months out of that.”

“Nice.”

You see, the pair worked together. Were writing partners, in a way. Landon’s hat let him fly. Her Brother Terrence had sneakers that let him run as fast as a car. Her friend Patrick had an apron that let him duplicate bread. Susan had a gnome that makes gardens grow.

And Cece was a writer. 

The head writer for a long running telenovela — a spanish soap opera filled with love and lust and long lost relatives. Cece’s magic totem is a book. The bible, in fact. With it she can take an event, imagined or actual, and make it into a lesson that gets translated and pumped out to the people for mass consumption and earns more than a pretty penny for it.

What Cece doesn’t know is that her Totem doesn’t do what she thinks it does...her words and her success are not magical. What the totem does is let her gather people, lets her turn the other cheek...and most of all, let’s her summon two bears to attack children that are mean to her — just like in 2 Kings 2:24:

And he turned around, and when he saw them, he cursed them in the name of the Lord. And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys.
