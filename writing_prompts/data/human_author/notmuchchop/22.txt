He had, at the begrudging acceptance of his parental guardians, been allowed to paint his room a bright and smooth shade of off-white. During this process he changed the lay out of the room as well, and tidied in general. 

His bed was made — taut white sheets, a plush blue blanket, a pillow fat and near bursting. A neat desk to the left of the bed held his completed homework, workbooks stacked in an organized pile in front of the sentinel row of colourfully tabbed textbooks. The carpet of his bedroom was clear of clothes and clutter, though his parents had not yet replaced the pitch-dark piles with something brighter and less shaggy and clottable. 

All in all, the bedroom was a bright and happy space for a teen who had found himself. Found himself *and* the lord and saviour: Jesus Horatio Christ.

The boy himself was sat in the padded bay window, letting the Lord’s light illuminate the holy scriptures, his favourite book — an easy choice as it had shown the boy the way. Coming through his bedroom door was heavy metal music and beyond the inner sanctum of his room lived the blackclad Satanic Cultists he called his family (but not his flock).

He was the black sheep — The lone saved soul in a house filled with beings of utter darkness and devotion to the devil. It was teen rebellion, they thought. A phase. But, this is who he was and would be...for eternity.

“And what are you doing up at this hour?” It was Dad, sat at the kitchen table, face white and black in common corpse make-up, a steaming skull-cup of goat blood in one hand. “It’s eleven in the morning on a Sunday, you should be sleeping in like your sisters.”

“Well. You’re up.” The boy tugged as his collar and fiddled with the straps of his backpack.

“Haven’t slept yet. Had a lot of drugs and goat sacrifice to get done.”

“Fair. Well, I’m off. Bye, Father!”

“Wait one...moment.”

Dad knew. This was it. He knew that the lad was off to midday services.

“Not going to give your old man a passing ‘go fuck yourself’? Not even a flipped bird?”

“Umm. In a rush. Bye!”

And the boy was off and out the door with its brass demon knocker, he leaped down the front steps (over the skulls and year round jack-o-lanterns, and he straddled his bike, put his helmet on, and was away.

“That boy ain’t right.” Said Dad as he sipped his mug mug and read the dog-track race form.

The executive lifted his eyes off the script segment he’d been offered. “You’ve never met an actual Satanist, have you?”

“Yes. I have. All the time.”

“Yeah, I’m gonna pass—wait. Wait, is this just another sanctimonious piece of preachy cinema or...is it actually a comedy. I mean, some of this is pretty funny.”

“...if it was a comedy, would you buy the script?”

“...Yeah? Maybe.”

“Then it’s a comedy!”
