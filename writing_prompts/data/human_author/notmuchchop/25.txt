Time is the passage of an objects experience across a dimension beyond its physical bounds. So. A rock exists, that is: it is contained. It is weathered and changed by it’s experience across time. And so...”

“I...what?”

“Look. I’m an Oracle not a philosopher or Neuropsychiatrist. You want a definition of consciousness, go see one of them. You want some vaguely worded peeks into the future, offered up in flowery words...I’m ya gal!”

“But...wait, how is this relevant to my fortune?”

“I said the universe hates you—”

“Yes, and—”

“And you asked if the universe thinks and I said yes, and you asked if rocks think and—”

“The fortune said that—”

“And then half an hour talking in circles later, here we are.”

“...but the fortune—”

“Your fortune was: The Universe hates you and you should travel far away from all the things that think and feel.”

“But, but your definition means that the universe—”

“Next!”

“But!”

“Next!”

He’d figure it out. She knew that much.
