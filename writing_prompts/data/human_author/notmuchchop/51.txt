The President is alive and so am I. The bullet had hit me and felt like nothing at all. And now I lay on the ground...not dying from my heroism.

The ground is cold and my face is hot. Somewhere out in that silent crowd was a terrorist assassin disguised as some kind of cameraman.

The murderous bastard had the full uniform. Even a camera that shot pictures instead of bullets. Can’t believe how much it feels like I haven’t been shot. Come to think of it...he may not even be an assassin... possibly...probably.

I hear the Presidents voice, something about taxes. My earpiece crackles with laughter and insults.

At least I know I did my job.
