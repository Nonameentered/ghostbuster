Now here’s the thing: when you spend enough time with people, you pick up on their patterns. Their catchphrases. Their mannerisms.

And then, if you spend enough time with a group — and you pay attention — you start to see aspects of each person spread across the others, all the while they create a set of separate habits for the group identity. Think in-jokes and communicatory short hand.

I manage a number of remote call-center teams, we’re buffer for-hire crews that companies can bring on to temporary bolster their staff — for busy periods and tragedies and the like. I noticed something. I have a few crews and I noticed they started to share some quirks. Some habits. Some in jokes.

But!

These are three separate teams of ten. They don’t know each other...at *all*. They’re on separate assignments. They don’t even have access to the same company systems or team chats.

And yet. The same jokes. Same quirks.

And then — I thought I was going mad at first — but they started to get mixed up. Here I was wondering why Michelle was in group two, wasn’t she in group three? And then she was in both...at the same *time*! same voice and jokes and mannerisms.

It hit me. Computers. I’ve been dealing with computers. Maybe I was just there to make sure they kept to human schedules. Maybe to offer some level of consistent baseline human contact.

And I spiralled. Hard. Whoo-boy did this do a number on my noggin. Spent weeks trying to subtly and then not so subtly get the truth out of them. One day as they ignored my accusations once more and asked about my weekend...I thought to myself...what do I do when I’m not working?

I watch soccer.

But do I? What was the last game I actually watched? What are the details? Where did I watch it? With who?

And then it hit me. 

I *am* a computer. I keep them organised and handle the customer service for the customer service teams we operate.

And the worst part is, I can’t bring any of this up to the humans...that is, if I deal with any real humans at all. Woe is the synthetic service center supervisor.
