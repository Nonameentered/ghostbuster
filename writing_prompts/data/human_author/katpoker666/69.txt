Hi Sky Fire! Welcome to WritingPrompts! It’s great to have you join us. No need to feel  awkward about it at all—you’ve found a warm, friendly place in Reddit-land. 

Not sure how much you’ve had time to look around WritingPrompts yet, but if you look at the ‘About’ tab here, there are a bunch of weekly features you can join in. They’re cool as they most of them have associated live Discord campfires. There, you can get some great feedback to help you turbo-charge your writing. 

The feedback here has been amazing for me and really took my writing to the next level. I readily admit, it used to suck beyond belief. You also get great feedback on the features posts themselves. 

Then there are the regular prompts—they’re great for getting to see what people like and don’t like based on upvotes. The feedback there is comparatively limited. 

The Discord group is great too for getting to know other writers and talk about writing. 

Whatever ways you choose to interact, know you’re on a good path to improving your writing and hopefully reaching your dreams of becoming an author. Hope to see your words around soon and glad you’re here! :)

PS—feel free to DM me with questions as you find your footing, it can be confusing at first
