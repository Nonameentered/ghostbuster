The opening is fantastic, Valky—it immediately sets the tone and premise for what’s to come and grabs the reader’s attention with the use of a known phrase:

>> Breathe in. Breathe out. You must always be calm before the storm. 

Here you also do a good job of showing us the MC is a novitiate:

>> The advice of my tutors rattled inside my head and I still couldn’t grasp the practicality of their meaning.

This sentence was a little repetitive:

>> I shook my head and watched the hope die a quick death. 

Maybe cut ‘die a quick death’?

Particularly when you have this a little further on:

>> I shook my head and watched her hope wither and die before my eyes.

This was poignant:

>> There was a slight softening of her tone when she spoke this time, falling into the role of comforting mother easily, but we both didn’t believe her. 

I wasn’t clear why the guards were panicking if they knew what the MC was trying to do?

>>But as I got lost in my focus, I hadn’t noticed that the guards up on the wall surrounding our home were panicking. 

I love the ending. Specifically how you show the MC is surprised at what they’d done and then was so happy—very sweet way to close out! 

>>I looked up and saw the sky streaked with arcs of lightning. A smile broke across my face as I summoned my first storm.
