‘Dwarfing Humans’

—-

In the vast marble antechamber of Rimora, Matt and Gomli sat discussing the finer points of the new engineering student exchange program. Over cups of finest dwarven mead, the two headmasters sought common ground.

“So, Gomli. That’s why we need to start the first annual Advanced Dwarven Human Student Engineering Exchange Program. Or ADHSEEP for short.”

“Leave it ta ya humans to over-complicate such a simple thing as a name, Matt. Wouldna ‘Student Exchange’ work as well? We know it’s us and not the ruddy elves.”

“Fine. Fine. Take out all the *important* details.”

“Well, iffen your engineering projects are anything like ya word choice, we have *a* *lot* to teach ya.”

“I doubt that. You still use pickaxes to dig. We have the finest drilling machines and excavation tools—“

“Aye, and we dwarves have built caverns bigger than ya could even imagine. If it ain’t broke and all that.”

“And it takes thousands of years to do what you do. Dynamite and tools are faster and more efficient.”

“Ya destroy fer more of Mother Earth than ya intended. I have seen those vast strip mines of yers. A crime against nature they be.”

Matt pulled his shirt collar with his index finger. “A little hot in here, isn’t it?”

Gomli laughed, a hearty sound emanating from the depths of his rotund chest. “Ya kenna take the heat then lad? We dwarves—“

“Are perfect specimens, I know.” Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with his handkerchief, Matt fidgeted in his chair. “But if we are working together, maybe tamp the fire a little?”

“There is an old saying we dwarves have. The temperature is what it’s meant ta be. In other words, don’t change things.”

“A fine saying, but that’s also why we humans have air conditioning.”

“Aye, and that’s why we live underground. No need fer it. Bad fer tha planet and all.”

Matt stroked his thin, ludicrously waxed beard. “Well, what about our automation? Surely, that must be interesting to you. Why we can dig a mine with a handful of men these days. That is incredible, right?”

“Our way provides work fer tens of thousands of dwarves. No one goes hungry when we dig.”

“But where is the progress there then? Don’t you want to be on the cutting edge of things?”

“Why? We get things done *and* co-exist with the planet. What more could ya want?” Gomli’s robust crimson beard shook with emotion as he spoke. “Besides, when the mines are fully automated, and they will be soon, what use will they fer your fancy engineering majors? It will all be AI and software engineers. They willna need the lot of ya, Matt.”

“Umm, Gomli, can I have a job, please?”
