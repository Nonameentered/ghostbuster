I love how almost Matrix-like this feels. The ‘cheap’ and expected ending would be that the brothers got back together and / or the MC was jealous. This was so much better and a great use of one of the constraints with the illusion word play and the bookending of illusory:

>> My satisfaction may be illusory, but sometimes, the illusion is all that really matters.

I also really enjoyed this line, as it said so much so beautifully in a single sentence:

>> The sun was grazing the horizon, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and fiery red, bathing us in its warm light while the rest of the city wallowed in our long shadow.

I liked this one as well, but it did feel quite long. It might also be worth substituting ‘otherwise’ for ‘consequential’ for variety’s sake:

>> There was a time once I came close to something more, an evening spent on yet another rooftop terrace, underscored by a string quartet and the inconsequential chatter of people trying to appear consequential — brutish, boorish men trying to impress women far too young for them

The one thing I’d say given you have extra word count is a little more detail on the MC’s feelings towards their family. It seems like even appearing to know their brother is intolerable in this world and it left me wondering why. Particularly as it sounds like the brother didn’t expect the shame to apply to them it seems:

>> You always were ashamed of where you came from. I guess that means you're ashamed of me now, too."

Overall, great piece as always and loved the character complexity here!
