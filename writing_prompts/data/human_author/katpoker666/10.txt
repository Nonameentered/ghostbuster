Hey Astro—this was heartwarming and wholesome as fudge.

A couple small things: 
- Her weeping, I think?
>> In spite of her efforts, her weeps escape her mouth and alert the diner to her sadness.
- I wish we knew a little more about Xavier in context. I get that he could be an anonymous figure, but did he walk in with her? After? Also maybe leave him unnamed as he doesn’t appear named elsewhere in the story?
- I love how everyone is so nice to her and generally. The one thing id say is there are an awful lot of names to keep track of. Eg maybe don’t name the couple in the booth with the umbrella 
- And this last part is a really small thing, but fifty tissues is more like a box than a purse pack which is ten. Silly thing, but took me out for a sec
Overall, really great tale
