Oooh—this is really nice, produce! The way the MC is befuddled about their identity now as a mom really shines with your use of sentence fragments.

I particularly like the near feverish repetition of baby here:

>> Baby nap, baby dinner, baby bath

>>Baby baby baby

I will say though that I’d be tempted to bring the second part out more. So instead of:

>>Baby baby baby

Something intensifying and a bit more varied like:

Baby. BABY. BABY!

Thanks for a great read!
