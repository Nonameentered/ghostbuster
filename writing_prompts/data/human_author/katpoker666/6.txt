‘Tears for a Crocodile’

—-

Leaving behind the bougie excess of Gustavia’s high streets, I explored the *real* St Barth’s. Some people may think it’s *exclusive*, but it’s not. 

I mean, getting the shop to open on private hours is one kind of money. The other is to have the ateliers come to you *before* the runway shows. I have Tom Ford on speed dial even after the *unfortunate* Estée Lauder acquisition. Sure, Tom finally has some money to play with. Bully for him and all. But he still better show up when I ring.

Ok—I did stop by *Hermes*. Personalized Christmas shopping done and dusted with a few custom monograms.

“Danielle? Can you go with the driver and take these thirty crocodile Birkin bags to my jet?”

“Can I have one?”

“They’re ninety thousand each! You think I want to spend that on my *assistant*? That’s practically your salary!” I laughed. “That said, if you’re *very* good, I might let you pick a Chanel and give it to yourself.”

Danielle’s face fell, giving her a most unbecoming double chin. 

“That is if you also lose weight. You’re looking a bit pudgy, and that won’t do.”

A tear glistened in her little piggy eyes. I bet she ugly cries when I’m not around. Can’t imagine why.

“Oh, stop sniveling and get the bags on my jet.”

“But—“

“The airport’s fifteen minutes away. Get on with it.”

She sighed and left in her desultory way in the specially designed skinny limo made for the island’s steep, narrow roads. I prefer a full-size, but needs must and all that.

Back at the villa, I looked out over the 270-degree view saltwater infinity pool at the setting sun. It was nice to get back to nature. I could see the sea below. A seagull hopped across the beach, far-too-heavy-for-its-beak fish in tow. It was nice to be back in the real world. In nature. I saw it so rarely, even though it was part of my brand.

But even here in *the* most expensive villa on one of *the* world’s most exclusive islands, the risk of paparazzi was real. I barely lived down the pictures from last year. 

You sunbathe topless on your own super yacht with no one around, and you’re called a harlot when some idiot with a drone buzzes by. It wouldn’t hurt the Mileys or Kylies of this world, but *my* image is pristine. Unattainable.

Privacy is an illusory feeling these days, but it’s one of the best. And I’m always satisfied with the best. 

I laugh hollowly and summon another glass of Pinot .

A nameless staff member delivers it, and I don’t bother to turn around. Tapping the table next to me should suffice as instruction if they have any sense.

If I were a guy, men and girls could come and go like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars, and no one would say a word. As a woman, my options are more limited. 

Billions of dollars, and I’m not free. I’d give it all up if I didn’t hate *poor* people so much.
