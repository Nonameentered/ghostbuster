Thanks for sharing, Nayeli! Some really helpful things here! One thing I would say is that being full of dialog isn’t always a bad thing. It can tell us a lot about a character. Age, we’re there from, etc. It’s one of many tools we have, so don’t be afraid of it. (says a self-confessed dialog addict) :)
