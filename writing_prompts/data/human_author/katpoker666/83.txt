“Auntie!” The cubs shout. 

You turn your head, befuddled. Trying to greet them, you sound out the words in your mind, but nothing comes out. You grit your teeth and try again, mouthing each word.

“Hello. Little. Ones. You. Seem. Lovely. But. I’m. Not. Your. Aunt.”

The cubs stare back at you, seeming not to understand. You try again, but with simpler words.

“Not Auntie. Friend.”

Exchanging looks, the cubs turn and stare back at you, eyes blank.

You lower your head and sigh. Maybe your voice is too human. Trying not to think about the words, you instinctively make a series of growls.

The cubs’ eyes light up. “Silly Auntie! All lady wolves are ‘aunties.’”

“Oh, I guess? I’m new to being a wolf.”

“Mama was new once.” They hung their heads low, their eyes brimming with tears.

“New too. Hmm. Where is she? Maybe I can ask her what is happening to me.”

“Gone. The bad men took her.”

You pause. Bad men? And then it hits you. “Hunters?”

They nuzzle closer. “Yes,” the girl cub whimpers.

“Are you all alone, or do you have a pack?”

The boy licks his paw as if self-soothing. “N-no. No one.”

“I see. Let’s find something to eat.”

A pair of mighty dogs loom over the deer as they rip pieces off. “Grrr. What do you want?”

“To share?”

“It’s our kill fair and square. Grrr. Go find your own.”

“There’s more than enough here.”

“Go. Away.”

You shrug. “Have it your way then.”

The dogs yelp as you bay them with your paws. You’re not using your teeth or even much force, but it is enough. They run away, whimpering.

You look at the cubs.

Your heart flutters as you let them have the choicest bits.
