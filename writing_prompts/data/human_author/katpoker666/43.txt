‘Dark Raider and the Wedding Day Blues’

—-

Assembling a team of *quality* villains is tough. There is a reason our kind work alone. Most bad guys are jerks. Take, for example, my last job—the Swarovski Diamond.

I drove to Villains R Us’ parking lot to look for some likely droogs.  Why here vs. the Center for Advanced Villainy (CAV) or even the local 404 Villian’s Guild? Weren’t you listening? Villains. Are. Jerks. At least the less powerful ones can cause less trouble in the field but still do some damage. Think of them as pawns and the occasional night to my King. Oh wait, in that metaphor, we’d lose. But you get the idea.

So I’m cruising the VRU parking lot when I see a group of likely candidates suited up properly and all. It’s a good sign. Means they’re professional and also that I don’t have to buy them new costumes. I can’t tell you how annoying it is to delay a mission for vanity reasons. But you can’t have a sidekick with a sheet for a cape and a colander hat. But I digress.

I pull up next to them.

“Hey, lads, in the market for a job?”

“Sure, but aren’t you *the* Dark Raider? What do you want with the likes of us?”

I’ve never decided if being easily recognized is a perk of the job or a liability. Engendering reputational fear and staying on brand are important. 

“I am. And that’s why I need *your* help. I’m just too recognizable in the field these days, so I can’t exactly do stealth missions anymore. But *you* can.”

The lead droog nodded and eyed my cape appraisingly. “Is that real silk?”

“Why yes. You have a good eye. Light, warm, and oh so comfortable for flying. Why do you ask?”

“Trying to determine the pay rate, boss.” He looked at his colleagues, and they nodded. Never a good sign—means he’s already got power over them, and in a heist, that can be deadly.

“This *your* gang, then?”

“Yeah, you could say that.”

“Ok. I’ll take them. Double standard wage *if* you don’t join them. Fair?”

“But why? And what about me?”

“Because it’s a code of mine, and tell ya what. I’ll give you ten times the standard rate for staying back.”

His eyes bulged at the figure as they should. Droogs don’t make a lot of bank. “I’m in.” Gesturing to the team, he added, “This here is Rockwrecker, and that’s—“

“Yellow cape,” I finished. “No names on this kind of job, another of my rules. Means if I get caught, you stay safe, and if you die, I’m not attached to you.”

The four men nodded at the sagacity of my advice.

“Ok. So, you’re working names will be based on cape color. Red, yellow and blue. I’m ‘Boss.’ Got it?”

“Yes, Dark Raider, I mean, Boss, Sir!”

We pulled out and headed to my spacious underground lair, where I showed them their parts of the plan. Never show the hired help the whole thing is another rule of mine.

Prepped and ready, we went to take on the Skyward Building. A simple through the atrium door entry for me to distract the punters with maximum fanfare to draw attention away from the real plan. Far below me on the maintenance level, the droogs would break in and work their way up the back stairs to the Swarovski Diamond’s chamber. A hackneyed plan to be sure, but sometimes the best ones are.

“Boss. We’re in.” 

“Ok. Carry on,” I said into the comms. 

Looking around, I realized everyone was in black tie. While a trope for a reason—looks great on camera—it had never sat right with me. People dress up for things that are important, like parties, funerals, weddings.

I caught a glimpse of a long white gown. Wedding. Great. I can at least try and keep the drama out on the balcony.

And then I saw him. Colt Rodgers, my arch-nemesis. He raised a glass in toast. “On this my daughter’s wedding day…”

Oh, crap. I can’t do this to him. Not messing with heroes’ families is a firm rule of mine. Keeps it professional, and it’s the right thing to do. Time to abort mission.

Then the comms sounded in my earpiece. “Boss. Yellow cape. We’ve got the rock, but there’s a lot of heat down here. Too much. Going to have to exit through the top.”

I facepalmed. This is what I get for hiring at Villains R Us. Incompetence. Ok, what to do? I hated revising plans on the fly. Too much room for error. Luckily I had a plan B. It would be messy, but it would do the job.

“Ok. Are you near the sewer tunnels from our map?”

“Yes…?”

“Good. Head down there with the diamond and walk two miles East. There will be a manhole cover there, and one of my drivers will be waiting.”

“But this is a *new* cape,” Yellow whined.

I gritted my teeth and sighed. What unprofessionalism. “I will replace it.”

“Good. I—“

“Get on with it.”

Then through the comm, I heard a scream. “Coming in hard and fast. Going to take elevator to roof. Only chance.”

Not on my watch. 

As they came out of the elevator, guns blazing. I threw myself in front of the bride and her mother. A perfectly reasonable human shield, as my cape is also bulletproof. 

The three exchanged looks before shrugging and continuing.

I couldn’t let this happen. This was one of my cardinal rules—no families. And so I quickly took out all three droogs.

Colt Rodgers ran up to me. “I can’t believe you saved them.” He gestured to his family.”

“Of course, you would have done the same for me, Rodgers.”

“Call me Colt. And hey, would you like to stay for the reception as the guest of honor? You’ve done so much for us today that it only seems right.”

“I’d love that, Colt,” I smiled genuinely as I tucked the diamond further into my pocket. 

Some days, following the rules, is the right thing all around.
