‘Cupid’s Quiver-ing’

—-

The pyre burned, its flames tickling the inky night sky. Even those perennial jokers, the stars hid. Probably too busy laughing at my predicament to watch in a dignified stellar fashion.

A man in a badly bleached ram’s horn skull that stank of putrefying flesh prodded me with a jagged pike. I flinched and cowered as I’d seen mortals do countless times. 

Steeling my expression, I prepared to plead in a subdued fashion. Laughter was not an option here. It would spoil the surprise.

“Oh, please don’t hurt me, brave sir. You’re so mighty while I’m small and frail.” And then I couldn’t resist. “What should I call you, sir?”

“Pyrogenes will do. You do not merit my full name as you are about to perish. But even this name I would not share unless you were not bound to become ash. There is *power* in a name.”

I laughed. I’d taught them the name thing. Well, their forebears, at least. 

“And who are we going to see *Pyro*?”

“Bacchus.”

“Oh. I thought he was all about dancing and drinking? Not really into sacrifices and all that.”

Pyrogenes glared and then gasped. “Blasphemy! Bacchus is a most temperate deity.”

I paused. What a laugh that he’d made our inside joke of a cult believe he was wholesome. The old rascal! Bacchus must be in rare form these days. “Umm…. ehrr… I meant no harm. A simple error.” I looked away, hoping he couldn’t see the fit of giggles lurking beneath my expression

“Ah. Well, all gods like sacrifices, right?” 

“I guess…”

He leaned in close. “Look, this is embarrassing.”

“You can tell me. About to die anyway and all that.”

“I’m new at this whole dark priest thing, but that’s what I read in the sacred manuscripts.”

“I’m sorry—what are those?” For the life of me, I couldn’t recall writing a bible or even carving a quick stone tablet.

“Teachings from the great leader himself written on very thin paper. So delicate only the chosen may touch them.” Pyrogenes puffed out his chest.

My mirth fought to escape. I tamped down the laughter, but barely. “Like disposable napkins?”

He looked confused. “Peasant, what is this ‘napkin’ of which you speak?”

“It’s a… piece of thin parchment you use to wipe your mouth after eating.” 

Eyes bulging in seeming surprise, Pyro replied, “Are you sacrilegious or a fool? Parchment is too valuable and rare for such uses.”

Better say something quick, or the jig would be up. Not sure he would like the idea that Bacchus and I traveled to the future and wrote the ‘plans’ for this religion on cocktail napkins after one too many Mai Tais. “A fool, I suppose. I know not of what I speak, oh great Pyrogenes. My mind has been addled by the grapes these many years…”

He nodded, his expression grave. “You seem kind for a drunken idiot. I almost feel bad for burning you alive.”

“Don’t be. As you’ve said, it’s what you should do. I would never wish to distance such a fine man as yourself from your god.”

“I will try to make this quick, then.” With that, Pyrogenes pulled back his mask and sounded a mighty horn.

The festivities went silent as Pyrogenes walked me to the fiery altar. 

He intoned some words in the mock language I invented with my old friend. “Ejjdjxidoo osiakh kdjid…” 

It was meant to be unpronounceable, but dang if the old boy didn’t do a half-decent job of it.

Bacchus appeared in his pristine white toga…

What? Where were the wine stains? 

And walked down the steps without a tipsy wobble…

Impossible—who was this impersonator?

Then with an almost imperial grace, he took a chalice of *water* and *drank* from it.”

Where was the freaking wine? Must be a charlatan. Had to be. 

Bacchus glanced in my direction. “Hail, Cupid. Well met.”

Pyrogenes’ jaw dropped. “Wha—“

“Greetings, Bacchus. You’re on good form, I see. But what’s with the water, my old friend?”

“I have turned over a new leaf.” He patted his flattened stomach. “All whole grains and fresh vegetables. No more red meat…”

“You’re having a laugh. You used to *love* great boar’s legs off the bone.” My belly rumbled at the thought of seared flesh dripping with fat. 

“Times change,” he said with a strange glint in his eyes. “Speaking of which, are you ready to be sacrificed?”

“Of course,” I winked. “Let them do their best. I am impervious.”

Pyrogenes shivered at that.

“To mortals, true. But not to gods.”

“You wouldn’t! Not after all we’ve meant to each other,” I quivered with a mix of rage and fear.

“I would and will. You see, I can’t risk anyone else hearing about the old days. It’s too embarrassing.”

With that, he lunged forward with a bejeweled dagger forged by Vulcan himself.
