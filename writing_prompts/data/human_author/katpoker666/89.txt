‘Trope-giving’

—-

“All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”

“What pretentious idiot said that one, Max? I swear sending you to study literature at college was a mistake.”

“Leo Tolstoy. And what, Mom? I’m a *great* student. Top of my class,” Max preened.

“Maybe. But you’ve become *more* insufferable.” Cheryl raised a hand to her temple. “Can you at least tone it down when the family arrives? It’s Thanksgiving, not ‘Max shows-off day.’”

“Let him alone, Cheryl. Our son has *nothing* on Uncle Charlie and his political rants.”

“But he’s sixty-one. Max doesn’t have that excuse.”

“Think of it this way, sweetheart—they may all leave early.”

“But I spent hours cooking this.”

“And we’ll have *amazing* leftovers. But you have to admit, your family is a bit difficult.”

“Thanks, Dad. That’s *exactly* what I was saying when I quoted Tolstoy.”

“Yeah, but haven’t they taught you about tropes yet? We’re the stereotypical Thanksgiving family.”

“Oh, c’mon. How?

“Well, let’s see… There’s crazy uncle. Check. Over-worked mom. Check. Kid who’s a know-it-all. Check. And dad, who’d rather be watching the big game. What’s more tropey than that dynamic?”

Max sighed. “Ok. I concede. You’re annoying when you’re right, Dad.”

“I must *always* be then.”

Throwing a carefully folded napkin at his father, Max rolled his eyes until the whites, and red veins showed. “You’ve just increased the trope level. Dad laughing at his own bad dad jokes.”

“Touché.”

Cheryl emerged from the kitchen and glared at the errant napkin. “Get. Out.”

“Well, if you’re gonna be that way, honey, we’ll go catch the pre-game.”

“‘Mom blows up on Thanksgiving.’ We can add that to the list.”

His dad nodded. “Coming?”

“Nah. I’d rather chill out in my growlery, the tool shed.”

“Growlery? Maybe your mom’s right about the pretension, Max. Even *I* don’t know that one, and I’m a writer.”

“Of computer manuals,” the teen snarked under his breath. “Some author.”

“What was that?”

Max kicked the ground with his Converse. “Nothing.”

Entering the shed, Max frowned as he swiped a cobweb out of his hair. Looking around, he flinched backward as a rat ran by. The dust was a quarter-inch thick. 

“What happened?” Max murmured.

Exhuming the old compound miter saw from a pile of other tools, he placed it on the workbench and began cutting. 

A shout interrupted his work. “They’re here.”

Max dusted the sawdust off his t-shirt with his hands and walked slowly to the screen door.

Grandma trundled in with her cane and a dapper cobalt skirt suit with a pussy bow collar. 

Running to her, he hugged her and knocked her slightly off her feet.

“Now, now. No need to kill an old gal like me,” she laughed.

Next, Max embraced his pudgy, bucktoothed, pre-teen cousin. The youth had his iPhone up and while filming the whole exchange. 

“I should call you ‘Big Brother.’ Nothing misses your gaze.”

“Big who?” 

“Big Brother. It’s a story about non-stop surveillance. I’ll lend you my copy of 1984 after dinner. I think you’ll like it.”

“Boy’s too young for that nonsense. Besides, things are way harder today with those dang immigrants from Catalonia…” Uncle Jim groused.

Cheryl paused, carrying an oven-mitted turkey in both hands. “First, they’re not Spanish. They’re from Colombia. And second, *no* politics at the table. You hear me, Jim. I want a *nice* Thanksgiving for once.”

Max mouthed to his father, ‘Trope.’ 

The strained expression on his father’s face lifted slightly. “So Jim, how’ve you been?”

“Same old. Same old. But I’ll tell ya what—we lost because we told ourselves we lost.”

Clearing her throat, Cheryl laid down the law. “No. Politics.”

“What? I was talking about the big game, sis. What do you think I meant?”

Cheryl cursed softly. “Everyone ready to eat?”

“Sounds great,” Big Brother grinned and rubbed his stomach. “It looks so good. I want to record it. Okay?”

“Sure. At least someone appreciates my cooking. Now, let’s have a good, old-fashioned Thanksgiving dinner.”

Everyone dug in. The tension receded. 

Then Uncle spoke. “You know you look good, Cheryl.”

She shook her head slowly and blushed. “Thanks. Sweet of you to say.”

“Yeah, for fifty, pretty impressive.”

Face falling, Cheryl tugged at her napkin. “Gee. *Thanks.*”

“C’mon, I meant it as a compliment…” 

“Hmmm.”

“It is Mom when you think about it. George Orwell said, ‘At fifty, everyone has the face he deserves.’ So, if you think about it that way, you’re beautiful because you’re a good person.”

“Huh. I never thought about it that way. Thanks then. Although I did say no Orwell at the table…”

“You said ‘nothing pretentious.’” Max looked over at his cousin. “You’re filming still?”

“Yep. This is can't-miss funny.”

“You may be right. I love you, Big Brother.”
