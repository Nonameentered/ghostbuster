‘Autumn’s Children’

—-

Friday night baseball hangovers faded to the monotony of real-life little league. ‘The Nutcracker’ in New York every Christmas gave way to dubiously-coordinated tots in tutus. Romantic getaways fell by the wayside in the face of life’s new rhythm. The universe’s center had changed, and Diana and Richard’s lives with it.

Rain-dappled windows looked out on a yard clad in autumn’s finest. A fawn poked its head through the forest as if daring Diana to look at it, but her mind was elsewhere.

“Rich? The leaves are really piling up. Think you could rake a bit?”

“Couldn’t you get the kids to do it?” Richard said, hunched in his college-era armchair over an iPhone game.

“You know Jamie is too little, and Max is at swim practice.”

Rubbing his temple, Richard cursed beneath his breath. “What is the *point* of having kids if it only means more *work* for us? Back in the city, the groundskeepers would have dealt with this.”

Diana put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed. “We moved here for a reason, babe. Don’t forget that.”

“How could I? I can’t get a minute to myself between our little ‘reasons’ and chores. Who signed up for this?”

“We both did the minute we saw that first ultrasound.”

“Yeah, but they were cute then—all small and squiggly. And, most importantly, *conceptual* at that stage. The reality is…different.”

“C’mon. Sure, kids are work, a hassle even at times. But it’s not like we could return them.”

Richard looked at Diana, hopefully like a puppy who really thought he was going to get that last bite of steak. “But…”

“No.” She glared. “No *jokes* about sending them to grandma’s until they get a decent interface or Swiss boarding schools which we can’t afford. Please, I can’t take that today.”

“Lighten up, pumpkin…”

“Oh crap. ‘Pumpkin.’ I forgot to carve the fantasy pumpkins for Jamie’s Kindergarten.”

Richard arched an eyebrow. “Do I even want to know what a ‘fantasy’ pumpkin is?”

“It’s when you freeze the thing first and then follow along with a bunch of YouTube videos and Pinterest pics to create something ‘original’ with a razor blade and Dremel tool.”

“Yeah, outside of the sharp objects, I’m definitely not interested.”

Diana looked out the window, her gaze soft. “It’s not always going to be like this. One day—“

“Yeah. *One* day, we’ll both be dead and buried, and our ghosts will wonder where all the time went. I miss living in the now.”

“That’s a hectic thing to say. Do you mean it?” She pursed her lips. “And also…about the leaves?”

“Are *you* kidding me, Di? Enough with the damn leaves. There’s *more* to life than that. I’ll just hire someone.”

Clearing her throat, Diana’s eyes misted slightly. “We don’t have the money. Not right now. Tuition checks just went out for the next semester, and Max is getting braces.”

“Wow. So that’s what it’s like now. What happened to us just being *us*?”

“Kids.”
