Olivia groaned as the baby kicked, her round belly quivering beneath her day gown.  

Perhaps it was a blessing being chubby of cheek with a  Rubenesque figure.  No one, not even the nosy Lady Gwendolyn and her lapdog Emily suspected her pregnancy, much less how advanced it was.

When her confinement began three weeks ago, Olivia thought nothing of it. Surely, those old nags could live without her for a bit. Why must anyone know her private matters?

But no, New York high society demanded full transparency or at least regular juicy scandals. Olivia had neither to her name. Her husband, Lord Geoffrey Samuels, was considered quite the catch. Much jealousy had ensued at their union. 

But Geoffrey was seldom seen these days. Ever since the tunnel project began, heâ€™d been occupied with overseeing it.  Gossip mongers like Lady Gwendolyn and Emily had had a field day. It was one of the reasons they often had her to tea. 

Which led to the problem at hand. A private person, Olivia shared little of the real meat of life with her peers. Why would she when she could offer a happy, carefully constructed view without interference?

Olivia paced so much as a heavily pregnant woman can. The Doctor said it would be good for the baby. After a couple of heartbreaking miscarriages, any advice was appreciated. Just not from her ridiculously fertile peers. 

With the assistance of her maid, Olivia sat heavily at her correspondence chair.

Five messages from Lady Gwendolyn and three from Emily.

What to do? Honest answers were off the table. Perhaps she could create a little scandal. Potentially, it would also defuse any tension around the pregnancy if, please god, it came to term.

But what to say?
