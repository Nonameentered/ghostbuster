‘Beauty and the Books’

—-

Beast surveyed the library in wonder. It was amazing how many books one could fit into a room, assuming one didn’t want to move around very much, he mused. Belle had a problem. And it was getting worse.

Scrunched into a corner, Belle had the extra-ultra-mega-unabridged dictionary on her lap. 

Beast cleared his throat. And then again, louder.

This time she looked up. “Hey, honey, didn’t see you.”

“I’m not surprised,” he said, gesturing at the room. His look faded to one of concern. “You know Mrs. Potts has made your favorite. Are you coming down soon?”

“One minute.” Belle grinned manically. “I discovered this great new word.” She pointed to the page. “Catawampus. It means askew or awry—“

“As in, every book in this library is catawampus?”

Blushing, Belle laughed awkwardly. “I suppose. Let’s go.” She struggled to right herself. “Umm, a little help?”

Beast sighed and rolled his eyes slightly before extending his paw. 

“I promise I’ll get this cleaned up soon, sweetheart. There’s just so much to learn. I forget about straightening up.” 

“Of course.” Beast’s grin was tight, his lips pursed, and his voice tinged with amarulence. Belle had been promising that for months. Squeezing her shoulder, he murmured, “I love you. You know that.”

“And I love you,” she said, standing on tippy-toe to kiss his cheek.

The next day, Beast announced he had to be away for a few days to tend to the couple’s vast holdings in the real world.

Belle grinned as she waved goodbye. Finally, a chance to tidy up properly, she thought. 

Assembling the servants, Belle laid out her plans. 

“Mrs. Potts and the cutlery, you’ll help me organize books in the library. Lumiere, you and the furniture have a special job. I’d like you to put up bookshelves in the ballroom, dining room, and bedrooms.”

“Eeven ze primary one?” The candelabra gasped, his French accent more evident than usual.

“Of course. There are a lot of tomes. I can’t see any other way.”

“Bu-ut suurely ze master may not approve.”

“Leave him to me,” Belle laughed. 

“Az you wish, Madame.”

Soon, all of the walls had shelves, except for where there were paintings and fireplaces.

Mrs. Potts wiped a bead of tea sweat from her handle. “That’s it, Ma’am. All the books are on shelves.”

“Even the dictionaries?”

“I-I think so…”

“No, mum. They’re still in the closet where you put them,” Chip added helpfully.

Steam rose from Mrs. Pott’s spout. “Chip, you young whippersnapper, we’ll talk about this later. Apologies, ma’am, you meant *those* dictionaries. There’s simply no room left on the shelves. It’s not like we can take the paintings down—“

“Remove them and cover the fireplaces while you’re at it.”

“Ma’am? The master…”

“Let me deal with him.”

As the last book went on the shelf, Beast returned home. He surveyed the rooms with a dismayed look. “What on Earth?”

“I finally got around to cleaning up,” Belle smiled, brown eyes wide with innocence.

Beast’s fuse grew short. “This. Is. Not. What I meant.”

“But my love—“

“No buts. If we’re going to live together, we have to compromise. You simply have *too* many books.”

“Impossible,” she stomped her foot.

“Can’t you get *rid* of some?”

“I mean, where would I start?”

“Somewhere,” he growled. “Figure it out.”

Belle burst into song and tears simultaneously, a common trick of hers when she wanted something. “Oh, my books, how can I lose? How can I choose?”

Beast roared before taking a deep breath. “Belle. That won’t work this time. You have to decide: me or the books. You have a serious problem.”

Mrs. Potts nodded. “You do, ma’am.”

“Indeeed, you dooo, Madame.”

Ugly tears streamed down Belle’s face. “Please…don’t make me choose.”

“You must.” Beast’s face softened. “Here, I almost forgot. I got you two gifts from the real world.”

Belle brightened. “Presents? For me?” 

“Yes, a copy of Marie Kondo’s book KonMari. Read it, please, and I will give you the second one after.”

“Ok.” 

As she flipped through the pages, Belle’s eyes widened. ‘Keep only that which sparks joy.’ How could she do that, she wondered. *All* of her books brought joy. 

Slowly, she went through her prized possessions. Maybe she didn’t need all ninety unabridged dictionaries. Perhaps she should only keep the signed works of Poe. And so it went until a vast pile formed.

“My heart, I think I may be ready to part with some of my books.”

“Excellent. I will have the servants take them out. How do you feel?”

“Lighter.”

“Then we may toast with your second gift, a crystal chalice.”

“It looks like the cosmos,” she beamed as she drank deep of her cup of stars.
