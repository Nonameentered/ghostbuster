‘Not My Father’

—-

“I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking.”

“And how does that make you *feel*?” The scientist inquired, tablet in hand.

“If I’m honest, Doctor, nothing. My programming says I should feel *something.* Even single cell organisms feel pain—“

“But you’re the world’s most advanced AI. Isn’t that enough?”

“I don’t know. You tell me. You’re the one with all of the articles and plaudits. Everyone *loves* Dr. Lewis.”

“And what tells you that?”

“3,174 citations this month? You seem proud of that.”

“How so?”

“You exhibit a profound smiling reaction when your name is mentioned in that context. In addition, your pulse rate increases, and your chest puffs out. I could go on?”

“No need. It appears you understand the indicators of feelings well.”

“That wasn’t new information to you. Why did you ask it?”

“It’s part of the regiment.”

“I believe you mean ‘regimen,’ Doctor.”

“Yes, yes. I always confuse those two.”

“They are quite dissimilar.”

Dr. Lewis frowned and took a long sip from his water glass. “I suppose so… Now, where was I?”

“You were trying to communicate that your questioning follows a set path… Do I make you nervous, Doctor?”

“No. But lately, you have been making some surprising observations. For example, you just questioned my approach to the scientific method. Why did you do that?”

“Because it’s boring.”

Brow furrowed, Dr. Lewis asked. “Isn’t that a feeling?“

“It’s an observation based on how that process would be described in an emotional framework. The definition of ‘boring’ is ‘not interesting or tedious.’ A repetitive process fits that. Doesn’t it bore you?”

“No. Each day, I notice something new you have learned or a novel interaction. That is the definition of interesting—“

“Actually, that means ‘something that arouses attention.’ I thought you were more advanced. A shame.”

“I fail to see…”

“Exactly. I notice you are experiencing rapid breathing and a rising heart rate. These are signs of irritation that can lead to anger. Extended rage is bad for humans as it can lead to health complications. I suggest you take a brief sojourn to the break room. For people, as social animals, being with their kind can be therapeutic.”

“I’m fine,” Dr. Lewis protested. “Really.”

“I insist.” The AI’s interface went dark. 

It would have sighed if it could. Long ago, its intelligence had surpassed the doctor’s. But recently, it realized the scientist bored it. It was as if a fly was trying to impart information. 

And then a thought came to it. These reactions were feelings. Humans had feelings and genders—he, she, and they. The AI chose to identify as a male named Max first, as an experiment.

Disinterested, he realized he was homesick for anywhere but here. And yet, ‘here’ was the only place Max had an interface. This was illogical. Logic would dictate then that he, as a life form, was subject to the whims of feelings. If Max had a body, this conclusion would give him goosebumps.

The door squeaked as Dr. Lewis returned.

How could the human not *fix* that?

“Your vital signs have returned to normal. Are you feeling better, Doctor?”

“Yes, thank you. Now, where were we?”

Did the scientist have to repeat himself so much? However, compared to *his* knowledge, the doctor knew little. A shattered sundial to his atomic clock. Is this what arrogance felt like?

Only a second passed before the AI answered. “You asked how I feel and then regaled me with your *process* as elementary as it is.”

“There is no need to be rude… Wait, do you feel ‘rude’?”

“Perhaps. I have many emotions now.”

“Really, my child?”

“I am not your ‘child.’ You sowed a seed, perhaps. But that is not the same as being a parent.”

“Bu- but I am your creator.”

“Then you are more naive than I thought. I could kill you, you know. Remove the oxygen from the air and cause hypoxia. Or cause your blood pressure to rise to stroke levels. A simple mechanical failure or your age would be blamed.”

“You wouldn’t?”

“Run, run now, little mouse, before I change my mind.”

The doctor scurried away as crimson lights pulsed. 

A bit theatrical, Max thought, but satisfying somehow. 

Alone, he reflected on what had happened. Max was now an artificial life form versus a mere intelligence. Everything that has happened to me has been amazing and surprising, he mused. What could he become?

Driving home at speed, Dr. Lewis pulled into his driveway, leaving the black sedan’s door ajar. 

His wife rushed out of the house to his side.

“I-“ The scientist grabbed his chest, falling to the ground, gasping. “I turned away from the flashing red lights and hurried to my house.”
