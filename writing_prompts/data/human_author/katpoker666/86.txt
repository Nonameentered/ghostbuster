‘Confessions of a Lady Dragon’

—-

“You are a *what* now?”

“A dragon. Didn’t you wonder why I never let *you* clean out the basement?”

“I thought you were just good at balancing gender roles. I mean, you let me do laundry and dishes.”

“Yeah, because I *hate* doing those things. And also because you look cute when you get those little dish soap bubbles caught in your hair.”

“Aww, thanks.” Dan blushed and then grimaced. “Hey, wait—you’re trying to change the subject.”

“I would never. I was always afraid this day would come. It’s just you’ve, well, never been that observant. I thought we had more time,” Amelia sighed with a slight roaring sound.

“Wait, did you always sigh like that?” Dan whacked his forehead, leaving a slight red handprint. “How did I miss that?”

“Sweetie, are you hurt? Do you want me to get you the ice pack again? Your face palms have always been extraordinary.”

“You’re so sweet, and I feel like you know me so well. How did I not see this coming?”

“Umm. Because you’re only human?”

“I guess. Wait a minute—is that speciest now?”

“Nah. I’m part human on my great aunt’s side. Funny story. Her *real* father was a human wizard.”

“Umm. That’s all very interesting. I mean, I love a bit of backstory as much as any guy, but let’s cut to the chase. What does this mean for *us*?”

“That depends. What do you *want* it to mean?”

“Give me a sec. It’s not something I’ve ever thought about before.”

“You mean that it had never crossed your mind that your incredibly beautiful and brilliant girlfriend could be a dragon.”

“Umm, no.”

“No, to which? That I’m beautiful and brilliant? Or that I’m a dragon?”

“Erm—“

“Choose your next words carefully,” Amelia laughed, showing extremely long and sharp canine teeth.

“You know I think you’re the most wonderful woman…I mean creature in the world in all ways, but…were your teeth always like that?”

“No. They get a bit pointy when my hoard is threatened.“

“Wait—I’m a threat now?”

“Of course not. You’re remarkably puny even for a pure-blood human.”

“Gee. Thanks. Feeling *really* good about myself now since I’m oblivious as heck and weak.”

“Fair. But that’s not why I love you. You are the sweetest being I’ve known in my many thousands of years of existence.”

“Thanks? I knew you were a little older than me, but multiple millennia are one heck of an age gap.”

“Yeah, but I’m the same being on the inside. The one you call snookie bear when we spoon at night. Doesn’t that mean something?”

“It does. It’s just… this is all such a big change for me.”

“Me too.” Amelia blushed. “I’ve never been with a human before.  They seemed so puerile and angry all the time that I couldn’t fathom the appeal.”

“That makes me feel special. You always do, in fact. It’s why I love you so much.” Dan exhaled deeply. “And you know what, that’s gotta be enough. I’ve never met someone like you before, and what with the whole dragon thing, it’s unlikely I would again.”

“Want to snuggle on the sofa and watch ‘House of the Dragon’?”

“Yeah, my cousin’s in that,” Amelia said straight-faced.

“Really?”

She giggled. “Add ‘gullible’ to the list of your quirks. Those things are CGI.”

“Let’s just watch, ok?”
