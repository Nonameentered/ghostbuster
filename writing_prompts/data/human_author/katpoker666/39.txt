Hey azdv—nice read! I liked in the intro how teacherly the first words sounded. It immediately grounds us:

>>Ah, the first day of a new year! Welcome freshmen

I also like the class’ reactions that you’ve peppered throughout. It helps break up Loriel’s dialog a bit. 

That said, the opening paragraph is a bit long for a piece of dialog as are a number of the subsequent ones:

>>Ah, the first day of a new year! Welcome freshmen, there is nothing more I enjoy as a teacher than seeing the bright eager faces of a new class ready to start a new chapter in their learning career…so could you at least fake it for the next forty-five minutes?”

Tightening it up would make it feel a little more natural. Think about when you speak IRL. You never say more than a couple sentences, right? Unless you’re giving a speech, which is somewhat ok with a teacher, but can still feel a bit too drawn out when you go to read it.

One way to condense things a bit, if you do want to include the whole speech is to think about what is needed / essential for the communication. So for example, we know she’s a teacher so you could take that bit out. 

The other thing I’d note with dialog is that speech tags like (Mrs. Loriel) work better in scripts, as that is what people most often associate them with. They also don’t really give us an insight into how the character sounds. Remember in a conversation a lot of the communication is beyond the words used. So the sound of the voice, how the body moves, etc.
