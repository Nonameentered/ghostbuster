‘Teeing Up Romance’

—-

“I haven’t had a good affair in months.”

“What? Is that a record for you?” Gladys chortled.

“Probably.” Sylvie touched her friend’s arm. “But a girl’s gotta do—“

“What a girl’s gotta do.” 

“Besides, I didn’t say that I didn’t have *any* affairs. Just no *good* ones.” 

They both laughed at that. 

Sylvie put her cup of tea down and looked over at a picture of a distinguished, silver-haired gentleman in golfing gear. “You know, I wish it were true.”

“That what was?”

“That I had had affairs. Well…not exactly that.” Sylvie bit her lip. “Maybe that I’d been with someone besides Herman.“

Gladys paused and spluttered into her Earl Grey. “Wait. What?”

“It’s embarrassing. Herman was the only one I ever even dated seriously.”

“Honey, it’s nothing to be ashamed of.”

“Yeah, but you’ve had what, like, four husbands?”

“Five, but who’s counting.”

“I am. I don’t even know how dating works.”

“It’s ok. I’ll be your wing woman, as the kids say these days.”

“Like an angel?”

“Umm. Sort of… It’s like someone who helps you catch a gentleman’s fancy when you’re nervous and makes you look good.”

“So an angel?”

“Let’s go with that. C’mon. We have work to do. First, we have to find you something to wear. Let’s see your closet.”

Sylvie opened the door to the closet, revealing rows of neatly organized stretch pants and serviceable shirts.

“Boring,” Gladys faux yawned as she rifled through the racks. “What, are you a grandmother?”

“Well, yes. Actually.”

“That’s beside the point. You want to be *cool* grandma not… whatever this is.”

Sylvie exhaled slowly. “I do have a twin set. Only…”

“What?”

“It was Herman’s favorite. I kept it for the memories. It would seem disrespectful to wear it. Like I’d be cheating on him.”

“Nonsense. Let’s see it.”

A lilac cashmere shirt and sweater emerged. 

“Ooh. Perfect. A bit of jewelry and a splash of Chanel No. Five, and you’ll be set.”

Sylvie walked down the stairs to the common area as Gladys sashayed.

“How do you walk like that?”

“It’s all in the hips.” Gladys gave a Marilyn Monroe pout, her Botoxed lips puckering awkwardly. “Hey, there’s that new guy in 406—quite a looker. And see, he’s sitting alone. Let’s strike while the iron’s hot.”

“May we join you?”

“Sure,” he said as he put down his copy of ‘Golf Illustrated.’

“Ooh. My husband used to read that.”

Gladys gave Sylvie a death stare. “What she meant to say was—“

“It’s ok. I was married once too. Most of us were, I’d guess. No sin in that.” He gave Sylvie a shy smile. “You play?”

“Once upon a time. Been a while, though.”

“Me too. Want to play a quick round on the mini-golf course? Not the same, but my fake knee—“

“You have one? Me too! And I’d love to.”

“Shall we?”

Gladys grinned as they walked off. “My work here is done.”
