‘The Thirteen Pound Heist’

—-

The room was dark and smelled of biscuits as the two entered. They exchanged glances in the dim light. 

From the shadows, a third came forth. Lean and black, he commanded attention, and he knew it. Stretching languidly, Stewie purred, “I’m sure you were all wondering why I asked you here tonight.”

“Is it finally time?” Woody asked, his blondish mop bobbing in time with his words.

“Indeed it is. We failed last year, but not this time. I have a plan.”

“Better, I hope. I may be new to this crew, but a girl has certain standards to uphold.”

“Nice to see you’re still full of fire, Billie. And yes, this time, we will succeed. We just needed some extra muscle.” Stewie eyed her up and down. “And you’re it.”

She chewed her lip for a moment. “What do you want me to do?”

“So, Woody’s going to provide a distraction over here.” Stewie paced toward the front door. 

“And you’re going to come in from there,” he gestured toward the ledge above. “Think you can make it?”

Billie huffed before expertly jumping onto the polished surface. “That work?”

“Perfect.” He nodded. “Now, for this to succeed, we need to time it out exactly. Luckily, it’ll be daylight.”

“Indeed, boss.” Woody nodded. “After last year—“

“I told you not to bring that turkey up again!”

“Sorry, boss.”

“As I was saying, timing is of the essence,” Stewie sniffed. “Based on past observation, the package will be shifted into a new container when the sun is at its peak. It will then be under tight lockdown until the sun moves 1/4 of the way down.”

“So, not our window, then?”

“Nope, Billie. But right after that is when we need you.”

She chewed thoughtfully on a stick. “How’s it work?”

“The guard will be alone by this point. They’ll put the goods on that ledge where you are for a 1/12 sun movement. If we don’t strike then, we’ll be out of luck for another year.”

“Got it. Strike, seize, and don’t miss.”

“Exactly.”

Two days later, the morning dawned clear.  The three assembled in the room at 1/4 revolution after the sun’s zenith.

The guard walked around with the package ignoring them.

“So far, so good,” Woody stage whispered. “The guard’s alone.”

“Shhh,” Stewie hissed. “We gotta look normal.”

Turning, the guard placed the package on the shelf. 

“Woody, you’re up.”

Capering around the guard and making as much noise as possible, Woody veered toward the door.

“Hey—where are you going, fella?” The guard asked, sounding exasperated. “You want to go out?”

Stewie commanded, “That’s our signal, Billie.”

The two hopped up onto the ledge together.

“Ready?” Stewie asked, eyes bright.

Without replying, Billie jumped up. “Coming?”

Joining her, Stewie began pushing the package off the ledge. “A little help?”

They heaved and it fell to the floor with a great clatter.

“What the—?” The guard screeched as the three pets dug into the Thanksgiving turkey.
