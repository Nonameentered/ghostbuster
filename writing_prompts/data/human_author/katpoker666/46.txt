Gwendolyn leaned against the door. Her skin glowed with perspiration. Fanning herself with her new indigo lace fan from Seville, she sighed. “Are we social pariahs now, Emily? To be reduced to knocking at doors where our welcome is far from certain is a shocking development.”

“Indeed.” Emily huffed. “And to think, *Diana* of all people is our last resort. Her husband and the gambling…”

“Were the gossip of *last* season. But this is a new one, and quite frankly, we are in greater need of her than she of us.”

Gwendolyn patted her voluminous skirts and tucked a stray blonde lock behind her ear. Pasting on a most congenial smile, she knocked at Diana’s door.

The butler opened it slowly. His eyes widened before narrowing. He looked down and coughed before recovering himself. “Yes?”

“Lady Gwendolyn Du Champ and Miss Emily Courtworth are here to see your esteemed mistress. Is she at home?”

A scuttling from the drawing room and a soft curse traveled from behind him. The butler looked back before replying. “The mistress is not in, I’m afraid.”

More whispering was heard. 

“And she will… be away for the next two weeks. So if you’ll excuse me, I’ll tell her you called.”

Lady Gwendolyn jammed her foot in the closing door in a most *unladylike* fashion. “I am sorry, but Emily *is* there. Why I can hear her breathing.”

Emily trundled out. “You have caught me, Gwen. I’d hoped it wouldn’t come to this.” She shrugged. “Now, I suppose I *must* invite you in.”

Arching an eyebrow, Lady Gwendolyn replied. “It would seem to be rude not to. Although,” she waved broadly, “this whole process has been rather unseemly.”

Diana bristled. “You know what? Courtesy be darned. Please be away!”

The door slammed.

“Well, I never, Emily.”
