“Hell 2.0: Kitten Power”

—-

“Seven potholes per mile is unacceptable, Engineer Metztli. This is *the* Road to Hell, not some minor thoroughfare in Lower Demonville,” Satan roared.

“Your Infernalness, I am sorry. We do our best in the night crew, maintaining the road as best we can. But without proper pavement—“

“Wait, the *asphalt* is the issue?”

“Well, erm, yes. You remember the old saying, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions’?”

“Go on.”

“Turns out it’s true.”

“Why have we never noticed this before?”

“It is the rise of secularism, sire. Without having to score points with a deity, humans tend to think for themselves and indeed of themselves first.”

“Oh dear, what can we do?

“We need the right balance your evilness; we obviously don’t want to help god gain followers as that will help the holy soul pipeline.”

“True, but then what can we do?”

“Well, humans watch a lot of videos on a thing called YouTube and search for answers to life’s questions on another thing called Google. They are both owned by a company called Alphabet—“

“You are making these names up, aren’t you? They sound so stupid.”

“Afraid not. Humans are notoriously bad at naming things. Think of the poor platypus. It’s not enough that god got drunk when making it, but the very name adds insult to injury.”

“Focus, Metztli. What are you proposing.”

“It's simple, really. We acquire this Alphabet and use it to create a new religion centered around cats—“

“Why cats?” Satan looked intently at Metztli and leaned forward in his skull throne.

“While the creatures themselves are conniving little bastards, they do seem to have a soothing effect on humans and generate positive responses.”

“Hmmm. Very interesting. And on brand for hell. Think it will work?”

“I am betting my soul on it.”

“That you are, my girl. That you are.”
