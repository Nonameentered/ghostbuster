<2/3> “You had to do it, didn’t you, Digory?”

“Do *what*? I’m just dreaming. Thought a kid could still do that without getting detention. And what the heck are you doing here?”

“It’s complicated—“

“How so? It’s *my* dream, and I want to know why you’re in it. I’ve never dreamed about being a teacher before. Why would I start now?”

Mrs. Epiales put her right hand to her temple as if she had a headache. She sighed and replied, “you remember in class when I taught you the names of the gods and goddesses? Well…I’m Persephone.”

Digory’s eyes nearly popped out of his head; they were so wide. “Like, *the* goddess? No way.”

“Yes, way. And keep up. It’s embarrassing enough to have to explain to a mortal like you.”

“Ok. Say I believe that. Why are you, Hades’ freaking wife, standing outside the gate to what I’m guessing is the underworld. Are you here to greet people like me?”

“Umm. No. You see… and this is embarrassing…Hades is mad at me, and well, this is the godly equivalent of being sent to sleep on the sofa.”

“I get it. My dad does that sometimes. It sucks until mom cools down.”

“Yeah, well, imagine that for a millennium. He did this once before, and it took that long.”

“Is that the same reason you teach at stupid old Milwood Elementary?”

“Yeah. Hades cut me off financially too. Being a real jerk this time. So I needed to find a job to make ends meet. A goddess has certain needs, you know.”

“Oh man, that sucks. Even my mom isn’t *that* mean.”

“Yeah, well, the good part is I’ve literally lived through all of history, so there’s that.”

“Anyway, do you want to go inside?”
