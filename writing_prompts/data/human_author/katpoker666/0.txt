‘My Biochemical Romance’

—-

The downy depths of the dark duvet beckon. I yearn to pull it over my head and shut out my heartbreak. 

A distant siren wails, strengthening my resolve. Doing something, anything has to be better than this.

Lacing on my running shoes, I bolt outside into the chill November air. I race down the cobbled streets. My shoes tap the pavement like an ever-accelerating metronome. 

And still, I run.

Past shops we’d visited. That cafe Clare liked with the double cocoa tiramisu. 

Euphoric endorphins surge through my body, filling the gap of oxytocin’s sweet embrace. 

And still, I press on.
