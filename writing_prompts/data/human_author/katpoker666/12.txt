‘The Rapids’

—-

The humid breeze stung my sunburned face. Mosquitoes bit my ankles with abandon. I swatted one into a satisfying splat of my blood. 

Robin handed me a bottle of water as we walked. Drinking greedily, I felt my stomach churn.

“Whoa, not so fast. You’ll get sick, Kim.”

“Yeah, I know. I taught you that, remember?”

“Don’t be so ungrateful. At least I listened.”

“Yeah, sorry. Heat is getting to me, I guess.”

They patted my shoulder, leaving a white handprint that shone against the fireball red. “I noticed,” Robin chortled. “Want me to give you a hand with that? Get it?” 

“Remind me again why I brought you with me to Africa?”

“Because we both have always wanted to go to Uganda to see the animals and stuff?”

“Don’t part with your illusions. I remember a fight where a certain someone said we could see animals at the zoo and that Hawaii might be nice this time of year.”

Futzing with their curly blond mop, Robin looked sheepish but said nothing.

David, the tour guide, turned and grinned, waving his hand at the nearby river. “And this, my friends, is the mighty White Nile.”

I spat out my most recent sip of water. “What? This?! It looks like my creek back home.”

“Don’t be fooled, Kim,” the guide shook his head. “These waters may be still here. But they run deep. And fast.”

“But it’s barely got an eddy by that rock. It looks like you could lounge down it in an inner tube.”

“It may look smooth here, but there are some of Africans, if not the world’s best Category V rapids downstream. From your extensive white water rafting experience, you know how that goes.”

With a blush that I was glad the sunburn masked, I nodded. “Of course. I was just being silly.”

Robin gave me *all* of the side eye and mouthed, ‘Expert?’

I shrugged.

Shaking their head, they rolled their eyes.

David looked between us, brows furrowed. “Is everything ok?”

“Yeah, just a little tiff.”

“Ok,” he shrugged. “Let’s get going then. Given your experience, you’ll both go with Mukasa.” He gestured to the other couple on the tour. “And since you’re novices, you’ll come with me.”

Mukasa smiled his teeth as starkly white as I wish mine were. “Safety first,” he said, handing us the life vests. “Oars next,” he murmured as if going through a checklist while tossing them into the center of the craft. “Alright, grab the handles.”

We waded into the water, pulling the black rubber vessel with us. Hopping in, we barely stumbled. The other pair didn’t have the same luck as what I presumed was the husband toppled into the water headfirst.

Helping him up, David, to his credit, kept a straight face. “Be careful. There are crocodiles.” He made the universal hand sign for giant mouth ready to chomp.

The man’s eyes widened until the whites showed. “Crocodiles?”

“Yes, of course. It is a tributary of the Nile, after all.”

Feeling bad for the guy, I shouted, “He’s just kidding, I’m sure.”

David glared at me. “I never joke about famelicose reptiles that can get up to twenty feet long and weigh 1,600 pounds.”

“He’s right, Kim. I saw that on National Geographic.”

My own eyes threatened to pop out of my head at that. Recovering myself, I replied, “Got it. Stay *in* the raft.”

The guide sighed. “Yes, but that’s not always possible. Particularly at the Washing Machine.”

“The what now?”

“It's the biggest rapid on our route. Has a nasty vortex effect. Topples most rafts. And it’s nearly the highest category, a Class VI. Probably should be, to be honest. Which is why I’m glad you’re experts too. Hate to take four newbies through there.”

My expression became more solemn. It’s going to be fine, I thought. What could happen in two hours? It’s shorter than a movie, for crying out loud.”

I leaned out the side of the raft, pointing. “Crocodile!”

“Log,” David replied without turning around.

This continued for the next half hour as we wound through boring bends. And then a thick spray emerged with the unmistakable roar of *major* rapids.

“Washing machine ahead!” 

The raft reared up, near vertical, as I screamed.

Water splashed over the sides. It spun—a 180. Vertical again. Then down. Straight into the vortex.

“Grab the handles!” Mukasa shouted. “Hold tight!”

My hand clung to the handle, talon-like, as we descended to the river bed. We hit a rock. My grip broke free.

Eyes stinging from the murky, swirling water, I couldn’t see which end was up. Robin and Mukasa were gone. Nothing but me and the water. We were at the mercy of the currents.

I screamed in distress, but no one could hear.
