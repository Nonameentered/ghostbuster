I really like this nerdy poet! There were some lovely descriptions and the tale itself was very emotive. 

A couple small things:

—the opening sentence felt a little strange to me when the MC’s transformation is revealed later. I think because the home hadn’t really changed, but he had. It might be too subtle for me, but thought I should mention:

>> As Xolani Mthethwa passed through the gate to his childhood home, the ruins that stared at him felt like a mirror, reflecting his own transformation.

>> Yet he had found peace since then. It had taken 60 years and much self reflection to be able to face this place again; but now, standing here, he was happy.

—the story itself covers a long period of time in such a short piece. It meant you had to be pretty zoomed out to make it work, which you did. But it also meant you had to do a lot more telling vs showing to take the reader all the way through. For me, I wanted to feel more of Xolani’s emotions here. Particularly after a profound transformation
