‘Cooking with Idiots’

—-

In the test kitchen’s sterile confines, I wiped a smudge off the granite. I try to keep this place sospital, but it’s tricky. Good help is so hard to find these days. But in the run-up to Christmas, I need all the assistance I can get. 

My new holiday bromography is in the works, and it has to be ready for soccer moms everywhere. This is my thirtieth edition—my legacy to the cooking world that will last long after I’m gone. That said, I don’t expect to live forever, but I do intend to hang on as long as possible. 

An alarm chimed—time to start on the test desserts.

“I need a jobler. Who wants to make peach cobbler?”

Julio raised his hand. “Boss, why must you speak in rhyme? Every. Single. Time.”

“It’s a management technique from a rival kitchen. Their food is quite bitchin’. But meanwhile, the oven’s hot. Do you want to help or not?”

Grabbing the loaf pan and a basket of peaches, Julio headed back to his station.

As he peeled and pared, I stared.  “You call that a slice? Why it’s practically a dice! Have you never used a knife? Not once in your entire life?”

“I have, of course. The knife’s dull, and I must use a lot of force.”

Rolling my eyes, I willed my tone to be patient. “Make it finer. This isn’t some misbegotten diner.”

He finished with a smile, but gosh, it took a while.

“Now for the pastry crust. Getting it right is a must,” I insisted.

“Could I take a break? I know there’s a lot at stake. Maybe stop for a prandicle or snack to get through it? I promise to hardly chew it.”

“Oh poo. Boohoo. I used to work twelve hours at a trot. And dang, that place was hot.”

“I don’t give a toss. But hey, you’re the boss.”

“Simply blend the milk and dry ingredients. Do so with expedience. Then place it with the butter in the pan. I know you can.”

Julio did as he was told. I didn’t even have to scold.

It came out of the oven nice and hot. I thought I’d have a taste and give it a shot.

It tasted bland. I couldn’t understand what had gone wrong. “Julio, what’s up with this? It tastes like peach-flavored piss. Pardon my language, for I am a lady. But dang, this tastes shady.”

“I didn’t mean to cause you any distress.  It’s just you’re a hard woman to please ‘Miss Stress.’”

“We’re a strange pair, aren’t we? A sarcastic, hard-headed sous chef and the *patient* one with her name on the book, *laughably*, is me.” I sighed. “Take a bite. You’ll see this is shite.”

Tasting it, he grimaced. “Ugh, it’s all my fault. I forgot to add the salt!”
