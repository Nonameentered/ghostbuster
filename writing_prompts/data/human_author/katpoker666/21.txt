This was a lovely story, Jayn. And nice as a parable too when you consider the humans ignoring nature. I really like the setup with the quirky names and the way you’ve established so well how the Grevtree looks. In a few words, it’s made it seem like a proper world!

A couple of notes:

- Here, it feels like they’re walking together to see the Grevtree, so it might be more powerful if they both see it together and then Gramama describes it. I think that would bring the reader in even more:
- 
>> “Grammama, tell me about the Grevtree please.”

>>”Oh, the Grevtree. It shines as bright as the sun. It’s always day where the tree stands.”

>> Draloh trudged up the hillside. 

The other thing I’d note is this part feels contradictory, as it seems like Gramama is there with Dray. It also feels strange in such a tight word count to say the tree was misdescribed by Gramama :

>> Instead of a leafy canopy he beheld a small galaxy perched atop the broad trunk. It bathed the area in a blue glow, a far cry from the perpetual day he’d been told about.

But small things. As I said, I’m amazed at what a detailed world you’ve created here
