Your descriptions here are gorgeous, Joxy! The one thing I’d say is that much as I love them, we don’t get to the nature of the conflict behind Margarite is running until about half way in:

>> The freezing mist was too thick here, paralyzing her limbs. The barks grew closer, and as they did, she heard their masters’ shouts.

You do give a hint here and we know Margarite is running from something:

>> Another gust flew past her, carrying the sound of harsh barking. 

And then when she is saved, it ends up leaving me the reader on a cliffhanger:

>> “Head upstairs. My wife knows where to hide you.”

This puts the pacing off and also makes me feel like the story is too big for this piece the way it is established.

That said, it’s very well written and with the gorgeous descriptions, I want to read more! :)
