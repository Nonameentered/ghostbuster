You drool involuntarily as a rabbit pauses in the distance. Falling to the ground, you realize you need all four feet to walk.

Paws. They’re freaking paws, you struggle to murmur. A low rasping whine is all that emerges. 

You want to ponder your situation, but the hunter’s urge overwhelms you.

All you can think is that ball of beige fluff bouncing around eating leaves. Your own stomach growls in anticipation as you careen through the forest with far more grace than in your bipedal form.

The rabbit runs, but you are faster. You follow the scent of clover mixed with dew-dampened fur. 

You run. Faster and faster. Leaping over fallen trees with ease, you stop only when you reach your prey.

The rabbit shrieks in terror as you bite down without remorse and sever its neck.

But that is but a morsel. You crave more. *Need* more, even as the iron taste of blood trickles down your jowl.

Fear gnaws at you. Fear of what’s happening to you. Fear of whether you will ever be normal again. But the hunger is stronger.

You catch a whiff of deer musk. Great gouges in the trees indicate a large male in full rut. The clomping of its hooves through the leaves on the forest floor is almost deafening. Twitching your ears, you realize the sound is coming from the right.

A baying, bleating sound you’ve never heard before echoes through the valley. About a thousand yards away by your calculation. 

You bound through the trees. 

A shot cracks through the still air from the very direction you’re heading. 

You pause, recognizing the sound on some liminal level between the lupine and human.

But you want that kill too much.
