I really like this, kelpy. Some really fantastic, visceral imagery that really fists with the story:

>>The way Johnny gyrates his hips as he goes into “Baby Don’t Lie”. The sweat falls like April showers. He is topless now, long black hair glossy with oil. 

You also use just the right amount of technical detail to pull us in without overwhelming lay folk:

>> The drum controls this song. I tap the cymbals lightly, then smack the bass. We’re in business.

There are also some nice details like this one that shows us a lot of time has passed:

>> Topless Johnny is more dad bod than beach bod. 

You also did a really good job varying sentence lengths

I like how you carried the concept of ‘drug’ through from beginning to end, as it made the ending that much more poignant.

World’s smallest crit: Pearl White Fender Coaster. Caster right? I think autocorrect caught you

But yeah, overall a really solid piece and a fun read
