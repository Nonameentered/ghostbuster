Yay! I’m so glad you responded—I love how you present animals / creatures and their interactions :)

Definitely agree with you re research, as you know. A lot of animal / creature personality is through actions vs verbal. That means being accurate and taking reader expectations about an animal into account.

And I love your killing the dog request.
