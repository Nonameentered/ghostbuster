‘Fantasia with Superheroes’

—-

Clouded with smoke, the city lay in ruin. Whole buildings rested on their sides as shattered pieces of concrete. Burning and burnt-out cars dotted what remained of the streets like misbegotten Christmas ornaments.

And amidst it all stood a masked team, their capes flapping gently in the smoggy breeze. 

“Hey, Josh. What’s up?” The leader asked, leaning back against a light pole so bent it looked poised to snap. “Haven’t seen you in a while. You here to watch our victory lap?” 

You rub your temple and look at the devastation around you. You gesture to the cracked shell of the former Circle City capitol building. “Victory lap, Ultra-mega-hero-man? Are you serious?”

“Well, umm, yes…we won, after all.”

“Yes, but at what cost? Look at this place. It’s a mess.”

“What are you, my mom? Heroing is a messy business,” Ultra laughed. “Besides, Ergalous was hard to beat.”

You roll your eyes. “Clearly.”

“So what are you doing here anyway? I haven’t seen you in ages. Not since Mortis and Triangle City. It’s not like we need someone whose so-called superpower is to ‘perfectly resolve an ongoing incident.’”

“Well—“

“The thing is done. We *won.*”

“Yes, but who is going to clean up *all* of this?”

“Not us. That’s the Super Scene Scrubber Squad’s job.” 

“They’ve been downsized by Hero Central. Don’t you read the newsletter?”

“Of course not. That’s for dweebs.”

“Well, *if* you’d read it, you would have seen that superheroes are now accountable for their own disasters. This certainly qualifies.”

“Make us.”

“With pleasure.” You grin as you turn them all into giant, sentient cleaning supplies.
