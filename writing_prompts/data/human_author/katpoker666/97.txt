The imagery here is amazing, girlcake! I love how this tells a story amid the beautiful descriptions. Partially as I prefer poems that tell stories lol. More importantly though, you’ve chosen to write a fairly long poem and I find that longer poems hold the reader’s attention more when there is a narrative thread to hold onto. You did a great job of that.

To crits that say you need a more consistent rhythm/meter, I feel it works as a little more freeform. 

I would also say though that the rhymes could be a little tighter, as when you set up an expectation for things to rhyme, the reader tends to glom onto that more and look out for it. 

The other thing I’d think about in a piece this long is punctuation at the end of lines for enhanced readability. It lets the reader know when to pause and when to carry through.

But overall, it’s a really lovely and expressive piece and a great read! :)
