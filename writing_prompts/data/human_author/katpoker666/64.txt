The title is a lot of fun, Restser, as it draws the reader in. I like the tardis vs drawers descriptions as well. There’s a lot of fun word play here too. And the writing is strong.

Since you have the available word count, I would have liked a little more description of their relationship up front for context. 

As this line feels funny from what turns out to be a friend:
>> He says I'm coming along nicely, whatever that means.

I totally get the concept of that super genius friend who is the social equivalent of super granola with extra fiber. Good for you, but in small doses. That makes sense, but then I’m unclear why the friend is judging the MC or:

>> Today, I challenged him as he was holding forth about the Reformation. 

To me, this sounds more like a teacher or the like vs. a pure friend. 

I learned a new word (sillygisms), but to me this feels a bit more self-mocking than the other descriptions as it indicates the mc knows they are foolish and then makes a joke about math. 
>>Apparently my sillygisms didn't add up. Well, I've never been good at maths. 

I feel like the original syllogisms which sillygisms is a play on might be more appropriate and then scrap the maths joke. But that may just be a matter of taste.
