“I *do* believe we have found the anomaly, Gwen. Grand, isn’t it? Our mission should soon be over.”

“This mission, at least. We have many more, of course, as part of Time Corp. You’re new, so I forgive that,” she laughed and yet sounded all business. “You can drop the accent too.” Gwen gestured around them. “They’re otherwise occupied, it would seem.”

True to their name, giant grey-skinned, ant-like invaders streamed down the streets. Flinging boulders from their unfeasibly strong mandibles, what the grey skins lacked in subtlety, they made up for in strength.

Emily twirled her Swiss army parasol and deflected a 200-pound rock with ease.

“Drat. Too many eyes to use the SIM charges.”

“Don’t you think the bigass ants are a giveaway?”

“Yes, but our goal is to minimize temporal disruption. Remember, the deeper we erase minds, the greater the risk.”

“Ok… Wait, I got it, Gwen. Think a  massive flamethrower would work?”

“Absolutely. But how?”

“Simple process. You gather the liquor barrels from the saloon’s basement. I’ll use the water tower and a pipe from the grain silo.”

Gwen grinned. “I’m impressed, kid. Particularly if this works.”

“It will.”

A thousand dead combatants were reduced to nothingness later, and all was resolved.

“Emily, well done! You’re definitely going places.”
