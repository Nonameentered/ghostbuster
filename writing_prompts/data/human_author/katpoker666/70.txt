‘Shadows of His Muse’

—-

It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, asking for someone who he was not.

It was for her. Kim, his ex-wife. Another one of her lovers, he assumed. How many could one woman have? Whatever the answer, there was a reason Kim was an ex.

John stood up and rubbed his eyes. There was no going back to sleep, not the way he felt. He grabbed a whiskey neat and sat down. Staring at the old Underwood typewriter on the shelf above his laptop, he touched it, leaving a line in the dust. It was said to be Hemingway’s. Even when he bought it, he knew that was a line. But it didn’t matter—sometimes hope from a lie was better than the truth.

He drank a long sip of whiskey and grabbed a cigarette. Coughing and spluttering as John took a drag, he remembered too late that he’d given up.

Everything can change at any moment, suddenly and forever. He laughed without mirth. Kim was his muse, and she was gone, nothing but some memories and a couple of photos he couldn’t bear to part with.

The cursor on the computer taunted him, reminding him his words, too, were gone. Gone with her to the District of Columbia. Kim would probably shack up with some bloviating low-level politician who’d convince her his fortunes were on the rise. That’s how John had gotten her anyway.

Stubbing the cigarette out in an old can of Coke, he turned back to the monitor and cursed. What was the point of a writer whose words had failed him? Could he even call himself a writer anymore? Or was that another ‘ex’ in his life?

The clock chimed loudly. An analog dinosaur, it had been Kim’s grandfather’s. Her fury at his getting it in the settlement and her hating that was the only thing that stood between it and a hammer. 

An email notification popped up on the computer. His eyes lit up. Maybe his publisher had finally gotten him some work.

<You have won $5,000 from Amazon. Click here to win…>

John sighed and hit delete. 

The clock chimed eleven times. He’d been up all night but didn’t feel tired. 

Maybe a break would help. He shrugged on his thin Patagonia fleece vest and headed out the door.

The stench of dog piss mingled with rancid trash and undercooked hotdogs to form a ‘perfect’ New York summer smell. 

John clenched his nostrils, willing the scent to fade, without luck. “It is not a fragrant world,” he murmured, vowing to save that line for later. 

Rounding the corner, he smiled at the proprietors of Green Leaf deli, glad to feel welcome somewhere, if only for a fleeting moment. John ordered a cup of inevitably stale coffee. Some days he wondered if he’d even like the real thing anymore.

Caffeine addiction sated, he took the number 6 subway down to Chinatown. 

Mott Street was another world from the Upper East Side. The Sephoras and Gaps of this world had no place amidst this area’s hustle and bustle. Headless ducks dangled in restaurant windows. Clouded fish eyes stared back at him from their ice-bound confines. Fruit stands hawked hairy rambutans and other exotic fruit, many of which he couldn’t name.

His feet took him on the all too familiar path to Bayard Street. Nestled in the center of the tiny street’s V-shape was a Vietnamese basement restaurant.  Its humble surroundings hid magnificent banh mi, pho, and Kim’s favorite, mi quang. 

To go in and remember happier times with his ex or to miss out on food that brought him joy. That was the question. John decided on the latter. 

Wandering over to the boba tea shop instead, he ordered a ginger green tea with extra large pearls. His lips curled around the giant red straw. John sucked in hard and nearly choked on the gummy tapioca orbs as he thought about how Kim loved this place too. 

There was no escape. Even in this chaotic warren that inspired so many other writers with its exotic feel, John felt bereft of ideas.

She was gone—why wouldn’t she go away?

His words were gone with her. Mute. No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them.
