‘Spiritual Upsell’

—-

In a crowded event hall clad all in white except for neon-pink ‘gloop’ signs, Margot elbowed the woman next to her with some force. 

“Ouch. Couldn’t you just use your Personal PowerTM like a normal person?” The woman rubbed her arm, showing off perfect diamanté nails. 

“Sorry.” Margot huddled back,  shoulders and arms held close like a pair of bat wings. “I’m a beginner.”

“No wonder you got bumped—you’ve *mastered* small space PP. You barely exist. Even when you were angry, your power barely extended a foot.”

Lowering her head, Margot became even tinier. 

“I bet people walk all over you, am I right?”

“Ye-es.”

The woman put her hand on Margot’s shoulder, releasing a hint of Gwen Paltry’s signature scent. “She’ll help you. I know it.”

“Wow. You even smell like the gloop goddess. Why would you come to a class like this? You seem to know everything.”

The woman smiled, a glint in her eye. “You’ll see.”

Delicate harp and lute music played, accelerating in volume. Porcelain pink curtains parted to reveal their rose depths. 

Gwen emerged waving from a crystalline throne. “Hello, Podunk!”

“Hello, Gwen.”

“C’mon. You can do better than that!”

“Hello, Gwen!”

She looked at her Patek Phillips watch. “That’ll do. We have *a* *lot* to cover in the next hour—“

Nudging the woman next to her, Margot murmured. “Wait? I thought it was three hours…”

“It’s one hour of content and two of gloop-related products you’ll need to complete your spiritual journey.”

Margot’s eyes widened. “Wait, this seminar was a thousand dollars…and now I need more things?”

“Of course. If managing your Personal PowerTM was easy, *everyone* would do it.”

Gwen’s soothing voice continued. “Today, we will focus not on the color of your PP—that’s for the intermediate seminar—but on what is impeding it. Like your skin, your PP is a boundary. It signifies where you end and the world begins. Not-so-great boundaries can pollute and compromise our personal ecosystems. So close your eyes and look closely at your Personal PowerTM. What do you see?”

Margot peered at a mix of dark spots and lines.

“Don’t be afraid of what is there.  Dark spots and lines are signs of past trauma or stagnant spiritual energy. gloop can help. To begin your journey, you will need to watch the next two hours of Spiritual Healing SolutionsTM videos to help you learn the basic tools of healing. This will include crystals, herbs, amulets, and much more.”

Slumping into her seat, Margot sighed. She glanced around at the other audience members who gazed transfixed at the giant screens. 

Gwen resumed the stage as the monitors faded to black. “Wasn’t that great? Now to get the most from your PPs, work with one of our gloop-certified Spiritual AdvisorsTM. They are located throughout the audience. Advisors, raise your hands.”

The woman next to Margot held hers up. 

“That’s it!” Margot seethed, storming out of the room as the packed audience cleared for her exit.
