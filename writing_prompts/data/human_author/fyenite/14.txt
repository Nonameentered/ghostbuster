#Long Long Ago

Part 1

***

On the front lines of the great war of Man, Humanity fought for its very survival. They sheltered in crumbling fortresses, fighting off the Lost as they stayed put and stewed in their own miseries.

On long silent nights, when the full moon shone so brightly, it cast a white glare over the night sky and left the stars invisible and no man’s land would grow stark and clear for miles, the men would sit around smoking campfires in their secure watchtowers and tell tales of legend.

Long long ago, the first man had turned off the path of righteousness and become Lost. No one remembered when it started, nor who the holder was. The tale was as old as time and retold more times than any man had a right to count, each time with a different hook. But who cared how the story went and Who cared if it was true or not? The point was it was a cheap scare on a night when the heavens lay bare with the radiance of the moon.

Long long ago, the first man had turned off the path of righteousness and become Lost. Dascastus was his name and that was all that was known about him. No one could say why or how he turned but they all could agree on his name and his home of Greece.

He wandered through alleys and streets on a moonless night, the darkness so condensed, one could not see their hand in front of their own face. Of course, that didn’t bother Dascastus much. He had lost his sight days ago and the darkness was only a mild familiarity now. In fact, he revelled in the thought that others were finally brought down to suffer the same sightless injustice as he had.

He wandered through the streets, clad in a dark threadbare cloak and a patchy hood shadowing his face. The voice in his mind yearned for a new host and he was forced to oblige.

Dascastus passed door after door, some of plain planked oak and others of stained beech. He tracked which houses he passed in his mind as his rhythmic steps on the cobblestones rattled in the silent night.

“Too dirty,” he muttered to himself, “Too small. Too diseased. Too old.” Every home he passed, his mind, still ripe with arrogance, came up with excuses to avoid. He still bore his sense of smell thankfully enough, and he almost gagged at the stench of one home before rushing on.

But finally, he came across the perfect door. Fine polished wood, smooth against his dead fingers. The mansion before him sprawled out before him in its magnificence.

“Now this is a dwelling fir for my station,” Dascastus murmured giddily as he pushed the great doors open with inhuman strength and sauntered into the dark building.

And that night, the city was filled with the laughter of an infected man and the screams of a newly damned.

And thus if you are comfortable and in need of nothing, hide away on moonless nights and fear the gentle tapping of cobblestones outside of your door.
