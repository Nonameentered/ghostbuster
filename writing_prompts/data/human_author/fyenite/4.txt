#Long Long Ago

Part 5

***

Tobias walked the desert alone, his hand resting on the fuse-like device in his pocket as he felt a wave of Amarulence wash over him. He would not be able to take the device with him, for it would do him and his goal no good. He’d need to find the root of that blinding evil and put a stop to it before it was even able to rise up.

Night had fallen when he finally decided to stop and rest. A campfire quickly blazed by his side with a spit and slab of meat roasting above. He drank deep from his cup of stars above him. Even now, so far in the past, he could recognise a few constellations. Or at least the predicted early versions of them. He leaned back, at peace with himself and all that he had done. A sweet song, one that his mother had sung to him every night, reached his lips and breathed the words out, feeling them mist in the cold air. He couldn’t remember the words per se, but the simple hum and tune were more than enough for him.

He had saved the man, Dascastus despite his main goal. After so many centuries of punching any and all who stood in his way, he had finally chosen to give mercy. Tobias felt for the fuse in his pocket again, his heart skipping a beat as his hands failed to navigate the clutter there. It was amazing how many books one could fit into a room, assuming one didn't want to move around very much. Too bad he wanted mobility too. He sighed, he’d need to sort through his collected possessions soon.

His thoughts wandered back to the arrogant man and he couldn’t help a smile forming on his face. He had shown mercy and resisted the urge to punish someone who would have genuinely deserved it. And in return, he’d learnt of a valuable tool to perhaps reverse the disease. The moral of the story, he mused to himself.

During his first days in the world of reversal, he’d been quite the whippersnapper: Inexperienced and rather obtuse. But as he visited older and stranger cultures, he’d learnt how to hide his rather strange affliction very well. He took part in traditions, prayed to the people’s gods and even didn’t laugh when they came up with one of their fantastical myths. Though cattywampus did certainly push his urge to laugh quite far.

Either way, his journey had been okay so far and it was rather close to ending too. With a sigh of relief, Tobias fished out the strange device that had saved Dascastus from the vile curse and buried it underneath a large and ancient boulder. It took hours but by the end, he breathed in the sandy air, a hint of the nearby salty sea on his nose, and smiled, before turning back to sleep.

His journey was almost over.
