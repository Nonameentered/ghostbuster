Hey Ry,

Just popping back to echo just how great this story was, haha. Loved the wholesomeness of a class of sea creatures all going on a field trip. All complete with one lonely kid that gets to take part too!

And of course, we can't forget about the Californian tourists, haha. Just brilliant.

As crit, I'd definitely point at the lobster not having a name. That was said in campfire before and you did mention that word count was an issue so I'll just mention it here and leave it there.

> Together they explored every exciting nook and cranny of the beach, delighting Freddie to no end.

Here, I think just some clarification would work. Was Freddie able to move around by rolling the jar or was he stuck in one place on the beach? This line suggests he was actually able to explore the beach but at the same time, I'm not sure what you were going for here. It makes more sense to me that the kids simply brought everything they found to show Freddie. I might be thinking a bit too much into it though.

Either way, hope this helps!
