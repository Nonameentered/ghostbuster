Hey Farm,

As said in campfire, the details and descriptions were great. I think you did a wonderful job of the back and forth with the way these two spoke and reacted to each other.

I also really liked the use of an actual event. It wasn't just some passive thing like saving humanity from something say but a bit of actual lore if that makes sense. It really pulled me in.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> Folded arms and v-shaped eyebrows encapsulated Lucifer’s expression.

Hmm, this almost felt like an exaggeration. "v-shaped eyebrows" was just a bit too much to take as seriously as you're going for I think.

> You can’t be serious? So much for omniscience. The Rapture is in five years!

Hmm, this line almost jumps around a bit. It's like Lucifer's rambling. The three sentences here don't really relate too well and either one could have been the starter if that makes sense.

> We shouldn’t hope everything goes smoothly. We need to ensure we play our roles and I do my part.

I feel like this could almost be a bit where you can have some repetition to make this sound better. Say, "We shouldn't *hope* everything goes smoothly. We should *know* everything goes smoothly." perhaps? The extra repetition could help here maybe.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
