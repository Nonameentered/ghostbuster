“We’ll be taking that, thank you very much,” Don sneered from the only exit out of the large circular room. He motioned as the rest of his cronies, four in total, waltzed past.

Jasper popped his head back out from under the seat and dove for his gun.

“Don’t!” Jessica screamed as she dove down to take cover.

The four cronies fired at Jasper’s exposed body and he grunted in pain. His own wild firing somehow hit one of the approaching teenagers and he went down with yelp too. Jessica heard more paint fly as Jerry the janitor took the remaining three unawares in quick succession.

“Oh heck,” he called in alarm. “Biggins’ got the automatic! How’d he take out the new janitor–?” Jerry’s question was cut off as the sound of multiple consecutive bangs and hundreds of whizzing paintballs permeated the air. Jessica gritted her teeth against the yelps of pain as Jerry dropped to the ground, vanquished.

The sound of footsteps broke the silence and Jessica looked around in alarm. Her eyes caught something under the chair and she realised that she was right beside seat 216. Scrambling now, she reached underneath the spot and yanked on the thing that Jasper had been reaching for mere moments earlier.

“You know, you should just give up. It’s only me and you now, and I have this,” Don cackled, letting loose another inferno of paint.

Just as he began to reload though, Jessica jumped up from beneath the seat and pulled the trigger of her new weapon. A giant boom rattled the glass as the paint canon fired, dousing Dons half of the room in bright blue.

Confetti rained down from above as people jumped up, cheering. Jessica stared in amazement just before she was tackled to the ground in a bear-hug as Carlise planted a kiss on her lips.
