#A Succulent Journey

Part 4

“Careful now,” Alpha mutters to the rest of the group as she approaches the door warily. It had taken an hour to reach this point and they still had a ways to go. But despite the group’s slow progress and Delta’s constant bickering about needing a break to eat a few chocolate squares, they still continued on.

Alpha signalled to her left, not tuning around and heard muffled footsteps as Beta charged the door in a flurry of black tactical gear. A second passed in silence before Gamma took up position and charged too. Even after a decade of missions, Alpha was still amazed at how stealthily the big man could enter a room at speed. He was a charger, meant to serve as a literal meat shield of sorts. And yet, why act as a living barrier when you can sneak up on the enemy instead?

A heartbeat passed before a low-pitched whistle permeated the air and the remainder of the crew entered the room. Two corpses lay strewn on the ground, one with a sharp bleeding cut to the temple and the other with half the head crushed into a mess of bone and grey matter. Alpha frowned at the latter and then turned to Gamma with his gore-dripping mace.

“You know,” she said nonchalantly. “We have sharper more effective weapons than a mace.” Gamma waved a dismissive hand, having had the argument dozens of times over the decade. 

“A break then?” Delta asked hopefully, bringing up the tail end of the march and ushering Vorn forward. “Splendid,” he exclaimed after surveying the room. With one fluid motion, he reached back and removed a small container from his backpack. Making a few rather disturbing hungry noises, he opened the container and removed the small squares from within. “Ah, Nanaimo bars. The best dessert imaginable. But oh man, too sweet!”

Alpha turned her attention back to the ‘cargo’ and eyed him as he wandered around the room, clearly searching for a comfortable place to sit. His feet brushed up against dust and dirt as he effortlessly walked through the room. He was so natural in fact, that you’d think he’d been walking like that his entire life. Arms by his sides, back facing his destination, he walked backwards to the far corner and sat down by the wall.

What was his mission, Alpha thought to herself as she too took a seat by the opposite wall and covertly watched the man? He had begun walking backwards a little ways into the building. Alpha got the impression that he was practising for something.

“Mmm, the crumble is just divine! And the contrast between the custard too! My god, where have these things been all my life?” Delta mumbles with a moth full. Alpha glares at him, disgust plastered all over her face but Delta just brings up his hands innocently. “Well, I’m sorry you can’t experience the glory of the Nanaimo bar too, Joyce. I know actually eating food for the taste rather than the utility is hard for you. I mean, it was fairly new to you before I came along, but you should try it sometime, trust me.”

Alpha flinched at her real name being used. The rest of the group however didn’t even react. They were pretty familiar with Delta’s shenanigans. His occasional habit of breaching protocol and using someone’s real name over their squad name didn’t even phase them at this point. Even Gamma, who had practically pummelled the poor sniper into the ground the first time he did it, now barely arched an eyebrow in response.

Alpha just sighed heavily. Deciding not to respond and take the bait, she turned back to her examination of the kneeling man, his eyes now closed and breathing shallow. Now that he was sitting still, his movements became a lot less strange. It wasn’t that he was awkward with them. No, he moved with the grace of someone who wasn’t walking in reverse. But it was more just the unnaturalness of it all. Like seeing an animal with backwards bending knees.

She eyed him for a little while, going over the little information she had been given about his top secret mission before sleep finally took her. She drifted off, face leaning on her arms and back against the wall as the steady groan of the building around them lulled her thoughts.

It was perhaps only a couple of hours later when the group arose again. They strapped on their gear in a determined silence and then finally took positions around the barricaded door.

“Right,” Alpha said, rinsing the sleep from her voice. “We need to get to the drop-off zone. In and Out. Understand?” Right then, a scream echoed through the building and everyone froze and looked up.
