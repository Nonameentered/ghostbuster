#Sacrificial Transportation

Part 1

The sun shone through open windows and glinted on the walls of the intricately decorated room. The light bounced and cascaded off of the gilded carvings of golds and silvers as it adorned the edges and corners of the room. The exotic metals lay in excess, shining their lights on the many marble murals that decorated the space.

Stanton stood in the centre of the space, admiring the pastel colours of one such mural depicting the fierce fight between a tribesman and a lion. The soft colours lay in stark contrast to the violence of the scene and Stanton felt his mind at war with itself as he thought about the beauty and brutality.

The ornamental door — just as gilded and reflective as the rest of the room — opened softly and a man, chubbier than Stanton and shorter entered with an uncharacteristically light step and sidled up to the brooding man. He waited a few moments before audibly clearing his throat and glanced at Stanton.

“Yes?” Stanton finally said, growing weary of the man’s presence. “You have something for me, Samuel?”

“Boss wants to see y’. Says it’s urgent. No time for you to dally around and admire the wallpaper.”

Stanton chuckled to himself, the absurdity of calling the magnificence mere ‘wallpaper’ was an absurdity he couldn’t fully process. The rich architecture before him, encapsulating as much history as it did beauty was once an art form; something resplendent. But now, with newer uncaring eyes laying siege to them, the sacred became secular, losing all meaning and merely becoming desecration.

Without a word, Stanton turned on his heel and marched out of the door, the chubby man startling at his quick motions and rushing to catch up.

The hallways depicted a similar beauty to the room behind them but Stanton paid them no mind. This part of France — the richest in both wealth and culture — depicted all forms of art. And this particular hotel specialised in Rococo architecture, the greatest clash of beauty and wealth.

Samuel rushed ahead of him and forced the great front doors open as he grunted heavily in strain. Within the world of the Global Emergency Response, GER, in short, worked with both Stanton and his boss and thus, was technically liable to punishment anytime Stanton was for missing a meeting.

“Come on, hurry up! We’re already late and you’re not even out the door yet.” Stanton didn’t reply, just continued to stride through the hallway at his usual brisk yet relaxed pace. Marble clicked beneath each step. The golden evening sun shone off of them each time he passed a window. It was a bright explosion before a return to darkness, so to speak.

On reaching the door, Samuel forced it open the rest of the way and practically pushed him out before rushing down the steps and then freezing in place. “Shit,” he muttered to himself as a chilly wind blew past them and ruffled his bowler hat.

Before the two stood Gorion Snise, their boss.

“I thought I told you time was of the essence, Sam. What took you so long? I had to come looking myself.” Samuel blubbered in response, his words failing him just like every other time Gorion spoke directly to him. Hell, it took the short man nearly a year before he could look Stanton in the eye whilst speaking.

“And Stanton! How many times have I told you to stay focused on the job at hand? We have a global crisis with this *Loss* going around and you’re here admiring a building?” he said, gesturing with his fine wood cane at the building behind them. “What is wrong with you?”

Stanton ignored that, his hobbies always seemed to perplex others, even if they made perfect sense to him. Instead, he decided to change the subject. “*Loss?*” he asked, his onyx eyes lighting up with curiosity. “Is that what they’ve decided to call them?”

“Yes, that has been named their official title.”

“Interesting.”

“Oh, it makes sense,” Samuel interjected, puffing out his chest to seem more intimidating. “And if you don’t approve, then what would you call them then?”

Stanton eyed the man and then narrowed his eyes. That got the reaction he wanted. He smiled to himself as Samuel shied away and looked down.

A black nondescript car pulled up in the courtyard of the fine gleaming building and Gorion gestured to it with his cane. “Get in,” he said as he walked over to it with far more vigour than you’d expect from a sixty-year-old man with a shot knee that never healed right.

Shrugging to himself and considering these new concerning developments, Stanton approached the vehicle with the smaller man in toe. And with one final mournful look back, they sped off.
