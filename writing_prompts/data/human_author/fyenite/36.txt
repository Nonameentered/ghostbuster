The luxury cruise liner exploded dramatically as the hull groaned ominously. Screams and shouts emanated from the wreckage as lifeboats dropped into the sea below. But with one tidal wave, the sails crunched and the ship disappeared.
  

  
Several miles away on a tropical island in the middle of nowhere, Brohime and Dudeus threw a frisbee between themselves and sashayed in the sand. Their lifeboat discarded on the beach and already halfway into the water and being pulled in ever more.
  

  
“Damn Brohime! You were right, this is fun.” Dudeus exclaimed.
  

  
“Right Dude. Isn’t it just the best?” Brohime spun and launched the frisbee hard and it arced around Dudeus and flew out over the water.
  

  
“Whoa Bro! Where can I learn to do that?”
  

  
“Heh, frisbee floppin’ fristravaganza, of course. All the best frisbee flappers compete. But hey, you’ll learn.”
  

  
“What the heck are you two doing?” Ricky yelled as he hauled a stack of logs forward and tackled them to the ground. “We’ve been marooned on this island for hours now and all you guys can do is flounder and frolic?”
  

  
“Chill Ricky. Eat an avocado or a wild watermelon.” Brohime flashed his perfect teeth.
  

  
“You know those things are poisonous.”
  

  
“They are?” Dudeus snapped, spitting out a mouth full of avocado.
  

  
“Don’t be ridicky, Ricky. Take a chill pill, brah.”
  

  
“Uhh, look. We’re stuck here on this island without any resources. This isn’t a good thing! It’s humid out and we need sunscreen or something. Or else a sunburn will be the least of our troubles.”
  

  
“Potato potahto. When life gives you limes, you make some scrumptious limeade and have a picnic.” And with that, Brohime took off his shirt in a makeshift swimsuit.
  

  
“Yeah, have some spontaneity in your life, Ricky.” Dudeus followed Brohime’s lead, intending to swim. “When life thwarts. Thwart harder. When life vexes. Vex more. When life screams! Be cacophonous!”
  

  
“That’s the dream brother. One heckin' haze of a dream. Just relax under the parasol of the universe. Preferably with cookiedough ice cream.”
  

  
“Amen Brohime.”
  

  
Ricky sighed into his hands, face red not only because of the sun. “Both of you… Your frustration is ubiquitous. God I’m flabbergasted you survived this long.”
  

  
“Takes a little more than an exploding ship to vanquish our totally tubular twosome. Stargaze? watch flowers bloom? sizzle in the sun? We can survive all painful and or boring tasks.” Dudeus shook his head.
  

  
“Duuuuuude! Check out those gnarly waves! Radical right?”
  

  
“Eccentric even. And fragrant with the freedom of the sea, Brohime.”
  

  
“Last one there dies of exposure!”
  

  
“You’re on, Bro.”
  

  
Ricky stood alone on the beach as the pair raced towards the rapidly disappearing wave, seemingly unaware they didn’t have surfboards to explore and ride. Ricky scratched his arm nervously. The need to vindicate his seriousness dying in the solitude. All that was left was a thirst for fun he couldn’t quench.
  

  
So he shook his head and followed with a log for a surfboard, ever the fastidious one.
