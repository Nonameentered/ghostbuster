Hey Hades,

I really liked this story. The tension is really well done here. You did an amazing job of keeping it strong and tense throughout the entire piece I think. Especially when we got to the part where they're running out of air. And I liked that end too! Pretty amusing all things considered.

> Seconds before blacking out, Johnathan finally breached the waterâ€™s surface.

As crit, I'd say this bit. It just sounded a tad odd. Like I was expecting him to black out seeing as you said that in a few seconds, he would. Maybe rewording this may help?

I hope this helps.

Good words!
