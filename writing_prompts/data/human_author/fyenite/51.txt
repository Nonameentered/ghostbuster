#A Succulent Journey

Part 5

The building shook and dirt and dust that had previously been caked onto the grimy roof came down in a dark cloud. Another roar and the ceiling began to crack. Alpha couldn’t see into the dark space above, but she sure could hear it.

“Run!” she shouted in her practised military voice as she wrenched open the door. Each member made their hasty exit out of the room and Alpha glared at Tobias as he charged towards the open doorway... backwards. Finally, Delta brought up the rear, his pickle-barrel of a stomach, now sufficiently filled with Nanaimo bars, made him puff with exertion as he cleared the frame. And right as Alpha charged through, the ceiling collapsed; Bits of cake rained down from above, like a shower of *delicious*, frosted confetti. Disgusting.

“Right, everyone okay?” Alpha asked the assembled crew as she breathed heavily.

“Looks to be,” Beta said, counting down the faces. “That was a close one though.”

“Yeah well, same can’t be said for my poor bird house,” Delta whined as he put on his tactical vest. “Man, I put months into that thing. Had to even learn decoupage for that. But alas, I knew something like this would happen. Just hoped my prognostication was wrong for once.”

“Welp," Gamma teased as he patted the smaller older man on the shoulder. “If you knew what was going to happen, probably shouldn’t have brought it along. But hey, dangerous things are paid for with poor choices. And you just paid to watch your work of art get crushed.” Delta glowered at the snickering man before skulking off away from the group.

“Right,” Alpha said after catching her breath. “Any ideas of where that sound emanated from?”

“Well, looks to be from above,” Beta said, examining the doorway and heavily dented door.

“Probably a Lost up there sensed us or something. We should get to the drop-off point as quickly as possible.” Gamma added.

“Agreed.”

The group made their way through the facility, making sure to keep an eye out for any forms of movement or signs of life. Whilst they were careful before, they had no idea any creatures actually resided within the facility itself so were somewhat lax at times. Now, that relaxed mood was gone, replaced by a sense of tension and urgency, not unlike the atmosphere during more routine missions.

They came across a room where more dust rained down from the shadowed ceiling above. They were more careful this time, making sure to keep quiet and unseen. Though theoretically, the creatures shouldn’t have been able to find them anyway; due to their missing sensory organs, they still somehow did and Alpha didn't want to take any risks in case their ability to find prey relied on more *traditional* methods.

As the dust rained down from above, it piled onto the ground, burying it inch-deep in some places.

“What was this place again?” Gamma whispered as he took care not to leave too many deep footprints. His shoes kicked away the pile beneath them and it washed away like a castle of sand.

“A wood factory, I believe,” Beta chimed in. “In the old world, I mean. This place probably hasn’t seen use in decades. Gamma frowned to himself as he kept up his careful steps. 

Alpha thought she knew what he was thinking. ‘Why would an old wood factory be chosen to house a person for who knows how long?’ With her mind still racing with questions and her eyes occasionally turning to Tobias and his strange backwards walk, she remained quiet and continued on.

It wasn’t long before the group reached their drop-off zone. They each froze in confusion as they spotted the centrepiece and then each turned to Tobias. The room was a small low-ceilinged narrow space with walls made up of exposed crumbling brick and rusting copper pipes. Tobias for his part, simply walked forward to the large pipe-like structure jutting out from against the far wall and heaved the lid off.

Alpha was about to ask what he was doing when a roar came from just behind them. And so, the group jumped into action, securing the area.

“At least five!” Beta yelled as the creatures came through. “We need to go, now!”

Alpha charged forward just as Tobias began crawling into the pipe's murky depths. “What are you doing? We need to go.”

“No,” Tobias said in an oddly strained voice. As if he were talking the wrong way somehow. “You need to go, I need to travel back and meet my — and everyone’s — past. And hopefully, save them all.” And with that, he ducked in and forced the lid shut behind him.

Alpha wavered, but then turned and charged after her team through the recently collapsed wall.
