#Containment Breach

Sirens blared all over the facility as the hallways were consumed by the red glow of emergency lights. Men and women in white coats and tight-fitting goggles scrambled through open doorways and sprinted down the already congested corridors. Above the siren, the rhythmic deep robotic tone of the communications service announced the emergency.

“Containment breach G! Please calmly evacuate all laboratories and dormitories and make your way to the evacuation point for extraction.”

The words were a forgotten echo as scientists and soldiers alike barrelled through the corridors in order to flee the escaped subject.

People rushed past Barry, sheets flew off of hastily grabbed stacks of paper and landed on the floor only to be trampled on by the next fleeing researcher. Barry watched as one man with a stack of research papers nearly as tall as he was slipped on a forgotten loose sheet and fell to the ground hard, his own pile coming down in great torrents around him. Rather than fretting over his life’s work, however, he merely glanced back then got up and charged ahead one more.

Barry found the whole situation quite curious. He fiddled with the cuffs of his own lab coat as he let the rushing mob push him forward. *Some of the smartest minds in the world and yet even they couldn't understand the basic benefits of an organised escape,* he thought to himself dryly.

Lights flickered above him as the red glow gave way to black darkness for a fraction of a second before turning back on. The lights continued to flicker however and right behind Barry, they started to switch off completely.

As time passed, the crowd that pushed Barry forward slowly thinned as they made it past him. The lights had completely stopped too and now, Barry walked completely in darkness.

Screams of sorrow from the destitute lost souls left in the darkness and pained moans from those trampled by the mob and left to die filled Barry’s ears and he stifled a shiver. Barry considered discarding his white coat as it made him easier to spot in the darkness when a chorus of voices spoke simultaneously from all around him.

“Hands up! On the ground!” the soldiers roared as they made their way out of the shadows and circled Barry.

“My, what’s going on here, officers?” They only continued to circle, a man with white hair and a weathered face stepped forward.

“It’s time to stop this, Garry.”

“Stop what?” Barry asked innocently.

“Stop escaping your containment pool, Garry.”

“Okay… My name’s Barry though.”

The old man placed his hand over his face and moaned in frustration. “No Garry, your name is Garry. And you're a mimicking slime. Garry, Like Breach G. Breach Garry.”

“Hmm, that all makes sense, except my name’s Barry. See, it even says on my name tag.”

“Yes, Barry's name tag? The guy who you shapeshifted into? Do I have to get the mop, Garry?”

“Nope, no mop. I’ll come quietly.”
