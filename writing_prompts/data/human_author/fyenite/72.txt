Hey Rest,

Heh, I really liked this. It's always amazing to see a poem and even better to see one done so well! I really liked the bounciness of this one and how it flowed really well. I think you have the syllable count down quite well too.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> Out on the misty waters

Hmm, this line felt a bit short for the stanza it was in. It tripped me up a bit. Though the syllables are good so not sure.

> Survived the old man’s passing
> And knew what had been calling

Just a pair that doesn't rhyme here.

> Of calming introspection
> The boy’s become the boatman

And another non-rhyming pair too.

Sorry, I'm bad at critiquing poetry. I imagine all the issues that I've just pointed out are lines you've already agonised about a whole heck. Still, I'll leave it here.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
