**Summer's lease hath all too short a date**! Ahem, sorry. That was awkward. But, after **a year without Summer** I'm ready. So **surfs up, bro**! Or bruh or brah! You know, whichever you prefer. The point is, we're heading down the ol' trusty road. **Take a vacation**, ever **effervescent and free**.

"We're hungry!" the twins cry. So, I tossed a bag of soggy cheez-its. The soggiest, of course.

"I **forgot my sunscreen**!" my daughter screams... But hey, we've made it outside at least, right?

**The Summer sun feels endless** on my pasty skin. The **mixtape** blares its cheerful glory. "**The summer sun was not meant for boys like me. Boys like me belonged to the rain.**” Huh, more dreary than cheerful... must be British.

We pass a **tiny shopping mall**, a **beach resort** and even a dangerously low-flying helicopter. Well, someone's clearly being sneaky, huh? Anyway, it's time for some relaxation: **sitting on the grass in the park with friends** or wandering a beach **filled with endless possibilities**. **The road stretches out before us** and a **Summer breeze** is in the air. We're ready to **soak up the sunshine**.

I notice billboard advertisements with plastered glossy words, swimming in the Summer mirage. “**A man says a lot of things in summer he doesn't mean in winter.**” are the accompanying words for a home-use lie detector device. And “**One benefit of Summer was that each day we had more light to read by.**” for a window installation company if you can believe it. And another one: “**Summer bachelors like summer breezes, are never as cool as they pretend to be.**” for who knows what. Perhaps that and the first are related?

Either way, **the island is ours. Here, in some way, we are young forever.** Except we aren't on an island and we aren't really free. Hmm, perhaps the heat's getting to me. it's **so hot you could cook an egg on it**... the Summer, I mean. Though, it is supposed to be **cool for the Summer**. Either way, who cares? We're **wearing sunglasses indoors** and then it'll be **time for some fun in the sun**!

"**You dropped it!**" one of the twins moans,

"**You're making a mess!**" my eldest yells.

'Stay cool as a cucumber' I think to myself. '**Toes in the sand** and a beautiful **hang ten** on a surfboard.' But alas, it does nothing... I need a beer. **It wasn't like that**! Just a slight buzz. So instead, I reach over and press play on my phone. Suddenly my car fills with the **sound of the ice cream truck** and the twins sit back in gleeful giggles.

And then the mixtape mellows out, and I begin to daydream. I'm transported back to a time in my teens: high as a kite and surfing on lucid dreams. I'm a piece of sentient asphalt now with my friends of old, just trying to get to Niagra falls. My, how **time flies when you're having fun**. **It was something unforgettable** and **we never wanted the day to end**.

I hear the rasping voice in my head. "**My old grandmother always used to say, Summer friends will melt away like summer snows, but winter friends are friends forever.**" And thus my fearsome asphalt friends begin to disappear from my side. **August rain: the best of the summer gone, and the new fall not yet born. The odd uneven time.** Or, saddened confused melancholy, perhaps?

And thus I awake and find myself alone, weeping and shaking for the imagined lost friendships. "**I know I am but summer to your heart, and not the full four seasons of the year.**" is the last whisper I heard in my mind. Yet, **what good is the warmth of summer, without the cold of winter to give it sweetness**?

No idea. But you can imagine how I, of course, decide to never do shrooms again.

"**Are we there yet?**" My twins whine in unison. And soon enough, my daughter takes up the chorus. My hands shake on the wheel and my mind screams for peace.

"Quiet!" I demanded in a tired voice.
I'm three hours in with no patience to spare.
So you have to believe me, I have no choice.
Or maybe I begin to lose the will to care

"Right. One more peep out of any one of you and I'll turn this car right around. You hear me? I'll even drive backwards if I have to."

And thus, all is right and quiet again.
