Hey Hades,

Well now, this was wonderfully tense. I really liked the idea of the constant rains, floods and lightning. It was a really nice touch to add to the overall mood of the story. I also quite liked the systematic nature you took to describing how the members died.

You have some great descriptions here, and a fair bit of that dialogue at the end was great too.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> a single metallic bite that always found its mark.

So with a name like "the copper sharks" as well as the floods and rains and such, this line confused me a bit. Do you mean a literal bite from metal jaws or are you perhaps talking about a bullet from a gun?

> “To claim my birthright.”

So this particular use of the word doesn't really fit here. Perhaps "vengeance" may work better here? I say this because I thought that maybe Nobody wanted to take the copper sharks as his own gang at first until I read the last line.

One final thing, the use of flooding and lightning here makes me wonder if Nobody has some sort of magical ability. It just seemed too perfect that a storm would hit so hard right as he started his attacks. If he does, then I'd suggest leaning into it. If not, then maybe pulling away some? The lightning destroying their defences was especially hard to right off as a coincidence.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
