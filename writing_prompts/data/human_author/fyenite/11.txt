#Long Long Ago

***

In the right situation, we are all capable of the most terrible crimes.

That’s what the man showed Dascastus first. Even before speaking to him, he had the sense that this man—Tobias—had done some truly terrible things. He had killed and stolen and fought on no matter the suffering it caused. And yet, he did it for a cause. His first words to Dascastus weren’t heard, for how could the senseless man hear? Even so, he felt them.

‘Just as I see through myself, I saw through you too.’ Dascastus sensed it almost as a threat. Like the strange man from another time was insulting his very being, his way of life… his god.

‘That’s it,’ Dascastus thought, ‘these are words against the monster in the sky, not me. I may be an arrogant sinful fool but I’m certainly not that thing.’ Even so, he felt uneasy around this man who had seen more eras than should have been possible. He felt as if this time; his sacred hell of punishment, was being breached. Invaded by a being that wasn’t supposed to be there. And yet, Dascastus felt at peace., so he simply accepted the shock and the knock to his understanding of time.

The man beckoned him to follow, Dascastus didn’t know how he knew but it didn’t matter much to him. He followed willingly and they walked for a time.
Dascastus looked up to what he believed was the sky and saw a caliginous form clouding the darkness. Again, Dascastus had no idea how he knew the thing was there but he did, and it made him shiver regardless of his inability to feel cold.

For some reason, around the man Dascastus felt things lighten a bit, his senses were just as dead as ever but he still felt like the darkness thinned slightly. As if his afflictions were being cured somehow. Dascastus continued on his walk beside the man, growing calmer and happier at the intruder invading his land.

Besides him though, Dascastus sensed the man’s awkward gait, as if he were walking unnaturally. It seemed as if this man—Tobias—had learnt all the steps of walking like a normal person, but simply reversed the ordering of the steps and made do. It was strange.

Dascastus continued to marvel at the man’s strange steps as he followed his lead. The more his thoughts cleared, the more his curiosity awoke and the more he wanted to know who this man really was.
