Hey Arch,

... Wait, Arch? Like, the Arch? The Arch, otherwise known as ArchipelagoMind? Whoa! We've got some Arch words. No wait, an Arch poem! Woo!

As for the poem, it was great! At first, it was a bit hard to read as I couldn't really get a rhythm going but once I hit that second part, it all became clear, heh. At least I assume that the odd rhyming schemes were intentional as it mirrored the actual meaning and message of the poem.

As for the more organised bit later on, that was awesome. I didn't count all of the lines but the couple I did had their syllable count being equal so great job.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> But as I much as I battle

There looks to be a rogue "I" here. A typo I assume.

> When movement was hampered by thistle and snow. And Iâ€™ve been here before, I know it revolves,

So here, I think reddit screwed up the formatting. Although, there have been times recently where the formatting messes up for some people and doesn't for others. But here, I think there should be a new line in the middle when there isn't if that makes sense.

One final thing, I'd perhaps suggest screwing around with the rhythm and line lengths for the top portion a bit more. Really lean into that lopsided structure like you do in the actual words.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
