Dr. Liv was so mesmerised by how the creature in her hand pulsed and quivered that she hadn't noticed it secreting a clear liquid. Or, she hadn't noticed until it started burning her hand.

"Ouch!"

With a yelp of pain tinged with surprise, she acted on instinct and flung the attacker to splat on the wall.

Silence followed as Liv processed what she had just done. Two years and countless research grants all to produce a splatter on the wall. The pain in her hand took a backseat in her mind as she panicked over the compulsive mistake she had just made.

So much so in fact that she didn't notice the figure standing in the corner staring at the mess as well until it spoke. "Now that was a bit mean, don't you think?"

LIv spun around like a freshly oiled swivel chair and stared at the figure. She took a second to process the shape. It looked vaguely human, like a poorly prepared mould of one.

"Who– What are you?"

"Darn," the thing sighed, "and here I thought I nailed the shape. That obvious, huh?"

Dr. Liv didn't respond, though she did pinch her arm just to make sure she wasn't dreaming. The figure cocked an uneven eyebrow at the movement.

"My apologies, this must be quite surprising for you." He paused for a brief moment, making sure that Liv was in fact sticking with her shock of silence. "Look, the truth is I– we need your help."

"We?" Dr. Liv finally croaked.

"Yes, we. My species."

Liv glanced around the room. Besides the figure, there wasn't any slime left in the lab. "What species?" she forced out, turning back to him.

"You're looking at it. Well, besides poor affergsdergergs, of course," he said, glancing at the wall.
