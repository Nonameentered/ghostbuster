Lol, thank you, Kat! I'm a bit amazed I got it all in, lol. Huh, that is super interesting. I'll be honest, I wrote this from start to end. So everything left was kind of forced into that ending, (a lot of the leftover sentences). So it's amusing to see that the start was a possible odd point over the end.

I'll see what I can do, heh.

Thank you again, Kat! Glad you liked my mishmash.
