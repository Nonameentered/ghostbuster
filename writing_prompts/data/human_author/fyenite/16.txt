I was able to complete all my tasks last month. Woo!

> Finally write that dang Romance.

Check.

Well, it's rough and in need of some major edits but Word-Off really gave me the chance to get a lot of rough writing in and I finally got this Romance done! Though, it's hard to look at, haha.

> Take it easy on the sprinting.

Check.

Well, this was a yes and no. Again, Word-Off meant I didn't take it too easy but compared to the last one, this was basically a walk, haha.

I was able to get the first three chapters written and fully edited, woo! My only issue is that my previous idea for the story is morphing a little and now I've realised I may need to rewrite them again. So, I'll count it as done but this project may bleed into NaNo which will be fun.

> Take one of your self-set tasks for this month and turn up the hardness by 50%

Check.

As per the task above, both are done. The original with an extra 50%.

> Write a story involving a mythical creature.

Check.

And done, courtesy of Word-Off.

This month I will,

> Write a western story

Panic!

> Share with a friend/friends a novel idea and get feedback on it

Now this will be fun and probably where my previous project comes into play.

> Do some planning for my NaNo project

These two tasks will be linked for me. I think I'll take a look at those three chapters already written and try and come out with a strategy to not fall into the same holes as before.

> Finally get back into prompts/short stories. I've been slacking on that front and NaNo may make this even harder so I want to get this done this month. Let's say 6 prompts or short stories over on the other sub? A little less for the month but I want to wade into it slowly.
