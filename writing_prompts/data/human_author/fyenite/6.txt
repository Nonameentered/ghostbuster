#Long Long Ago

Part 4

Dascastus followed patiently. Sometimes he would jargogle his steps and stumble and it took every shred of his focus just to be able to navigate the rough stone-strewn ground. He couldn’t see, hear or feel the earth beneath him, but he persisted nonetheless. ‘We all go a little mad sometimes,’ he thought to himself. ‘And I’m only going madder.’

A light in his mind suddenly made him pause, however. A bright shade of crimson took over the darkness inside him in bright floral designs. He sensed the man pause beside him too, his eyes locked onto him as he studied Dascastus.

“Your truths are worse than your lies,’ he said. Again, Dascastus had no idea why he could suddenly hear the man’s words and yet he didn’t care. Despite the beauty of hearing sound again, even if it was in the form of a deep raspy tone, nothing could distract him from the sheer beauty of colour.

He would have fallen over if he could dare move, tripped over his own feet. And then he noticed the earth beneath him had a texture. The soil was rough and coarse on the soles of his feet and loose jagged stones pressed against his rough toes. He savoured those feelings, allowing them to wash over him and overpower his mind.

In time, Dascastus regained all of his senses once more, and it took twice as long for him to rise from the dull trance he had fallen in love with. He looked to the sky and felt his breath taken again. No darkness. No wriggling blackness. No obsidian beast in the sky congealing and pulsing in its gargantuan mass.

Just endless blue skies, puffy white clouds and a great ball of golden flame. He sighed and basked in the golden rays.

“So you can see now?” the man said in a quiet voice.

Dascastus started at the sudden intrusion of sound and whirled around to meet the steady gaze of the man. He was tall and thin. His face was clean-shaven and sandy hair stood on his head. But it was the man’s eyes that gave Dascastus pause. Great depthless pits of amber that still somehow pierced his very soul.

“Wha- who are you?”

“So you can hear too?” His gaze fell to his palm, studying an oddly glowing object in it. He turned it over and ran his index finger across the surface. The object shone too brightly for Dascastus to be able to tell what it looked like or even be able to come up with a vague shape.

“Yes. Yes, I can see and hear,” he paused and ran a hand over his shirt, scraping up loose grains of sand and then placed one finger on his tongue. He immediately recoiled from the sudden taste of salt overpowering his new senses. “And feel and taste and smell.”

“Good.” And the man began to stride off, heading back forward.

“But, how?” The man didn’t respond but simply just kept on walking. Dascastus thought he should follow. But the voice in his head, the one that had first told him to follow this man, was now silent. So Dascastus turned back to the city, already enamoured by the beauty of the land and excited to see his home again for the first time in far too long.
