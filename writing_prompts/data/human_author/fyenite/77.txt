Hey Joxy,

I'm always so blown away by the amazing stories the new people break into TT with. Not being too old myself, I remember the sheer amount of anxiety I had when pressing that post button. So I just wanted to start out by congratulating you on this checking amazing story. So many feels. Just so many feels.]

I really liked how you weaved in the senses in this story. You do it really naturally which is always great to see and have it as a major part of your story.

> alone on the pier, alone in my bed, alone in my thoughts.

This was a great triple to end on. There were a couple of instances above where I was just waiting for you to drop the third repetition but you never did and I think those could use it but here, you had a really nice line.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> The sun's warmth rests on my back, slowly draining with each minute. My hands rest on the scratchy wood of the fishing pole, quietly waiting to feel the tug of a fish.

Just a bit of repetition of "rest(s)" here. Now, twice wouldn't be anything bad but when in both instances, the word is the sole verb, it becomes a bit obvious.

> Days come in and go out,

I really think you could drop the "in" and "out" here. "Days come and go," works quite well on its own.

> never good or bad news from someplace, never a new story from some passerby, never a whisper from some lover.

Another really nice triple here. I think replacing the commas with full stops would make it hit a bit harder though. That might be my own preference though. I also think you use commas in place of full stops in a few other places too. So just something to look out for.

> It's my life, and I chose this lie. So why does it hurt so much?

Hmm, a bit of a contradiction on this final line. If our main character admits to it being a "lie", then why are they surprised that it hurts so much? Seems like they've accepted the reality in the first bit, but then go straight back to denial in the last bit. Perhaps "lie" should be "life"?

I'll also agree with what seven said below about the in-the-moment stuff. You could use a bit of that too.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
