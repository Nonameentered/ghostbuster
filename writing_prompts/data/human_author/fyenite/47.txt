Hey lion,

Oh wow, a genre mashup with a poem. Really well done. I really liked the varied sentence lengths here. You did a great job transitioning from the long descriptive lines to the short stanzas of three lines each. as Tom said, I think you captured so much within those super poetic lines too! Really well done.

The only critique I'd say is I'd ask for a bit more structure. Especially those last ones. I'd perhaps ask for some rhyming to really make the lines flow better. Though I'm not too sure.

Good words!
