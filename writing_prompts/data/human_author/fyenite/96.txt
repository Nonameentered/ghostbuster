#Paintballer

Jasper, Carlise and Jessica all sat huddled together, behind the red sofa in the staff room. They remained as still as a group of 7th graders could be, their weapons raised by their sides, ready to attack any adventurous foes.

“You think they’ve gone?” Carlise whispered to no one in particular. His own hand shook, covered in the residual paint of vanquishing so many players.

“No clue, but I’m sure they wouldn’t just let us go after what we did,” Jasper replied, his leg shaking much like Carlise’s arm.

“Quiet,” Jessica cut in, waving a steady hand at her brother. “Just listen, if they’re waiting for us, we should be able to hear them.”

The small group of scrawny teenagers listened intently, Carlise leaning his head against the sticky red material, his eyes focused. “I don’t hear anything,” he finally whispered. “I’m going to peek.”

“What, no!” the two siblings said in unison, just a second too late.

Carlise stuck his head just a few centimetres above the sofa and looked around. “All looks clear, guy–”

“There they are. Get him!” Someone shouted from the far side of the room. The siblings cursed simultaneously as they stood up to fire paintballs at the coming enemies. 

Jasper hit a kid in the shoulder, who went down with a groan and Jessica hit one square in the face. Carlise sat behind the sofa, firing at exposed legs and feet but even with the trio’s combined effort,  too many enemies advanced to take down.

Paintballs fired all around the siblings and they were forced to take cover. Carlise jumped back with a yelp too and leaned against the sofa breathing heavily. They were finished.

The gang of kids approached, laying down a healthy amount of suppressing fire. They laughed and taunted the three as they pelted the sofa with green paint. Over the sound of splattering and kids laughing Carlise could hear Don taunting, the school bully, above them all. He whooped and cheered as they approached. Carlise would have rolled to the side and shot him point-blank in the forehead had he not been so exhausted.

Suddenly, a door slammed open and the sounds of paint flying and kids running in panic replaced the earlier sounds. Blue paint splattered against the wall behind the sofa. The trio looked at each other and then jumped up and ran towards the door.

“Don’t shoot! It’s us!” Jessica shouted by way of greeting. They were accosted by a flurry of green paint as they reached the open door and slammed it shut right before the apex of the wave hit.

“Howdy there kids. Been busy, I see.”

“Yeah,” Jasper said, breathing heavily. Bent double, his hands braced on his knees. He looked up at the friendly weathered face of Jerry, the school janitor. He smiled warmly, a long-barrelled rifle-like paintball gun held against his shoulder. “Oh thank god, I thought they got you.”

“ Heh, takes a bit more than a pint o’ paint to take the ol’ janitor out, sonny.” Jasper smiled and nodded in response.

“So then that means…” Jessica stared hopefully.

“Means I got what we were lookin’ for. But man, was that new janitor a bruiser. Had this huge automatic paint planter. managed to push him back though. Just wish I had gotten the vanquish.”

“Err, guys–?” Carlise said quietly.

“That’s great! What colour was he?” Jasper prompted.

“All that can wait,” Jessica said firmly, ever the sensible one. We need to go before those guys get through the door.”

“Good call, sis.” And the three started their walk down the hall, not having noticed that Carlise was rooted to the spot.

“Guys?” he called more adamantly.

“Carlise, what’s up?”

“Come on, we need to get going.”

“Yep, sorry kid, but ain’t no time for chitchat.”

Carlise just turned his back in response, showing the blue protective plastic he wore there and the new giant splatter of green paint.

“Oh heck!” Jasper breathed. They all rushed over to examine the paint.

“This could have just been some residue from the floor or something. You're not out!” Jessica pleaded as if trying to believe her own words.

“Nah, I felt the hit and heard Don laugh, just wasn’t able to check until we got out.”

“Aw hell,” the janitor chimed in.

“Yep, it’s fine though. Just promise me something. Promise me you’ll get him.”

“But–“

“Promise me, jess. I wanted to get Don myself after everything he did, but... promise me vengeance, please.

Jessica looked into his eyes, focused and determined. Neither of them cried, despite the pain a speeding paintball could inflict. Jasper squirmed beside them, impatient and frequently glancing at the door.

“I promise.”

“Good. I’ll see you all in the cafeteria once you win this thing.”

“Yep, make sure to save us each some blue jelly!”

“Sorry to cut this mournin’ party short, but I think Jasper’s got the right of it. We need to get goin’, and now.”

Jessica looked at the door for a second, before turning back to Carlise and nodding. “Right, let’s go. The girls’ bathroom should be safe I think. I’ve heard it’s been clear for most of the day.”

“Wait… maybe someplace else?” Jasper piped up, his face taking on a deep shade of red.

“Nonsense sonny, plenty o’ cover in there too, in case things get sticky.”

“Fine…” Jasper muttered, shooting Carlise one final look before hurrying down the hallway after the pair.

“Coast clear?”

“Yup. Coast’s certainly clear to these old eyes.”

“Right then. What–“

“Whoa! You guys get a vending machine in here?” Jasper asked, amazed. “And why is everything so... gold?”

“That’s not your standard vending machine, Jasp, now get over here and quit interrupting me,” Jessica scowled at her brother before turning back to the janitor. “So, what exactly happened and what did you get?”

“Well,” the grizzled old man began. “Not too excitin’ a story. Or, nothin’ compared to what you kids went through. But still, I went to the maths class as you suggested and there it was, right there on Mr. Freddy’s desk.” He punctuated the sentence by slamming down a book against the damp sink.

“A journal?” Jasper asked as Jessica examined the old book.

“Yes,” Jessica answered for him. “Though all the pages are empty… except this one.”

“Well quit keeping us in suspense, what does it say?”

‘Where plants once stayed to grow and thrive

but now is used to look longingly outside.

Where people of old stood to ponder the land

Walls and ceiling made of invisible sand’

“Huh… What do you think that means?”

“No clue there kiddo. These eyes may be as sharp as ever but this damned mind has long since departed.”

“Well, let’s break this down. What does invisible sand mean?” Jessica asked.

The siblings looked about as they thought, the janitor just humming an old melody to himself. Jasper’s eyes fell onto the vending machine once more and he considered the weirdly packaged candy inside. ‘Strange,’ he thought. ‘Weird labels for chocolate bars. And who puts one in a bathroom as well?’ His eyes caught the glare of the fluorescent lights on the glass and he paused. “Glass!”

“What?” the other two asked in unison.

“Invisible sand is glass.”

“Huh, so old plants in a room of glass…”

“Well now, the planetarium was a conservatory once. Yep, converted some two decades back.”

The two siblings looked up at the janitor sharply, smiles plastered on their faces.

“Gosh darn, it's dark. Can we turn on the lights or something?” Jasper whined.

“Yessiree, it is. These sharp eyes aren’t too great in the dark it seems.”

“This is the best we have. The glass is transparent, so budget cuts meant no lights in the planetarium.” Jessica answered absentmindedly. “Just keep looking, it has to be here somewhere.”

“Have you seen this place, sis? It’s massive! And we don’t even know what we’re looking for.”

“Yeah, but they can’t have it just anywhere. The journal was on the desk…”

“We’ve checked the planetarium desk… twice. We’ve looked everywhere. All that’s left is to go through with a literal magnifying glass. Are you sure it’s here?”

“Has to be…” she paused as she looked at the number on one of the audience seats. “Hey wait, you have the journal, right?” Jasper answered by waving the old slightly sodden book in the air. “What page is it on?”

“What?”

“All the other pages are empty,” Jessica clarified. “What page is the clue on?”

“Ermm, page 216. Why?”

“Look for seat 216!”

Over the next five minutes, the three scrambled about the room, searching for the seat. Jasper almost tripped down the stairs twice but finally, on his last fall, he landed right next to the sought-after chair.

“Found it!”

“Great. See if there’s anything near it,” Jessica said excitedly as she approached.

“Ermm, there looks to be something underne–”
