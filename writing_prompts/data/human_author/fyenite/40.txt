Ooh, that is awesome, rainbow! I'm so happy that you hit all your tasks last month. I know things have been busy for you for the last little while so super proud of you! Good words!

And ooh, some really fun tasks here. A PM and 37.5k words? Wow, you're going for a whole three-quarter NaNo! But I know you'll smash them just like last month.

Good luck and Good words!
