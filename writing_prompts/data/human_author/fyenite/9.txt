Tracy Sherad sprinted through the darkness, darting between trees as branches whipped at her face and nettles stung her exposed legs. A cold sweat ran down her back as she leapt over a rotting log in a clearing. She misjudged the distance however and landed in a patch of mud that sent her careening to the ground.

She shuddered in the bitter midnight chill, rose to her feet and then came crashing back down as her ankle collapsed beneath her weight. She shrieked before clamping a hand over her mouth.

No sound permeated the darkness and Tracy sighed in relief until she saw the figure in the tree line.

“No,” she begged. “Please no!” She continued to plead even as the battered rusty shovel came down. The figure raised the weapon, caressing the thirty-three deep notches carved into its side as he admired his work.

The sun was high in the sky and bathed the misty morning with its golden light. Pines stood crowding around the old cemetery, kept at bay by the logger’s axe. The crisp grass glinted like crystals with the morning dew.

Colin stood near the front of the crowd surrounding a fresh grave, wearing dirty overalls and idly watching the mourners in black around him.

“We stand today to say goodbye…” the elderly Priest Edwards was saying, his voice worn and scratchy in the morning chill. But Colin wasn’t paying attention. Instead, he focused on the bowed middle-aged woman beside him.

Clad in onyx black, Katelyn Sherad sobbed silently, her body shaking with the effort. He eyed her, fists clenching reflexively. Eventually, the grieving mother noticed his stare and hurriedly dabbed at her eyes, colour rising to her pale cheeks but sorrow still swimming in her emerald eyes.

“Please forgive my outburst, it’s just…difficult,” she croaked.

“A mother must be allowed to grieve her own child,” Colin replied with a knowing smile.

“I know but… We thought she was happy with us.” She trailed off as more tears welled up in her eyes.

“I understand.”

Now another person clad in black stood by the open grave; a young woman—beautiful in her grief. “When my sister ran away that morning three long months ago, it broke me. And when the police returned her body five nights ago, it broke me again. ‘Mauled by a bear,’ they had said. ‘Then left in a forest to die all alone…” Her voice cracked and Colin lost interest.

“How did you know her, my daughter?” Katelyn piped up.

“We spent just one fleeting intimate night together. And after that, I knew I just had to find her again.” He smiled, letting some genuine sadness show on his face. Katelyn nodded appreciatively.

When it came time Colin gazed upon that lifeless face once more, a lone tear in his eye. He hefted his battered rusty shovel—thirty-four deep notches cut in its side—and helped the other diggers scoop up the dirt. He glanced up as Katelyn broke down into tears and grinned.
