Hey Pink,

This was a really nice story. I think you did a great job of showing the emotion here and I quite liked the dynamic between all the characters you had going here.

I also have to praise you for how well you managed to convert the senses. Really well done.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

One, you repeat names quite a bit. I think you could cut some of those times.

Second, the verbs with the dialogue tags were a bit repetitive. You have a fair bit of "asked" and such.

Finally, I think a bit of varied sentence structure could also help here. It was just a few bits I noticed but they could also be just my preference.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
