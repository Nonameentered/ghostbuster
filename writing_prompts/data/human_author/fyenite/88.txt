Hey Tens,

I'm always in awe of these super short yet still super powerful pieces that people can write. This one especially, so visceral and strong in its own way. The details about skin hitting tile and how the entire room was straight white.

I really liked how you had the silver door stand out so much in the room. It was a perfect way to transition from our character simply describing the room to actually trying the door.

Very well done.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

Now, these will be very nitpicky because as usual, you've got an incredibly hard-to-critique story here.

> A switch on the wall spills soft white light

Hmm, like a light switch spills light? Or do you have something else that can be called a "switch" in mind that gives off light? I'm not too sure. Perhaps you meant a bulb or something? Or perhaps I'm making a mistake here. No clue.

> I lift my hand and place it on the handle. It’s warm. I grasp it and breathe, once, twice, three times. But I can’t.

So here, the "I breathe" followed by the numbers suggests that the character breathes that many times. Now, I imagine that you actually meant it as him trying to open the door once, twice, three times. Maybe replacing "breathed" with "pulled" may help there or adding it on? 

> My feet slap tile, slow at first, then faster.

Hmm, so later on, you replace an action with a sound. "The bed creaks" means that he's sat down on it. This works because you've established that the bed creaks when he moves at the start.

So I wonder if you could do the same here. You could do away with the "My feet" part maybe? Just a thought I had.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
