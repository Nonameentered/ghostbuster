Hey Ry,

Hehe, this was a sweet and wholesome story. As always, the characterisation was on point. From the stubborn young princess to the wise old dragon, just very well done in general.

And I also liked how you ended the story too. A nice amusing resolution of sorts to the whole thing.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> “Not until I hook a fish! I’m close, Marran. I can feel it!

Okay so before this, Marran insists that the fish had gotten very close and that she'll be sure to catch a fish soon. But then he suggests that they stop for the day at which point, she replies with the above line. Just felt a bit odd that she'd jump to the notion of "I'm close, Marran. I can feel it!" when she'd just asked for his sight before. I hope I'm making sense here but it caught me a bit.

> Tiredness gnawed at Marran.

So here, we have a perspective shift. We go from Penelope's perspective and mind to Marran's. And you do this a bit later too, where the perspective isn't really too clear near the end. Ermm, I'm not too sure how you'd fix this as both perspectives give key insights and information so perhaps clearing it up a bit? Here, the perspective shift is clear and it's rather easy to adapt to it, but later on, things get muddled. So maybe clearing those up a bit may help?

> The fish on her hook was warm. Too hot for her to hold onto, in fact.

Although repetition is something I'd usually point out to change, I'd go the other way here. The second sentence is almost a continuation of the first, like an escalation of it. So I'd say changing "hot" to "warm" may help here. I think that repetition helps to link those two sentences a bit better.

> “Very well then,” Penelope giggled, scratching behind Marann’s ear. “Your mistruths are pardoned by royal decree.

So here, I thought we were still in the phase where Penelope was scolding Marann for his "help". But then that broke a bit with the "Penelope giggled,". I guess my issue here is that the whole thing ended a bit abruptly. Like Penelope just lost her anger and frustration in an instant.

Also, I believe it should be "Marran's", not "Marann's"? Not sure how you prefer to spell the name.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
