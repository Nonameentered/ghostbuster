I was able to complete all of my tasks last month.

> Review the past 12 months of your writing.

I reviewed the past 12 months. Or at least since I had started writing. That was under last month's Tasks.

> Choose something out of your comfort zone and be okay that you will fail at it.

I had a bit of fun with this one. Initially, I thought it would be Romance I would go for (though that wasn't my only option) and lo and behold but a super fun Summer Fun TT came up and I decided to do a genre mashup of Crime and Fairytale. Not sure how I did on that one but I will say it needed a fair bit of improvement. But again, super fun to write.

> Write a second draft

Check. It was a fair bit harder than I originally thought actually. I think a mixture of "Why do I have to rewrite this whole paragraph when I could just edit a few words?" But I do see the appeal of it now. Longer pieces I think. Longer pieces are where Second drafts shine.

> Write two horror stories

And check. These were a blast to write and actually gave me ideas for a possible longer-form project which is neat. So let's see where that takes me, heh.

This month, I will:

> Write a story involving a mythical creature.

Ooh, now that's fun. So many possibilities.

> Take it easy on the sprinting.

I've been, well, diving deep into the whole "write as much as you can" pit as of late and I want to try and find my way out. The usual issue I come to is by the end of it, I have a mountain of editing to do and no desire to do it. So, projects kind of fall off and stay there.

So this month, I will try and take my previous experience with a single second draft and try to develop on that. Write more second drafts as I go and balance new words with old words. Hopefully, this can actually lead me through to completion. As for an actual goal, I have a project in mind that's vaguely horror based and I really want to make a start. So let's say, three chapters written and ready to post by the end of the month? Sounds good to me.


> Finally write that dang Romance.

I'll be honest, I was hoping to write a Romance last month. And though I completed my task a different way, I was still kicking myself for not finding the time to actually start it.

So for this month, I'll finally do it! Or at least sustain an element of Romance in an already ongoing project. Hmm, maybe my new one? Here's hoping.

> Take one of your self-set tasks for this month and turn up the hardness by 50%

Oh dang! Hmm, well, I already picked the Romance that I wanted to do as a self-assigned task, so I'll assume I can't pick that again. Hmm, not much else to choose from.

OKay, a 50% increase in difficulty it is. Hmm, I don't want to task myself to write more chapters/instalments this month because I feel like that takes away from the whole goal of being slow and methodical...

Okay, how about I introduce a soft word count threshold? I was just saying that second drafts work better with longer works, wasn't I? So my unspoken goal would have probably been around 1,000 words per part. So let's increase that, shall we?

Three instalments of 1,500 words each, and all polished, edited and given a second draft. Phew, I'm exhausted just thinking about it, heh.

Anyway, those are my goals. Fingers crossed I hit them.
