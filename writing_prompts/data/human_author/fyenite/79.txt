#A Succulent Journey

Part 3

Days had passed in the forest of grass as the group slowly made their way through the dense blades. Showers of rain fell in flashes coating the sea of green with a thick transparent dew that both refreshed Beta and Gamma and frustrated the ever-loving heck out of Delta.

“Damn fing,” he groaned as his carton of milk tore and spilt all over the muddy earth. “Fudge!” Alpha didn’t bother asking why he decided to bring cartons of milk on an expedition where the temperature could darn well hit near 45 degrees and the humidity well beyond 100%. And nor did she complain when she looked back and noticed a fine trail of colourful powdered spices leading back for miles. You had to get used to the quirks of a man like Delta. He was just too good a soldier to pass up.

Alpha turned away from him as he dropped a plate of oddly fragrant rice on the floor and cursed rather aggressively. “My Nasi Uduk!” He turned to the offending blade of grass that he’d tripped over and pointed an accusatory finger at it whilst growling quickly in french. Alpha didn’t see the point as usual. Looking around, she noticed that the grass had reached all the way up to their chests. And a few reedy translucent stokes even reached their heads. And standing on her tiptoes, she saw that it was everywhere.

Thankfully though, as she looked at the horizon, she spotted a large dark shadow growing. With straight lines and blocky portions, the brutalist structure grew ever more brutal and utilitarian the closer they got. And that was their final destination.

Another half day had passed as they slowly approached the structure. Night had fallen and passed quickly and in that moment when the sun started to rise and the creatures around them began to lay to rest after a night of prowling, Alpha felt a chill as she glanced back at the structure that towered over them. The lack of curved beauty left the whole thing unnatural. The solid grey colours and sheer size made her feel strangely intimidated like the structure was threatening her on some personal level.

Beta and even Gamma each spent their own private moments marvelling at the structure ahead of them as they laid out their cook fires and began to open a few cans of preserved food. Delta however only remained concerned with the egg in his hand and the spoon he tried to crack it with. “There are many options you see,” he said to no one in particular. “Cracking an egg seems like a simple task but trust me, there are right ways of doing it and then there are wrong ways of doing–“

The egg bounced out of his hand a fell into the underbrush, splattering a bit of mud as it sunk into the earth. Alpha suppressed a laugh and turned to prepare her own meal as Delta sidled over to Gamma to beg for some possible spare food.

The structure creaked as they walked through it, concrete crumbled and cracked on the walls and ceiling but otherwise, the structure looked to have survived the century it had been lost to the wild quite well. They wandered past rooms of many sizes, some large and spacious whilst others were small and cramped. They found dormitories, recreational areas and even walked through a cafeteria.

“Hey look,” Gamma said, pointing his raised rifle at a small stall in the corner. “A vendor. Didn’t think I’d see one of those here.”

“You’d think he’d have better luck on a busy street or something. I mean, how much do you think he sold?”

“Well,” Delta chimed in. “Considering these rusting cans of… beans? I’d assume quite a bit. He wouldn’t really have set up shop here if business wasn’t good, no?”

“How do you know he did though? What if he had to leave in a hurry and couldn’t get all of his supplies out?”

“Well, considering his crumbling skeleton’s still sitting on the seat with that sign in its hands, I’d say you’re probably wrong.”

“Wait, it is? Oh Jesus! Didn’t even see that,” Gamma exclaimed, jumping back from the skeleton.

“Can of beans,” Beta read. “Fresh last decade can of beans. Huh, you’d think a vending machine would do the trick, no?”

“Well have you ever seen a vending machine selling canned goods before?” Delta asked amused.

“Fair point.”

“Okay, time to go. We haven’t got all day for this,” Alpha commanded, her gun still raised and trained on the door ahead like they’d been taught in basic training. “We need to get Mr. Vorn to the drop-off zone and then rendezvous stat.”

The three saluted and got back into position around Tobias before proceeding once again.
