Hey Astro,

I think you did a wonderful job with the characters here. Both of them were really clear and unique in this story. And then the fun bit at the start with Richard was great too! All in all, I think the emotion in this piece was perfect.

And in regards to the end? Well, I was very curious as to the reasons behind Greg's inability to find the ring. We had a bit of a discussion of it in campfire when we read yours, heh. I hope you can join one soon! I'd love to meet the guy behind these incredibly early consistently great stories.

My only critique for you is to be a bit careful with names. You repeat them a lot. In a lot of cases, I think just pronouns would work.
