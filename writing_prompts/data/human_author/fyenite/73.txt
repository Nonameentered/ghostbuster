Hey cake,

Wow, this was oddly hilarious. I loved the little rhyming bits and the general absurdity of it all. Actually, I take that back, I can't describe how much I loved the general absurdity of it all. My god, it was just glorious all the way through. Kind of like one of those 'There was no point in there where I could guess what the next sentence would be' but ten times better. Just very well done.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> A toad big enough to swallow all the mud men sights!

I think you want "all the mud men's sight!" or something. Not too sure, just sounds odd here.

> She let the slimy thing plunk back into the pond she fished.

I think you missed a word here. "into the pond where she fished."? Or something else could work too.

> and the line went taught!

Just the wrong word here. I believe you want "tought" over "taught". Or something like that.

> Her hands groped for the mossy feeling horns of her friend.

Hmm, this whole bit is confusing. I'm not too sure what she was feeling for. Horns? The moss or her friend? Maybe some rewording may help?

> that father had made her for catching creek bogglegloops,

Just a mix-up of two words here. "had made for her" over "had made her for" I think.

And finally, I assume the frog king was about to give her back her sight? I was kind of sad that we didn't get something for that. Even something like "She felt a searing pain and then saw." I assume you were trying to not use sight so maybe there's a clever way of not mentioning what she saw exactly but as it is, the story feels a bit unfinished.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
