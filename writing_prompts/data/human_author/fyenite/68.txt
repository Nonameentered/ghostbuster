Hey Stick,

Oh my was this a strange story. Have to say, things only got stranger as the story went on. The fish jumped out of the river to attack the fishers? Honestly, I was waiting for the twist where we learn it was all a dream or something, lol.

I have to say, you have some absolutely beautiful bits for Donnie. The running around like a toddler line was hilarious the "Beer me" bit? Absolute gold. I don't know how you came up with it but now I'm irritated with Donnie.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> Moses was tired of squinting at the water, holding a rod, and pretending to pay attention to the fishing line, but didn’t have other options.

Hmm, I think this sentence could have ended with "line," and then the next one could be reworded to "But he didn't have another option." It just reads a bit better that way I think.

> We could be killed! Drowned!

Might be intentional but I found the "killed! Drowned!" a bit redundant. Both essentially say the same thing. Then again, that's what you might have been going for to show frustration.

> Carp. Buddy you made the wrong choice today. Isn’t that right, bro?

This line was a bit confusing for me. Was Donnie talking to the carp in the first sentence? Just a bit confusing is all. And if so, then having it as "Carp buddy,..." over "Carp. Buddy..." may work better.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
