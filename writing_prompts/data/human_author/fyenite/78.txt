#Easy Peasy

“So, I hold it like this?”

“Yep Glen, one hand under the barrel just like that and the other curled gently around the trigger.”

“Ooh, it’s so smooth, and light too! Look, I can hold it with one hand!”

“Whoa there cowboy, don’t be wavin’ the bleedin’ shotgun around like that. You don’t wanna blow someone’s head off, now do ya?”

“Oops, sorry. Okay, so where do I point it?”

“Just down is fine, barrel about a foot from the water is the sweet spot.”

“Like this? Sight's been, well, exactly as it used teh, heh.”

“Ah, no idea why you insist on wielding a shotgun when you’re uh, blind but I ain’t no vendor who turns away a payin’ customer. Now here, let me show you. Hmm, yep, just like that.”

“You sure?”

“Yep, you’ll get a bit of spray like that, but it’s the safest. Now pull the trigger when yer ready.”

“Oh damn, that is loud, my ears are ringin’!”

“Yep, shotguns’ll do that.”

“Hehe, thisa kinda easy. Really easy actually. Err well, like 'shootin’ fish in a barrel', hehe.”

“Yep, you said the thing.”

“Mhmm, wouldn’t be right if I didn’t say the thing while doin’ the thing. Oh man, I see what you mean about that spray, tastes gross. Ugh, so sweet and cold. And smells kinda odd too. You sure this is the fish I ordered?”

“Yep, one fish in a barrel and a buckshot shotgun as you asked for this mornin’.”

“Huh well, hm hm, certainly easy. Perhaps even very easy. But man, not quite 'as easy as pie' for instance. Nor as tasty as 'cookie cutter' neither. But it’s definitely up there. I’d give it a... 7/10 on the accuracy scale.”

“So, pretty good then?”

“Eh, perhaps. Now, I say these results are satisfactory!”

“Well, glad I could supply the necessary equipment.”

“Thank ya, Janine. Now, do you by any chance know the location of the lemonade stand? Gotta test the ‘Easy peasy lemon and squeezy’ expression thing next, aye.”

“Sure, just five stalls over on your left, Glen. Good luck!”

“Thank ya.”

“So Janine, how’d it go?”

“Oh, you mean with Glen? Went smoothly, I’d say Marge.”

"Well good to hear it! Honestly, surprised you managed to come up with that many fish for him in such little time. Me and the other vendors took bets and everythin'. Heh, won ten bucks cause of it. So thanks.”

“Oh, it was easy, just took a barrel of water, a couple pounds o’ table salt and a whole lotta non-dissolving Jell-O.”

“Wait, waddabout the fish? And Jell-O?”

“Oh, I mean, he’s blind, so probably couldn’t tell the difference. Wasn’t gonna put some poor fish through a buckshot now was I? Some well-prepared Jell-O gave it that nice splash.”

“…You know, I wish I had thought of somethin’ smarty like that too. Gotta say, was not a pleasant day when he came in for ‘stealin’ candy from a baby'. No sirree.’”
