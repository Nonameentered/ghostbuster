The small sample of slime in Liv's hand congealed and morphed as it explored the surface of her hand. The slime changed colours too and Liv watched with an open mouth and wide eyes as the slime turned from a bright shade of lime to a dark green.

"Fascinating," she breathed in excitement, her lungs fluttering as they usually did when she was on a discovery that would recourse her entire career.

What Dr. Liv didn't know however was the reason the slime turned different colours. Threats. When the gelatinous creature in her hand changed colours based on how threatened it felt. And right now, it was a deep shade of green — almost black.

With a yelp of surprise, Dr. Liv jumped back as the slime in her hand launched itself towards her. No, not towards her, over her shoulder. Liv turned just in time to dodge the lunge of another slime, this one much much larger.

"O-Oh God!" she stammered. A small blob in her hand was fascinating. Representing the potential next decade of Biological science. Plus, it was kind of adorable too. But when you had a mass of the stuff that rose to over seven feet tall with a surface that squished and quivered, you tended to lose your sense of curiosity.

Before the creature could get another attack in, however, the small blob that was previously in Liv's hand plunged itself into the raging mass...and immediately disappeared.

Dr. Liv backed away into a corner, unsure of what to do. The creature — which she now realised came from a shattered storage tank of the extra matter — blocked the only exit. Dr. Liv shivered despite the heat in the room.

And then, the mass stopped moving altogether and turned a bright lime.

"Hello Liv," the creature somehow said.
