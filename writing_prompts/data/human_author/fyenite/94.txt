Hey seven,

Hah, this was hilarious. I loved the little details you used here. The chipmunks, though they added nothing to the plot, was quite an amusing addition. And I especially liked that bit where Aaron didn't have the heart to move the paving stones because of them. And I liked how they were brought back at the end too.

I also liked the shared history here, Both these two characters are aware of the fact that they've crossed in the past and I think you do a great job of bringing it up to the reader in a funny way.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> Aaron might have sat on a fence post, but the lead officer was even higher, way up on the back of a gangly Appaloosa.

So here, you might want to reword it as "Aaron might have been sitting on a lampost, but the lead officer was still taller," I'm going back and forth on the "higher/taller" bit because he's not actually taller, he's just sat on a horse. And yet, higher just sounds wrong. Hmm.

> where only chirpy, little chipmunks could see.

Okay, so when describing what was on Aarons's property, you didn't list the tent that they then later walked into. Not sure if that was intentional or not. The line above also indicates that Aaron's back is facing towards some sort of opening and towards the pile of paving stones, as that's the only way I'd guess the chipmunks would be able to see it.

One tiny little nitpick. The bit about the mermaid implies that mermaids actually exist within this world, correct? Otherwise, the officer would have called Aaron a liar. Although I guess if gold spitting alchemy oysters also exist, then it would make sense. Just wanted to point it out either way in case it wasn't intentional.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
