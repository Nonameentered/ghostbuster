Part 2

It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not. Jordane stood in the dark and dank hallway, bleary-eyed and frustrated beyond belief. The weird parasite-man thing in the interrogation room that insisted on being called Karl Viger had kept his team up all night with his ravings and “warnings”. He had bloviated for hours about the enemy to the East but worst of all, he refused to break. Seriously, Jordane had tried every interrogation tactic in the book, from assurances of freedom to downright barbaric torture, but nothing got an ounce of information from him about his identity beyond a simple name.

“Sorry sir,” Jordane said with an exhausted sigh for what felt like the thousandth time. “What was that?”

“Captain Marklyn, soldier. Put me on the line with Captain Marklyn.” The man yelled through the line.

“Ah sir, I’m afraid he’s not with us anymore.”

“What? Since when?”

Ughh, typical mainland officers. More politician than soldier, Jordane thought. He’d be surprised if the man on the other line had even seen a day of active operations in the field. It was no wonder he had no idea of the goings on at the Eastern end. “Sir, Captain Marklyn retired ten years ago. I, captain Jordane, have taken up his position. So again, I ask what’s the meaning of this call.”

“Ah, so they replace the good captain with a green lad such as yourself? Typical, our military’s really going down.”

If Jordane wasn’t so exhausted, he’d have had a retort already down the receiver. Or, he’d have just simply slammed the phone down. That’s what Marklyn had taught him, pride and respect. But god did he need sleep.

“Well captain, I am calling you in regards to that prisoner you have taken.”

“Wait, how do you know about–”

“That’s not important. All I want you to do is take the USB drive he has and send him on his way, preferably with some supplies too.”

“What, are you insane?” Jordane tried to argue again, this time with a little more force. He’d have genuinely considered this to be some sort of a trick if the call hadn’t come from the executive line straight from Washington. Even so, it was just ridiculous. Sorry sir, it’s just… he knows the location of the base now. If he were a spy, or decided to perhaps sell the location–”

“He’s not, captain and he won’t. Now don’t argue with me, or I’ll have you assigned as an armed escort for an insufferably boring family in Columbia. And, I’ll downgrade your equipment back to typewriters.”

“I–“

“Do you understand, soldier?”

“Yes,” Jordane sighed before putting the phone down. He walked towards the interrogation room, shoulders slumped and eyes downcast with a mixture of defeat and anger. With a quick motion to the guards, he gave the instructions necessary. At first, their eyes bulged with surprise and annoyance but the stern look on Jordane’s face halted any argument.

“Everything can change at any moment, suddenly and forever, Captain. It is not a fragrant world. So be ready,” Karl said with a voice far too wise for a man so young. He handed Jordane the small USB stick without even being prompted to and silently left the room. The guards outside walked him to the entrance, not quite trusting the odd man even still.

“So now what?” Jesren — his second-in-command — asked from beside him. “We just let a potentially dangerous man out with sensitive information and we’re letting him go? I hate to question your commands, Jord, but this sounds like how you lose an outpost to the enemy.”

Jordane simply smiled at Jesren’s comment, toying with the small drive in his hand. “Well mate, question all you want, because that ain’t my command. Some big cat over in Washington wanted him set free.”

“Oh,” Jesren replied. More words weren’t needed. The pair had always heard of those calls. Deep in the bowels of the night when even God couldn’t see. From the special line that was reserved for them and backed with so much encryption, it was useless to try and crack the electrical signals before they hit the receiver.

Simply put, this was a very rare and important call. And one that Jordane — now that he was a little more awake with the importance of it — was glad that he had been to tried to argue back too much.

Leaving Jesren behind, Jordane made his way to the command room. He needed to post the drive back to Washington, stat. But Jordane was curious about the secret. No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them.
