The giant slimeball stopped shuddering and promptly began to expand and contract, rapidly changing shape. The contents within churned as the sheen of detritus swirled on the surface. And then — to the sheer shock of Dr. Ordie — her "child" expanded into a cube of all shapes.

The good doctor stood stock-still, notepad and pen held tightly in her hands and mouth half agape. It was odd seeing a creature make such a... fine shape. Sharp edges ended in fine pointed corners. Surfaces were completely smooth and level. And right in the centre, Dr. Ordie thought she could make out a slightly different shade of green.

Yes. In the middle of the cube was a small blob of slime that was slightly different. How strange.

"Ah, that's much better," the Cube said. Its voice was still the same — echoey and distant — but the tone had changed. More consolidated and solidified, like the speaker was more real now. "Ah, sorry. Just incredibly difficult to talk, or I guess do anything without a brain." A deep rumble emanated from the creature almost as if it was... laughing.

Liv idly scratched her head, both terrified and amazed. "I'm sorry, brain?"

As if in answer, the Cube contracted and the small blob of differently coloured slime inside it pushed its way to the surface.

"Oh," was all she could manage. Suddenly realising the opportunity before her, Dr. Ordie dove back into her notebook, frantically scribbling everything she had witnessed as if it were some vivid dream she was determined to document before it faded.

"So Mother, w-what are you doing?" A slight touch of concern entered the Cube's voice.

"Just jotting down some notes before the experiments–"

"Experiments?" the thing shrieked. "Oh absolutely not." And with that, it disappeared down the sewage drain.

"Well shit."
