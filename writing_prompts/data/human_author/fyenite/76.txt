Hey seven,

Ooh, such a visceral (?) story here. Not sure what else to call it but you do a great job of focusing so heavily on the minute actions and movements of the hunter and the prey. I really liked how you dove straight into the different senses of the hunter. The taste and sensors and such were great ways to give us information about her surroundings. I believe you missed out on sight here? Makes total sense for a sea creature.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

Now, these are incredibly tiny nitpicks because, as usual, seven words are far too good. Like it's almost unfair how good they are.

> There are fish in the water; the hunter can smell them.

Hmm, I see that you start and end on this line here which did give me pause with my critique but thinking about it, I think it would still help.

So in this story, you show the hunter as an almost intelligent feeling being with an almost-sentience. You personify her really well, especially with the little thoughts she has. And I think that pairs really well with the pronoun of "she" that you give. You familiarise us immediately with her as if we're there personally, watching it all unfold.

So my critique is to perhaps change the really impersonal words "the hunter". It immediately puts us on the outside of this creature whilst a couple of sentences down, you immediately jump into pronouns and get closer. So I'd say replace "the hunter" with "she" and then use "the hunter" as another way to reference her in order to avoid repetition.

From the first little bit, it's apparent that she's a predator. I think you drop enough clues for that so "the hunter" doesn't really add too much beyond giving us that information a sentence or so earlier.

> Must get closer.

Hmm, I almost want to suggest that just a simple "Closer" would work best here. On the one hand, I like the brief thought, but on the other, it's almost not direct and brief enough if that makes sense.

>  The hum of a living being,

So you've mentioned below that you didn't actually give anything explicit about what these creatures were. Now I imagine that the "prey" is just a regular mundane fish... Or a rattail fish? I almost want to say that the specific species isn't important here. My critique is pretty much just about the word "being". You could use "prey" here. Or find a word that means food but fits with your theme. Either way, "being" just sounds odd to me.

Just to repeat, these are incredibly tiny nitpicks and could absolutely be preference based. So feel free to do with them as you please.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
