With a final nod, he led us to our room. I hung back with Denise as the man, who had neglected to give us his name and wasn’t wearing a name tag, prattled on about not disturbing the neighbours and breakfast times. We didn’t speak, I guess we were both a little too exhausted to really care. All I remember wanting was a warm shower and an early night. So, that’s what we did.

I woke up to the sound of an alarm clock blaring. As I turned over to switch it off and curse whoever thought to put one on, I realised that the bed was empty. Where was Denise? Glancing at the dark open bathroom told me that she wasn’t in there either. I surveyed the room for a second before groaning and getting up.

A quick look at my phone told me it was 3 am for god’s sake. I groaned again, a little more loudly this time and turned on the lamp. And there, on the ground and illuminated by the light from the lamp was a dark red stain by the foot of our bed.

Now, I know you guys know me as a sniper who rarely ever gets his hands dirty but you better believe I know the look of blood. I think in that moment, my mind turned from confusion to concern to anger in a matter of a second as I looked again more forcefully for my wife.

My search took me outside our room and, with the hallways deserted of all life, I turned to knock on the next door. As my hand reached the dark oak wood though, I hesitated, “don’t disturb the guests,” the creepy guy had said but even so, this was an emergency, right? What if Denise was lost or hurt? She could need my help and any one of these guys could possibly lead me to where she might have gone.

I furrowed my brow then and knocked on the door thrice. On my third thud, the door creaked inwards slowly however and a deep red light spilt out from the widening gap. I stood there, confused for a second before finally taking a step inside. Perhaps the room was empty and therefore unlocked?

Nope.

As I entered the room and the large double bed came into view, I saw my literal worst nightmare. Bodies. Two, maybe three of them lying on the bed bathed in red light and likely red blood.

I stepped forward, if only to confirm my initial conclusion and froze at the foot of the bed. I recognised them.

Now, you remember that hostage situation we were in in the nineties? Our exploits in the East led to that time we had to take the oligarch's family hostage. Do you recall the bloodbath that came from it? Yeah, I kid you not man, that’s what was on the bed. Right down to the duct tape pattern Buzz used to tie them down.

I just stood there frozen for what felt like hours. My nightmares… were just like this. When I’d have to face what I did. After a time, I think I just turned around and left, not believing that any of it was real. I don’t know why they let me leave but they did. And in the lobby on one of the tables, there was a picture of all of us in the successful mission picture we took after the fact.

The next thing I knew, I was here at this beaten down twenty-four-hour cafe in my pyjamas dialling your number. Look man, I don’t care if you believe me or not but… I just had to tell someone.

I’m… I’m going back now. Denise is still in there… and I need to finally face this.

Bye.

Despite my many protests, Jeremy spoke over me and finally hung up.

That was a month ago. So why am I telling you this now? Because I just got a coupon in the mail this morning about a late Veteran’s day celebration and a stay at Marvers hotel.

Now, I could just not go, but if they know as much as Jer thinks they do, then there’s likely no hope of escaping this. Going to the police may work? The army? Or perhaps I need to deal with this myself?

I don’t know.
