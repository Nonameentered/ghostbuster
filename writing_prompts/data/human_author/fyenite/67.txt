Hey Ginger,

well this is pretty amusing. Poor Ilyana, only fourteen and already having to deal with the mermaid police. Have to say, that start was glorious. Just the obnoxious screeching as we hear this voice slowly get louder and louder. Have to say, the fact that she's fourteen makes a lot more sense now.

> She once had a grandfather who could tell if a man’s blood was English by scent alone.

Ahaha, I wasn't excepting that. Brilliant reference, lol.

And I really liked that ending too! I think pretty much the whole dynamic between these two can be summed up by that final interaction.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> the blind giantess Ilyana flings her rod,

Hmm, I think you want a comma after "Ilyana"? Or maybe section that bit off with two commas? Not sure.

> “I can’t go home!”

This just sounded a bit odd. I think you want to give it a few more words. Something like "I'll never be able to go home!" or something may work better perhaps?

> Ilyana runs her finger over the smooth scroll of some kind of skin and sighs.

So, the fact that Ilyana is blind felt a bit isolated from the rest of the story. I was waiting for the mermaid to hesitate about how she'd deal with Ilyana when she learned that she was blind. I think you could have focused on it a bit more when the comment about the signs came up or even here. Just a thought I had.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
