Hey Restser,

Ooh, I really liked the metaphors here. The hamster wheel and such were great little things to mention and compare to I think. I also quite liked the characterisation you had for each character here. Although we only see one, the other two were very well described I think.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

First, I felt like you mentioned both new characters too close together. You didn't mention who they were nor how they were related to our character when you mentioned them which just proved to be a little confusing.

Second, so is Robert a therapist of sorts? You don't outright say it which did leave me a bit uncertain. He sounds like he's a friend but that last line about not coming back makes me think he's a therapist. Perhaps actually mentioning it could help?

Finally, I kept waiting for some sort of a resolution when I got close to the end. You have all of these great comparisons and metaphors but I was waiting for an accurate description of what was actually going on. What the metaphors were being made for if that makes sense. I understand that the "discomfort" was about his jaw pain but what was with the pain, to begin with? Just a thought I had near the end.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
