Well, here we go!

I was able to complete all of my tasks last month. A couple of them were a bit last moment but did them! I only finished the book about a week ago. I started late. The prompts fell off a bit later in the month so I'm glad I got those donw early. I managed to hit my NaNo goal as well and get the features in.

This month, I will:

> Review the past 12 months of your writing.

> Choose something out of your comfort zone and be okay that you will fail at it.

(This will be... interesting.) I'm thinking romance or something. Not sure thought.

> Write a second draft

Yep, that's it. I haven't ever completely rewritten a story before, just some heavy editing. So what I want to task myself to do is take a 2,000 word story/total of a multi-part story, and rewrite it for a second draft.

> Write two horror stories

I want these to be relatively long too, hence why I'm only tasking myself to write two. It's a genre that I've read a lot of but rarely ever written. So I want to change that.

I'll put my past 12 month reflection here just to have it down somewhere.

> What's one thing you've learned tha's improved your writing in the past 12 months?

Well... everything! I only really started writing about a year ago and a fair bit after that was empty space where real life had gotten in the way. So honestly, I've learned a real heck ton from all the wonderful writers around me. It's hard to really recall, but I remember struggling a lot around simple actions and dialogue. Definitely improved in those areas I think.

> ~~though obviously there are two points for anyone who does claim Talking Tuesday changed their lives~~

Funnily enough, TalkTues has also had a sizeable effect on me. It was the first time I thought to actually put down a few goals for myself to reach in a month. Sure, I had goals before, but those were either far in the future and somewhat unfeaseable or short-lived ones that I'd aim to hit in a week. So definitely been helpful.

> What's your proudest writing achievement of the past year?

Put a thought down on paper semi-coherently? Honestly, But seriously though, probably the longer winded stuff I've done. I'm prone to waffle and waver off course when writing longer pieces so writing some of that and actually having it recieved well has been great to me. Ermm, I wrote a story that came in at about 4k for r/shortstories which I quite liked. That one definitely stands out to me.

> What's one thing you would have liked to have done better in the past 12 months?

So going into writing, I thought I'd be better at horror. I came in already being a big fan of reading the genre and I thought I'd focus on that. However, I kind of never really started. I was immediately sucked into simply practising other types and doing a fair bit of fantasy.

But I want to change that a bit. Hence the horror story task I've set myself for this month.
