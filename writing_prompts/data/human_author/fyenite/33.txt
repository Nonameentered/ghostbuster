Part 4

Stanton stood frozen, eyes wide and unmoving as he took in the scene before him. His brother — Tobias — standing there casually talking to a small assembly of men and women in lab coats. He spoke amicably, an easy smile on his face and a relaxed posture to his stance.

" Err, coming in?" Samuel asked from a few steps away. He paused for a second before turning back to follow Stanton's line of sight. "Well I'll be a dissuaded control freak. Is that Tobias? Man, feels like I haven't seen him in – Oh right, that's why you're stood there." Samuel looked back at Stanton, bouncing from foot to foot nervously. Eventually, he cleared his throat, made an excuse and walked away quickly.

With a deep breath, Stanton cleared his mind of emotion and walked toward his brother. What he took to be scientists, quickly dispersed upon noticing him and he was very quickly left with his brother.

"Oh Stanton! How are you?" Tobias asked merrily with blatant disregard for his previous long absence. "I was wondering when you'd get here. Oh no no, no questions now, we simply do not have the time. Now please, come here." Tobias prattled on as Stanton followed him towards the far table, a cluster of very serious-looking people in official uniforms seated on the high-backed chairs. "When I heard what they wanted me to do, I insisted on bringing you along too. I mean, we need you and such."

Once the pair reached the table, Stanton realised that they had been waiting on them and now immediately jumped into the topic at hand.

"Right, so everything is good then, Tobias?" A man in military garb asked in a gruff voice.

"Yep yep, now everything is ready."

"And how long will the training take?" Stanton jolted a little when he recognised the pin on the woman's chest. 'Secretary of surveillance'? How big is this 'training' mission?

"And how about you, Mr. Stanton? Ready to train Tobias here?" The group of men and women turned Steeley gazes to him.

"Oh, about that," Tobias interjected. "He has no idea what's happening here. Just give me a few minutes and I'll fill him in."

"What do you mean you haven't filled him in yet? This isn't a game, Tobias."

"God, I knew this was a bad idea."

"I know I know," Tobias said quickly. "Just give me a second, okay?"

Pulled away to the side, Stanton felt the eyes of the others on him as Tobias began explaining things quickly. "So, you need to train me for a time reversal," he said with a relaxed smile.

"I, what?" Stanton replied.

"You helped build the time reversal system, right? The AnTimer?"

"What? I'm not going to do that. Why would you even think –"

"Because we have to."

"But... It stands in opposition to the original intent. It was made for the study of history. To allow us to finally get a glimpse of the world before us. Not for whatever game you're playing."

"I'm not playing any game, Stanton. The fate of the world hangs in the balance. You know those creatures, The Lost, that you're here to study? Well, that's what this project is trying to accomplish. It's to stop them."

Stanton grew angry, face flushed and mind curved with anger. "So let me get this straight, you disappear for years all because I didn't follow you into the special unit only to then drag me back for my invention?"

"Huh, so you do get it. Great, so is that a yes?"

"Hell no!"

"But it's to save the world! Plus, if all goes well, maybe it'll give us new insights into how to use your technology for other purposes too." Tobias waved a hand towards the table, "All those people there agree that this technology has a better use. They think that it's to prevent crime and war. Don't you want that?"

Begrudgingly, Stanton looked up and into his brother's eyes. There was that same self-assured amusement there that he knew from years of childhood. But there were other things too. Determinedness and hope. And though the sour feeling in his stomach and the bitter taste in his mouth told him that this wasn't what the design was meant for, he found himself agreeing.

"Fine," he eventually said, turning away.

"Splendid. And hey, maybe now we'll learn a little something about each other's careers," he joked as they approached the table once more.

"so?" the same military man asked as they came near. "is he in or not?"

"He's in."

"Great. Because if you had messed this up so close to the end, Tobias, I swear..."

"Understood, General. But politely, I told you everything would work out."

The Secretary cleared her throat. "Start training immediately."

"You got it."
