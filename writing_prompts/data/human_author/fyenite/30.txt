#Tie In

All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. And that rang true for questionably natured space parasites too. Perry/Karl Viger walked through the desert on his way to the last possible chance humanity had left, and hated it. He had been forced to of course by his brethren. For, without humanity, how would his species ever find another host?

He pulled his red leather jacket — that he'd exhumed from his host's closet — tighter around himself against the frigid night's chill and continued on, wishing for his growlery in Catalonia.

The man he'd killed with that strange gun still swam in his memories. Christopher was his name and a poor shmuck he was. In the wrong place at the wrong time. Karl's hand tightened around the small USB drive he had in his pocket. Though it may have been small, it carried vital information. "Sorry Chris," Karl found himself saying aloud. "At fifty everyone has the face he deserves. And that face is pale, white and cold." Karl always believed that a human should never be allowed to live past the age of fifty.

On the horizon, Karl spotted long grey towers peeking out above the golden sands and he kicked up his step and rushed over to them. Eyes alight with relief and movements quickened with a new sense of urgency, Karl made his way toward the military base on what would later be known as the Eastern front of the War of Loss.

"We lost because we told ourselves we lost," he said to himself. "But this time we won't."

A searchlight blared to life and immediately found his position. The light blinded him but also gave him enough light to safely speed up on the sandy earth. "They knew I was coming. Huh, spies. Karl thought to himself with a pleasant smile.

He loved Big Brother.
