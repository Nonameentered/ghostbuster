Last month I was able to complete all my tasks. Woo!

This month, I will hopefully,

> For at least twenty days in November, write at least 500 words.

Let's do this!

> Either, give yourself some time to do that hobby next month if you don't normally get a chance. Or, if you do normally get a chance, do not let the amount of time you spend on it drop.

Ooh, this might end up being baking. Wish me luck!

> Get my SerWun back on track.

So I have a serial on the feature that's stalling, I think. And it's been this way for a little while now. So, my goal this month is to get it back into shape and get the ball rolling again. Let's see how this goes.

> Write for every TT or FMF this month.

With other focuses this month, I don't want to stop writing for other features. So my second self set task this month will be to write for every TT or every FMF. I have not done anywhere near enough of either.
