Hey ran,

Ooh, I think you managed the panic and fear really well here. Though, I did think that the guy was just super drunk at first, heh. I think the concern and such from the flight attendants was well done and I think you characterised Allie super well too.

> Tom tripped, elbowed, bumped, and apologized his way to the tail end.

Heh, this line got a chuckle out of me.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> Last call for flight 828 to Paris out of Los Angeles.

Hmm, so I'm not sure if they would actually call the flights like this or not. I'd have thought they'd call out gates (where you had to go to board the flight) and then maybe the destination. I also think they wouldn't call the starting point as they're at the starting point right now. I get that it's probably because you want to clarify where Tom is right now but I'd argue that it's almost unnecessary as it doesn't get brought up again at all.

> Tom fidgeted in his chair, heart racing. He hoisted off his chair,

Just a bit of repetition of "chair" here.

> “Uh, sir, are you alright?”

> The flight attendant took notice of the beads dripping down his forehead as he handed her his boarding pass.

Hmm, the line break here shouldn't be there I think. Especially because the speaker and the one doing the action are the same here.

> “We have a full flight today, sir. Please grab the last remaining seat in the back.”

Just a bit of unnecessary information again. Not sure if the attendant would even know if the flight was full or if Tom was the last passenger. Also, surely some people would miss their flight?

So, I'd imagine the attendant would ask Tim to go to his seat by telling him the number and the general whereabouts of that section of seats. They wouldn't just say take "the last remaining seat in the back." if that makes sense.

> The woman said, “Hey, you want to listen to some music?”

Hmm, this might be a preference thing but I'd say replace the dialogue tag with an action. Say, "The woman held out her headphones..."? Or maybe replace "said" with "asked" if you still want it.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
