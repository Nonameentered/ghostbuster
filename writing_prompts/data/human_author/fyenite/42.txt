#Sacrificial Transportation

Part 2

The journey was a lot longer than Stanton would have previously assumed, and though his mind was busy pouring over all the information he had been given, his eyes drift over to the window and the vast mountainous terrain outside. The sun shone down with bright hues as it did in this part of the world. And Stanton could almost make out each colourful beam. A folder lay on his lap, closed and abandoned as he committed the information to memory.

Heritage and family trees were what the folder contained. Long lists of names on a page each signifying their own family surname, and each signifying a name Lost. Stanton continued to stare through the clear glass as his mind worked through the meaningless names for any form of meaning.

“Watch brooding about?” Samuel asked from beside him. Though he got no response, he didn’t stop staring at the man for an answer.

Finally, Stanton conceded and tossed the folder to him without turning around.

Samuel whistled to himself as he flipped through the folder, his tune hitching harshly as he came across a surprising detail or a horrifying fact. Stanton could picture it in his mind, Samuel sluggishly moving from one page to the next, examining each image in his mind’s eye.

‘Yes,’ he thought to himself. ‘There’s the part about China being overrun. And there’s the bit about Australia. And there’s the one where Germany falls…’ And like that, Stanton counts off the tragedies in his mind, all the while admiring the beauty of the outside world as if all were at peace.

Hours pass as the sun slowly descends from its high perch in the sky and dips below the horizon. And — at the same time — the moon rises in all of its glory from the opposite direction. Stanton rolls down the window as the silver moonlight bathes all beneath.

The mountains in the distance shine starkly against the night sky. Moonlight hitting their icy peaks and splitting into a beautiful light show above. Stanton couldn’t quite tell how such a beautiful show of colours was possible, but he didn’t care. The light shone in the distance, bathing the rest of the mountains in its rainbow glow.

And from above came the sparkle of a thousand tiny pinpricks, their own light white like the moons but also so much deeper and full of life. It was bold in its statement against the almost soft glow of the moon.

Samuel snored softly from beside Stanton, his breaths coming in softly, another instance of a stark contrast to Stanton’s own sharp breathing. But then, as the driver failed to navigate past a particularly large pothole, Samuel choked and jolted up, his eyes darting around.

Stanton turned away from the bleary-eyed confused man and turned back to the window. So many of those far-off distant mountains were off and yet inviting. Their irregular shapes on the horizon brought a sense of familiarity to him like he could picture his own life with them. He himself stood out amongst his colleagues, mind more interested in art and architecture compared to the more mundane interests of sports and TV. And so, just for a moment, he pictured his life with those like him. The quiet reserved type, irregularly cut and yet fitting perfectly together.

“This whole thing’s a real mess, you know that?” Sam asked, now rifling through the folder again. He reached for the thermos beside his seat and carefully poured himself some cold coffee. Stanton was surprised to note that the clumsy man had only spilt a few drops in his endeavour.

“I mean with this case. I mean, have you read this thing?” Sam waved the folder in Stanton’s face. “A real mess. Can’t make sense of a single word of it.”

Stanton sighed and turned back to the open window, his contemplation returning to the folder too.

“Like, what do you think it all means? They’re attacking as if they’re being led by some unifying force. That’s pretty clear. But if we’ve known this for years, if this file is to be believed.” He groaned a bit more as he flipped through it again, this time not bothering with any of the text and just examining the pictures.

“They’re targeting certain groups and countries,” Stanton mumbled, almost to himself.

“What?”

“They’re targeting certain countries and peoples.”

“Why?”

“I’m not sure, but those countries attacked are all a part of a long list of them. And all accounts say they’re taking certain people.”

“Who?” Sam stared at Stanton, eyes confused and wide.

“Looks like random people to us. But then again, we don’t have the link yet. They had taken back what was theirs in other nations, and then ravaged the rest.”

"What?"

Stanton sighed in response.
