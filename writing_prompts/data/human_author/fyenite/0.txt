#Rebirth

Part 3

***

Eddy rushed through the trees, clumps of leaves grinding beneath his footfalls. The thing that pursued him grew ever closer, its own steps clumsy and sporadic yet impossibly fast. How was it gaining on him so quickly, Eddy thought with desperation. He was young and small, yet his sospital need had kept him alive so far. He was a jobler, and he’d survive to see another day now too. He’d escape this thing, whatever it was and escape.

“We’re a strange pair, aren’t we?” the thing moaned in a hoarse whisper. “But soon you’ll be free, just like me.” This time the voice was even closer, and Eddy yelped in alarm and scrambled ever faster.

The small pouch hanging onto his belt swung wildly—a small loaf of bread he’d stolen from the farmer. Despite the extra awkward weight, Eddy didn’t dare drop it. Despite its minuscule size, he was thankful for the prandicle.

He swung himself over a rotting log and held tight to the pouch as it swung wildly and threatened to break its bindings. After the recent bromography with Italy, food was harder to come by, especially for a wild child such as himself.

Weaving between great hulking trunks, Eddy heard a crash followed by a groan from behind as the ground shook slightly. Yet Eddy didn’t dare slow down or stop, instead sprinting even faster until the dark sky bloomed with silver stars.

Something large loomed in the distance and Eddy cautiously approached it. Still jogging, though he heard no croaking voice nor footsteps behind, he emerged into a small clearing. And in the centre stood a large circular boulder. He approached it, curiosity waging a strong battle against exhaustion and fear. Eventually, he yielded though and rounded the boulder to sit on its other side.

Sweat beaded on his forehead as he shivered against the night’s chill. The cold smooth stone met his back and he slid down against it, thankful he still had his small sack of stolen nourishment. I don't expect to live forever, but I do intend to hang on as long as possible, he thought with a sigh.

But when he tipped the bag over, nothing came out. He waited a moment, his rumbling stomach still expecting a delicious roll of bread to tumble out. But nothing came. Hands drenched in a cold sweat, he fumbled within the small cloth sack, until his fingers poked through the other side.

There was a hole.

Eddy leaned his head back against the boulder as the reality set into his mind. It was going to be another night on an empty stomach, out in the cold forest with nothing but a beast of sorts to keep him company.

He froze suddenly, ears perking up. The forest was silent, all nightlife quietening as if a predator were nearby. And then he heard it again: a low gargling groan just beyond the treeline behind the boulder.
