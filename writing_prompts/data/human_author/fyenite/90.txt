Hey Ryter,

Heh, this was a hilariously wholesome story. I loved how Todd ran to Macie's house just so she could open the message for him. I think I verbally groaned when I read that bit, heh.

I also really liked the characterisation you had throughout here. Even Mace's mother had her own personality just through the fact that she didn't react to Todd charging into her kitchen.

> Sounds like she’s shoving you off into the friend—”

> “Don’t say it!”

Very nice dodge here. I think the theme of the friendzone was pretty much already apparent here but I liked how you still had this detail.

> the pain of teenage angst and anguish fading for the first time since his rejection, several long minutes ago.

You know, I was thinking the exact same thing. So much so in fact that I was about to point it out... until you did. And now, it's just a hilarious note to end on. So well done!

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> He raced into the kitchen, huffing and out of breath.

So, I thought the "out of breath" but here was a bit redundant as "huffing" already implies that... ~~Unless you meant a different type of huffing of course?~~ Bad joke? Bad joke.

> thoroughly used to Todd bursting into her home for the last ten years.

Hmm, perhaps there's a better way of wording this? Say, I think there could be a better word for "used to" here. Not sure what though. Also, "into her home for the last ten years" could possibly be reworded too. Say, "ten years of Todd bursting into her home." or something similar?

> He handed over his phone, which Macie unlocked with the passcode she’d known for years.

So I get that you're trying to show just how well they know each other here but this line felt clunky. I'd almost recommend getting rid of the "she'd known for years" bit as it just drags the sentence on a bit. I do like how this gives us more of an insight into their friendship though so perhaps there's a way of doing this with fewer words?

> “Glad you admit it.”

Hmm, considering that we're dealing with a couple of sixteen-year-olds here, I wonder if this bit could be replaced with an outright joke. It's already a somewhat sarcastic statement so something like "Glad you can count past ten." could work quite well. Though that might just be a preference thing.

One final thing, you repeat "Mace" and "Macie" a fair bit in this story, especially near the beginning. Maybe cutting down on those and replacing them with pronouns may help?

I hope this helps.

Good words!
