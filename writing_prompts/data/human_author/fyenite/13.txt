#Long Long Ago

Part 2

***

Dascastus swam in a sea of darkness, his arms lazily paddling beside him as he stared up into the void above. The recent feeding was on his mind. The void above shifted and squirmed at the mention of feeding. It was like hundreds of clack tendrils sliding against each other; impossible to tell apart or even properly understand and yet, still eerie all the same.

Dread filled Dascastus as he looked upon that unknowable forbidden thing, like looking at a dark sun, not yellow and lively, but red with blood. It was a violation of the order of nature and still, Dascastus found himself following its whims and orders. *Feed* it told him, *Feed on all of your kind and add to mine*. Dascastus was powerless against it and so, he merely did as it bid and hoped it would never look upon him with its full attention again.

As the darkness pulled away and the tendrils in the sky dissipated into evil wisps, Dascastus felt a little lighter and more like himself. Though the darkness still stood heavy around him; a result of the dulling of his senses and the Loss of his sight, he still felt it thin. He could breathe easier now, and walk more freely. His arms didn’t feel like they were paddling in a vast black pool anymore and now just hung limply at his side. He couldn’t feel them, nor anything around him but he still felt pleasant and relieved.

Dascastus looked back up to the sky, still dark but blessedly with a lack of intertwining tendrils and sighed in relief. We were not meant to understand. We never were. We were always just meant to be its puppets to do with as it pleased.

Suddenly, Dascastus felt a tap on his shoulder. Well, he never felt it—his nerves were dead—but more he felt himself lurch forward ever so slightly in space. Dascastus had lived long enough without his core senses to understand what this meant but was still surprised by it. Who on earth would approach a man like him? He must look an utter wreck, fumbling and stumbling his way through the city.

He turned towards the source of the tap and found that somehow, he knew that someone was there, standing and watching him. He stood and pretended to stare right back too, unsure of what to do. He could feed on the man, the unquenchable hunger he always felt was certainly begging for it. And the man was so close too…

But no, something in his mind told him not to, and he held himself back with it. A name popped up in his mind, bright against the darkness: Tobias Vorn.
