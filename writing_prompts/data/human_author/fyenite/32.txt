Hmm, I think, especially for a good villain, you want someone who is somewhat relatable. Say if their goal is to destroy the world, make their reasoning for it actually believable. If that makes sense.

As for a good hero? Honestly, not too sure. Most stories are about how the hero grows and finally overpowers the villain in some way. So showing their pain and grief whilst they fight and such is important.
