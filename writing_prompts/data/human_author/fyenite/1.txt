#Rebirth

Part 2

***

I listen as the forest goes quiet again. All that’s left of my dying senses is my hearing, and that is quickly failing me too. But I will still use it for as long as I have it. The beast that infects me has promised me much and more after the change is complete, and I wish to serve it until that reward comes.

Footsteps echo from afar. Past the winding rapids and deep into the forest beyond. I am not desultory. Despite my fast-approaching madness, I still have a plan. I used to be the old farmer’s daughter, quaint and quiet but wickedly intelligent. We were well off back then, this I remember. But even so, I seem to have lost my bougie concerns. Lost all of my now illusory habits and fears for wealth and success. Now all I wish to do is serve the writhing jet in the sky.

Even so, I am always satisfied with the best. And these footsteps tell me of a person quite perfect enough for me.

I wade through the coarse waters of the river, my progress reduced to a crawl as I submerge myself up to my neck. I can’t feel the icy embrace of the water anymore, and nor can I feel it rush about me. But even so, I still feel it sap my strength as an involuntary shiver creeps into my bones.

It is sunset again when I finally escape the river. A part of me longs to see the golden rays of the sun pierce the treeline again, or to be able to feel its heat. But that part never wins. The ticks and buzzing of insects rising tell me of the passing of the sun. The forest seems to both fall asleep and awakens all in the same moment as the nocturnal animals rise.

My mind is brought back to a different time. A time before when my concerns for life were very different. Men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. Each wanted their own thing: my hand in union or my hand in friendship. Neither won out though, unfortunately. The slithering darkness above did.

The sound of his footsteps seems louder now and I smile to myself in satisfaction. He is close now. Very close. And soon my master will have another to bless with his senseless power.

The thought brings me comfort as I stalk forward at a slightly faster pace.
