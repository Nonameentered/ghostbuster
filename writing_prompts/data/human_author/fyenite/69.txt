Hey Tens,

I love this idea! I was expecting regular old fishing stories and perhaps a bit of play on the word and such when I first saw the theme. But not something like this. Man, if we hadn't already had backyard barbecue week, I'd have loved to have seen the continuation of this world.

You did a great job with the worldbuilding in this one I think. 500 words are difficult and even more so when you're trying to explain the dynamic of how these societies and groups of people rely on each other to survive. And all primarily in dialogue form too.

I think that ending was perfect. Slowly but surely, you revealed to us what Sem felt about the deep and why she always sat there. And I think the progress of Bil coming to admit that he was interested too was a great focus for the end. Not to mention I just love that final line.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> The other she kept wrapped around the sturdy handle of a long pole strung with thick translucent wire.

So right from the get-go, you give us a rather lengthy line of description for Sem's hand placement. And I think that slows things down a lot, especially when it's right in the second paragraph and the first time we see her. Bits like "the sturdy handle", whilst an excellent bit of description, just felt unnecessary in the face of a rather long sentence. I'd say the important bit is the pole and the wire, so perhaps keep it to only that?

> not with the heat from the vents. Not like the up top. Heard they got a snow up there just yesterday.

First, this bit has what sounds like two starters. "Not with the heat from the vents." and "Not like the up top." Both give us information so maybe combing the two may help? And that would cut down the repetition of "not" as well?

Second, I'm not sure if this was intentional, but there's a rogue "a" before "snow" near the end of the line. It could just be how Sem speaks or a typo. Not sure.

> Bil laughed and emptied his beer, crinkling it in a meaty fist and tossing it casually over the edge.

I think it would make more sense to use "can" over "beer" here. Especially with the later actions with the container.

> All they eatâ€™s the mushrooms they grow,

Just a bit of odd phrasing here. But again, that might be intentional.

> Maybe there is something. And if there is,

I think you could drop the repetition of "there is" here. Just felt like a line that was lengthened without much cause.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
