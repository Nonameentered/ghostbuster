Hey Kat,

This was, quite the interesting story let's say. I found myself chuckling through a lot of it, just completely confused as to what on earth was happening. And then I looked at the genres and it all made sense, haha.

Super glad someone attempted to tackle the beast known as mannerpunk. I can't imagine the amount of research needed to properly pull it off.

As critique, I'd like to point to this line:

> “I’m terribly sorry; you’re standing on my cape, I think. I might be wrong, of course.”

The "I think." followed by the rest of it just felt a bit odd. I presume you were trying to go for the politeness and such, but I'm quite sure you already get that with the "I'm terribly sorry;". But that might just be me.

Good words!
