Hey Memory,

Oh my, this was not where I thought a story would go. Man, you do such an amazing job of giving us this incredibly depressing scene and atmosphere. Just jumping straight into the mess of a home life and then jumping into how she survives and such was such a powerful way to portray this idea.

I also quite liked the little nods at how she actually felt during the err, encounter in the latter half. Those side details were very nice in further characterisation of both our MC and the other guy.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> The chain had tiny, rounded dents. It glinted in amber light as he coiled it between his thick fingers.

I think the full stop here in the middle could be a "and" just to connect the two sentences and vary the structure a bit.

> he didnâ€™t stutter on the entire day.

I think this line was oddly worded. "in the whole day." or something similar may work better? Not sure.

> After midnight, I sparkled the ring in the mirror.

Hmm, I kind of wanted a moment where she admired it in the mirror before she brought it to her mouth. Otherwise, it just felt a tad sudden.

One more thing, the connection between the first and second scenes is a little tenuous. So she's getting the jewellery from the guy for herself and her family? Who is her mother? Where is she? And how is she going to pawn off an engagement ring? Just a bunch of questions.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
