Hey Memory,

Ooh, I loved the world you've made here. It's super cool and interesting. Honestly, I'd love to see more of it. How did the boy lose his eye? How did Marin and the boy meet? From the writing style, it seems like they aren't related or even friends really.

And on top of the awesome world, you managed to fit in a bit of a fight scene in it too. Very well done. I think you described the two trappers with just enough detail and depravity that the danger felt quite real.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> Rust tinted sunbeams ribboned past the boarded window. Above rotting floorboards, dust particles caught in the morning glow danced like fireflies.

So the description here felt a bit too convoluted. This might just be me but it took me a second read to see what you were getting at. Why was the sun's beam rust-coloured? was one of the questions I was thinking.

Also, I think you can do away with "particles" here. You don't really need it I think.

> Sparks spritzed from the mass of hanging wires.

So narrative issue here. If the apocalypse has happened then why is there power in the powerlines? I would have assumed they would have gone out quite a while back, no? Just a thought.

> Crumpled bags, dented cans of oozing gunk, miscellaneous trash littered the aisles.

So here, you have a list. So, I think you want to replace the final comma with an "and".

> Lopsided stools, checkered tiles caked with debris.

Hmm, I think you want another "and" in place of the comma here. I think.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
