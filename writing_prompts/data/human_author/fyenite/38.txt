Hmm, I generally try to read a book a month or something. It's not much at all but I'm a slow reader and somewhat busy at times too. But because of that, I do try to force myself to always have something ready to read.

Currently, I'm reading Mistborn Gen 2 and on the third book on my e-reader. Though, I do need to pick it back up very soon.
