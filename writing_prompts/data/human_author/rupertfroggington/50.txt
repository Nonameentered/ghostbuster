He could feel his hand pulsing in hers. An odd feeling, like his hand was a chick in a nest.

He’d never felt it pulsing before. It must have been her heartbeat, not his.

She squeezed harder.

”Ouch,” he said, pulling his hand away, only realising then that he’d felt the pain of her squeezing his hand.

Felt the pain.

Felt.

And he’d felt more than that. Something he couldn’t quite see, couldn’t quite describe, had been creeping up his body before he’d pulled away.

”I’m always overwhelmed by emotions,” she said. “Always! It’s never ending. That’s why I’m here with my dad on my twentieth instead of with friends. Because I’ll do dumb shit like I did with your trick and ruin the night. But Dad puts up with me. And I put up with him.”

”That must be…” But he didn’t know what that must be. What did feeling overwhelmed by emotions look like? Was it like a cold wave rushing over you, knocking you over? Or like a hot flame?

“When I touched you,” she said, “the feelings — the pain I’m always feeling, that I take everywhere — it became a little more distant.“

“Distant?”

She nodded. “Like someone had control of a dimmer for a light, and they turned it down so that you could just make out the outlines of all the objects in a room.”

He swallowed. In a whisper he said, “When you held my hand, I felt something. In my hand to start with, but it was slowly rising up me. Like I was a dry stem of a flower and your hand was water and I was drawing it up into my body.” He paused. “Sorry. I sound really stupid.”

She smiled. Her green eyes looked into his. Maybe just beyond.

“Can I hug you?” she said.

“Hug?” He watched his hand holding the pint. Watched as the liquid rocked back and forth. Both his hands were trembling.

”Can I?”

He took a deep breath. Nodded, and stood up.

The girl stood too.

Slowly, she put her arms around him and pulled him in. She rested her head against his chest and breathed in and out very deeply, very slowly.

The sensation that had been creeping up his body now rose out from his back and his chest. A warm feeling. A feeling that melted the emotion contained around a thousand memories, as if the memories were long-extinct animals that had been caught in an ice flow , trapped there. And now, as the ice melted, the smell of them, the feel of them, the sense of them, was returning.

He thought of his childhood.

His father had left before Eric had been born and his mother couldn’t look after him. Couldn’t look after herself, even. She’d been placed in care and then he’d been shipped around any place that would have him.

He’d lost the ability to feel emotional or physical pain at the age of nine. Everything he should have felt before or since had been entombed in the ice.

”It’s okay,” said the girl, “stroking his back. “It’s okay.”

He was crying, he realised. He was sobbing heavily into her shoulder. His back heaving.

”I’m sorry,” he said.

The ice had been so heavy. So god-damned heavy and he’d carried it for so god-damned long. And now, as it thawed, even though it was painful as anything he knew, he could feel the weight of the ice lessening. As if freeing the memories to release this pain was somehow also lifting it away him.

”I’m sorry,” he said again.

She held him for a long time, rubbing his back, as the glacier slowly melted. Perhaps the ice and the fire would return to them both when they let go, but for now, at least, it was enough to hold each other and breathe.
