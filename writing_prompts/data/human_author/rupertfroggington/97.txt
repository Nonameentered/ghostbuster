My friend was telling me about a dream she had the other night. We were in a little bistro in town catching up after a long time. My friend was drinking some fancy coffee. I was on my second G&T. We’d used to be roommates in college but we rarely saw each other now.

“This dream was just awful,” my friend said.

”What was so bad about it?”

“Well, it was about Emma.”

Emma is my friend’s baby. I’m not sure how old she was exactly, but less than a year.

”I think I’ve been watching too many Disney movies.” My friend laughed but I could tell she was distressed. Her eyes were red and baggy.

”Tell me about the dream,” I said. I didn’t really want to hear about her dream — what good do dreams do? — but as a friend you have certain obligations.

”You really want to know? It’s so silly.”

”I really want to know,” I said.

”A witch cast a spell on my baby. In the dream, I mean. She’s my firstborn so I guess that attracted the witch in the first place.”

”They do tend to go for firstborns,” I agreed. “What was the curse?”

”The old sleeping beauty one. My baby wouldn’t wake up again until the curse was broken by true love.”

I thought about this as I sipped my drink. It’s probably a common enough dream for new mothers, their baby not waking up. I bet they worry about it all the time when they’re awake and it seeps into their dreams. I didn’t say anything about that to my friend though — sometimes people just want you to listen.

”Did her true love appear?” I asked.

She shrugged. “I thought maybe I was her true love. After all, I love her with everything I am. So I leaned down and kissed her soft forehead. And it’s dumb, but in the dream I really expected her to wake. To raise her eyelids and little arms and want to be picked up.”

“But she didn’t wake, I guess?”

”No. I think I must have kissed her forehead until it was red but she didn’t wake. What do you think that means?”

”I think it means you’re a tired and worried mother. Like all new mothers.”

She smiled, stirred her drink. It wasn’t steaming any longer and I don’t recall her taking a single sip.

”I thought it meant I don’t really love her,” my friend said. “And in the dream I fell down by the cot and cried because I realized that must be the truth of it. All along I’d been pretending to love her.”

”It sounds like a rough dream.”

My friend nodded. “But then I woke. To Emma crying, would you believe it? The sound of her crying in real life was the sound of my own crying in my dream. But she was awake then. And she needed me. You’d think that’d be enough to dispel the witch’s curse, right? For the dream to blink out of memory. But it‘s really lingering.”

“It’ll fade,” I said. “Sometimes they just take a bit of time.”

She sighed. “You’re right, I suppose. Thank you for listening. It really helps to get it off my chest. Now, how are you? Is your mother doing any better?”

My mother didn’t recognise me any longer. But it didn’t seem right to tell my friend that when she was already upset, so I said, “Good days and bad.”

I had another drink after my friend left. I sat back on my chair and watched couples and friends come and go. I put a hand on my belly, imagined it feeling fuller and fatter.

I thought about the witch for a while. About a witch like that. Why would she put a curse on a child?

She must have been very sad and lonely to do it. Bitter at some unfairness of life. Maybe she thought other people also being miserable would help her feel better about her own situation.

Or maybe not. Maybe she was just evil.

I finished my drink and had a glass of water, then headed to the care home. Imagined my mother asleep. She’d been sick for so long that she could fall into a long sleep at any time. That’s what I’ve been told.

Her kiss would have woken me if I’d been cursed as a baby. I’m very certain of that.

I didn’t tell my friend, but I’ve been having a recurring dream like hers. Only it’s my mother that is sleeping, not a baby.

She’s sleepwalking, rambling down the halls of the care home — and I’m there in front of her, only she can’t see me.

I take her hand and guide her to her bed. Pull the cover tight.

Then I kiss her forehead. Not to wake her, but so that she can sleep very peacefully.
