I was only a kid when I dated a goddess. Thirteen and a little chubby — only ever kissed by Mom’s brandy-hot lips.

I was too young for dating apps, I knew it at the time but I wanted to get out. I wanted a friend, as much as I did a kiss, and like I say, I wanted to get out. I had a phone and I installed a few dating apps. I’d gotten the phone when I was eight; Mom spent that year telling her friends that a phone is modern parenting 101: “He loves it. He’d rather play games on it than play games with me. Which is ideal, when you think about it. It makes things easier for us both.”

The app was called Mythical Dates, the idea being it set you up with a fantastical creature, or even a God. When you’re thirteen and lonely that sounds pretty cool. So I uploaded a picture of my face. Then I looked at the pocked and acne scarred flesh that stared back, with its sunken eyes and hollow cheeks, and deleted it.

I didn’t have many photos of my dad but I knew Mom kept one in a chestnut drawer by her bed. That she took it out and stared at it when she was very drunk and very sad. I’d see her through the half-open door. The photo was taken long before he ran off with that ‘whore Catherine!” It was before she started drinking, too.

It didn’t look much like me. The man in the photo was almost model handsome. Like my face through a dozen filters, my arms and cheeks inflated like balloons, and even then you’d need to squint. I wish I remembered him for myself instead of through the scratched and cloudy lens of my mother.

I wrote a bio. I lied about my age. Said I played sports and had plenty of friends. I think the only truth I wrote was that I liked poetry. I ended my bio with a line from a poem I adored: “I do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands that the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses.“

And then I went to bed.

&#x200B;

I woke up the next day to the front door being slammed. It was either Mom back from an all night drinking session with her single friends, or it was her leaving early to start one. I hoped for the latter. At least then I’d have peace.

Twenty messages waited for me on Mythical Dates. Twenty requests for a date. I sat up in bed, mouth agape.

A siren named Lorelei. A goddess called Athena. Even a god called Sol.

I flushed with guilt. I closed down the app. Opened it again. I hadn’t thought it through — I hadn’t expected any matches. No one ever took interest in me and now, suddenly, I was inundated.

Except I wasn’t. This was some strange chimera I had created. Not my father, not me, but something that was both of us and neither of us. Something I wanted to be true but wasn’t.

I deleted the messages and requests without reading them. I should have replied and confessed but I couldn’t, at least not that way. It would have been too personal. Instead, I changed my profile and put a photo of me. A real one. I deleted my bio and just wrote: loser. I suppose it felt like a penance for my earlier lie.

Mom had gone out. I cleaned the kitchen, washed the empties, then got ready for school.

&#x200B;

It was two days later I got another request, accompanied by a message. The profile had no picture, just a grass and a distant pond.

”Hey,” it said. “My name’s Flitt. I saw your profile. I’m not much of a dater but maybe we could meet up and talk?“

I didn’t reply. Instead I clicked her profile, but there was nothing written. Odd, even for this strange app.

”What do you say?” came another message from the same account.

A sweat dampened my neck. I typed very slowly, fingers tremulous. “Okay. I guess. Where?”

The doorbell rang. My heart scrunched up like a fist was squeezing it.

Mom was out. I looked at the phone. The door. What could I do?

I took a deep breath and pulled the door open..

There was nothing on the doorstep. No one. Maybe someone from school was prancing me, standing behind a tree and laughing.

”Wait,” came a voice. “Please.”

A burst of wind whirled dirt up around my legs.

“Hello?” I said. “Where are you?”

”Here.” The voice came from behind me now. Inside my house. I turned but… *nothing*.

”It’s okay,” said the voice, both soft and warm. “There’s nothing to see. I don’t have a body like the way you do. Now come sit down with me! It is a date, after all.”

This couldn’t be real. I was having another episode. My breathing was rapid as I took a seat on the sofa. “I’m not sitting on you, am I?” I asked between gasps.

The voice giggled.

”What are you?”

”Same as you.”

I thought about that. Did she mean invisible? Many times I wished I was invisible — it would have saved me a lot of pain, especially at school.

”We’re not the same.“ I tapped my chest. “See? I have a body.”

”Don’t rub it in! Listen, I read your profile and I thought you could do with a friend.”

My head bowed. It sounded pathetic to hear. And I knew she’d read all of it. She knew as well as I did that I was a loser.

“I think I wrote it as a confession,” I said.

”I like honesty. I think honesty is important. Honesty is the step forward not the step back.”

”Who are you?”

Silence for a moment. ”I’m the Goddess of the lost.”

”Of the lost?”

“Right.”

”I’ve never heard of you. But you do look pretty lost,” I admitted. “You’ve not got a body. That’s got to be pretty lost.”

The air in the room warmed, just slightly.

”You’ve got it wrong,” she said. “I’m not the one who is lost. Just because you can’t see something doesn’t mean it’s lost.”

”Oh, so you think I’m lost?”

”I think it was good I came, that’s all. I’m glad you reached out.”

Is that what I did? Reached out? Was this some kind of cry for help?

“I’m not lost,” I said, simply.

”You have to know you’re lost before I can help you be found. That’s how it works. I wish it was easier than that, but there you go.”

”I’m not lost,” I repeated. I was breathing hard now. Angry. Who was she to call me lost, this ghost without even a body?

”You pretend he’ll be coming back. That he’ll rescue you from this.“

I stood up. Looked around the room, fists balled up. “What do you know about it! Huh?”

”I’m sorry it hurts so much. But if you keep running from that fire you’ll never reach the water that will put it out. You’ll always be lost.”

“Fuck you!” I said. Tears streamed down my cheeks. “Fuck you.”

”You tell yourself your mom drinks because he ran off. But you know, really, that she’s as depressed as you. But she has to handle it in her own way.”

The anger leaked out of me, replaced by a heavy, hot grief I hadn’t ever felt before. I sank onto the sofa, palms to my damp eyes.

”I’m sorry this hurts so badly,” said the voice.

We were silent for a long time. I thought about Mom. About my own lies to keep up this shield of denial. I thought about how I fuelled her drink as much as anything else did. How I’d always be on my phone, or pretend to be, to ignore her. How I made myself believe he was alive.

”I just miss him,” I said.

”I know.”

A warm breeze ran through the room, through the open window. Dandelion seeds danced in on the current. One seed gently rubbed against my face then fell to my lap.

”Are you okay?” she asked.

It took me a long time to answer. When I finally did, I raised my head and said, ”I’m very sad. I’m very sad and I”m very angry and I’m very, very lost.”

”I know,” she said, this time more gently, more comforting. The warm breeze from the window wrapped around me. “But I’m not going anywhere until you’re found.”

Another long silence, although not uncomfortable. A spring day laying on a blanket together kind of silence.

“I don’t know what it is that closes and opens,” she said.

A smile flickered on my lips. “It was his favorite poem. That’s what Mom says.”

I felt the breeze rush against my chest. Against my lips, my face.

The spring air whirled around me as I breathed.
