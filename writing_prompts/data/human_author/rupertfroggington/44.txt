I met her at a fashion event downtown on a Tuesday evening. By Wednesday she was dead.

It was a soirée with fizzing drinks and an old fashioned bass being plucked note by note on a spot-lit stage. The kind of deep sound that reverberated in the cavernous chamber of your heart, if you cared to listen. A tall woman in an orange dress stood next to the bassist, crooning out jazz numbers, puffing them into the microphone like delicate smoke rings.

The people below her mingled and exchanged faux-laughs, shared their labels’ up-coming projects, swapped numbers, played the game of ’make-a-connection‘ like they were switchboard operators routing calls.

Everyone was playing the game, except for me. I was there in a journalist capacity, and thirty minutes into the event I’d made enough notes to almost satisfy my editor at the local newspaper. I’d been the technology correspondent for the previous three years, but people had gotten tired of technology running their existence, had rebelled against the fake life it placed them into. Technology, people realised, can’t fix problems of the mind. So readers wanted something real again and I’d been redirected, made to cover events like this. But I figured thirty minutes was already enough of my time wasted.

I stood beneath the stage, the only spectator not mingling, instead caressing a glass of champagne and staring up at the lady in the orange dress.

She looked at me, too, as she sang Billie Holiday’s ”Solitude”.

On her break, we drank together. I said I was a music reporter and could do great things for her.

She said: You’re lying.

I tapped the champagne glass in my hand: You got me, I only play the flute. Tell me, how did you know?

She said: You opened your mouth.

Do I look like that kind of guy?

You don’t not look like that kind of guy.

Champagne? I asked.

She said: You know, it’s the imperfections in the glass that make the champagne fizz.

I said: If that’s the case, imagine how much a perpetual liar like me could make something as pure as you sparkle.

I watched the second half of the performance in a trance. The crowd had gathered now, finally relaxing, their exchange of business cards complete. They probably each came with a hundred cards of their own, left with a hundred different. Traded part of their identities, I thought.

&#x200B;

We went to my place when it was all over. We drank cocktails and listened to a needle run its finger across old records. Then we went to the bedroom and showed each other our own delicate imperfections and made each other sparkle.

After, we talked about love and life and futures.

She told me about she’d been in a relationship with the bassist for a long while. But he’d cheated on her with a prostitute, confessed out of guilt, and that had been that. He might as well have snuffed out a candle.

You kept playing together after that? I asked.

He’s a great bassist, she said.

I couldn’t argue. The guy could play.

I told her about my ex, god knows why, but it poured out of me — it was like my heart was a balloon filled with water and the story about the bassist had pricked it. Or else maybe I just felt I owed her a truth.

I told her how my ex left one day when I was at the office.

She got the kids?

Yeah, I said. She got the kids — except every other weekend.

She placed a palm against my chest. Her heart beat through her hand and into my being. Or perhaps my heart beat into her. All I remember thinking is it felt like we shared a heart. The pain that always lay in mine spilt into her, and maybe hers into me, and we felt a little better through this communion.

She fell asleep on my chest as I stroked her hair.

In the morning, I didn’t wake her. I slipped out of bed and washed in the bathroom sink. The steam rose and veiled the sink’s mirror — fogged it like my memory of the party. I scrawled a note out with my index finger: *do this again tonight?*

Satisfied, I headed to work, my head filled with fumes from last night’s oil, my notebook too light to impress my boss.

She was woken by the doorbell. I put that much together afterwards.

She woke, saw I was missing, figured I’d gone out to get breakfast. At least that’s my guess. She answered the door and: *bang*.

The guy was never caught. They even had his footprints — her blood had been stepped all over my place as he searched the medicine cabinets and drawers and didn’t find what he wanted.

Doesn’t matter how hard you scrub blood like that, it never truly comes off.

&#x200B;

I left the paper and spiralled into something deeper than depression. I could barely move. I could only function when I had those old records playing and imagined she was there singing. Solitude, I kept thinking. I kept wondering how solitude is different to loneliness, and how you get from one to the other.

The idea for a time machine came from watching the records spin, from the needle lowering and raising, from simply imagining the grooves being played in reverse.

Ideas, of course, come easily. The machine took a decade of my life.

&#x200B;

The record spins backwards. We’re at the morning of her death.

I’d returned to that gloomy day where the early sun just couldn’t break through the low hanging clouds.

I sat in a bush outside my house and waited an hour for my younger self — the one who thought he carried all the pain of the world in his chest but really had no idea what pain was — to leave the house for work.

After that, I waited some more. Knife firm and reassuring in my head.

Thirty minutes later, a twitchy young guy comes up to the door. Sniffs. Was about to ring the bell when I stepped out and ask him for a lighter.

I don’t got one, he said, but by then I’m near him.

He looked at me, more surprised than suspicious.

I plunged the knife into his leg and twisted.  I’m not a killer and never plan to be, but part of me, as I watched him bleed, sprawled out on the step, imagined opening up his chest.

I went into the house and called an ambulance.

I didn’t hear the woman get up. I didn’t hear her gasp as she saw the man on the step. Didn’t see her until she was staring right at me, the bloody knife in my hand dripping onto the carpet.

I’ve saved you, I wanted to say. It’s okay now.

But it’s not okay.

Something gives in her heart. Maybe it’s seeing this older version of me, or maybe it’s just seeing the knife. She doesn’t clutch her chest but falls straight down and never gets up again.

I’m sorry, I say, kneeling at her side, I’m so sorry.

The ambulance was already on its way but, too late.

There was no saving her. There’s no changing our reality, as much as we might want to.

We were two ships passing in the night, and that’s all we ever could be. It had been written in some greater tapestry than I could comprehend.

&#x200B;

Later, when I returned to my present, I lay in bed thinking about the last ten years. Of how I’d held this bitterness in my chest, this bile, this venom. And instead of trying to accept the pain or to slowly flush it out of me, I tried to stop the pain ever arriving. Instead of moving forward, I moved back.

What a waste, I thought. What a waste of us both.

&#x200B;

The next morning I got up as lonely as ever. I went to the bathroom and showered.

The mirror above the sink was fully fogged up by the time I stepped out — or almost fully fogged. The delicate note written in it was so faint, it seemed to me like it came from another reality. A whisper that had slipped in through the cracks.

”Had a great night. Love you.”

It was the only time a note like that appeared on my mirror. I checked for weeks for another, for anything, but the mirror only ever contained that one note.

Here’s what I think happened: the wires, those communications between ourselves, between realities, they got crossed when I travelled through time. The operator put the wrong people in touch, just for a moment. Just for a morning.

I’d saved her, but not *my* her. I’d saved another her — or I’d split my universe into another branch of reality where she lived.

And every day, in that universe — or so I let myself believe — we exchange mirror-messages before we leave for work. And we always end them in: Love you.

That night, after the message, as I imagined this truth for the first time, things seemed just slightly different.

It was the difference between lonliness and solitude.
