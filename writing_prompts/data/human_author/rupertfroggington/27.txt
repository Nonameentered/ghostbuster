Birthdays seem rare when you’re a kid. When you bump into someone who shares a birthday with you it seems rare as an elephant getting struck by lightning. Well, maybe that example betrays my age a little. Rare as a computer game that doesn’t try to steal your money with micro transactions.

Point is, you put just sixty people in a room together and it’s as likely as a hot day in Austin that someone shares a birthday with someone else. I share mine with about eight hundred thousand people in my country alone.

Now you have to understand, none of this crossed my mind when I started it all. I was twenty-one back then, dirt poor but degree rich (as of a week prior), and looking for a way to celebrate my birthday on twenty dollars.

If I’d had friends, maybe I wouldn’t have gotten the fliers printed. But I didn’t. I had little money, fewer friends, and thus no one to celebrate with.

It couldn’t just be me though — I couldn’t be the only socially awkward person in a new city looking to celebrate. And, it occurred to me, I couldn’t be the only person in the city celebrating a birthday tomorrow.

The fliers said something like: *Is your birthday on X date? Bored of traditional celebrations or lacking people to celebrate with? Then why not join me for the start of something special? Bring a few dollars and an open mind and we’ll pool our pennies for a grand celebration.*

The fliers might not have done much on their own, but people found them and photoed them and stuck them on a bunch of sites. All in all, a hundred plus people turned up to that first event. All of us shared a birthday. And I think the key was: all of us were looking to be part of something bigger than any of us.

I didn’t have anything planned for that first event — I really hadn’t been expecting much. We pooled our money and rented out a bar, ate good food, got well drunk, and sang bad kareoke. Great time in the end, I thought.

Next day, hangover rattling hard in my skull, I get a call from a shared-birthday member I met the night before. He says: it’s my little sister’s seventeenth in a week. She’s had a rough time lately, been bullied pretty badly at school. Can you do anything like you did for us?

What can I say? I get a little more info and find out her prom’s coming up. So I start to organise a little something. New fliers, new location. People who shared her birthday all want to join in for a counter-prom party. And for a while that’s the plan. Until that guy — the one everyone likes, including the girl we’re trying to help — from One Direction sees one of the posts online. Guess who he shares a birthday with? Guess who ends up going to the prom with this girl?  You don’t need to guess who, after the prom, played for everyone else who shared her birthday and had come to support her.

That’s how things really took off. That’s how I started organising an event for every birthday. Putting people with no friends, no family, maybe no connections to society at that time, in touch with each other. Just this little link to life changed people’s perceptions about living. Non-conditional friendship — not forced into making friendship groups but invited. Wanted. And you didn’t need to have money to come to an event, people just donated what they could.

Eventually the purpose of the parties began to change, people bored or upset at the extravagance it had become. So instead of a hundred-thousand dollars being spent on a lavish event, maybe half of it would go to a charity. Maybe help cancer victims, maybe help animals. It was up to that event.

Over time the parties got a little less lavish — although people never stopped showing up at the events up and down the country — and the donations grew larger.

And the events spread globally. You know over the world you share your birthday with about twenty million people? Now sure, they’re not all as fortunate as one another — but when the eighteen million who are doing a little better start to help the two million who aren’t, well, things begin to change. Gradually. A little. For the whole world, I mean.

We’re all family. All children. All related, however distantly. When we remind ourselves how we share something so basic, so important to the childlike-joy of our mind, it connects us. Reminds us it’s not about the differences we have but the basic and human similarities we share.

I guess finally all there is to say is that if it’s your birthday today, well, happy birthday.
