It's strange what thoughts return to you as you're dying -- what shallow-graved memories crack through their caskets and creep out into your conscious.

Around me, my fellow villagers groan and cry out and beg for help. We're a makeshift wall of the crucified. Of the defeated. Our feet and hands are nailed into wooden crosses all around the village perimeter. We bleed onto the charred remains of our old wall -- the wall that did us little good against the necromancer and his undead legion. Our blood dribbles onto smouldering wood, then sizzles and returns to us as a perverse smell, as hunger.

It's been two days. Of course we're hungry. Starving. When you're this hungry you see and hear and smell whatever you want to be true.

When one of us dies, a skeleton or a zombie will come to our body and remove our corpse, will take it to the necromancer. The dead will return soon after. Or at least, their body will. Their mind is something else. Rotten, darkened, obedient to their new master.

The evening sets on the hill beyond. I can do nothing but watch it happen. This is my view until I die. I watch the smear of orange bleed into the purple sky, and try not to hear the screams around me; try not to see the flash of fire in my periphery as another friend is brought back as a demon. No, I stare at the hill, at the sky.

I stare.

There is a windmill on the hill's peak. My uncle's old mill. Its blades fail to turn, the night air too still, the insides too ancient. But I remember them in motion and if I close my eyes I see them blurring, churning up the sky behind them.

I worked at the mill for three summers as a child, feeding grain into those grinding gnashing stone teeth. Flour would smoke around me and I would always leave dressed in ghostly, powdery white.

&#x200B;

I imagine myself covering my ears. I pretend the screams around me are muted. Tell myself: this is better, this is peace. But your mind knows a lie better than your tongue.

It was a lie I saw one evening after working at the mill. That was why I buried it in a casket for so long. My parents chastised me for spinning yarns, and my siblings mocked me. They called me Gob, after the incident. It stuck with me for too long.

Gob was what the goblin I found called itself -- not that I really did find it, it was just my imagination. But still, I remember it crying: Gob. Gob. Gob!

I was dressed in my afterwork whites, even my face powdered like the Queen of Exolria. The evening was much like tonight, the sky a handshake of indigo and orange, the breeze just gentle enough to rustle my hair. I was tired, that much I admitted even to my parents. And maybe I did see things. But it was the fatigue that drew me away from the village after my shift, towards the coast. If I went home, I would have had to help with my baby nephews, watching and feeding them while our parents got drunk on bad ale. No, I'd worked hard enough and deserved a break.

The peninsula has few beaches but plenty of rocky coastal points. I walked a good mile further than usual until the din of the village was lost fully to the hush of the ocean. Then I clambered down boulders, nearing the ocean. Could feel the salt-cold spatter my neck and the floury globs of water trickle down my back.

"Gob," came the pathetic sound. "Gob."

It was sound of water rising out of a blowhole beneath ground. A wet swallow of a sound.

"Gob."

Curious, I searched for the source of the odd noise, expecting to find the entrance to a tiny, flooded cave, or something of its ilk.

Instead, I came upon the tiny goblin (no, I didn't, it wasn't real! Remember?) trapped between two boulders. A goblin, mottled cream and green and the size of my two palms places together. "Gob!" it cried, urgently now.

To start with I was scared. I recognised it as a goblin, of course. I'd heard plenty of stories about these fantastical, made-up creatures. And although its ears were smaller than I'd imagined, and its skin less slimy, it was clear as day a goblin.

My fear of it subsided as I realised it was caught. Another emotion took over. Similar to when I watched my nephews.

The tide was yawning in. Stretching its watery jaw up the cliff towards us.

&#x200B;

The screams are maddening. I don't know who exactly cries in this choir of disappear -- a sister, a cousin -- but I know everyone in the village. I'm sure my cheeks would be soaked if I had any water left in me with which to cry.

Bones clatter as a skeleton guard walks past. It looks up at me as it passes. It wears a clump of rotted meat around the left part of its mouth, upturned only there into a smile. *Soon*, the smile seems to say. *Soon*. Then it walks by.

I stare at the windmill. Stare. Force myself into my memories. Watch as the blades slowly turn.

I tried to pry the goblin out with a stick, to start with. Not out of cruelty but fear. But it was wedged in too tight and in the end, as water licked my boots, I put my hands behind it and yanked it out. I held the tiny creature to my chest and clambered up to safer ground.

I still remember its starving tongue tickling my face as it licked the flour off me. The memory of my laughter fights the sounds of those dying in my present.

"Gob."

It sniffed the air. Looked one direction then another, before settling its eyes on the first path. So that was the way we walked.

&#x200B;

The blades of the mill... They are turning in my imagination.

No...

They are turning in truth.

They really are turning.

But the wind is almost still. And they are moving so fast...

The mill has been decommissioned for the better part of the last decade. The mechanism too rusted to move, surely.

And yet the blades whirl against the night.

Has the necromancer repaired it? Does his army need sustenance?

&#x200B;

I remember little of the cave and the eyes inside it. A hundred fires emblazoning that liquid darkness. But I do remember the one goblin, the mother, rushing out, unafraid of me. Of holding her hands to mine. Taking the child. I remember the sound of her crying.

I'd never heard in any story of a goblin cry. And it was a happy sound.

&#x200B;

The windmill slowly falls over. The blade lowering, pushing forward at an impossible angle. The entire structure tilting until it lies on the ground.

I am deteriorating. Dying. That is it. I can hear my father's voice yelling at me to stop with the lies. Can feel the roughness of his palm against my cheek.

The lies.

And yet, the screams around me have paused.

More eyes have found the strange scene of this changing windmill that now looks like a javelin with a whirling front.

The skeletons march beyond us, as do the zombies. They stop a little way forward and stare at the strange windmill, then at each other, confused as I am.

"What is it--" says the necromancer, joining his army.

And then a roar as the windmill races off its perch on the hill. As the giant spinning javelin flies towards our ruined village.

If I could move, I would be too stunned to. Just like the necromancer. Just like his undead legions.

The weapon -- for surely that is what it is -- screams down the hill. It screams of death. It screams of oblivion.

The blades are not those I remember. They are reinforced by sharp-pronged metal. They spin in a blur of red as they chop through the dead, as they mince the necromancer and fly through the army and over the smouldering wall. And as it passes, I see a hundred, a thousand, burning eyes, just like the day in the cave.

I hear screams of triumph.

I hear the hiss of hydraulics as this transformed structure screeches to a halt somewhere behind me.

I hear the one sound that I was never allowed to believe as real.

"*Gob*."
