Hard to choose one piece of advice! But: share your writing with people who will give you honest feedback. Ideally make friends with other writers and regularly exchange crit. It’ll help a lot — they’ll point out all kinds of mistakes that are in your blind spot and help you understand them. And you giving them crit will help you understand stories better.
