Teresa moved the cabinet away from the wall and spotted four red dots marking the cream paint. Her patient had just left — a man who repelled insects as if they were one end of a magnet and he was the other. Sadly for insects on the floor or walls, he was the stronger force and they’d be popped like spots when he neared them.

She sprayed a cloth, wiped, then returned the cabinet to its place.

He was an interesting man, this insect repelling client. A man who was almost a superhero but wasn’t. His ability wasn’t useful enough use to join a league, or even form a second-rate duo. And by himself… well, not all superpowers created superheroes.

Three weeks ago he’d come in and announced he was getting married.

“Great news, all my problems are over, doc. I don’t think we’ll need to keep doing this.”

”Oh?” Teresa had said, ushering him into a chair. “Well that’s good news indeed.”

”No, not good news. It’s great news! I’m getting married, you see.” He laughed and shook his head. “Married.”

She raised her brows. Teresa didn’t even know he’d been dating. As his therapist she ought to have known. “Congratulations. I’m very happy for you.” And she was. She very much liked this client. Teresa had been a therapist since university — she’d never known any other profession. Her mother had been a therapist too and she’d simply followed the breadcrumbs through the forest. Teresa had slipped into the profession as easily as one steps into a winter coat when cold weather comes. And in all the time she’d been doing this, she thought this man was likely her very favourite client.

“Thanks!” he said, beaming. “It’s been a hell of a thing. A real whirlwind affair. Could be a Hollywood movie. But truth being truth, we’ve known each other since school! Back then we saw each other for a while, casually, you know? So it’s less of a new a thing and more of a resumption of what should have always been, I guess. Sorry, I’m blathering.”

”Blather away. That’s what I’m here for.”

“We’re getting married in a month. Just getting the finances sorted. Hell, I couldn’t be happier.”

She looked at him a while, waited for him to talk, but his eyes were staring blankly at the ceiling.

”How did your trial with the Cleanup League go?” she asked, changing the subject. Her client tried for positions in different superhero factions most weeks. Part of the therapy, at least initially, had been to help him cope with the rejection.

”Forget about that. I didn’t go. I’m not interested in that anymore. My wife-to-be has got me a better paying job lined up with her father. Going to be a mechanic — I’ve always loved engines and this suits me fine. It’s something for me to get absorbed in. More hours sure, but it’s better pay than my current work.”

”So all in all, you’d say you’re happy?”

He looked away from the ceiling, held her gaze like a dare, then smiled. “Never been more so.”

That had all been weeks ago.

Today’s session had gone unexpectedly.

Her client had barged through the door and slumped down on the seat opposite her.

”I think I’m going nuts, doc.”

He’d been sweating, face shiny in the bright lights of her office. She offered him water and he glugged it down in one go.

”Tell me what happened,” she said.

And so he told her.

Earlier that day he’d gone to the bank. Him and his fiancée were buying a house together. Plans for the wedding had been downsized. Not exactly what either of them wanted but she was pregnant now — they’d just found out. A glamorous wedding was out of the question. They had to be realistic.

“We needed somewhere to live and we found it — somewhere we wanted to put an offer on. Modest place but a good start. For that though, we needed a mortgage. I should have sorted it all out before we started looking, but everything’s been a rush. Anyway, I’d been working as a cleaner for the best part of a decade and my credit’s good enough for what we needed. For a big enough mortgage for my part.“

He paused for a while and stared past Teresa, as if looking at the scene again.

”The banker,” he said, “looked like a nice enough older guy. Kind of like my dad, or at least how I remember him. Not much hair, no wrinkles. We chatted for a bit as we sorted through everything, but as we did I began to get this uneasy feeling. It was like an iceberg was floating through by body and everywhere it went it turned cold as the arctic. Then I could feel it bobbing through my chest, the tide pulling it inexorably towards my heart. I knew — just knew — something bad was about to happen.“

”And did it?” Teresa asked. “Did something bad happen?”

He nodded. “We were all but done. He leaned forward to shake my hand. I went to take it but… I couldn’t. I couldn’t shake it. It was exactly like how it is with the insects. More powerful, even. My hand trembled as I tried to push through this thick, impossible air towards his. Then I looked at him, at his eyes, and I saw everything in the world that could scare a person, all there in those green pupils. That’s when my heart and the iceberg collided.”

He paused a moment. Drank another glass of water.

”I pushed my chair back and I ran. I knew afterwards the banker was some kind of insect hybrid. It’s obvious enough. But there, in the room, I just knew fear. See, usually I push insects away from me. I’m the stronger one! But not in that room. It was my hand that couldn’t reach his.”

“It’s okay,” said Teresa.

”Thing is, I told superheroes about this banker. I told the police. They interviewed him and nope, he was just…”

He placed his hands to his face and began to shake. “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry about this.”

”It’s okay.”

Teresa considered for a while. She should have seen it coming of course, and the failure was on her. Of this man with thinning hair who’d given up on his dreams. A man whose outstretched hand had been a key about to turn in what he saw as a padlock, but he hadn’t had the strength to twist.

”Do you wake up often during the nights?” she asked.

He lowered his hands. “All the time. For the last few weeks, all the damned time. I wake up but I’m not woken by any sound.”

“How do you feel in those moments?

He lowered his voice. “It’s like the whole world is asleep except for me. Asleep or dead. And in the silence I can hear the ground beneath me opening up like a mouth, and if I look down at the darkness I think I’ll fall into it. So I shut my eyes tight but I don’t sleep again until sunrise.“

Teresa had never seen him cry before. Maybe someday she’d look back and think the moment was a breakthrough. Then however, she’d just wanted to get up and hug him. To be the rock that his heart could tie itself to. She wanted to tell him how rich he was for starting a family — not that she had her own to compare it to, but she felt that was a truth all the same.

She restrained herself and wore her professional mask. Talked about how youthful dreams aren’t always realized. It’s painful but it’s life and it’ll be okay. And as we step away from them, as we look into a different future, we can find new dreams and hopes and reasons. And that, if you allow them to shine like you did your old dreams, they can be more powerful than any youthful hope. She told him the real superheroes, the real superpowers, are made, not born.

He’d been gone now for a couple of hours.

He’d been in better spirits when he’d left. Said he’d try again for a mortgage tomorrow.

She’d wished him well and they’d talk next week.

All that was left now was for Teresa to clean the insects staining the walls, and to consider what she wanted to do with her own life.
