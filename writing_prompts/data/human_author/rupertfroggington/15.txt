The boy doesn’t even mean to summon an angel. He’s bored — he lives in his aunt’s creaking Victorian house and spends these winter days mostly indoors. There’s no internet. Or rather, there is but it’s off limits to him. His aunt encourages reading in the little library she’s put together instead.

“Better for you to read material that appeals to your brain than watch videos that appeal to your short attention span.”

So, in a way, she’s to blame for what happens because the boy found the book on portals in the library. Boredom had beaten him into reading so he’d approached the most exciting shelves. The shelves filled with scientific ideas so old they were cross-polluted with religion.

The boy is called Paul and the ideas in this musty, dusty old book, filled with diagrams and annotated by pencil (who read it before him?) greatly appeal. They talk of portals to the beyond as tunnels that must be constructed to reach either up or down. Like an old telephone line, the boy thinks, although this book was written long before a telephone ever rang.

A circle on the floor to communicate with those below, a circle on the ceiling to reach those above. The book’s extra annotations sketch more details into the circles, turning them into intricate pentagram-type constructs, like tattoos on a singer in a metal band. Someone, an ancient relative of his, presumably, has already attempted this. They have added to the original writer’s recipe.

His aunt is out today. It is just the boy. He’s barely a teenager and struggles with the ladder — it’s three flights of stairs to the attic, after all. But his aunt never enters the attic (too many memories to bother with, she says) so he believes this a safe location for his graffiti.

He positions the ladder in the center of the room and climbs. The roof is heavily slanted and he almost hits his head; he worries this won’t work as well as he planned with a slanted roof. But it’s the only room he won’t get in trouble for desecrating. He has no chalk so uses a fat-tipped marker pen. Balancing on the ladder, book in one hand, pen in the other, he sketches the pentagram. His hand is shaky and his body is stressed by the act of balance. Around him slump suitcases and jewellery and colourful fancy costumes that his aunt — in another life, it seems to him — must have once worn.

Finished, he climbs down the ladder and positions it out of the way against a wall. Then he stares at the circle and prays silently,  his dry tongue clicking each word. He prays his parents really are up there — they were good people so they must be up there.

The wind exhales through the attic. The shutters on the two little windows clatter closed, then they open again. Then, they slam with a gloomy finality.

He’s shivering. The air has become winter. The room, a pit of darkness.

Above, however, the circle begins to shine. It radiates a soft white light, the brightness chasing the outline of the circle like a lit fuse. It sparkles. Like stars. Didn’t they once call the stars the heavens?

He hears a voice and he believes it to be his mother’s. And if not, it’s beautiful enough that it must be an angels. It has worked.

”We’ve been waiting for you,” says the mellifluous voice. “Come.”

It is a siren call. It is his mother, his father, reaching out from beyond. The car crash only stole their mortal forms but he has found their souls. The boy is tearful, shuddering, barely breathing, as the delicate arm reaches out from above.

”We’ve been so patient waiting,” says the voice.

He takes the hand.

”And so very bored.”

Only now, as he feels the unnatural strength, the chill in the long unfamiliar fingers around his hand, does he again think of the slanted roof. How it is neither up nor down.

And as the arm snatches him, drags him towards the portal, he wonders if there could be a third place. A place between the up and down.

Then, he is gone.
