“Kid,” I said, to the sway of shadow in the corner of the room. “Come on. Enough already. Get out here and let me see you.”

This kid — a girl of maybe eleven — stepped out of the shadows like how memories step out of a half-forgotten dream.

An obese man lay on a sofa in the middle of the room, the TV still on, displaying a fizz of black and white static in which you can see just about anything, if you looked hard enough. Popcorn, now cold and hard, spilled out over his beer-belly.

It looked like a heart-attack but in my mind there was a cold and knowing certainty that the kid had killed the man.

”I didn’t,” she said. “I didn’t kill him, I swear.”

”Oh, you can read minds, too? Neat trick.”

I shrugged off my backpack and took out a pipette. This part always reminded me of school, of science class, way back when. Before I’d become this semi-god of the damned.

”Sometimes,” she said. “Only some minds, though. When they let me.” Her hair was grease and knots and she looked down at her bare feet as if inpecting her toenails. Her parents weren’t doing such a bang-up job with her.

I pried open the dead man’s mouth until he looked like a pale fish, then tucked the pipette most the way down his throat. When I squeezed, his eyes opened for a second and I watched the last light inside them fade as his spirit drained into my implement.

“Why have you been killing them?” I asked, now dripping the soul bit by bit into a glass flask. “I’ve seen you, you know? Always there these days, in some shadow or doorway thinking I can’t see you, but maybe not knowing just how good my eyesight has become since my death. I see everything these days.” I popped a cork onto the flask then packed it away in my bag. “So?” I said. “Why you been doing it?”

“To… To see you. I just wanted to see you.”

“Me? Why‘d you want to see me?” Truth was, plenty of people wanted to see death. For an adult I was something like Santa or the toothfairy. When you grow up you think you leave fantasy behind, you say make-believe is for kids, then you start wondering what’s waiting for you once it’s all said and done. Hell, adults believe in fantasy every bit as much as the kids they mock for it.

But the difference here was her age. Kids her age didn’t want to see death. They shouldn’t even be thinking about it. And to kill — that’s the cheese for the mouse trap she’s using for me?

Unreal.

But maybe kind of sweet.

She shrugged. Tapped her foot and stared at it harder as if willing it to walk, to take her out of this room. She glanced up once, twice to catch my eye.

Her eyes were field-green. Mine brown. But something about them, about her eyes, reminded me of my own. Maybe there were flakes of nutmeg in them.

”Pretty eyes,” I said. “Remind me of something.”

It’d been years since I’d died. Since I’d been alive.

Not everyone gets to make a deal with Death. But for whatever reason — I guess he saw opportunity in my situation — he offered me one.

I should have rested more that day, before I’d driven us. We were going from Texas to California and it didn’t need to be in one go through the night. But that’s what I said it’d be so that’s what it would be.

I didn’t quite fall asleep at the wheel but I did drift a little, and so did the car. And then a truck on the other side roared a horn and hit the edge of the bumper and sent us tumbling. I hear my wife scream, hear our baby wailing. Feel the warmth of blood rush over my face and then the comforting numbness of coming death.

“I can make you a deal,” said the reaper, standing at the shattered driver-side window. “We always make deals, when we’ve had enough.”

”A deal?” My jaw didn’t move but my voice sounded.

He looked with empty eyes at my wife, then at my baby. “They don’t have to die. You can still save them.“

I looked from one to the other, slower than Death had. I looked right at my baby’s green eyes.

Those eyes…

”Alana?” I said, staring breathlessly at the barefooted girl.

”I just wanted to see you,” she said.

I collapsed onto the dirty carpet. “Alana.”

She looked at me with those eyes. Opened her mouth as if to say something.

Then she faded. She faded right away. Melted into a shadow again.

Like she’d always been.

It’s not just kids who need to imagine.

”I miss you,” I said, pretending they were her words.

For a long while after, I sat in the room with just the lifeless, soulless body of what had once been a man.

I’d see them again one day. Both of them. And I longed for and dreaded that day far beyond all others.
