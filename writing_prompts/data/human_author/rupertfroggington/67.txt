I like the question. I never provide feedback (as in critique) here because who am I to provide it for someone who hasn’t asked for it? They might just be trying something out, or have rushed a piece because they had 5 mins free, or it’s their first story, etc. And I think if you can’t give feedback in a way that’s helpful to someone’s level/goals then your feedback might be detrimental.  Saying that, I think feedback is vital for any writer (new or not), so writers, dive into a feedback/critique group as soon as you can.
