Toru stood at the top of the ancient lighthouse, hands firm on the rail, and stared out into the inky black sea. Once upon a time — long before Toru’s time — this place had safely guided lost ships past jagged rocks. Now the light was gone. It had been for a long time. The gusty air stunk of dead fish and salt. The moon looked like a silver razor blade hanging high above him, a blade that at any moment might fall. Like the sword of Damocle, thought Toru.

If only it would fall, he thought.

The door behind him creaked open. A young woman in a pink hoody and black jeans stepped out of the room and into the wind.

”Hey,” she said, standing next to him. “Shit, it’s cold out here.” She took out a box of Hope cigarettes and offered one to Toru.

“I don’t smoke anymore,” he said.

“Oh yeah, I forgot. Swapped one bad habit for another, huh?”

He didn’t reply.

She shrugged and lit a match, cupping the flame in her hand so the breeze didn’t steal it.  She took a long drag, then blew the smoke out over the side of the lighthouse; it drifted along like a reluctant spirit.

”I heard you had a reporter killed,” said the woman.

”I could do with a drink,” he said.

”I bet you could do with a whole bottle. You look like you’re falling apart. You look like shit.”

”I’m not the guy I was, that’s for certain. Not these days.”

”Who is the same person they once were, right? Everyday we change. We wake up thinking we’re the same person and it’s a new day, but the truth is we’re a slightly different person. But that’s good, I think. It means each day really is different. Internally and externally.”

They stood silent as she smoked. They watched waves crash onto the rocks below, the water splitting them in two, then the tide inhaling the broken waves and the ocean healing them once more. If only it were so easy, thought Toru.

”So that reporter?” she said, lighting another smoke.

”She figured things out,” said Toru. “That I’ve been doing some messed up shit.” He looked at the woman, caught her eyes. “She figured out who was running this whole business. And worst of all, she figured out who I used to be.”

“What a mess,” said the woman.

”That’s one way of putting it. How did it get this far?”

The lighthouse had been Toru’s hideout as a superhero, many years prior. The woman, once a superhero too, had formed a team with him, almost a decade ago. They’d become a duo and used this as their base of operations.

Now the lighthouse had turned into a mafia base where Toru gave his orders for extortion and murder and torture.

“It’d seemed the only way,” said Toru.

“Huh? You mean all this?”

”Yeah. This. Being a hero wasn’t enough. I needed an army to even the playing field.“

”Well, you did that. You’re still doing that.” The woman turned to him. ”I don’t think there’s any room for more crime with you around. You’ve got a monopoly on it now.”

He nodded, his cheeks red. ”It got out of hand fast. That’s all. To start with, we really were stopping crime. My people took down the most dangerous thugs and lowlifes in the city. But we were on a knife-blade even then, we just didn’t know it. And when we killed the first innocent person…”

”Easy to justify,” she said. “You were doing so much good and these people who got in your way, they would have stopped it all. Right? Might have gone to the press.”

He nodded again. “It’s so tangled now. Right and wrong. Good and bad. It’s become a Gordian knot and I don’t know how to undo it. And even if I could undo it, I don’t know which end of the thread had once been good and which had been bad.”

They were silent again. Not watching the waves but each other.

Toru thought of when they’d first met. He’d been playing baseball — no one could swing a bat like him. The power he got in his swing was unbelievable. He could have taken a head off with a swing — and later he did so, on multiple occasions. But back then, he’d loved the game itself. Swinging and hitting and releasing all the frustrated power that had built up inside him.

No one had ever caught a ball he’d connected with. No one ever tried. The ball might have torn a tunnel through their hands and guts.

He’d played with machines, to be safe. He’d aim the ball towards the sea.

Then one day, this woman had caught a ball he’d hit. She’d been watching him practice. He’d hit, she’d suddenly burst into a run. She’d become a smudge of paint as she’d run. An echo of colors. So fast…

She’d caught it with ease. Had run two miles and been waiting for it to descend. Then she’d run back to him. “Out!”

&#x200B;

They’d started off stopping small crimes together. He’d been doing it for a while already — roaming alleys late at night. Now they tried together, him with a baseball bat, her barefoot (she burned through shoes almost instantly when she ran). One weekend they’d created each other’s costumes. He’d given her a cloak with a falcon on it; she’d given him a mask that looked like a baseball glove. They weren’t very good at designing costumes but they both loved what they’d been given.

And that love grew. Consumed them both. They became closer than a duo. Almost like a single entity, like they shared a heart.

&#x200B;

“I miss what we were,” he said. “I’d give it all to go back to it.”

She let out another puff of smoke. “Life takes us forward and we must go forward with it.”

“I went too far forward.“

She shrugged. “Then give yourself in. Or, here’s a crazy idea, instead of giving in, make a difference. Use your gifts the right way.“

A breeze took the smoke as it left her mouth, drifted it back over her like a cloak.

&#x200B;

It had been a fluke bullet that had killed her. Aimed at someone else but she’d sped into it.

It had been an attempted gangland killing. One of many that day. No matter how many streets they patrolled together, the two of them couldn’t stop crime altogether.

In a way, it’d been his heart destroyed too. But it was only her physically dead.

He’d spent a year in the lighthouse after that. What was the point trying to stop crime, now? He’d lost everything that mattered. Besides, there was no way that he could stop it all — not alone. Ridding the city of crime by himself would have been like trying to empty an ocean with a cup.

&#x200B;

“They’ve taken everything from me,” he said.

”Then you make new things. And you love those things as fiercely as the old, and you protect them as fiercely.“

The breeze took the smoke and drifted it out in the night, beyond the lighthouse. It drifted through rays of moonlight before dispersing into nothing.

”I miss you,” he said. Then, “I love you.”

But of course, he was alone, as he always had been, on the railing at the top of the lighthouse.

He looked out at the sea again. Closed his eyes.

He imagined a tiny boat out there, being battered by the waves, forced towards the rocks. The sailor struggling desperately against the tide and waves and wind. Alone. And in this absolute darkness, as the rain lashed down, how could the sailor see the rocks?

The tide dragged him closer. The sailor swore that if he got out of this he’d first kiss the ground and then he’d find religion. Or spirituality. He’d find a reason for living — because he knew he had one. He knew, right now, that he was terrified of dying, so he had to have a reason, if only he could find it.

Then the lighthouse light flickered, returning to life for the first time in many years. Its wide yellow beam sliced through the blackness of the sea, lighting up the rocks that thrust up like icebergs.

In the light, the sailor thought he could see a route through the rocks. Not an easy route. A slender chance of making it, if any at all. 

But still, it was a chance.
