Eric stood on the stage assessing the audience. They were mostly drunks, but that’s what you got performing in a pub. He made a show of his search for a willing participant, peering around the crowd in circular motions, like a lighthouse shining into a sea of inebriated slobs.

Not that he minded where he performed. He’d long since understood his brand of magic wasn’t going to make it mainstream. And that was okay — who wanted to be mainstream anyway?

“Are there any dads here?” he asked, snapping his gloves further up his arms. “I could do with a little assistance for my next trick from a father.”

A pretty young woman, perhaps eighteen or nineteen, pushed forward an older man she stood next to. “Go on, Dad. Do it for my birthday. Please.”

The man staggered forward, flashing a glare at his daughter.

“Fantastic,” said Eric, clapping the portly man on the back. “Thank you sir, you’ll be perfect for this.“ And to the daughter: “Madam, I am going to make your father disappear.”

”Good luck!“ she said with a smile. “I’ve been trying for twenty years but he keeps coming back.”

The crowd laughed. This was the first time the audience had laughed — even though he’d told at least a dozen decent puns. But that was Eric. Not a greatly skilled magician, not a greatly funny one, either.

“Sir,” he said, gesturing to a tall black box painted with mysterious white swirls (Eric had painted them himself). “Would you step inside?”

The man rolled his eyes at the audience. They laughed again. Of course they’d laugh at that, thought Eric.

”Sir? Please step inside.”

”Dad! Go on.”

”Yeah, yeah, for you, sweetheart. Happy birthday.“ The man stepped into the box. Eric closed the door behind the man, then turned to face the audience.

”When I was a young boy,” said Eric with practiced patter, ”my father went to the shops to pick up a bottle of milk. It was that trauma that set the stage for this very trick. Nay! Trick is the wrong word. This is truly *magic*.”

Someone in the crowd groaned. At least it was a reaction, Eric thought. A reaction to something he’d said. It might not have been laughter but anything made a change.

“I will now make this gentleman vanish before your very eyes, as if he has just popped out for milk.”

He tapped the box twice. The door swung open.

The man was gone.

Eric was about to take a bow when the daughter began screaming.

”Where’s he gone! What have you done with my dad!” She charged up on stage, barrelling past Eric. She was petite but had no trouble knocking him out the way.

”He’s fine,” whispered Eric.

”Dad? Dad!”

”In here,” came a muffled reply. “It’s alright love. I’m not gone anywhere.”

A second door inside the box swung open and the man stepped out.

“Ta-da,” he said and took a bow.

The crowd laughed and clapped. Eric watched on, stunned. His trick had been ruined and the applause stolen.

Such was life for Eric.

“Thank god you’re okay, Dad,” said the girl walking him off-stage. “I really thought you’d gone.”

\*\*\*

Eric packed up his belongings, taking multiple trips to his Volvo outside. It was a real magic trick that he managed to get all his oversized props tucked inside it, aligned in just the perfect way.

He’d performed no further tricks that night. There‘d been no point. He’d stood on the stage with no idea what to say next. The crowd gradually muddled off to the bar.

The manager had walked over to Eric and placed an arm on his shoulder. “I don’t think we’ll be needing you again. But thanks, it was an entertaining one-off.” He paid Eric forty pounds in two twenties.

Eric finished packing and returned to the pub. Might as well have half a pint before he went back to his apartment. Wasn’t like anyone was waiting. And half a pint would at least waste some time

He sat at the bar sipping his drink when a girl sat on the stool next to him. It was the girl who’d ruined his trick.

”Can I get you a drink?” she asked. “You know, to say sorry for what I did.”

He waved a hand. “You don’t need to apologise. I would have probably ruined it if you hadn’t.”

She looked at him a while, biting her tongue.

”Happy birthday, by the way,” he said. “I hope you’ve had a good night.” He raised his glass to her.

”My mum left when I was five,” she said. “She slipped out the house and really didn’t come back. I have slight issues with attachment. Or detachment. One or the other. Sorry.“

”Oh,” said Eric. “But… You pushed your father forward for the trick? You nominated him to vanish.”

She shrugged. “Guess you don’t know how you’re going to cope with something until that something happens. I really didn’t expect to run up on stage. But it was like a cold hand squeezed my heart.”

He sipped his drink. “Thanks for explaining.“

“You’re still wearing your gloves,” she said.

He looked at the long black glove. “Sometimes I take them off for a big trick. But usually not.”

”What’s the big trick?”

”It’s real magic. But…” He sighed, then took off his right glove.

”Oh,” she said.

His hand was badly burned. Red and white and bubbled.

“Fell forward into hot coals when I was a kid. Don’t ask. I stopped myself with my hands and… this is what I got. On the plus side, I can do this.”

Eric clicked his fingers; his hand erupted into flame. “Handy, if you’re a smoker. But as far as big tricks go, it’s not all that impressive. Not compared to some magicians out there. Plus, seeing my hand kind of turns audiences off.”

The girl opened her mouth. Closed it. “That’s… Doesn’t it hurt to have a hand on fire?”

He shook his hand and the flame extinguished. “Don’t feel a thing.”

”In either hand?”

He sipped his drink. “At all. I don’t feel a thing anywhere, ever.”

She stared at his hand as he lifted the glass.

“It’s pretty freaky looking, right?”

”Sorry, no, it’s not that. It’s just…”

”What?”

”Can I hold it?” she asked.

”Uh…” It was a weird request. But it was her birthday, he supposed. And what harm could it do? He held out his hand.

She took it, clasping it in both of hers. She drew a breath and closed her eyes
