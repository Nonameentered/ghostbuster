The border wall stretches to the horizon and towers up towards the clouds. It’s as if God took a blade to a mountain-range, slicing off jutting and uneven peaks, leaving it slick and impossible to surmount. Now the only way into the country beyond is through the hotels.

I sit on a dune a mile away from the barrier and watch other hopeful migrants scutter towards the buildings embedded in the wall. A barefooted mother holds her children’s hands, dragging them towards an uncertain future. By the time they leave the hotel they will no longer be family. Familiarity will have been squeezed out of them and replaced by something more practical.

Perhaps that’s why I left my own children behind. An act of selfishness, not generosity. Perhaps I’m unable to bear the idea of them forgetting me, even if I’ll forget them.

My water bottle has been drained for near a day. My swollen tongue barely moves and tastes only grit. Still, I don’t leave the dune until the afternoon sun flays my shoulders.

\*\*\*

The grandeur of the lobby – the marble floor, fountain, golden chandelier – acts like flypaper to the desperate: you walk inside and it will not let you turn back.

A porter in a striped red uniform approaches me holding a glass of water clinking merrily with ice.

I cry before I even take a sip.

The receptionist talks into a two-sided tablet propped up on her desk. It speaks her words but in my own language, in a voice softer than hers despite being fake.

“Welcome to Hotel 468B. Please state your name and your skillset, if you possess a skillset.”

“Romina,” I say. “Veterinarian.”

The tablet digests my words and twists them into the receptionist’s language. The lady nods and skims a finger over the screen, then taps a manicured nail.

“We have no need for vets in the country, currently,” says the tablet. “You will be reconfigured into a podiatrist. Do you know what a podiatrist is?”

“A foot doctor,” I say.

“Exactly. You’ll be provided with the skills and knowledge needed to become a useful member of society.”

It’s better than expected. I’d imagined factory or sewage work.

“I want to send half of what I earn back home,” I say. “To my family. My girls are with my mother and there’s no work back there. Only the threat of war and…” My voice trails off as I realize I’m rambling to someone who doesn’t care.

“You won’t know your family,” she says through the tablet. “You’ll be giving half your money to strangers, and that won’t make you happy. Are you certain you want to send that much?”

I’m certain. She takes my family’s details and I press my thumb against the screen to confirm.

“There will be ten reconfiguration sessions,” she says. “One per day. Your first will begin shortly. Once it’s over, your room will be ready.” Then, with a nod to the plastic bag in my hand, “Leave that here. It will be discarded. You’ll be provided with new clothes and anything else you’ll need.”

I ask if I can at least keep my phone. I have pictures of my girls on it. The receptionist denies me.

“You’ll find a phone in your room that you can make arrangements from. But,” she adds, “in a few days you’ll have no desire to call anyone from your old life.”

The porter leads me from reception through a wooden door labeled *reconfiguration*. We descend two flights of stairs before a portly man takes my hand. He leads me into a small room with a single seat positioned in front of a mechanical contraption twice my size.“Sit,” the man says in my own language.

He straps my wrists to the seat’s arms. The room falls black as he leaves.The machine whirrs to life, two green lights glowing like reptilian eyes. Metallic tentacles raise into the air, and then, with no warning, strike. Pain erupts as a dozen needles pierce my body. Something cold and hard presses against my forehead.

I remember nothing else until the door opens and the lights come back on. The machine sits still and innocent.

\*\*\*

My room is on the fifty-first floor and overlooks the country that will soon be my home. It's a haven of lakes, well-paved roads, and distant city lights. It’s already difficult to imagine that the opposite side of the building gazes down on desert and death.

I lie on a feather-soft bed that night, cycling over memories of my daughters: of their births, their first days at school, of being cuddled up together watching movies. I’m sweating, fearing I’ve already forgotten something precious about them. How would I know if I had?

I still recall my mother’s number. I call her on the phone next to the bed and she listens as I cry. Hushes and soothes, says what I’m doing was the only option. I hear her sniffing back tears and I remember that she is losing a daughter, too.

Once I recover she fetches my girls and we talk for a long while.

After the call I write down their names, my mother’s number, and I circle everything with a heart.

I look down at my feet. I stare at the bony protrusions next to my big toes. Bunions. Did I even know what bunions were earlier today? I have no idea.

I can’t stop myself from laughing.

\*\*\*

On the fourth day the grandeur of the hotel’s lobby is perverted by blood. I’m on my way to reconfiguration when I come across the scene.

A woman lies on the floor, a security guard above her. It’s the barefoot woman I saw as I sat on the dunes. Her children, a girl and boy, are at her side crying. There is a wide gash in the side of her head and blood is pistoning out.

“What happened?” I ask in a foreign tongue that is becoming more familiar to me daily. I press my robe’s hem against her head.

“I didn’t mean to,” says the guard. “But she tried to steal her children and leave. Then as I grabbed her I guess she fell.”

I can’t blame her for trying. She would have been separated from her kids on the first day, and after that, night by night, as she sat alone in her room, her children would have been forgetting who she was. She would have been forgetting them, too.

I try to remember how to treat a wound. I must have treated a thousand animals over the years and yet details of any incident are thin, as if I can only see them as a sketch.The receptionist is by me now. She has a roll of duct tape in her hand. “It’s all I’ve got. I’ve called the medic but no response.”

“Bandage,” I say, panicked. “We need a bandage.” I tear a strip off my gown and tie it tight around the injured woman’s head. Then I take the duct tape and tie it around the bandage.

I roll onto my back as we wait for the medic, occasionally glancing at the woman, wondering what state her feet are in beneath her sneakers.

When the receptionist whispers, “She’s not breathing,” I get back to my knees and begin CPR.
