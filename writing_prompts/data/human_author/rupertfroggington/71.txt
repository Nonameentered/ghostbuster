The girl was my last call on the Thursday. I’d been driving home that evening after fixing up a golem for an older couple. This couple had purchased a golem and unpacked it just fine, but they hadn’t been able to get it do anything more than stand in the kitchen. It didn’t respond to commands, couldn’t be budged, and was now firmly blocking their dishwasher.  

I do a lot of work for older people who‘ve had a little experience with the occult in their youth, but those green-leafed memories have long since browned, flaked, and breezed off in the wind. They think they’ll be okay setting something up, then an hour later call me. 

I got the golem up and running in thirty minutes. “Try it,” I said. “Any command you like, so long as it doesn’t hurt people. It won’t obey commands that hurt people.”

The old woman asked the golem to carry her husband up the stairs and into their bedroom. He’d been sleeping downstairs for the last month on a camp bed but that wasn’t a long-term solution. It was either get a golem to help with chores now that the husband’s MS was getting worse, or else place the husband into care.

The old woman had giggled like a kid as the golem scooped the old man up as easy as ice cream. Didn’t exactly seem like independence to me, but what do I know about it?

“Thank you so much,“ said the woman, her eyes twinkling with tears. “You don’t know what this means for us.”

“No sweat,” I said, already heading for the door. I’d gotten into the van and was deciding what to pick up for my dinner, when the call came. 

“I’m finished for the night, Louise,” I said into the radio.

”I got no one else in the area,” her voice buzzed back. “Come on, just do me this one tiny favour.”

My whole life seemed to be favours to other people. But I was in an alright mood after fixing up the golem — the old woman’s smile was quite the sight. Besides, I didn’t have much else to do.

”Fine, I’ll deal with it.”

”Knew you would.”

”Yeah, you’re a regular psychic.”

I turned off the radio and tapped the address into the SatNav.

The girl lived the other side of town to me. The wealthy side. Where houses had room to breathe and no one was looking down on your yard. Where the drives were twice the size of my backyard.

The jobs I did here, I didn’t much like. For these people a golem was a play-thing for the kids, not something to bring a smile to wrinkled faces. Familiars were pets for teenagers to abuse, destroy, replace. Like I say, I didn’t much care for the work I carried out in the area.

I pulled into the girl’s driveway. A line of leafless poplars grew either side of the path, like giant fingers sprouting out of the ground, and there I was right in some creature’s palm.

&#x200B;

The girl had brown hair pulled back into a tight ponytail. Usually the kids in this area had their faces so painted up it looked like they’d tripped and landed headfirst in their makeup bags. But this girl wasn’t wearing any. Not even for the bags beneath her eyes.

”Hey,” she said, gesturing me inside. “I’m Lilah.“

”Eddie. So what’s the problem today?” I asked as I walked down the hallway.

A series of gold-framed photos hung on the corridor’s walls. The rugs underfoot were quicksand cushy. You could lie down and never went to get up off them again.

I recognised the girl in one of the frames, although she must have been only ten in the photo and maybe she was sixteen now. A bearded guy, who had the same nose as her, had an arm wrapped around her. The two of them were in a garden.

She led me into a large room that I guessed was the dining room. But the big oak table had been pushed up sideways against a wall, along with a series of upside down chairs. To the side of the table a white throw lay over a bulging pile of goods — the rest of the room’s decorations, I presumed. It had really been emptied out.

In the center of the room, on the wood tile floor was a bundle of small objects. To their side, someone had drawn a chalk outline onto the wood — it looked a little like a pawn from chess, only a pawn the size of my arm. She‘d tried to summon a ghost. She’d drawn the sigil but I guessed she’d had problems after that. I knelt and examined it.

”Did it summon at all?”

She nodded. “Oh yeah. It drifted around a little. I saw it go up through the ceiling, just by the lights there. It popped back a couple of times but it’s not done much else.”

I looked at the pile of objects next to the sketch. A watch, a razor, a set of marbles, a handkerchief, a tie… Weird.

“And it’s still floating around?” I asked.

”I guess.”

I stood up. ”Then I don’t see the problem. It’s haunting the location you summoned it in. What’s the issue? This‘ll scare your friends just fine.” I was running low on patience.

She took a deep breath, looked at her tennis shoes. “I’m having trouble programming it. That’s why I called.”

”Programming it?” Here was the crux. This was a ghost not a golem.

She toed her shoe at the pile of items. “I‘ve got everything here to give it the personality it needs, but it’s not taking. It’s just haunting. It’s not even noticed me, I don’t think.”

“Ghost aren’t like that,” I said. “They don’t have personality. They haunt but that’s all they do.”

And just like that the girl started crying. She suddenly looked a lot younger, like the girl in the picture. Maybe she was only thirteen or fourteen after all. She fell to her knees sobbing into her palms.

”It’s go to work,” she said, sniffing. “It’s got to.”

”Where’re your parents?” I didn’t want to deal with a distressed, spoilt teenager. 

She didn’t answer. 

In the photos we’d passed I’d only seen her dad. Maybe she didn’t have a mom, or at least not one she knew.

”Listen, there’s nothing else…” My eyes fell on the set of objects that clearly belonged to a man. A razor and a tie and all the rest. 

She was trying to summon a ghost with them…

My heart sank and pain spiked my gut. I looked to the table, to the white sheet covering what I’d thought to be a set of ornaments. I let my mind trace the outline of what was under it and put together what was really there.

”Jesus,” I said. 

I looked at the girl. Didn’t she have anyone else in the world to help her? 

“How long’s it been?” I asked.

She looked up at me. Paused. ”Three”—sniff—“days.” 

Her dad had been gone three goddamned days. And the poor kid had been trying to bring him back the best she could.

”Ghosts don’t work like that,” I said. “I wish they did though.” And I meant it — I wished that more than anything.

I took the girl’s hand and led her out of the room. “It’s going to be okay,” I told her as we reached the hall. 

She shook her head. “No. It’s not.”

I’d have to call an ambulance or the police to collect the body. There were no spells or magic that could bring him back. 

The girl shivered. When had she last eaten? I’d stay with her until the police got here. And after that, I decided that I’d stick around with her for as long as she needed. We’d get pizza. 

I thought how dumb that sounded. Like pizza could comfort her. I had no idea what to do, in truth — but I swore I’d do all I could.

”It won’t ever be okay again,” she said. “You have no idea what it’s like.”

”You’re right,” I said, softly.

I didn’t tell her that I’d gone home one night expecting a kiss from my wife. That, instead, I’d found her cold. I did know what it was like, at least a little. But she was right, it wouldn’t be okay again. Or at least it wouldn’t be the same. 

But it would improve.

Slowly.

Words, however, were not my strong point. I thought of those two elderly people. Of how they’d just needed someone, something, to be as physically strong as they were mentally. I opened my arms and the girl fell against me shivering and sobbing as I stroked her hair.
