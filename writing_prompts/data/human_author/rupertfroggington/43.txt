Sometimes I imagine you with me. Here, in the dark, it’s simple to trick one’s mind, so I hold my own hand and allow myself to think it’s yours.

Humans have always feared the darkness. The unknown has scared us as a species. The reason we explore, that we step inside the darkness, is so that we can tame that which terrifies us. So that we can take control over it.

It’s only here, in darkness, that you find the true unknown. You drown in darkness like this. As black and heavy as an ocean. You can not look out at the sky so you are forced to look inwards.

Do you remember when we first met on that autumn bench in the park? I was at the start of what seemed like an endless road to becoming a surgeon. You’d just become a primary school teacher, ready to inspire generations.

I would escape to that bench in front of the pond just to breathe, to soothe the stress that pinpricked my heart. You would come to feed the ducks at lunch. We never talked, just nodded and smiled politely. I’d watch the birds on the water and steal glances at you, slowly realising that just being near you eased my stress, and it was nothing to do with the park or birds.

In winter you stepped onto the thick slabs of ice that covered the pond and brought a branch down onto it, cracking open holes so the fish could breathe.

Then that sickening crack as the ice you stood on gave.

And me, the imagery hero, running to the ice, putting my hand out to pull you up. And instead, I ended up falling in next to you. You climbed out then helped heave me out.

We talked after that. We broke the ice, alright.

We married, only a year later. Had two children, almost as beautiful as you, but tinged unfortunately with my own slight off-kilter features.

And then the problem with your mind began. Your body tightning up as if you were made of iron and your joints, your bolts, were hurriedly rusting. Like a sea breeze constantly besieging you. Before long, walking slowed to an impossibility. You voice became slurred. My heart became cold.

You always kept your spirits high — how, I don’t know. And instead of admiring you, I became bitter, angered that you weren’t as angry as I was. For that I’m eternally sorry.

I never dug up bodies like they accused me of having done. I don’t think I would have had the nerve to visit a graveyard at night! But I was willing to pay for fresh corpses. You’d be surprised how many families will depart with a loved one’s body for a little money.

And so I began my work of dissecting brains. Of understanding where rot could occur that might influence a person’s motions. Of rewiring and reworking to move around the faults.

But these were corpses! I thought what I was doing might help you, but how would I know without testing on living creatures? On people. Would this truly interfere with their movements, and would the operation fix it again?

There was only one way to know.

People, it seems, are less likely to part with living relatives. Not all, mind. But many.

I was only able to procure six subjects before it all crumbled. Before I was reported and investigated and found out to have being committing ‘criminal’ actions.

They feared the unknown! And now when others are struck by your condition — perhaps their own loved ones, for God’s sake — they will turn away from the darkness. You and I, we were punished for staring into it. For trying to conquer it.

At any rate, what I’d found by that point would have been very little use to us. I could destroy movement, I could take it away. But I couldn’t bring it back.

But with more time…

&#x200B;

I squeeze my hands tighter together. Imagine the scent of oranges, of your favourite perfume, whisking through the darkness.

How long did you live for after I was buried?

A month? Year? Decade?

The coffin itself has rotted, the wood all but gone, but the soil keeps its shape.

I still have a long way to go. The skin on my fingers is gone, the bones protrude like a set of white knives, like claws, like I’m an animal digging at the stoney soil.

They buried me deep below the surface. But I’ll be out before they’re all dead. And even if they are, they will have families for me to find.

You squeeze my hand reassuringly. I feel your lips breeze across my own.

It’s your way of saying yes. That it’s a fine plan. That they deserve it.

Yes, we’ll make them suffer for separating us.
