They sat in the same room, both reading books they’d read before. They’d read enough books to know new books wouldn’t hold their interest. New books would recycle old plots and ideas but for the sake of making money instead of art, or to push some ideological sensibility instead of exploring an idea with an open mind.

The wall-clock ticked.

They’d read enough books to know which books they liked best. As such, they re-read the same hundred or so books and rarely read anything else.

The man and woman looked to be in their sixties. For the man — a vampire — this was perhaps easier. He’d not feasted for forty years, and without new blood entering his system his body mirrored that of an ageing man. The hunger pained him but it would be temporary. A blink of an eye.

The woman aged through a mix of potions and hair dye. She grew wrinkles in glass tubes and then folded them into her forehead and beneath her eyes. Careful, tedious application appeared to age her.

The wall-clock tocked.

They ate dinner — pork and potatoes — with barely a word exchanged. They were both waiting for the other to die so as to collect life insurance and inheritance. Just a waiting game for both wretched creatures. Although neither thought of it quite like that. They did love each other, in a way. Just that love was already stretched. When they’d met it’d been like entering a room full of scintillating scents — of chilli and perfume hanging in the air — and now those scents had settled down, fallen onto the linoleum, their intensity faded.

The vampire made them both a cup of tea after their meal. They sat down with their mugs and returned to their books.

Today she read *The Picture of Dorian Gray*. It amused her, reading about this immortal man with a painting in his loft. A man who couldn’t stand to see himself age. The book was philosophical and always interesting but it was the simple irony of it that made it a favorite.

Vanity was not something an immortal had. You soon become sick of seeing yourself in a mirror, of looking the same way day in, day out. It was, she thought, like living in a house that hadn’t been redecorated for six hundred years. And although the wallpaper still looked fresh — no mould or peeling — it was outdated and boring as hell. No, she thought, give me wrinkles, give me character.

She placed the book on her lap and mused aloud, “How long would it take, I wonder, for an immortal to become bored enough with life to no longer want to live?”

The man lowered his book and furrowed his brows. “What kind of question is that?”

”A thousand years?”

He ran his tongue over a sanded-down tooth and considered. “No. Less than that, I think. What would there be new to see after a thousand?”

”I wonder,” she said. ”Sometimes I think it’s not a matter of time but perhaps a matter of what people do with their time. Some people reach our age and are already bored to death. They’ve seen and done everything they wanted and are ready to walk out the door.”

”You should stop reading that book,” he said. “Every time you start it, you get like this.”

”But are those people wrong? Is it because they don’t think there’s anything new that’s worth doing or trying, that they stop doing or trying anything new?”

They sat in silence for a time after that. The clock ticked and tocked, the gap between beats seeming somehow more than a second.

Was that why he’d stopped doing anything new? he wondered. Is that why he was on War and Peace for the god-knew-how-many-time?  Was existence truly dulled to him now — or was he dulled to existence? How had he allowed himself to become like this? Like dust lying on a sofa…

”Have you ever been ballroom dancing?” he asked, eventually.

She hadn’t. She‘d danced to singing and stringed instruments, she’d danced beneath trees and in open moonlight, clothed and naked. She’d danced out her soul, and by the time she’d finished she’d lay on the grass panting and decided no type of dancing could ever better this. She knew she’d felt that at the time — but she only remembered feeling it, not how it felt.

”No,” she said.

He thought a while. He’d once loved dancing and then grown bored of it — although he’d never tried ballroom. But strange, curiously, he wanted to try it tonight.

”Would you like to?” he asked.

She nodded. “I think I would.”

They stood up. The air in the room seemed suddenly fragrant. Not fresh, but zesty. Spices and citrus perfume.

Later that night they took each other’s hands on the ballroom floor. The danced poorly, laughed merrily, and wondered what else they might discover — or rediscover —together.
