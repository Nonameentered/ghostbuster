Every night the demon visited Belle. It came with sharp, clacking teeth, fire-hot breath, long curled nails. Some nights it would climb out from beneath her bed, its spine clicking as it straightened. The room would fall cold and a stink of sewage would lay over her like a dirty dress.

Some nights it would stare at her with its beady red eyes. “They’re not coming back,” it would taunt. “Ever. I took your parents and I’ll take you next.”

If she buried her head beneath her pillow, the demon would rage. It would tear the pillow away and then climb upon her chest, its heaviness almost suffocating her, each breath a struggle. It would pin her arms and legs and paralyse her for the night, as it told her how her parents died and how lonely she’d always be. As it spat down upon her.

In the morning, before her foster parents checked in on her, it would climb back beneath her bed and or into a cupboard, its voice echoing: you’ll never escape me.

During the day, the stink of the creature followed her everywhere. Every intake of breath — even out in the fresh spring air — reeked of the creature. She could smell its hatred and depression, as if its essence had oozed through her pores and into her heart, staining it.

When she tried to talk to other children, the demon would possess her tongue. It would lash out at them — although Belle never wanted to say those things. It would tell her foster parents it hated them and that she wanted to leave or die but all she really meant was she missed her parents.

She could see the demon in their tears, too. Its gleeful face reflected in the surface, laughing not at them, but at her. “You’ll never escape me.”

It was the night she’d overheard her foster parents talking about her — saying that they weren’t strong enough to help her. Nothing they did seemed to work and that they’d failed.

She’d fled up to her room at that point, slamming the door, crawling into bed.

They were going to get rid of her. All because of this demon. This darkness that visited her. It wasn’t fair.

She cried herself to sleep that night.

&#x200B;

The white razor-blade of the quarter-moon shone through the window. Belle had fallen asleep before closing her curtains. She woke shivering, hoping she’d left the window open, too.

But the shadow was there, cooling the room, watching with its red eyes. “You’ll never escape me.” It grinned, its jagged rotting teeth uneven in its black gum.

She cried and the creature laughed. She pulled the blanket over her face.

The creature stepped forward and ripped it away from her. “Look at me,” it said. “You have to look at me, or else how will I have any fun?”

“Please,” she said. “Please. I don’t want this anymore.”

The creature put one foot onto the bed, its bones clicking as it rose.

“Please. I just—”

Something was at the window. Was that… There was a face pressed against the pane. Or, more like the after-image of a face. The imprint left on glass. It was there, yet she could see *through* the misty face.

The window creaked open.

”Struth, that’s a big ol’ guilt demon,” said the person. It pulled itself up and into her room one swift motion.

The demon turned and hissed, “Who the hell are you?’

“I’m the ghost of Steve Irwin, mate,” it said. “Come on, you must ’av heard of me?”

It shook its head and looked a little confused.

”Afterlife demon wrangler, at your service.” He looked at Belle. “No worries, I’m here to help.”

At this the demon growled. A low, dark rumble. “Leave. Now.”

Belle sat up in bed, panting against the headboard. Paralysed even without the creature sitting on her.

Steve Irwin — Belle vaguely remembered that name. She’d used to watch him with her parents when she was smaller. Both her parents had loved him. Said you had to be a little crazy to be as brave as him.

The demon lurched at Steve. The demon wrangler stepped aside, easily avoiding the attack. “It’s an awful big one, but big don’t always mean smart. Sure don’t mean agile, ha ha ha.”

Belle remembered her dad explaining how Steve died. Even that, she’d thought, had been brave. He’d known the risks and he’d still chosen go in the water.

Steve jumped at the demon’s legs, tackling him and bringing him crashing to the floor. ”Easy there, mate. I don’t want to hurt you if I don’t have to.”

Why was Steve helping her?

The demon struggled, finally rolling Steve over. It sent a flurry of punches at his face, screaming all the while. “You won’t stop me! She’s mine forever!” Every blow that connected with Steve sent a violent crunch across the room.

”Cri— Crikey,” he said, weakly.

Steve tried to block the punches but the demon was too strong. It scratched and lashed his face.

He managed to find Belle through his swollen eyes. “I’ve bitten off more than I can chew. Sorry ab… about this.”

For once, Belle thought, suddenly furious with the demon… For once she’d need to be the brave one. She knew what waters she’d be swimming in, but if Steve could jump into them, then so could she.

She thought of her parents as she leapt off the bed and onto the creature’s back.

It screamed as it tried to fling her off. It stood up and reached behind, clawing at the girl. She could feel its long nails drawing her blood.

But she’d given Steve precious time — he was back on his feet now. He took a boxer’s pose and sent two quick jabs into the demon’s belly. “That’s how the Kangas do it.” The demon bent over in pain as Steve brought a knee up to its face.

Belle was still hanging on its back, her heaviness slowing the demon down.

It was shrinking now, the demon, as they both attacked it.

Smaller and smaller.

And smaller.

Until Belle fell off it.

Until it was the size of an ant.

Steve took out a glass tube from his jacket and pinched the demon up and into it. “That’s it, good boy. You’ll be safe in there.” He tucked the tube back into a pocket and looked at Belle.

”Thank you,” said Belle.

”Don’t thank me. You’re the one who did it. You stood up to it.“ He placed a hand on her shoulder. “That was the only way to defeat a demon like that. You did real good. Your parents would be mighty proud.”

Steve hugged her as she cried. When she settled, he tucked her into her bed.

“Will it come back for me?” she asked.

Steve shook his head. “Nah, that one can’t come back. But here’s the thing: similar, smaller ones will come for you. And they can grow, they can get just as big and nasty.”

She shivered. “What should I do?”

”You do what you did tonight. You fight.” He tussled her hair. “As long as you keep on fighting, you’re going to be okay.“

Steve slipped out the window and Belle took a deep breath. For the first night in a long time she slept a few hours without waking.

The next morning every trace of the demon was gone from her. From her tongue, her ears, her eyes, her skin. She hugged her foster parents and there was nothing there to push them away.
