Danielle sipped her frothing beer then wiped her sleeve across her mouth. The log fire crackled behind her; thick windows muffled the sound of skiers and revellers outside the lodge bar.

The alien only had water. It seemed to study Danielle's face, and either it or the fire caused her cheeks to heat.

"Physics, chemistry, biology," she continued, if only to break the judgmental silence between them. "We know almost everything about... well, about almost everything."

"True," said the alien. "But science is the easy part."

"Science is the *easy part?*" She took another drink of beer -- *Downhill Slope*, the lodge's own brew. A swig this time, her throat burning slightly, her brain slowing, numbing. It was her third pint during the conversation.

"You're a science fiction writer, Danielle. Surely you can see that science is the easy part?"

She considered this as the lodge door opened and a cold wind swept in, along with a young couple in thick red sweaters holding hands. Danielle's head was swimming but the frigid air helped form some level of reason. "You mean, the ideas are the difficult part? The concepts. That, like with Star Trek, the science needed the ideas before it could catch up."

She opened a nearly-blank notepad and scrawled this semi-revolution -- a revolution she'd had a dozen times in her life already -- as a note: *science needs fiction*.

"I don't mean that, although I suppose there is truth in it," said the alien, after a time.

Danielle's beer was finished and she held up a hand to summon a waitress clearing up glasses on the table next to them. "Another *Slope,* please."

The waitress's smile shifted on her lips like quicksand as she looked over Danielle. Danielle, for her part, sat up straight and did her finest impression of sobriety.

"Coming right up," said the waitress.

Danielle steepled her fingers and looked down at the table. At the wood. At nothing that would look back at her. "That wasn't what you meant?"

"You have almost mastered science, as you rightly pointed out. You are a drumbeat of research away from immortality, however it is your race decides to pursue it. Be it digital immortality, cloned, robotic, or a merge."

"Immortality," said Danielle. The couple in bright sweaters sat on barstools now, cocktails in front of them, laughter ringing. It sounded fake to Danielle.

Or maybe she just hoped it was fake. Bitterly wanted it to be.

That had been her and Sira only a decade ago. And now the roots of Danielle's hair were greying, wrinkles were imprinting deeper into her forehead, her writing career had frozen, and Sira was dead three years.

"*Immortality*," she said again. Too late for Sira. Too late for them.

Every year for three years she had returned to the mountain where they'd met. Where they'd gotten engaged only a year after meeting.

"You should ski again," said the alien. The alien whose face that she could never quite see clearly shifted, blended, with a memory or Sira. "It might do you some good. Better than sitting here drinking."

"I can't."

"It's been years," said the alien. "You need to try."

"I don't have the energy."

The waitress planted a fresh *Downward Slope* on the table and took the old glass.

"Immortality is the easy part," said the alien with a heavy sigh. "Surviving when others haven't. Finding meaning in a seemingly never-ending existence. A way to keep going. That's the difficult part. And really, it's the only part that matters."

She thought about that as well as she could as she sipped her beer idly. *Meaning*. Where would an immortal -- or anyone else for that matter -- find it? In experiences? In pursuit of the unknown?

The alien was gone, back to just a scribble in the margin of her notebook. It looked mostly like a huge eye peering up at her.

She wrote a single word next to the alien: *memories.* Then added, *meaning comes from memories. We create memories for, when in the future, the world has grown very cold, we have a fuel of meaning that we can throw on the fire and keep ourselves warm with. So that we can keep going until we have the energy to create the next set of memories.*

She sighed and stood, leaving her last beer mostly untouched.

She took a last look at the happy couple at the bar. Smiled -- didn't even need to force it.

An early night was in order.

Tomorrow, who knows. Perhaps she'd try skiing again.
