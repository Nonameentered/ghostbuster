\*\*\*

I can’t remember my children's first day at school. I can’t even remember their faces. My mind paints them anew and wrong each time I conjure them.

I’ve had seven treatments and still remember I have daughters. And I’m sure they went to school. But where or when, I can’t say. I can only guess what color hair they have.

I know the situation back home was terrible and I know I’m doing this for them – which I think means I was a good mother. But would a good mother be willing to forget her family?

I don’t sleep. I lie awake shivering beneath the air conditioning.

I realize that in a sense I’m dying and something else is rising up in my body, taking my place. Someone used to the luxury of this hotel, who knows more about the country beyond the wall than the country I come from. Who cares more about feet than animals.

I wonder if I would have been able to save the woman’s life if the incident in the lobby had happened today?

I spend the rest of the night with a notepad in hand, attempting to remember any precious details.

\*\*\*

“Congratulations,” says the receptionist after my final treatment. “Looking forward to getting out tomorrow?”

“You bet!” I say. “Time to get on with life, right?”

I speak our language with perfect intonation and accent. It’s the only language I know. My old life’s been erased and now it’s onwards and upwards. I’m a useful citizen. Tomorrow I get my I.D. and the birdcage will open.

That night in my room I try to be sad for my old life. But how can I be sad for things I don’t remember?

Instead, I’m pleased.

\*\*\*

I wake violently, my heart beating in my throat, my breath hitched.

I felt them. In my dream I felt them. The weight of their love pressed down on my chest, stilting my breathing.

It’s all still there, my old life, just condensed into a core of feeling and hidden in the deepest recesses of my heart.

What have I done?

I’ve almost lost something precious beyond words and reason.

I vomit into the toilet.

Later, I sit on my bed flicking through my notepad, but most of the writing is in a language I don’t understand.

I dial the numbers into the phone and wait as it rings.

A  tired, unfamiliar voice answers. A child’s.

“Hello,” I say. I swallow hard. “It’s your mother.”

She cannot understand me. I cannot understand her.

It does not matter.

She yelps and her excitement transcends language. It reaches something primal inside me, something as deep as my dreams, and I’m happy-crying.

She talks and talks but I can’t respond in any meaningful way.

There’s another voice then, too. Her sister.

I look at my notepad. At the names scrawled inside a heart. I say them slowly, one at a time.

Beneath their names is another line of text. I don’t know when I wrote it but it’s a beat of phonetic writing. It makes no sense to me and yet, as I pronounce it, understanding comes.

They repeat the sound back to me.

I will learn this sentence by heart and I will speak it to them each night. Words and memories can be erased but feelings etch themselves forever on your heart.

“I love you,” I say again.
