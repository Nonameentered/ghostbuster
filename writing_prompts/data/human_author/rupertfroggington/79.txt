I want to be cohesive — is that the word? I want to write about what’s happened to us should anyone survive and need to know, or should a new species rise from our ashes. Like a griffin.

Jackie my neighbour keeps thudding her head against the wall. I’ve removed the painting of the cherry blossoms from my wall because it kept shuddering, very noisy, but I can still hear the thumping. It’s extremely distracting when you’re trying to write the definitive account of humanity‘s fall.

“Shut up!” I yell. “Shut up you old hag!”

But either she doesn’t hear or she ignores me (guess good manners have gone along with her sanity!) as she keeps up with the noise.

I’m pretty sure it was a phoenix I meant. Not griffin.

See, this is part of the trouble. Our minds, all of our minds, have been badly dealt. Ideas and memories have been scrawled onto playing cards and shuffled and scattered over the emptiness of our brains. You collect an upturned card and you think it’s the right one, that it’s going to be an eight of hearts. Even when you turn it over and look at it you’re like: yeah, that’s what I thought it was. But it’s a two of clubs you’re staring at and you just don’t remember you were after an eight.

Oh god I’m rambling aren’t I? I never used to. Back when we lived in a house and not a cloud-high apartment I used to have a better grip on my thoughts. If I’m not careful I’m going to start telling you about the man I used to love. Which is tough to do because I get him confused with every movie star I’ve ever seen. One moment I’m thinking of when we first met — a blind date at a bar, him carrying a single rose. And the next we’re jumping off a skyscraper and his face is Tom Cruise and I’m like, Ray, are you sure that’s always been your face? And didn’t you bring a rose and not a glock?

The drugs. That’s what I mean to talk about.

The drugs the drugs the drugs the drugs the fucking drugs.

Okay: sleep. Who needs it, right? Let’s develop a drug that eliminates the need for sleep. It won’t start any riots and sure won’t wipe out humanity.

Ha!

They tested the drug in labs, told us it was good to go. Then they pushed it onto us. We could get more work done and have more leisure time with more money to spend. What’s not to love about that? So, a lot of us took it. A year passed, two three four five, nothing bad happened and people were enjoying the nights and the extra free time so the rest of us took—

”Shut up!” I scream.

What I mean is, then they made it compulsory to take. Needed everyone to pull their weight. To work a couple extra hours.

All good! For a time.

Then the first people who took it, the test subjects, they started forgetting basic stuff. Like, you know, their names. Started hearing voices in their heads. Started fighting and harming and all kinds of shit. They screamed for sleep. To please please please let them sleep.

They stopped taking the drugs but guess what? Too late. They couldn’t sleep. And they needed to — we all need to. Now we’re all insomniacs, not even getting a moment’s peace.

Jackie’s finally stopped. That’s nice. Maybe I was wrong to say not even a moment‘s peace. I should have said not even a drop of sleep.

And dreams, they think now, dreams were the mind’s sorting hour. Where we got everything straightened out and squared away. And now there are no dreams and everything’s a real mess.

Even babies, even if they’ve never had the drug — and most didn’t, imagine a baby that didn’t sleep? Jesus. — even the babies couldn’t sleep. Jesus. The drug had leaked from parent to child.

We’re all infected. That’s what I’m trying to tell you.

”Shut up!” I yell. She’s back at it, would you believe? After I’m done I’m going to pay her a visit. She was never a good neighbour — always borrowed foods, never brought any over. You know the type.

Oh.

I realize now that Jackie was my *old* neighbour, before we moved to the apartment. So it can’t be her head-butting the wall after all! Ha.

Out my window you can see the city burning far below. Pretty, almost. More people join the rioters each day. What they expect anyone to do about this, I really don’t know. I guess they’re just angry.

Sometimes, with my binoculars, I watch them set their fires. Watch the buildings snap into an orange blaze. Occasionally one of the rioters runs from the crowd and leaps into the flames. And the crowd cheers and maybe another person follows.

I don’t like the thought of burning. Not one bit. I’m not good with that type of pain.

But God, I envy the peace that must follow.

I just want to sleep.

Please please please let me sleep.

Okay, that’ll have to do. I need to check on my son. He’s in the room next to mine and he’s making an awful racket.
