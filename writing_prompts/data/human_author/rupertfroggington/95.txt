The world is full of improbable statistics. Did you know that thirty-five million adults in the US can’t read above a third grade level? Or that there over two billion robotic calls made around the globe each day? Hell, it’s the only time my phone rings any more.

Or you know that’s there a writing subreddit with fifteen million members that only has ten thousand active? Got to admit that’s strange, right?

There’s a slide rusting in my backyard. A helter skelter type of thing: a domed body with the slide wrapping around it like a snake. A thin snake that hasn’t snacked on a child for quite some time. The shelter’s dome has (faded) red and white stripes spilling down its side. The slide itself is hard red plastic.

Put it together myself.

I think my kid must have rode it a thousand times before moving on. I try to count the actual number sometimes, but trying to count memories is like trying to count beads of sweat fallen into the sea.

It shouldn’t be a big deal, the writing thing. Not in the face of other unusual statistics. Like how the average person produces forty-six litres of saliva each month. Almost enough to fill a bath. Can you imagine?

But still, I don’t know. I can’t get it out of my head.

Millions of writers. Where did they all go?

They just get bored and leave? I guess some do. Most, probably. Tried out writing: nope, not for me, boss. And then, I figure some move up the ladder, the talented few, to greener pastures. Release a book, pop a cork, and either they’re happy-ever-after or they’re back in an office two months later sharpening lead.

But that can’t account for all of them right?

I put an advert out on Reddit one time. It said: Writers missing. Up to fifteen million of them. Any information please contact me.

I got the usual crank responses. The same way you do whenever you ask the public for help finding something.

A Redditor is eating them, said one smartass. It boosts their intelligence like a word vampire.

Another said: they’re all lurking, millions of silent eyes on every post. Watching and waiting. Stay quiet and you’ll be safe.

You know Americans eat four billion avocados each and every year? That’s kind of something, I think. Four billion.

My kid, when he wasn’t so much a kid anymore, he started writing on that writing sub. Me and his Ma — we were still together then — thought maybe he’d turn out to be a writer. That we’d get him some classes. My son the writer. Imagine.

He’d already given up on the slide by then. Too old for it. Plus, when he was at the top, the neighbors could see him standing up there high above the fences. And he got shy as he got older. Didn’t like that space at the top so much.

Who cares what they think, I said.

But he cared. He was like that.

Fifteen million. Only ten thousand active. Can’t get that out of my head.

You know, on average, an American drinks twenty-six gallons of beer each year?

And that the average drunk driver has driven under the influence over eighty times before finally getting caught?

That must mean most of the time they’re never caught.

You can put out all the adverts you like, ask the world for for help.

You don’t get real answers.

A lot of stats are like that. Mysteries.

No answers.

And somehow you’re meant to find a way to just keep on going like answers don’t matter anyway.
