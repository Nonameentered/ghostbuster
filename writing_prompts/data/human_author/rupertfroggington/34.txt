The blood dripped off my lip and splashed onto the chalked-out pentagram that I'd scribbled on the asphalt behind the slide.

I'd expected the playground to split open and a demon to pull itself up out of the gap, but that's not what happened. The demon fell out the sky instead, wailing as it descended, then smacked face first on the asphalt. If you slap a hand hard against your thigh, the demon's landing was that sound but way louder.

"Uh... Are you okay?" I asked.

The demon peeled itself off the ground, stood straight (must have been about seven foot tall) and cracked its neck. "Fine. Absolutely fine. Just took the wrong portal. Now, was it you who summoned me?"

"Uh huh."

It looked like Sylvester Stallone. I don't know if it looked like him before the fall, but it sure did now. Except its skin was a washed-out mould-green.

"Well? What do you want?"

I held up the note of ownership between two fingers, letting it crackle in the wind.

The demon looked at it, looked at me. Sniffed. Checked the note again.

I wasn't worried about anyone else seeing us -- the weather was as moody as Michael had been when I'd offered him the trade. Like him, the sky was dark, grey, dour. Only difference was the rain: Michael had spat at me as he'd accepted the deal, but the rain was a constant barrage.

Mom, of course, had made me pack my bright red poncho. "Going to rain, honey," she'd said that morning. With that gentle *I only mean well* smile, but in that *you better fucking listen to me cause I know best* tone.

That was part of the reason I'd summoned the demon. Since Dad died, Mom was less Mom and more mafia boss. I didn't much like being home. Thing was, I didn't much like being at school either. I wasn't smart or nerdy, and I wasn't athletic or funny. I just floated around school like a wraith, trying to fit in with various groups but never managing to infiltrate fully.

That'd change if I had a genie, I'd thought. I'd thought it on one of those long nights where you try not to sleep because if you do Dad'll be alive again and you'll be playing soccer with him in the yard and then you'll wake and he'll be dead again and it'll hurt just like the first time.

A genie could change that though. A genie could bring him back. Or if it couldn't do that, it'd make me rich maybe. Or powerful. Or even funny -- heck, I'd have taken funny.

But where was I going to get a genie from? I had no idea. On the other hand, with Google's help, I found a possible alternative. Turns out demons basically grant wishes if you give them something they want. And mostly what demons want are souls.

Michael Elpsly was a grade A (A++) asshole. Only subject he'd excel in, if it was a subject. He was like this giant muscular spider who skulked in corners. Dark corners of the classroom or the cafeteria or the playground. You'd forget he was there sometimes, you'd step too close to his web, and that's when he'd pounce and pound. The only thing we had in common was the lack of close social connections. That is to say, neither of us had any friends.

Still, that slight connection was enough for him to usually take it a little easier on me than other kids.

Michael was lazy and I knew that could work in my favor. He rarely bothered to bring his own lunch and he never brought any money to buy food. Instead, he'd gently (with a fist) coerce others to hand over their food or money.

But he was *really* lazy. Too lazy to even bully, sometimes. So when I offered him lunch without him having to do any bullying, just had to scrawl his name on a piece of paper and pretend that he'd sold his soul to me, he shrugged and said, "Whatever."

We'd agreed on the trade -- a sandwich, snacks, drink -- and he'd signed my agreement. But when he'd checked inside the lunchbox and found the carrots and celery he took a swing at me. *Thanks Mom*.

"You think you're smart, trying to rip me off."

I wasn't sure if it was a question and I didn't have much time to think it over. His knuckle connected with my face and blood started spurting. I don't think he'd meant to hit me that hard cause even he looked pretty shocked. Still, he didn't say sorry. He took the lunchbox -- vegetables and all -- and went over to a corner table in the cafeteria, setting himself down in the dim recess.

Oh well, I'd needed to bleed for the ritual anyway, so the joke was on him.

&#x200B;

I stole a piece of chalk, headed out into the rain, scrawled the symbol, dripped a blood-offering, and the demon slapped the ground like a hand against a thigh. Now we're caught up.

"Can you bring people back to life?" I asked.

He sniffed the note some more. Didn't look away as he said, "Not in the way you'd want."

I considered that, my heart falling like a stone down into my shoe. I remembered a story about a monkey paw and decided, reluctantly, against it.

"What about money?"

"This soul's rancid," said the demon. He was scratching it now with a chipped nail to really bring out the stink. "This is yours?"

I shook my head. "Is it a deal-breaker?"

"Nah. But hell, where'd you get it from? This thing's tattered."

"Tattered?"

The demon looked at me with those squinting Rocky eyes. "I've never, in all my lives, smelled such a sorry soul. What kind of life has this poor bastard been through?"

"Poor bastard?" I said, about to launch a verbal counter-attack and to explain about my lip, but the demon interrupted.

"Parents gave him up. Foster care abused him. School is letting him down." The demon whistled. "This'll do well for me. Could be a promotion in it. Damn, this kid never even has food to bring to school because he has no one to buy it for him."

"Oh."

"Money, you said? I can do money. I can do lots of money. I'm going to make you rich, and you're going to make me infamous."

I couldn't say a word in reply.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Here's your soul back," I said, laying the paper down on the table. "I got it a bit soggy, sorry. But otherwise it's good."

Michael looked at the torn paper. "I ate your lunch. You can't have it back."

I shrugged, sat opposite him, and pushed the paper further towards him. "That's okay. I wasn't hungry." Even the veg were gone, I noticed.

We sat together in silence for a while. He didn't take his note so I said, "You should probably swallow it. Or at least pocket it."

"Why don't you want it?" It might have been my imagination, but he looked almost disappointed. Upset. Did he think it wasn't good enough for me to use?

"To tell you the truth, I was going to trade it with a demon to try to get my dad back."

"Huh."

"But I realised you needed it back."

"For what? What good's it ever done me?"

I thought for a while. Thought about Dad. And Mom. And me. I turned and blinked back tears. Then finally I said, "I don't think it's going to be like this forever. I think we can repair them. Our souls I mean. I know they're not much now, but I think they're seeds that can still be fed and watered and..."

I figured I was going to get another punch if I carried on like that.

Except I didn't get punched.

A few minutes passed before he picked up his damp soul and put it in his pocket. He got up then and slapped my shoulder, saying, "Thanks."

"No problem," I replied. I sat there for a long time after wondering how you go about trying to fix up a pair of battered souls.

&#x200B;

The next day at lunch I sat next to Michael and split my sandwich with him.

"Ever seen Rocky?" I asked.

"Rocky?"

"Know the actor?"

We talked. Laughed a little, even.

He didn't tell me to go away. And I didn't want to go away. Because souls, it turns out, like to know they're not alone.
