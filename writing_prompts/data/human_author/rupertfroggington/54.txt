The tower is the inverse of a regular tower — needled deep into the ground instead of thrusting out of it. It‘s like a giant, spiralled mollusc shell, spindling its way into the earth’s heart.

Now I stand at the ground by the tower’s top, the sky, with its spritz of clouds, hanging perfectly still above me, while an impossible sound echoes up from deep below: the sound of a woman screaming. *Wailing*. The thumping of desperate fists against thick wooden doors. I can’t hear the words — the cries are too muffled, but I can hear the pain.

I stand there listening, unable to move. The screams are amplified by the by the tower’s design in the way a long musical instrument inflates a puff of breath into a melodious roar. Only there’s nothing melodic about the sound of this desperation.

There should only be silence here.

This is the tower I grew up in, many years ago. As a little girl I’d been locked up in a room at its core, where no light could pierce, where no hero could rescue me. The fact that I’d escaped begged a mysterious question: who was trapped in the room beneath the ground now? Who was screaming?

Since escaping I’d taken on the identity of a knight. I wore a helmet and suit of armour and took quests for leisure. Never had I expected to be sent on this quest. To rescue the princess of the inverse tower.

I accepted the quest as I knew it would be easy. The princess — me, unmasked — would turn up in a few weeks time and say the knight freed me. Then I leave. Later, the helmeted knight would turn up for his reward.

So I travelled back to where it all began. I had weeks to kill, after all. Why not go to where I was meant to be — see my old home once more?

The screams are like rushing water pouring up the stairs instead of down, defying all sense of gravity. They wash over me in powerful waves, as if trying to push me back.

I must be brave. All my life I’ve tried to be strong, but often failed. I must be brave today.

I remove my helmet and step forward, walking against the screams as if plunging myself against a hurricane, forcing my way down the throat of the white tower, one step at a time.

Slowly, I descend. The world above me becomes a ring of blue. Everything else is dark. Even my hands have become lost in the blackness. If I had to answer who I am right now, I wouldn’t be able to — so disorientating is the dark.

The patch of blue slowly shrinks, and with it my bravery withers. The blue becomes a pinprick of light. And eventually, nothing.

How deep I‘ve burrowed, I do not know. There is no sense of time when everything is dark. It is like being lost inside one’s own head. I feel the cold of the walls against my palms and lower one foot at a time, gingerly, carefully. Afraid to trip, to break my neck.

The thumping on the door is like a drumbeat accompanying the screams. Or like being inside the heart of a great demon, every thump of its existence is like two hands slapping over my ears.

&#x200B;

Eventually, I reach the door. It shudders in time to the beating of the fist behind it. For a long while, I stand this side, not daring to pull across the latches that lock the woman inside.

I shouldn’t be this frightened. Why am I so scared? I was once that side, after all.

I slide the locks across and step back, allowing the door to swing open at the next beat.

It does so.

&#x200B;

There is no one at the door.

&#x200B;

”Hello?” I say.

I step into a small room, a green light pulsating from its corner, reflecting up onto the beige walls.

A woman sits on a sofa in front of a glowing box that hums with static. There is no screaming here. No one thumping.

The woman… *She is me.*

She looks up at me, then back at the box, uninterested in my presence.

“I’ve come to rescue you,” I say, very quietly, uncertain of the words.

She says nothing. There is only silence and the humming.

A fear possesses me. A fear I’ve not experienced since childhood. As if the whole world is cracking open and birthing a creature of pure darkness that will stand, reach out and scoop up the sun itself. It will eat all the light from our world. That is the sense of fear running through me.

“We’ve got to leave this place,” I say. ‘We’ve got to leave — right now.”

She doesn’t move. I walk to her and grab her by the shoulders, rattling her. Trying to make her understand. “Do you hear me? If we don’t, something very bad is going to happen.”

Her eyes don’t meet mine. She drops back on her seat.

The room is a mess. Littered by bottles and bags. The air is stale and rank. There are pictures of her — of me — younger than I am. Not paintings, too accurate to be paintings. She is with a man and a baby in all of them.

“Who are they?” I say.

”Gone,” she says. “They’re gone.”

I can hear the cracking of the world. The rising of the beast. If I let her stay in this place it will clamp its jaws around us.

“I have no choice,” I say. “I’m sorry, but if you stay here, you’ll die. We’ll die.” I grab her and throw her over my shoulders. She doesn’t resist. She flops like a bag of corn on my back.

The way up takes much longer than the way down. The screaming has returned. The knocking — the heartbeat — returns. I think it is our voice, our heartbeat.

The staircase fills with warm, rancid breath as if I am in a beast’s throat. The other me is heavy, and by the time I see a pinch of blue sky, I’m already exhausted. I put her down and catch my breath.

”If we’re going to escape,” I say, “you need to help me. *Please*.”

She stares at me for a while. Then begins crying. “I can’t. Not you. Not myself.”

With everything I’ve got, I heave her up once more, and struggle onwards. The blue light widens.

We burst out of the tower and collapse onto the soil, just as the earth rumbles. A spout of flame follows us, an inferno blasting from the tower’s throat to our side. “Come on!” I say, taking her arm over my shoulders and guiding us away.

Then the whole world rattles as the beast whose throat we were in — the great dragon in the centre of the world — explodes out and leaps into the sky.

“You’ve got to help me,” I say. “We have to run or it will devour us! There’s a valley, not far from here. A thin gorge. If we make it there, the dragon will not be able to follow. It’s too huge to fit.”

She looks at me. Then glances in the air at the dragon — its vast wings blotting out the sky, shrouding us as if we’re deep in another tower.

“It’ll find us again, even if we escape. It always finds us.”

I take her hand. Hold it tight in mine. “At least there can be a next time if we run.”

Her throat rocks as she swallows hard.

The dragon is swooping.

She pulls my arms and together we run. Towards the valley.

We sprint as the dragon‘s roar tears through the fabric of the world.
