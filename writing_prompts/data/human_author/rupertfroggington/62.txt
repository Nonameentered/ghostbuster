It’s been a year since the duplicates arrived. I‘m at the kitchen table flipping through stories on my phone as Mom cooks pancakes. There’s an article I find about quadruplets who have met their quadruplet doubles, and they’re all smiles and hugs at the entrance to some theme park.

A friend of mine put the strange happening like this: two dying realties were attracted to each other. Each reality had an arrhythmia at its core — a heart abnormality. Neither beat in sync to the rhythm intended for it. It was that out of rhythm heartbeat, that tada-ta-ta-da-tada, that drew them together. These sick existences merged, the missing heartbeats of one filled by the irregular tempo of the other. Tada-tada-tada.

Voila, said my friend, a healthy reality.

My friend tried to explain it to me like I was ten, not fifteen. In a way I could comprehend.

Mom sets pancakes down on my plate and kisses my hair.

“Any plans for today?” she asks.

There’s no school at the moment. I’m glad about that — it’s tiring seeing the other kids with their doubles hanging out at the lockers. Each person has become their own clique, their own diary and soundboard.

I shrug. I cut the pancakes into square chunks and eat them to please Mom, although I have no appetite.

My therapist — I don’t see her anymore — told me people my age commonly suffer narcissistic tendencies. We spend so much time on social media and on perfecting selfies that we see ourselves as something we aren’t. We make a new being and convince ourselves it’s us. In that sense, we‘ve stepped outside of our bodies and are viewing ourselves as objects. Puppets that we pull the strings of.

Now everyone has doubles. They style each other likes dolls and take photos of the double and pretend it’s their own selfie. They perfect the angles and shadows and the art of self-infatuation.

Mom sits opposite me and waterfalls honey over her pancakes. “You used to love honey,” she says, very quietly. But she doesn’t mean me. Too sweet, for me.

”I’ve no plans either,” she says.

Neither of us goes out much.

I think seeing people with their double hurts us on a level we can’t easily express. It’s not like a stab to the heart, but something much quieter. A gap opening deep somewhere inside us, letting out a blackness — a darkness from some third, empty reality — that swirls and swims and infests the waters inside us.

After breakfast Mom begins a jigsaw puzzle. It’s of a forest and there are eyes peering timidly from behind the trees — it’s hard to say what creatures the eyes belong to. I suppose it’s for the person putting it together to decide.

It’s her favorite jigsaw but in this universe she’s missing three pieces so she knows she’ll never finish it. It doesn’t stop her trying at least once a month.

”Do you regret being here?” I ask.

She stops, a jigsaw piece in her hand that has painted eyes in a treetop. An owl maybe. “No. Never.” She pauses, then draws in air. “Are you glad I’m here?”

I hold the answer for a moment,  just to check the workings out. “I’m very glad,” I say.

We were both in pain. A different kind to the pain we’re in now. Not as loud or sharp. We’d each lost the most important person to us. And even though we didn’t have them back, not quite — we knew we’d never have them all the way back — we had something close. Something that reminded us. A living photograph; a breathing souvenir.

I leave the room for a while and find a box of games and jigsaws I’d used to play with my real Mom. I find one that’s a summer scene — a shimmering stream with parents and children splashing through it, couples picnicking on the riverside, others sunbathing.

I return to the kitchen with the jigsaw and remove the lid.

Mom, new Mom, has finished all she can of her puzzle; three pieces are missing, as always.

”Let’s see if we can find anything that fits,” I said. “The pieces are a similar size so I bet we can. The same company made both so maybe they used the same instrument to chop them up.”

I think I hear Mom laugh but then she wipes her cheek and I know it wasn’t laughter. But she smiles, all the same.

We search through the box until we find three pieces that fit. We have to jam them in a little, and we both know they look out of place — too happy in this forlorn and quiet forest — and yet, as I step back and take in the whole, I think it works.

I think it’s almost perfect.
