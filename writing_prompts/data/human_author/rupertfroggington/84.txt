My dad introduced the angel to the family, so if you were looking to blame someone for what happened, I guess it could be him.

It was a Tuesday in late summer and my father just lost his job at the car place — hadn’t sold a vehicle in months, not that it was all his fault because he couldn’t control economics any more than he could the weather, and things at home had become difficult for him. That said, other people were selling and he wasn’t, so they let him go.

Dad couldn’t face coming back straight and telling his young family the news, not while sober, so off he headed to O’Rileys to sip up some liquid Prozac. Daytime drinking wasn’t like him at all, but it was a unique situation.

Anyway, that’s when he met the angel.

The angel had been slouched at the bar knocking back Orange Heavens. It was one of those angels who’d had its wings clipped — it had not shirt on so you could see these extra bones run down its back, like two extra and protruding spines, a fluffy down of feather still tared to the bones.

Dad pulled up a stall next to this angel. He asked what he was drinking and ordered them both another. Turned out Orange Heavens were vodka, plus vodka, plus a little orange, and were Dad’s brand new favorite cocktail.

”Not seen you around,” said the angel. “Rough day?”

”Rough day? Yep. I’d say so. Rough day almost covers it.”

”I know something about rough days myself.”

”That makes two of us.”

”Well then, here’s to better days,” said the angel.

“Amen.”

They raised their Heavens to the heavens and swigged them back.

Dad waddled into our house about midnight. Me and my sister woke to the shouting and crept out our bedroom door and into the hallway shadows. There, in the glow, was my dad, arm around his new pal.

”Come on, Louise,” said Dad. “He’s got nowhere to go. They kicked him out of heaven, would you believe it? Look what they did to his wings. To an angel! If they’d ruin a goddmaned angel imagine what they’d do to us, huh?”

”If they kicked him out he probably deserved it,” said Mom. She wasn’t much of the religious type.

”This is my house too, Louise. The angel’s my guest. End of conversation.”

”Listen,” slurred the angel, “I don’t want trouble. And I get it, I do. It’s been a rough day all round. You two need to talk things through. It’s not easy losing a job.”

Mom stared at Dad. “Whose job? Tell me not yours? Christ, I don’t need this right now.”

Dad performed a *what-can-you-do* kind of shrug. Mom looked at him a while, waiting for something to spill out that didn’t come. Then, with damp eyes, she marched to her bedroom and slammed the door shut.

”Louise…” said Dad. Then: “Fuck.”

The angel slept on the sofa. Dad slept on a camp-bed in our bedroom. Me and my sister pretended to be asleep and not notice him set it up. But he snored all that night like he was leaning right in our ears with each machine-gun breath.

Mom was already gone to the hospital by the time I was up. But I heard the angel and my pa talking as I walked into the kitchen.

”Listen,” said the angel. “You’ve been a careful saver. You’ve got money saved. It’s a good position to be in. Hell, who wouldn’t kill to be in your position? You’re basically retired with enough money to last you months. And don’t you deserve a break?”

Then the hiss-pop of a bottle of champagne.

The angel and my father were sitting at the kitchen table eating cereal and drinking champagne.

“There you are, champ!” said Dad, seeing me pad into view.

He looked happy but I don’t think he really was.

“Hi,” said the angel. “You know what I am?”

I nodded.

”Clever kid. You must read your bible.”

My sister waltzed up behind me. She was a year younger and when she saw this topless angel with his bone-cut back, she said, “Are you why my mommy’s sick?

The angel laughed. “Me? Come on. Do I look like I could make people sick?”

&#x200B;

The angel stayed with us. Even after Mom died, the angel stayed.

“I’m sticking right here to look after your father,” the angel told me. “He needs me to look after him now more than ever, don’t you think?”

What about us? I thought. Me and my sister. Didn’t we need someone to look after us, too? She’d been our mother after all. But when we lay in bed awake, hoping it was all a dream and that she’d waltz into our room and read a story and kiss us to sleep, Dad was out there getting actual comfort from the angel.

They’d drink champagne in the mornings. They seemed to like that routine. The angel would always be the one to pop a bottle open; said it was how king’s started the day. *Guaranteed to have a good day if you start it with champagne*. *You can’t be miserable if you’re drinking the fizz.* Later in the day it’d turn to double Orange Heavens, and then to lager as night fell.

They’d listen to music. To happy songs first, to music that made them dance. Then later to Lourdes, sadder slower songs and eventually we’d hear them both crying. The angel about being thrown out of heaven, Dad about Mom. They both drank to the unfairness of their lives.

&#x200B;

One morning I found Dad crouched in the shower, clothes still on, cold water running sluicing over him. A framed photo of him and Mom sat clutched in his hands, but the ink had all run, the two of them merging together into some colorful chimera. Her bright dress into his black suit and white shirt. You couldn’t recognise one from the other.

”Dad?” I said.

He looked up but didn’t reply. I turned off the shower and wrapped a towel over his shivering shoulders.

”Where’s the angel?” I asked. The pair of them would usually have been drinking champagne in the kitchen at this time. The angel was meant to be looking after him.

”Gone,” gasped my dad. “He’s gone. He’s finally abandoned us too.”

”Gone?

”Took the last of my money and left. He’s gone. We’re alone now. Just us.” And then he started crying. “I’m so sorry. Im so sorry. I should never have brought him in. Now we’re going to lose everything.”

I helped Dad out of the bath and unbuttoned his shirt and took off his socks and got him into bed.

Then I consulted my sister on how we could get him happy again.

”Mom always said a clean house is a happy house,” said my sister after much consideration.

It was the only idea we had so we started cleaning. We washed out every bottle. We scrubbed the smell of lager out of the kitchen tiles. We threw out the takeout containers and cigarette packets. For a few days, as Dad lay in bed, barely there, we pretended we were a pair of Cinderellas, sparkling up the home.

He lay in bed for the next few days, curtains drawn. This man who had once been our father but now only looked like him. Like a picture of a picture of a picture. Our uncle said he was sick, but not like Mom was. All the same, it felt like he was being stolen away too.

&#x200B;

“How do you stop hurting?” Dad asked one day. “How do you stop hurting when God just keeps on hitting you? Even when you’re lying prone on the ground, he just keeps kicking and kicking. There’s always more blood left to squeeze out of you. He’ll put more in you just so he can kick it out. So how do you stop hurting?”

It was one of those questions he asked when we were in the room with him but it might have been directed to the wall or to himself.

Either way, I didn’t have an answer. So I didn’t say anything. Instead I thought of what Mom would do when we were sick. I walked to Dad and leaned over and kissed him on the forehead.

My sister, maybe seeing his reaction, followed suit.

Then he started crying again, but not like he did in the shower. This time he gathered us in his arms and hugged us up like stuffed bears.

The next morning he was up before us. He was sitting at the table circling jobs in the local paper with a red Biro. No champagne, just water and toast. He smiled at us and looked a bit more like our dad. Just a photo of a photo now. Then he made us eggs.

”What did I ever need that angel for, huh? When I got two real angels right here.”

He was really trying. You could tell that much. His shirt was damp with sweat but he was trying.

&#x200B;

Me and my sister would sometimes talk about the angel. About what we’d do if it ever came back. How do you prepare for an angel visiting? Can you build a scarecrow that would keep a wingless angel away?

We didn’t think so but we tried anyway.

Maybe it wasn’t even an angel. Just something that to the right person at the right time looked like one. Fallen angels look for fallen men. Fallen men look for fallen angels.

We built the scarecrow in the attic, just under the skylight so the stars would drench it at night. We dressed it in Mom’s clothes, her best floral dress, pinks and lavender, and placed a pair of her shoes at its base. Then we crossed our fingers and climbed back down the ladder.
