The knock came from an impossible door.

A dozen lit candles sat on Alisa’s kitchen table, pooling orange light up half of the wall and casting shadows down the remainder. The light and shadows wavered and looked like two unsure oceans meeting.  The table itself was circular and woodgrained. The twelve candles were placed carefully around its edge like where numbers on a clock would be.

The knock came again.

It didn’t come from the home’s front door, nor the kitchen door. It came from the larder door — a tiny space there was no way into or out of except through the kitchen iteself. And no one had come through there.

”Come on,” came a voice. “Let me out of here. It’s dark as hell.”

Alisa slowly got up, paused a moment, then made her way to the larder door. “Hello?”

”Lady, let me out of here! You can’t summon me and keep me trapped. That ain’t right. That ain’t a good way to do business. Besides, you only got me for an hour.”

”You’re… you’ve not broken in, have you?”

”I’m not here to murder you, if that’s what you mean. You invited me. Hey, why would I lock myself in a cupboard if I was here to murder you?”

”It’s… It’s a larder,” she said.

”Same difference.

Alisa glanced at the candles, at the book on demonology that lay open on the table. It had worked? *It had worked.* This was what she’d wanted, what she’d hoped for. So why was she so scared now? Why wouldn’t her hand move to the latch?

”I won’t do business with you through a door,” he said. “I’m a face to face person, that’s what I am. So either you open or I’m going incommunicado.”

She took a heavy breath then unlocked the larder.

The door swung open, Alisa barely avoiding it.

A grey-stumbled man in a ragged looking trenchcoat stepped out. He had a bottle of wine — of Alisa’s wine — in his hand. He took a long swig as he stepped out, the grey hairs on his neck undulating as he drank.

”Are you… You’re a demon?”

”Well I ain’t no angel, lady.” He laughed and wiped his mouth. “But I’m no demon either. Unless you ask my ex-wife. Hey, maybe I am a demon!“ He lifted his arms and snarled at Alisa, who shrank back against the wall. He laughed again, said, “Nah, I’m no demon. I’m a big softy.“

”I meant to summon a demon.”

”Well lucky for you, there ain’t no such thing as a demon. There are people who die and there are people who aren’t yet dead. But that’s all there is. No angels, no demons, just people like us.”

Like us? she thought, a powerful shiver rattling her.

He screwed the lid back on the wine, then off again before he took another drink. “Beats corks.” He looked Alisa over, longer now, as if for the first time. “Why would someone like you want to summon a demon anyways?”

He sat down at the table and gestured for Alisa to sit next to him. She sat opposite instead, always with her eyes on her guest.

”I need to make a deal with one,” she said.

He laughed. “I can’t imagine that would go well! You think if demons were real, they’d stick to a deal?“

She shrugged. “I don’t have much choice.”

The look on her guest’s face changed, softened. “You in some sort of trouble?”

Alisa said nothing. She couldn’t say anything even if she wanted to. Her tongue was suddenly numb.

“Ah gee, I’ve been in trouble before. Bad trouble. Borrowed too much from the wrong people, you know? The real bad people. That kind of trouble. I don’t know how it ended exactly, but I know I ended up dead at some point because, ta-da!”

“That’s not very reassuring,” she whispered.

”Look, you summoned me. I can’t cut the kind of deal you might have been hoping for, but if I can help, I will at least try. You have my word.“

”I’m dying,” she said. “I found out three days ago. I’m terminal. I don’t have long.”

”Ah,” he said. He took a long drink of wine until there was nothing left in the bottle but gloopy dregs at the bottom. “Look, I won’t say dying is easy — no one dead really wants to be dead. But it’s not awful. It’s not as bad a you think it’s going to be. Making a deal to keep on living, well it might seem like—”

”I’m not scared,” she said. “Not of dying.“

”No?”

She shook her head. “No.”

”Then what?”

Her throat was dry; she swallowed hard. “I’m scared to tell my husband. To tell my daughter. I’m frightened to death of leaving them.”

The guest looked at the empty bottle of wine, tapped his pale fingers along its green-glass sides. “Ah. Yeah. I can see how that’d be tough. What a situation.”

”They’re both asleep upstairs.“

They sat in silence for a long while. The candle in the seventh position extinguihshed. A little more shadow spread onto the wall and floor. The guest tapped the empty bottle as he thought.

”Maybe I shouldn’t tell them,” she said. “At least not yet. That’d save them some of the burden.”

He tapped his bottle.

“Would you like another? There’s more wine in the larder.”

He opened his mouth. Closed it. Eventually said, “I kind of do remember why I died. And it wasn’t as glamorous as mobsters getting me or anything.“

”Oh?”

He pointed to the bottle. “Couldn’t stop. I just couldn’t. It wasn’t wine so much as it was anything at all.”

She nodded.

”I had a family. Two kids.“

”I’m sorry.”

”What I left of me for them,” he said. “What memories I left of me — of how I looked, how I acted, how I reeked of the sauce — that’s what they’ve got now. If I could have stopped, just for a few days, sobered up… I could have said goodbye to them. I could have chosen what memories to bestow upon them. I know that’s not the same as your situation but I just, I just thought you should know the truth.“

She nodded again, not sure what to say.

Another candle faded out, the eleventh.

He stood and looked at his left hand, already fading away. “Guess my hour’s up. I’m sorry you didn’t get to meet a real demon. One that could cut you a deal. One that could help.”

He looked so sad and pathetic, she thought. And beyond anything, he looked lonely.

She got up from her chair and walked to him. Wrapped her arms around him. Could smell his sour breath.

He stood rigid a moment, surprised. Then hugged her back. Hugged her tightly, imagined she was his wife, his children.

”You‘re not a demon but you helped all the same,” she said. “I’m lucky to have summoned you.”

”You are?”

And then he was gone and she was left with cold air and ten lit candles and a made-up mind.
