The two old friends sat on that bench in front of the lake and watched the skaters dance and fall.

Benny hadn’t seen Tyler in years. Not since before Tyler’s divorce, and that wasn’t so long after college had finished. They’d played baseball together back then, been pretty good friends, but not the type of friends to stay in touch should anything inconvenient get in the way.

Now they‘d bumped into each other at the winter market and decided to go to the lake to talk a little more, to catch up. Benny held a beer in a gloved hand and sipped it every now and then. He had more beers in a paper bag at his feet. He’d offered them but Tyler hadn’t wanted a drink.

Benny said, “So this thing, this parasite, it’s still in your head?”

Tyler nodded. “Yup. Still there.”

”Any idea what it looks like?”

“Something like a worm, doctors tell me. I never thought of it that way until they told me, but there you go.“

”A worm. Unreal.“ Benny shook his head. “And they can’t get it out?”

”Maybe they could,” said Tyler. “Thing is, its wound around the different parts of my brain and latched itself deep — right down into the primal area. They could do surgery and try to kill it or remove it, but they say it’s not growing so if I can live with it in my head then I should probably just keep it there.”

”It’s not growing? Not found enough food in that thick old head of yours, huh?” Benny raised his brows and laughed. It was the kind of joke he could have made back when they’d been friends but now, a dozen years later, it felt dated.

No, they were still friends. Just not as close as they’d once been.

“Thing about parasites is they don’t want to kill their host,” Tyler explained. “The smart ones don’t, at least. Because when the host dies, it’s very likely they die too. No more easy energy for them.”

Benny took a swig of beer and stared out over the lake. “Huh.”

Last week, a single sheet of ice covered the lake in front of them and yet no one had been allowed to skate. Back then, a crack had spidered down the center of the sheet and people were worried it might split proper any moment. Both sides of the ice had barely been holding on, like hands growing tired, until eventually they’d slipped away from each other.

More cracks had crept through the left ice sheet after that, until it was a handful of unsafe islands. The right sheet, however, had been deemed strong enough to skate on. As if letting go of the other sheet had helped it regain its strength. And now kids and parents in red hats and with steaming breath priouetted the circuit.

“It’s been a long while,” said Benny. “Since I last saw you out.”

”I couldn’t bring myself to go out much after Sue left.”

Benny felt a flush of heat even in the cold wind. Not that the marriage breaking down was his fault, but maybe he should have checked on his friend more than he had done — his friend who had fallen out of their social circle as suddenly as if he’d fallen down a well.

They’d all known what had happened. That she took their kid, too.

”It’s good that you can be out again, now. And you look the picture of health. You look better than when we was playing baseball. Not an ounce of fat on you.”

Silence, for a time. Then Tyler said, “It’s the parasite.”

”What? It’s eating your fat?”

”I must have gotten it from a food delivery. I got a lot of those during the years after they left. I’d get them to leave it in the porch so they didn‘t have to look at me. I looked like a bloated, sweaty moon and I didn’t want anyone to see me. Honestly, I despised myself.”

There was that heat again on Benny’s cheeks. But he was thinking of his own wife now and he wasn’t sure why. Him and his wife, they spent less time together since they’d had kids. It was tough, they were both tired. Arguments could rise up like mist, from nothing, no one’s fault. The fog’d eventually dissipate but it’d leave a cold dampness clinging to them both for a long time after.

“Then one day I wake up,” Tyler continued, ”and it’s as if I hear something talking right to my brain. As if there’s someone else in there — although I didn’t know what, at that point. Hey, it says. Hey, pal, we got to do something about this situation we’re in. This won’t work for either of us. Not in the long term.”

Benny didn’t know what to say. It was hyperbole, sure, but it was still an odd thing to say. A parasite talking to you.

”I order food later that day, Chinese — my favorite — and it gets there, sitting on the porch, the smell wafting into the house. And suddenly, I feel repulsed. I can’t eat it. I manage to get it in the kitchen and I know it looks good, and yet I’m seeing what might as well be boxes of mold.“

”That’s… That’s something,” said Benny.

”But I’m thirsty. I drink a lot of water.”

”You didn’t eat?”

”Not for maybe three days. I’ve tried a bunch of different takeout options by that point, but they all revolt me. So I dig out a pair of shoes and I go to the market. I figure I need to find something I can eat. Only thing I can stomach even looking at is veg and fruit.”

”Veg and fruit?”

”So that’s my diet for a long time. I lose a lot of weight, as if I’ve shedded my old skin, and out I step. Literally, out I step. I started coming out more often. Walking. Watching the lake, hiking the hills — all alone, mind you. And at night, for the first time since she left, I slept properly. There was a soothing voice in my head saying it was going to be okay. It was alright, things happened, mistakes happened. It was okay.”

Benny laughed but it wasn’t much of a laugh. “So a parasite moves into your head and tells you it’s all okay, and it really is okay. It becomes okay.”

”Right. Sometimes, maybe, that’s all you need. A friend, of sorts. Someone to tell you that life goes on. That it’s okay, just look after yourself and the clouds will pass.”

Benny finished his beer and crumpled the can. He watched the ice, saw the little unsafe islands that had shrunk since even yesterday. Felt a warm heat again; he didn’t like them shrinking.

“Well,” said Tyler. “I best get moving.”

”Same. Wife and kids, they’ll be wondering where Pa is.”

”I got another scan later. Lot of doctors interested in me these days.”

”Sounds like a pain.”

”It’s not so bad.”

”We should do this again sometime,” said Benny. He’d blurted it out, almost desperate, and he didn’t know why. He thought he wanted to say something else but that’s what had come out.

Tyler smiled, got up, and walked towards the car park, leaving Benny and his bag of beers to watch over the lake.

Benny wasn’t ready to go home yet. He wanted to but wasn’t ready. There was a clear view of the lake here, no fog at all.

He looked at the ice and wondered just when exactly the first big crack had appeared. He wondered if anyone had known which side of the ice would survive. How would you judge such a thing?

He wondered about the parasite in his friend’s head, too. Maybe it wasn’t what had caused Tyler’s changes after all. Maybe Tyler had decided — even if subconsciously — that he needed to make urgent changes to his life, before his life ended early. His body or mind, or a combination of both, had reached breaking point and rebelled.

Maybe that’s all it was.

Benny took another beer out and cracked it open.
