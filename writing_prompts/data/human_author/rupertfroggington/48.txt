I sat on the floor in the kid’s room thinking about infinity and how long that could realistically be. I stretched and loosened a rubber band between my thumb and index finger, repeating the motion as I considered.

Out the window, against a white breath of cloud, a bird hovered in the sky, perfectly still. As if it were a paper cutout of a blackbird pasted onto the cloud.

Nothing in the world moved. Nothing except me.

The lady who summoned me still sat on the little bed, clutching the lamp on her lap, staring at where I’d been standing two years ago when she’d first made the wish. She had eyes the color of grass drenched in morning dew.

She’d found my lamp in a thrift shop where my creator had jammed it between an old record player and a woman’s blonde wig. Taken it to her kid’s room.

This room, the kid’s room, was full of similar oddities: three other lamps (two bronze, one silver) sitting on shelves next to giant Lego insects. A miniature wishing well positioned against a wall, complete with water and at least two dozen tossed coins. A half-collapsed birthday cake with ten candles. A shooting star with a glitter-tail glued on one of the walls.

Nothing had worked for her before. And still, even though she’d rubbed my lamp and I’d arrived in a plume of smoke, nothing was going to work for her now, either.

Her wish was simple (in theory): She wished her kid was still alive.

Only seven words. No room for misinterpretation. A solid wish, all in all.

As soon as she’d made it, god had metaphorically placed his finger to his lips and hushed the universe. Only I was left awake, with all the time in the world to make her wish come true.

Except, I can’t do magic. Not like she needed. If she’d wished for a new house, sure, no problem. It might’ve taken me a year to build, but I’d have got it done. If she’d wanted money, I’d have walked into a bank and filled up a few sacks.

But she’d wished for the impossible.

Of course, I hadn’t just given up. I’d read all the latest research on cloning — that’d been my first thought, to clone him. I’d find a hair and I’d clone the kid and grow him back to ten, put him in front of his ma, and voila! Your wish has come true.

But cloning wasn’t that advanced yet. And besides, the kid’s head would have been empty. The old memories wouldn’t be stuffed into it. That is to say, it wouldn’t be her kid. Just a very good painting of him.

I had other ideas too. Ideas that involved the occult. But again, if I’d brought something back, it wouldn’t have been her kid. Not really.

So what to do.

The rubber banned snapped, falling limply to the carpet.

His name was Robbie. He’d played soccer. He’d been walking home after practice when a car had swerved, drunk driver.

He didn’t die instantly. Slow, protracted, unable to wake in his hospital bed.

It’s no wonder the woman who’d wished me to life looked like a husk of a human. As if something inside her had left with her kid. Maybe everything inside her.

I knew all about her too — I’ve had a lot of time on my hands. She’d worked at a beauty salon. Was married, had the one kid. Kid’s death had torn the marriage apart — her and her husband both looked like him, in different ways, and couldn’t bear to see each other. He’d moved out, on mutual agreement. A temporary separation that was already six months long.

She‘d worked for a charity before all this happened. At a shop not unlike the one she’d found my lamp in. Unpaid, but she’d spend one day each weekend running the shop, helping organise the items, checking sales and accounts, etc. She’d usually purchase a thick coat or two when she left her shift, handing them to shivering vagrants before heading home. Just doing her bit to try to make the world a little easier for people. To make life easier — because life isn’t easy for everyone. That much I know.

I sighed, my body deflating a little. I’m mostly air and smoke, after all.

I didn’t have a family — it was like that for genies. I’d been created. I had a creator — not that I knew my creator. My head had been filled with knowledge, as if someone held a sieve to my ear and just poured a bucket of facts into me. I’d been told the rules, and then I’d been wedged into the thrift shop.

If I didn’t make this wish come true, then I’d be unmade. That was the main rule.

And for whatever reason, even though I hadn’t had much of a life yet, I didn’t want to lose it.

But how selfish was it of me to keep the world forever frozen just to go on existing like this?

I thought about that a good while.

I looked at the woman and thought about it some more.

The kid’s bedroom hadn’t changed since his death — nothing removed, only items added to it.

No wonder she couldn’t move on. Her world had been as frozen as mine.

With a heavy sigh I stood and clicked my fingers. The blackbird outside flapped its wings and shot out of sight.

The woman on the bed looked at me. “Did you hear me? That’s my wish.”

I nodded. “I did, but I’m sorry, not even a genie can do that. There’s no going back, only forward.”

She was trembling.

”But you *can* go forward. You don’t need a wish for that. You just need to take it one day at a time. And right now it might feel like a nail is being driven into your heart, but in a year’s time that nail might feel like a pin instead.“

The lady was crying into her palms. Shaking on the bed.

”I’m sorry,” I said.

I didn’t know how long I had before I’d be unmade, so I took my chance and walked over to her. I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her.

After a while she said, sniffing, “You feel like a soft blanket.”

I said nothing to that. What could I say?

”I knew it, really. I think I’ve always known it.“ She looked around the room. “I was hoping for a miracle. For a wish. But hearing it from you — from an actual genie — that there’s no going back. No bringing him back…” She stood up and walked to the wall where the shooting star was. Tore it down and scrunched it up.

”I guess it’s time I faced reality,” she said. She gave a tearful laugh.

“There are people out there who can help,” I said. I knew that much from my research into other parents who’d been through similar situations, as I’d tried to figure out how they got through it. “There are therapists for a start. They can’t erase the pain but they can help you hold it in your hands and look at it.”

She nodded. Whispered: “I’ll try. I really will.”

Then I felt a tug on my very being, as if I were water in a bath and the plug had been removed.

I gasped as the lamp dragged me into it. Tried to scream.

But my voice was silent.

”I wish for a giant teddy bear,” said the little kid with a lisp. “Twice the size of me! Maybe more!”

Then the world paused, the kid’s almost toothless mouth still half-open.

I was still dazed. I hadn’t expected to exist, let alone be in front of a kid who’d just made a wish.

A giant teddy bear? I felt like I could do that.

It took me a moment to realise this was the same room that I’d been in before. Although, almost totally different now. New wallpaper, new bed. No wishing well or anything like that.

I looked at the kid. She was almost a little familiar. Something about those green eyes.

I didn’t cry. Genies don’t ever cry. But… maybe a drop of water leaked out of my eye.

I wiped it away and clapped my hands together. I had work to do. Time to make the softest, friendliest, most beautiful teddy the world had ever seen.
