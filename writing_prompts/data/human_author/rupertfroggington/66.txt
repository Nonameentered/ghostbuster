We sit in chairs in the yard, me and my son, gazing up at the night. The chairs’ brand is *Zero Gravity* and they let you lean back so far you think you’re going to tip over. Guess the idea is they hold you upright like an invisible hand, floating.

Above us, alien ships dart in zigzags of light that look impossible to hit. Yet we get them all the same — they burn up quickly, like dry leaves, a flash of intense heat then gone.

When our ships are hit they burn for a much longer time — they cook like sausages on a barbecue until they’re the same charcoal-black as the space around them.

”Looking like another good night,” says my son.

The sky is full of burning leaves, of dying fireflies that flew too high and suffocated in the nothing.

”Looks it,” I say.

The radio sings from the open kitchen door behind us. My daughter-in-law and her two kids are inside. Finger-painting or making art from food.

It’s been like this for a lot of people since the invasion. We’ve become nocturnal, we watch the sky with the eyes of hunting-owls, we watch for the flakes of fire. No one sleeps well knowing what’s going on above them, so instead we watch what we can then sleep when the sun blots the war out.

My son dangles an arm like a rod, fishing up a beer from the grass, eyes always on the sky. “I still don’t get it,“ he says. “They’ve got technology millennia ahead of us.”

”That’s true,” I say.

”So then how are we winning night after night? Why aren’t they adapting to our tactics? Not that I’m complaining, but you know, I don’t get it.”

It’s a common enough question. The standard answer is that the aliens weren’t prepared for a world united. We were tribes and now we’re one country. Together we have the power and numbers to repel them. Sharing tactical info with China, providing knowledge of the skies as a global community. We’ve constructed an unexpected home advantage.

I sip my beer but don’t answer. I’m not confident enough to offer anything.

Elise and her children join us. The kids show us their artwork, their proud faces brighter than anything above us.

I’d never seen my grandkids before the invasion began. Only a photo. Me and my son fell out over money, of all things. I’d loaned him a lot when he’d been hard-up. He’d gambled it and lost it and I’d loaned him more. And I’d never seen a penny back.

Seems so stupid now.

The pasta-art is macaroni and penne glued onto a black sheet of paper. Some of the pasta ships have trails of finely grated cheese coming out of their rears. There’s a war going on for title of galaxy’s best pasta.

”Say, wow, that’s great. It’s really great.” I mean it, too. I was never much of artist.

They’ve all been staying with me since the invasion. My place is big enough for us. It’s the same place my son grew up in, before his mother died, and even then it was far too big for the three of us.

”What were you guys talking about?” asks my daughter-in-law.

”How we’re winning. How it’s possible, I mean.”

She makes the sign of the cross. “Let’s just hope it holds up.”

”Been another good night so far,” says my son.

That sets me thinking again. How are we doing this?

There have been very few captured aliens. Apparently there are two but the public’s never seen them. I can only think there are so few because they don’t want to be captured.

Back when I was in the military the countries we invaded were fractured, like how earth was when the aliens came. Countries with a dozen different tribes united in their efforts to repel us. Good for them — we’d do the same, and earth did do the same.

I remember one night playing cards with a few of the higher ranks, talking about this phenomenon. Of how we’re a common enemy and every country needs a common enemy to be united. I remember saying, We could use this, you know. Because when you conquer a divided country, you never really conquer it. Maybe one of the tribes has surrendered but the others will go on fighting. You can’t negotiate with a dozen leaders because they will rarely all be happy with the same solution. You can’t force a hundred leaders into the same decision — into surrendering. It’s like trying to sell parts of a jigsaw to many different shoppers and hoping they’ll all be happy with their purchase.

But if you could somehow unite an entire country or planet under just one leader, or one set of leaders who spoke for everyone, then a full surrender and negotiation would become a lot more realistic.

That’s what I thought back then, at least. But it’d been late and I’d been drinking a lot that night.

”Granddad, look at mine! Look at mine!” Another pasta work of art presents itself.

I pick my granddaughter up and sit her on my lap. My stubble tickles her cheek and she laughs. Everyone else is staring up at the sky, but not me.

Maybe the real war isn’t up there. Misdirection on a global scale.

But even I can’t help looking up eventually.

Could be I’m wrong, after all. Could be we really are stronger united and that’s why we’re winning. And either way, at least — for now — we’re all together.

I squeeze my granddaughter a little tighter as we watch the war above us, poppies blossoming and wilting, until dawn comes and pulls the curtain down.
