Thanks for the feedback! The intention is something like: wishes are bad because of what he’s wishing for (that’s if any of the wishes actually worked and weren’t just coincidences). He thinks he’s happy being comfortable with his life but deep down he knows it’s not going anywhere. He’s stalled and subconsciously he’s in pain. He’s got a bad job, refuses to make any big decisions, is in a relationship that’s going nowhere, and he’s lying to himself that he’s happy. He’s wishing it’s okay but it’s not. His subconscious makes a wish that he needed to make but was avoiding.
