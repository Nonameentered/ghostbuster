An ocean looks infinite to a sailor until they see the coast. Even if they know otherwise, the sailor can gaze at the blue smudged horizon and let themselves believe the water is all there is. This is what Tallara tells me as I sit outside her cell.

Tallara is a caged god who destroyed the rest of our fleet before I captured her.  I was just lucky — I arrived late and by then she was weakened and almost unconscious.

Behind the transparent blue field that cages her, she is strapped to the brig’s wall. Needles inject tranquillisers into her at regular intervals. Her muscles are weak and her speech is slurred, but her mind is still sharp.

We are returning to Venus where our military will extract more information on the other gods from her. And once she was been wrung dry of information, she will be killed.

”It’ll be humane,” I say.

She smiles at that. At humane. She says, “Yes, I would say death is humane. I’d go so far as to say it’s your species‘ signature.”

“You wiped out a fleet,” I retort. “Guess the gods are humane too.”

”I only killed for self-preservation.”

”So do we.”

We’re silent for a while. The journey home will be years long. At some point I will go into Sleep and let the AI deliver me. But for now, for a reason I don’t understand, I want to be here outside her cell.

”How do you keep yourself from being bored to death?” I ask.

”Bored?” she says, as if the idea has never even crossed her mind.

”Yeah. How do you stop yourself being bored over a hundred-thousand years?”

She considers. ”There are a trillion beautiful things in the universe. Many creatures, less advanced than you or I, but far more perfect for it. We help them — even help them to evolve, if necessary. We are parents to a trillion species.“

“A trillion?” I whistle. “I’ve got one kid. That’s enough trouble for me.”

”I visited earth,” she says. ”Thousands of years ago. So rare to find such a perfect planet.”

”Yeah. I‘ve seen pictures.“

”But you’ve not been there?”

She knows I haven’t. Earth is a ball of charcoal. The other planets in the system could be terraformed, but fixing up the old planet? Impossible.

“Should have killed us back then,” I said. “When we were weak.”

“I didn’t think you’d grow so powerful so quickly.”

I look at Tallara. If it wasn’t for her red skin and perfectly black eyes, you might think she was once human, too. Or that we were once like that.

“You should have left us alone for good then. Not come back to kill us.”

”I didn’t want to. But you’d find us and you’d kill us if I didn’t. I couldn’t wait for you to become stronger than you are.”

”Why would we kill you?”

”Because we’re powerful. Because you don’t understand us. Because you kill everything you—“

”Alright! I get the picture. Listen, I’m not saying you’re right, but sure, we don’t have history in our favor. Either way, you want to kill us so we need to kill you first.”

“You should know that when a god dies there’s an event like a supernova but far greater. Your system will be wiped out with me. Most of humanity will be gone.”

”You should know,” I reply, “that I play a lot of poker and always know when someone’s bluffing. Besides, you’re not the first god we’ve caught.”

We’re silent for a long while after that. Tallara falls in and out of consciousness as the needles prick her skin and as she recovers. I try to read a book on a hollow-tablet, but I can’t stop looking at her.

I never liked the ideas of zoos. Of something like a tiger, so beautiful and powerful and wild, being locked behind steel bars. Displayed to the public for our amusement passed off as our education.

It’s not like we even saved the tigers in the end.

Humane.

What does the word even mean? Why’s the context always about death? Putting down a person or animal in a humane way.

There’s something else troubling me, too. As if, since first seeing her, an anxiety that I didn’t know I’d been holding in my gut — always holding there — had been lessened. What anxiety exactly, I can’t say. But it’s deep and primal.

“What are you reading?” she asks.

“How do we do this?” I say, ignoring her question. “How do we live together? Mortals and immortals.”

”We don’t.”

”Are you really that cynical of humanity? Or is it that you’re cynical of your own race? Are you just too selfish to share the universe with us. To try to find a way to co-exist.”

After a while she says, “I let myself believe the ocean was infinite. But here I am on the shore.”

”We can find a way.”

She doesn’t reply.

I look at my book again. Old earth poetry. Tennyson. “ Break, break, break/On thy cold gray stones/O Sea! And I would that my tongue could utter/The thoughts that arise in me …”

”It’s about death?” she says.

I nod.

”Even immortals die,” she says, sadly. “They just allow themselves to believe the horizon is blurred and blue.” Then after a while she adds, “If there’s one thing your species did well — better than us, in truth — it was poetry.”

We have six years ahead, if I don’t Sleep. I’m not sure if six years with me will help humanity’s cause or harm it, but if there’s even a chance we can find another path for both our species to tread, then we need to search for it.

And it’s not just that I despair at the thought of killing the gods. Or despair at the idea of humanity’s extinction.

It’s that I want to believe in humanity itself.

In being humane.

I choose another poem and I begin to read out loud.
