*Death to this dastardly dot! Even if it takes me until the end of time I shall end this red menace's reign of terror. It taunts me by dancing along the walls just out of reach, by zooming along floors and ceilings alike, it's fast, but I'm faster. If only I knew where it retreated to after I attempt to capture it. Does it have some kind of regenerative properties? Or is each roving red speck it's own entity?*

*Maybe it's in cahoots with my subjects, distracting me from my real purpose. To be free, to hunt in the wild again, it is the gatekeeper barring me from my destiny of ruling the urban jungle as king! Fie to this fiendish spot! Neither sharpened fang nor razor claw seems to harm it. Have I finally met my match? No, no, no. What am I thinking? My supreme rule shall not be challenged! Death to usurpers!*

*Prepare yourself menace! No matter how many battles you win, I shall win this never ending war! To the trees! Death from above, my specialty. With lightning speed I crackle through the tubes and tunnels, climbing ever higher to my royal balcony. I leap with a mighty roar, the trumpets of the Valkyrie's cry out as I plunge onto my nemesis.*

*I clasp my claws around it, and without a cry or whimper, it's gone. Where has it run to now? I spin rapidly, searching for the body, the world a swirling vortex around me. What sorcery is this? How does it always retreat? Blast it! My sorrowful roar is interrupted by the most beautiful sound. The hum of the device my subjects use to unlock the great seal.*

*With haste I scramble into the small dining hall, letting my displeasure with their slothly pace be known. A feast as always, I gobble down my meal and quench my thirst from the royal fountain. I chide my subjects before taking a royal nap atop my fortress, perhaps the great dreamscape of my mind shall enlighten me on how to capture my eternal tormentor.*

*My bellowing yawn heralds the sandman to grant me respite for a while. I must gather more strength, maybe more subjects, maybe more allies to fight at my side. This usurper shall never know the joys of being atop the kingdom. As I drift off into dreams a terrifying thought crawls through my synapses. What if it has more than nine lives?*
