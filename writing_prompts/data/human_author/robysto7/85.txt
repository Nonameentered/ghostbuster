The bills were starting to outpace the profits at my shop. It wasn't the economy slowly falling into a recession or that chandeliers were gong out of fashion for the high society types, it was something far worse. The chandeliers were killing people without fail. Three people dead in Paris, one in the small seaside town of Sapienza, and two more in Dubai. According to the news all were deemed accidents. I knew the truth, I was cursed. Good thing my dad wasn't here to watch me destroy the business he had built from scratch. 

The store was closed today while I tried to figure out a way to pull myself out of this mess. I flipped through the overwhelming mountain of bills on my desk, I was screwed. It would take a miracle to save the business. 

*Ding dong!*

I ignored the first ring of the doorbell, maybe the person didn't see the big 'Closed' sign on the door. I pulled up the doorbell camera on my phone, the video feed wasn't working. 

*Ding dong!*

I trudged out of the office to see who was out front, hopefully it wasn't a bill collector. I carefully walked across the shop making sure not to step directly under any of the showroom chandeliers. I opened the tinted glass door to the shop to greet my unexpected guest.

A pretty middle aged woman eyed me up down as the door opened. Her auburn hair done up in a fancy bun, piercing blue eyes dominated her stoic face. She wore a dark blue blazer with a black blouse underneath. Her black knee length skirt showed off her toned calves. Simple black heels completed the outfit. She clutched an expensive looking black leather briefcase.

"Are you the eponymous "Crystal" Charlie, the proprietor of this establishment?" She asked curtly. Her British accent carried an air on authority.

"I am. Sorry but we're closed today. Come back tomorrow. Have a nice day." I smiled at the woman, she was dressed like a bill collector so I tried to blow her off. She confidently strolled into the shop past me, standing directly under the large chandelier in the center of the showroom. I tensed up, I'd never actually seen a chandelier crush someone, it sounded painful.

"Lovely little shop you have here, very quaint. Chandeliers are not very fashionable these days are they? May we talk in your office?" She politely asked.

I watched the chandelier, waiting for the inevitable. Nothing happened. "Which past due balance is this about?" I groaned.

The woman eyed me curiously, a sly smile crossed her face. "Quite the opposite, if you'd like to hear what I have to say we can do that in private." She tapped her briefcase.

I hesitantly led her into the office. "Would you like some coffee?" I asked trying to be a good host. 

"Do you have any tea?"

"No."

"Coffee's acceptable then." The woman watched me carefully as I served the coffee. She placed her briefcase flat on my desk. "Pleasure to meet you in person Charles, you've become quite an invaluable asset these past few years. I'm here to give you your severance for many years of dutiful service to my employers."

I had no clue what this woman was talking about. "I think you've got the wrong guy. I only own the shop, I don't have another employer."

The woman sipped her coffee and grimaced. She slid the coffee mug towards me. "Do any of these people look familiar to you?" She opened the briefcase and slid over a stack of high resolution pictures. The pictures were of the people I'd read about who were crushed by my chandeliers.

"Saw these people on the news." I replied coldly.

"Those are Dalia Margolis, Viktor Novikov, Richard Delahunt, Marcus Stuyvesant, and Carl Ingram. All very powerful people who met a common end, crushed by a chandelier that you sold to various shell interior design companies over the years. They were in fact purchased by my top operative, he has an eye for the finer things in life, and he loves the craftsmanship of your light fixtures. 

I'm going against the board's wishes by being here but I couldn't in good conscience let your shop go under after it has done so much good for the world. Inside here will take care of your bill problem, and much more." She pushed the briefcase towards me.

I examined the contents of the briefcase. Binders filled with accounting documents, balance sheets, tax records. A stack of passports, birth certificates, medical records, everything to start a new life. Before I could ask about it the woman explained.

"We've purchased the building so you no longer have to pay your lease. Mortgage for your home is paid off as well. We've moved your business holdings to the Cayman islands as a tax haven, retirement and college funds have been deposited into Swiss bank accounts that pay a high interest rate. If you want to start fresh you hold all the documentation necessary to do so for yourself and your family. 

This is in exchange for closing down your shop, sell something else for a change. We can't risk overusing your products for our work, it's becoming a pattern, don't want anyone to pick up on that pattern. Maybe open a pet store? A bistro perhaps? Just don't serve that coffee to your customers. If you have any questions you have my card." She stood up quickly and left the shop without another word. 

Her business card was fancy, felt expensive, good thick stock. Simple cursive writing read 'Diana Burnwood' ICA, a small QR code in the bottom left corner. Maybe curses and gifts aren't so different after all.
