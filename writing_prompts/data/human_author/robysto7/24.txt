***Parabellum***

Generals and bureaucrats have always sought out a familiar place throughout history to make plans for war. A bar, a tavern, an inn, or whatever they called it during their lifetimes. Paul's Piano Bar in the heart of Star City naturally became the site of negotiations between the supers and the schmucks. The shaky peace between the two opposing factions was on the brink of collapse. Something every super along with every schmuck knows is that in Star City, new year's eve and day are off limits. No super activity allowed. Magnetron broke that rule. He ripped the children's wing of Star City hospital off with his magnetic control powers. Held the wing above the city, threatening to drop it unless his demands were met. He wanted a meeting.

Five supers: Fuzion, Nighthawk, Meteor Man, Scarlet Shadow, and Frozen Flame brokered the deal with their five schmuck counterparts. Dr. Neutron, Will O' The Wisp, Mason Maniacal, Queen Bee, and of course; Magnetron. A minefield of interpersonal relationships ran the table. Between these ten some were secret lovers on opposite sides, some had secret alliances, others just hated the other side's guts.

Fuzion and Dr. Neutron tried to calm their respective super and schmuck comrades. Fuzion was still head of the table for the supers despite no longer being active, no more day-to-day, only worked global emergencies. She never thought the day would come when she would have to use her trump card. She prayed for it to work, if war broke out it would be all over. Her daughter wouldn't have a world to live in, she couldn't let that happen. Not even she knew what was going to happen, only that it was promised to work.

The trump card arrived bursting through the front doors of the bar. The supers were confused, the schmucks angry when Detective Falcona burst in. She went straight to the bar, hopping over it and grabbing a bottle of Glenlivet 18, no glass. Her burgundy trench coat was tied tight, her matching pork pie hat pulled down low, long raven hair cascading past her shoulders.

Piercing blue eyes scanned every person around the banquet turned negotiating table carefully, her gaze lingering on Magnetron.

"We're closed for a private event detective. Leave now." Magentron's snooty voice rang out. He motioned towards the front door with his flowing red cape.

"SHUT THE FUCK UP MAGNET BOY!" Falcona yelled firmly. She ripped the cork from the bottle with her teeth and spit it at Magnetron. Mason Maniacal held him back. Falcona slugged back a shot.  She grimaced and lit a smoke.

"Any of you fucking morons know what '*Si vis pacem, para bellum'* means? Neutron don't answer that because I know you know the answer." She growled.

Nighthawk raised his hand. "If you want peace, then prepare for war." He said solemnly.

"Correct answer Bird Boy. Putting that college education to use I see. I have been preparing for war for longer than most of you costumed morons have been playing dress-up and play fighting with each other. That is why there will be no war. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not never!" Falcona slammed her fist on the table.

Magnetron floated into the air above the table, his liquid metal mask morphed into an oni mask. "I've grown so tired of you detective. Acting like you own this entire city, that your're better than us, despite being a puny normal. You can't stop us, nobody can. My time has come!"

Falcona threw her hat down in frustration. "Sit. The. Fuck. Down. Magnet. Boy. Listen. Closely." Falcona's words dripped with rage. Magnetron complied, his mask returning to its neutral state of nothingness, a mirror of the world.

"Make no mistake. I do not come here bearing an olive branch, I come bearing a cleansing fire. There will be no war, because I will wipe you all off the face of this Earth before you can wage it. I am not above a preemptive strike. Schmucks, teach Magnet Boy a lesson for breaking the new year's detente. Get back to having your petty squabbles, throw away your dumbass delusions of grandeur. Capiche?" Falcona exhaled a massive plume of smoke.

Angry murmurs erupted from the schmucks. Dr. Neutron calmed them down. "Detective please, you really expect us to believe that? Since when did you gain the power to kill us all? Think I would have heard about that." Dr. Neutron smugly said.

Falcona smirked at the doc. "I don't. Connor Chaos does."

"Ha! Ha! Ha! Chaos is dead detective, you killed him, been hitting the bottle too hard?" Dr. N asked.

Another large gulp of scotch passed Falcona's lips. "Connor Chaos is alive. I faked his death, he's been my prisoner ever since, little pet project of mine."

"Bullshit." Said a few supers and schmucks in unison.

Falcona strode over to the bar to turn on the tv. She tuned it to the college basketball game on SCSN. The starshines were up by ten on the wildbears. She returned to the head of the table and pulled out her cellphone. Eyes widened and jaws dropped when she turned the screen towards them.

Connor Chaos waved from his dank, dark, windowless cell being lit by a small television showing the game. "Hello there friends and adversaries. Seeing you all again is incredible, really puts loneliness into perspective. How is everyone?" Connor's gentle voice trembled.

Silence fell across the room. Falcona propped her phone up so everyone could see. "Conman can you kindly explain to everyone what's gonna happen to them?" Falcona asked politely.

"You can do it, I like hearing your voice detective." Falcona rolled her eyes. She pulled a gold locket from under her coat, she opened it, letting it hang freely from her neck. A small red button was concealed inside.

"Some of you know this, some of you don't. Nobody in this room has super powers. You're lab rats. Connor's twisted experiment. I can explain every single person's power in this room, it's not magic, it's not alien, it's genetic engineering using quantum biology. Like any good schmuck Connor has contingency plans.

This button triggers a bomb inside Connor's heart, killing him instantly, that triggers the dead man's switch. Once he goes, anybody who's got even the slightest bit of super genes is gonna be ripped apart on a sub-atomic level. I'm guessin that hurts."

Queen Bee buzzed with anger. "You're bluffing!"

Connor Chaos laughed. "She's not. What did you expect me to do? Not have a way to destroy my creation if it got out of hand? I've read Frankenstein, I know how that story ends if you don't take precautions."

Falcona took a victory sip, she watched the schmucks hopes die in real time right before her eyes. Supers looked relieved. "I hate repeating myself but I must insist. There will be no war because there will be no more soldiers. I have upheld an oath to protect this city at all costs, but this has gone beyond that. This threatens what little family I have left, and you will not fuck that up for me.

Go back to the way it was. I will not hesitate to destroy the fragile peace to prevent all out destruction. This is not a negotiation, there will be no more discussions, you will keep the new year's detente sacred, you will all stay in your lanes. Give me more time to end the war the way it should be ended. Through compassion, and understanding. And Magnet Boy, if you ever threaten children again, I'm gonna throw you in a place where you'll pray to be taken to hell for better accommodations."

Falcona kept the scotch bottle and retrieved her hat. Didn't say goodbye. Horus the hypnotist was waiting outside for her.

"How'd it go?" He asked.

"Good enough. Go in there and take the details out of their brains but keep the overall message in tact. If anyone ever wages war against my family again, they'll be fucking dead. Really drive that point home."

Horus groaned. "I can't hypnotize Scarlet Shadow."

"I'll deal with her later then. Follow my instructions to the letter Horus, I brought it with me today." Falcona flashed a small ankh pinned inside her collar, Horus was unique, his powers couldn't be explained. All Falcona knew was that if the ankh was broken he'd be just an average joe again.

Super politics makes super strange bedfellows.
