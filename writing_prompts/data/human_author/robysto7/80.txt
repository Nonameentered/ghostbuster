Joe Krazowski was having a slow day at the flea market, lot of looky lous, not many buyers. He took a swig from his flask, at least it was sunny outside. A nice late summer afternoon with a gentle breeze. 

"How much for this one? There's no price on it." Asked a heavyset middle aged man. 

Joe looked over the classic pulp comic the man asked about. "Issue seventeen of The Phenomenal Phantom. Classic issue. Twelve bucks, twenty if you want to know the true story behind it." 

The heavyset man handed over twenty dollars. The Phenomenal Phantom line of books were loosely based on true stories. Joe would know. He appeared in multiple issues during the long running series under his alias 'The Sinister Schmo'. 

"So in this one 'The Arctic Wind' is gonna use his high tech freeze ray to bring the city to its knees. Once he tries to use it to stop double P it don't work quite as he planned. Turned out to be just a big air conditioner. The book says that double P had swapped out the diamond that powered it with a fake. That never happened.

What really happened was that Arctic Wind did make a doomsday device. Had he used it on double P he coulda shattered him with a hammer. I had one of my crew, real science nerd type, infiltrate his hideout and rewire the machine. Made sure it couldn't do nothin catastrophic."

A small group had gathered during Joe's story. A young woman held up another issue. "What about this one?" She asked.

"Twenty dollars and I'll tell ya." Joe chuckled. She paid him.

"Ah. Issue thirty-seven; I like this one too. Melinda the Muse develops a pheromone that brings people under her control with a fanatical, almost lustful devotion. She tainted a batch of a popular brand of lipstick, so it spread quickly, all it took was a kiss. Double P stops her because she can't control him. The book is a character piece, she can't control double P because he's a strong willed individual immune to becoming a mindless drone. Couldn't be further from the truth.

I arranged for a shall we say.............. a hooker to visit double P the night before the lipstick hit the shelves. One of my boys has connections at the docks, knew when the product was moving. Got me a sample that I synthesized an antidote for. This young lady's lips had the antidote applied to them. Now you ain't supposed to kiss hookers but double P is a gentlemen. It was funny watching him going around smooching people to cure them."

Some teenage nerd wearing a Phenomenal Phantom t-shirt scoffed. "If you're always bailing out the Phenomenal Phantom how come he caught you robbing the museum? Issue six."

Joe took another swig of his flask. "Good story behind that one. I knew I would never succeed at boosting Van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. Double P is a lover of the arts like I am. The museum was having trouble selling tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit. I figured they could use the publicity. I wasn't very subtle about it, didn't try to be."

The day ended up being profitable for old Joe. Truth really is stranger than fiction.
