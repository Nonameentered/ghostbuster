"You have had some stupid ideas in the past but this has to rank top ten, maybe top five." Bryce teased his fiancee Ashley as he watched her try to wrangle their cat Meowser. He was quick for his size, Meowser was spoiled so he was a chunky boy. After an epic struggle Ashley managed to secure the small camera to Meowser's collar.

"How much did you spend on this?" Bryce asked.

Ashley rolled her eyes. "Our bank accounts aren't joined yet so none of your business honey. Are you not at all curious to what he does when he goes outside and disappears?"

Bryce shook his head, "Not in the slightest. If I had to guess he annoys the neighbors for food then naps in the sunshine. I don't think Meowser is going on any epic adventures. You do you though."

"I knew you'd come around to it. This camera has every feature, shoots in 4k, automatic night vision for low light, even has infrared capabilities. Wherever Meowser goes and sees, we'll see it too. Maybe we'll get some funny cat videos out of it. Rake in some karma."

Meowser bolted for the door like he always did when Ashley opened it. An orange streak shooting into the distance, little did Ashley know the footage she would get back would change the course of human history forever.

Ashley's new evening routine was no longer spent binge watching whatever carbon copy drama was trending with Bryce, it was spent scrubbing through the footage of Meowser's daily journeys. She fast forwarded through Meowser's morning ritual of going down the street to have a staring contest at the neighbor's cat through their sliding glass door and his afternoon nap, the two constants of the cat's life. That's when the footage got weird. Everyday around two pm Meowser would meet up with a gang of seven other cats from around the neighborhood.

Sometimes it was behind a dumpster, sometimes in the park, sometimes an underground car park. A clandestine cat mafia. One would expect fights, attempts at feline romance, or an orgy of grooming one another, but nothing of the sort happened. All the cats formed a circle sitting perfectly still. Their eyes tracking something in the center of the circle, not a meow or hiss to be heard. The meetings could last anywhere from thirty minutes to two hours. After they wrapped up Meowser would return home for dinner.

Ashley reconfigured the camera each morning hoping to find the right settings to record whatever phenomena was occurring. Weeks went by with no success. Ashley bought more expensive equipment, invested in better video analysis software. Spent more time alone watching the footage, obsession slowly taking priority over all else.

Bryce watched the footage with her sometimes, he didn't really get the allure of a group of cats sitting in a circle, he started to become more distant. Ashley didn't notice. She didn't care about that. She just wanted more footage.

"Bryce! Bryce wake up right now!" Ashley yelled out from the small guest bedroom across the hall of the apartment. Bryce checked his phone. Three forty in the morning. "Bryce get in here! You have to see this!" Ashley was going to wake up the neighbors if she kept yelling like that. Bryce slunk out of bed into the guest room. Ashley sat frozen in her leather office chair, Meowser purred loudly from her lap.

The monitor screen bathed the room in harsh light. Bryce rubbed his eyes and let his vision adjust. "What are you yelling about?" He asked through a yawn.

"I was right, Meowser's been up to something. Something weird." Ashley's hands shook as she pressed play on the new footage she pulled from the sd card of the new camera.

The meeting took place at the old abandoned pool, the cat circle in the middle of the drained deep end. A trio of basketball sized white orbs floated in the air, randomly changing directions and configurations. They pulsed in rhythm, then disappeared in a flash. Ashley rewound and played it back in slow motion.

Bryce reached down to pet Meowser. "What am I looking at here? What are those things?"

Ashley squeezed Bryce's hand, her hand was freezing. "I have no clue. This is from a wide spectrum ultraviolet camera, human eyes can't see it, seems like Meowser can."

Meowser meowed with pride. The couple agreed to get more footage to be sure it wasn't a technical glitch causing the anomaly. It wasn't.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Ashley anxiously waited for dinner time. Right on cue Meowser arrived, he never missed a meal. He sat impatiently at his food dish meowing loudly. Ashley fed him the good stuff. She used the distraction of food to remove the camera rig, but today it was gone. A shiny silver collar had replaced Meowser's normal white one. Ashley took it off to inspect it; causing it to activate.

In the blink of an eye Ashley's world changed. The apartment walls were gone, replaced with a stark white void that stretched forever. A black leather recliner the splash of contrast.

"Please have a seat." A deep disembodied voice emanated from the void. Ashley nervously sat down. She was scared of what she had gotten herself into. Maybe she wasn't meant to know so much.

"Where am I? What are you? What is all this?" Ashley wondered aloud.

"We are currently seventy seven thousand light years from the terra firma you call Earth. I am called the emissary. You have been brought here so that I may explain to you the decision the council has reached about your planet's designation in our records. It appears that your masters are unable to communicate it to the lesser beings."

"Masters? Lesser beings? I think you have it backwards." Ashley retorted.

"Incorrect. Felis catus has been designated alpha species of the planet based on their subjugation of the homo sapiens. Clever creatures who have everything provided to them by a species that sits higher on the food chain, you even clean up their refuse. Our diplomatic envoys from across the cosmos have determined that your planet is to remain classified as a level seven zoo world. We will continue to extend diplomatic courtesies with the Felis catus species. Thank you for your continued cooperation. A piece of advice before you go. Clean up your act, your masters don't want your species to destroy itself, they like having you around."

The white void swirled around Ashley, the recliner melted into a thick black ooze that seeped into Ashley's pores, she woke up on the kitchen floor next to Bryce. Meowser kept eating. The two got to their feet.

"So what do you want to do for dinner? I'm craving chinese." Bryce asked.

"That sounds good, you know what I like. And get that duck thing that Meowser likes, he's been a good boy lately."

"He has been oddly well behaved lately. I'll go order it." Bryce sat down at the computer in the guest room. "What the hell is this?" He wondered aloud as the footage from Meowser's camera played on screen. Without hesitation he deleted it. Meowser couldn't delete it himself like the diplomats wanted, he didn't have thumbs.
