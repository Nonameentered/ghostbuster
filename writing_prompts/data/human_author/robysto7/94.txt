Everyone hates the first day of school, it's the farthest possible place away from summer vacation. Normal students try and navigate their way through a storm of awkward social interaction, raging hormones, the real world of adulthood knocking on the door, and worst of all; math class. Heroic Hall had anything but normal students. Its classes were composed of the children of a generation that was growing quickly. A generation of people born with superpowers of all varieties.

These students had to be kept together, if the general populace was made aware of just how widespread the super genes were in the gene pool, there would be chaos. The faculty at Heroic Hall were all former side kicks to the most potent superheros of their day. All of the reading, writing, and arithmetic one suffers through in the course of normal education was forgone here. Algorithmo's super learning software thoroughly covered all the scholarly topics at a genius level before class formally began, an emphasis on ethics and philosophy.

Heroic Hall's mission statement was simple. Peace through compassion and empathy. All it would take was one rogue super individual to begin a domino effect towards destruction. That is why the thought experiment on the morning of the new school year was so important. Teenagers are rebellious and imaginative, a dangerous combination, especially when laser vision could be involved.

Lady Luck, former sidekick of Professor Probability, was teaching the freshman this year. The freshman were always a rambunctious group, some students filled with idealism, other students filled with misplaced angst. She took roll call, everyone was accounted for. She sat down at her desk and called the first name. Gravitas.

Gravitas was a lanky, awkwardly proportioned boy. His face covered in acne, his clothes were too tight, it does take a lot of concentration to control gravity. His shrill, nasally voice was offensive to the ear.

"Hi everyone, I'm Gravitas. I guess if I was a villain I could pull the Earth into the sun, wiping out all life." He said sheepishly. A light murmur swept through the classroom. It was overpowered by a menacing laugh from the back of the classroom. Magnetron was laughing, his feet kicked up on his desk. The metal mask he wore morphed into a jovial expression.

"What good is a dead planet going to do for a villain? Why not pull the Earth close enough to the sun to destroy the o-zone layer and give us all skin cancer?"

Lady Luck stood up from her chair. "Please do not interrupt the person speaking please. I thought that was a good idea Gravitas, you can sit down. How about you go next Magnetron?"

Magnetron levitated his chair to the front of the classroom, he dramatically rose from the chair and sent it gently back to his desk. His metal mask went blank, a metal mirror for a face, reflecting the other super people's visages back at them. Magnetron shared a flair for the dramatic like his father, Ionic Man. Magnetron paced slowly while waving his hands as if conducting a symphony.

"Magnetism. The force that binds us all. Once you master it, you master creation itself. It is the very blood that runs through the veins of this tiny blue dot we inhabit. That presents many pathways to villainy. I could destroy the ionosphere, plunging weather patterns into chaos. I could lift mountains into the sky and make the meteor that killed the dinosaurs look quaint by comparison.

But where's the villainy in that? Those are merely acts of aggression, like an angry child breaking a toy. No, no, no. True villainy is creative, it's personal. The ferrous blood of the Earth is not what I'm interested in. You there! Remind me of your power." Magnetron pointed at Nightdove.

"Self regeneration and the ability to heal other's wounds." Nightdove replied proudly.

"Can you come back from a heart attack?" Magnetron asked sinisterly.

"I don't........" Nightdove's eyes rolled back in her head, she clutched her chest tightly. A deafening thud echoed in the classroom as she fell from her chair.

Magnetron clapped slowly. "Apply a strong enough localized magnetic field to a bloodstream and it loses viscosity. Loss of viscosity leads to shortness of breath followed by a heart attack. Since most of us in the room are carbon based lifeforms we all have hearts. Except for some of our alien students, but I have a plan for them as well...." Magnetron's speech was interrupted by Nightdove springing to her feet.

"You asshole! That hurt!" Nightdove was relieved that her power allowed her to recover from that.

Magnetron snapped his fingers. Nightdove's eyeballs exploded in a splash of red and white, she fell to the floor screeching in pain as blood poured from empty sockets. "What a terrible power you have. You still feel pain? Not a good tradeoff. Now where was I? Let me explain something else to everyone. Every drop of blood has enough iron in it for me to manipulate. Iron maintains its ferrous properties in the blood supply.

As I demonstrated I've come to learn to localize it within singular organs then rip them apart from the inside out. Looks very painful. The most villainous thing is choice. Comply or die. Either way I win."

Magnetron took a bow and floated back to his seat. Nightdove glared at him as her eyeballs regenerated. His mask morphed into a face with pursed lips. "Nothing personal Dove, I knew you could take it." He blew her a kiss.

Lady Luck got the classroom under control. This was going to be a long school year.
