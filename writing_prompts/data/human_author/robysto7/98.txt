"Well that is much more romantic than what my boy said when he told me they were getting married. Toss me another beer, a cold one please." Requested the former supervillain known as 'The Quizzler'. He was too busy being the grillmaster for the kids' wedding anniversary barbecue to get one himself.

His nemesis turned relative, The Frozen Shadow, used his freeze breath to instantly chill the beverage. "Oh yeah? What did he say?"

"That this chick was super hot. Also some things you probably wouldn't want to know about your little girl, lets just say it was romantic in its own unique way. That boy is crazy about her, always has been."

"Well they did basically grow up together, you did kidnap her about fifteen times."

"I was trying to be a good dad. There's no manual for it. He needed a friend, instead he found his soul mate. I'd say I did a good job."

"In your own weird way you did. Is dinner almost ready? I'm starving." The Frozen Shadow's metabolism was superhuman, Earth food wasn't packed full of super nutrients like those on his home planet's.

"Almost, stop bugging me. Go help the kids set the table, be useful for a change." The Quizzler joked.

The four sat around the picnic table in the backyard of the modest home Quizzler rented. After a lovely dinner filled with delightful conversation everyone enjoyed a nice glass of after dinner port.

The Frozen Shadow raised his glass. "Happy anniversary kids, here's to many more!" The four drank deeply. "I forgot to ask you Quizlet.....oh I mean Brad. Sorry, force of habit, how did the latest expedition to the meteorite go?"

"Pretty good, got a lot of new samples. Still going to take some time to fully analyze and date them. Far as we can tell this meteorite was formed almost around the time of the big bang, it's beyond ancient." Brad worked for the international space agency, extraterrestrial mineral department.

The Quizzler snapped his fingers. "That reminds me! I have an anniversary present for you two." The Quizzler quickly jogged inside the house, he returned with a large box wrapped in polka dot wrapping paper. It made a loud thud when he dropped it on the table. The Frozen Shadowette gently peeled the paper back to reveal a plain lead box. The top flew open. A torrent of black ooze erupted and covered both the Frozen Shadow and Frozen Shadowette. The ooze seeped into their ears, their eyes went blank. They sat frozen, almost stuck in time.

The Quizzler and his son cackled. "It worked! Oh my dear boy you're a genius!" He embraced his son. "Do you want to do the honors or should I?" He asked his son.

"You can have this one, I took the last one." The Quizlet smirked.

Quizzler leapt onto the table and posed proudly, he did love giving a villainous monologue after a plan worked. "You aliens really are stupid. I don't know if you can hear me with all that shit in your ears but if you can listen up! Inside of you now are the parasites that wiped out most of your race before you captured them and launched them into deep space. I never would have learned of them had it not been for the wonderful information you hoarded in that secret library of yours.

I knew I could never earn your trust, but your daughter was a different story. Maybe if she had a more attentive father she would have made better choices. But instead she led us right to your weakness, your own destruction. That's the power of love, it makes you do stupid things sometimes. I must say you have been a formidable opponent and I am going to miss you. Goodbye my friend."

The Shadows flew off with the box, their new masters drove them to spread the parasitic ooze to other galaxies. Quizzler hugged his son as the two watched them fly away.

"Want to go hit the town? You're single now, I can be your wingman. With those two gone the city will be ours soon!" Quizzler elbowed his son in the ribs.

"What do you know about picking up women?"

"I was quite suave in my younger years, you still have a thing or two to learn. I heard a rumor Atomica's daughter just broke up with her fiance, that bitch has been a thorn in our side for a while now."

"Natalie's single? She's hot." That caught Brad's interest.

"Sounds like it's settled then. I love you son."

"Love you too dad."
