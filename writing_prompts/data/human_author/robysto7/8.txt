***Mint Condition***

Magnetron banged on the glass walls of his holding cell like an angry zoo animal. That's what he had been reduced to, a nude animal on display in Falcona's zoo. Bright spotlights illuminated the villain, keeping the detective in the shadows, only the burning end of a cigarette pierced the darkness. Magnetron spread his arms wide, shutting his eyes tightly in concentration.

"Ain't gonna work Magnet boy. Walls are lined with magnetic panels that can shift polarity to counter your manipulation. Can't tear the walls down or use that little trick of ripping the iron out of people's blood cells. Calm the fuck down kid, don't spend your last few moments on this mortal coil having a temper tantrum." Falcona's raspy voice oozed from the darkness.

Magnetron's evil laughter reverberated the glass walls. "Oh please detective you expect me to believe that you are my executioner! Preposterous! If I didn't know any better this is only an excuse for you to see me naked! Like what you see? Rumor has it you don't appreciate the male form. Pity. Pretty girl like you would make a good trophy wife." Magnetron lewdly grabbed his crotch.

Sharp smoker's coughs punctuated Falcona's laughter. "I told you a long, long time ago Magnet Boy that if you ever threatened children again this would happen. I keep my promises, unlike you. Supers ain't gonna kill ya, goes against their oath. Schmucks ain't gonna kill ya neither, to be honest, they don't like you Magnet Boy. They make fun of you a lot behind your back, pretty mean shit. Only reason you sit at the big boy table is so you stop bitchin about it.

You're a joke, a nobody, a bum, a loser, an outcast. You want me to keep going with the adjectives? Don't answer that. Rhetorical. All I needed you to do was stay in your lane like everybody else. Simple thing to do, it's what best for business, but you went into business for yourself. That comes with a cost. I'm only here to collect."

A sinister sneer crossed Mangetron's lips. "They only hate me because they fear me. Just like you do."

"How long can you hold your breathe Magnet Boy?" Falcona asked, the glow of a cellphone screen appeared in the dark.

"Pardon me?" Magnetron asked. Small slits opened along the floor of the cell, water flooding in. "What are you doing?" 

"I would have chosen something more poetic for my last words." Falcona chuckled.

Magnetron flailed as the water rose quickly, smashing his hands desperately against the glass walls. They didn't give an inch, nor did the ceiling. Magnetron gasped as his head was slowly pushed against the ceiling, cold water enveloping him, choking him. The world fell silent in the watery grave. As quickly as it rose the water drained. Magnetron cowered on all fours throwing up water. He whimpered meekly. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll be good. I'll be good. Is that what you want?" 

"Those are better last words. I'll write those down for ya. The waterworks was for my own personal satisfaction. Here comes your real punishment. Bye Magnet Boy." 

The bloop of a button the final sound to ring in Magnetron's ears, his eyes filled with fear watching the glass walls collapse in on him. All that remained was a small red orb the size of a marble, encased in a glass box. Falcona stretched as she entered the spotlight, tossing the cube in her hand. Another one to add the collection, she needed to build another shelf, the collection was growing faster than she anticipated.
