Overheard in the Olympic locker room after the medal ceremony:

“He got me,” Wesker said of Redfield's win over him. "That f***ing Redfield boomed me."

Wesker added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times.

Wesker then said he wanted to add Redfield to the list of S.T.A.R.S. agents he works out with this summer.
