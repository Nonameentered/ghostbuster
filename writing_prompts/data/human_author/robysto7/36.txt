*Ain't ever seen a letter so fancy. Can't even read the exquisite calligraphy, Gus read it to me while I jump roped.*

"Friends, Romans, Countrymen!" Gus's gravely growl really brought an air of gravitas to the words. "Modern day Gladiators prepare for combat most fierce! On the night of the bloodmoon a mighty feast for the senses shall take place. You are cordially invited to test your might against an army of formidable adversaries. Only one shall be left standing amidst the swirling chaos of bone and sinew clashing! The only arms you may bear are the two you were endowed with by your creator, whomever or whatever you believe that to be.

Untold wealth shall rain upon whomever is victorious, the more blood you spill, the more riches are showered upon you. Are your fists furious enough to fisticuff your way to the top?"

*Gus tapped the letter on his leg while he supervised my workout. I stopped jump roping and bobbed my head.*

"Got two choices y'all pull over the car or

Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor."

*Gus scratched his head, he didn't get the reference. Sounds like a bum like me could make some good cash. 99 pairs of fists would be a problem. Nothin I can't handle, I am the champ.*

"When's the next bloodmoon? Whatever the fuck that is?" I asked.

"According to google, six months from today. That ain't a whole lot of time to prepare for 50 fights all occurring simultaneously. Keep jumping that rope, you don't get breaks anymore."

*Gus had that look in his eyes I'd seen a million times while he coached me in the corner. He had a plan. Gus knew the sweet science better than anyone else who voluntarily took punches to the head for money. His joints popped as he salsa danced around me.*

"I'm gonna turn you into the world's most graceful dancer, that's the only way you're gonna survive being in the eye of the tornado. You suck em into the vortex and wait for an opening. Then WHAM! Lights out. Fancy feet mixed with counter punching, throw em all off balance while you dance the razor's edge."

"You asking me to dance with you Gus?"

"I used to be quite a good dancer when I was a young man. Dames like it when a fella can dance, dancing translates into a lot of things in life. In our case, perfect defense. Without even thinkin about it you'll be twinkle toeing a tornado of thumps. It'll be as natural as breathing once we're done but it ain't gonna be easy."

*I chugged my vanilla protein shake and burped loudly. I went to my locker and retrieved my pink sweatsuit while Gus mounted up on Doc's old bicycle. Time to carry on the legacy with a run through battery park. Say hello to Lady Liberty.*
