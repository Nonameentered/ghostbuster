*Oh that pissed her off, I swear the entitlement of some people is off the charts. Think I'm just gonna walk away, see how angry that makes her. Stupid people must be angry all the time, I know I would be pissed if I had only two brain cells fighting for control. Why the fuck does she think I know anything about what kind of watercolor paints are good for six year olds? Even when I did work here I worked in electronics, not this crap. Surprised they let me still come in after the sporting goods sports spectacular where Colin "accidentally" dunked on that old woman who wandered in front of the hoop when he was going hard to the post. This woman is still yelling. Everyone's looking at us, that makes sense. She wants attention, probably hasn't been laid in a while.*

"Your picture is right up front at customer service. It's pointless talking to you, I want to speak to your manager!"

*She screeches like a harpy. I'm gonna develop tinnitus at this rate. Let's try and diffuse this situation quickly so he doesn't get in trouble because of me again.*

"Is it Ma'am or sir?" *I ask her.*

"It's Ma'am!"

*She doesn't laugh, she doesn't get the reference.*

"Well......ma'aam like I said before you went on a menopausal monologue about the injustice and iniquities of the current state of customer service in our fair country, I do not work here. I used to work here. The employees here were lazy assholes when I was around, I'm guessing they still are. That picture is old." *That was true, most people were chill but they were really fucking lazy, surprised Colin still worked here.*

"You're just trying to get out of helping me and being very rude! I want to speak to your manager!"

*The seven most annoying words of the modern world. No matter how I many times I hear that phrase it makes my blood boil. Lady the manager isn't on your side, they bitch about you more than employees. They have to kiss your ass or get fired by corporate. The lengths people will go to just to get a little smooch on the cheeks. Validate their meager existence by embodying the squeaky wheel. Well I'm about to grease you up dumbass. I pull my phone out and dial into the pa system, little trick Amanda taught me. I clear my throat.*

"Attention all team members." *The corporate way of saying wage slave.* "We have a Code K in AC, repeat Code K in AC. Colin report to AC, take approach vector HG. Repeat approach vector HG. All other team members get back to work."

*I make sure I'm standing in front of this menopausal menace so I can watch her react to Colin walking up behind me. Her eyes widen, her jaw slightly drops. Panic mixes with confusion. She's dumbfounded as the veil of reality tears away. It's hard not laughing as Colin slaps me on the back. The woman is sputtering like an old laptop trying to reboot, too many programs are open in her head.*

"Is this person bothering you bro?" Asked Colin, my twin brother, only thing different about us was that his hair is shorter.

*Before I could answer the harpy started shrieking, the initial confusion must have worn off.*

"Are you the manager! This employee is being very rude!"

*Colin and I instinctively shoot each other a look, we're thinking the same thing.*

"I am the assistant manager, still new to it. Got promoted after winning six consecutive employee of the month awards. Pretty low bar to jump over but still an accomplishment. Ma'am you're causing a disturbance so I'm going to have to ask you to leave please."

"I'm not the one causing a disturbance! He's the disturbance! If he would help me without giving me attitude I wouldn't have to yell like this!"

*She's going nuclear. A couple scoffs escape my lungs while I'm trying to hold it together. Colin's pulling out his walkie.*

"Loss prevention to AC, Code K in progress, need containment assistance."

*I join the small group that formed to watch the show in filming the woman's screaming match with Jerome. Jerome kicked ass, used to play offensive line for the Vikings in the eighties. Works here to get away from his six kids and four baby mamas. He just waddles behind the woman, slowly directing her to the front. She's nuts. Starts screaming about 5g being virulent, Bill Gates is the devil, and topped it off with saying birds aren't real.*

"Why do the crazy ones always find you when you come in here?" Colin asked.

"Likes moths to a flame. It sucks. Want to know the worst part?"

"What's that?"

"Not a milf amongst them."
