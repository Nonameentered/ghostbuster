*What is that which in the morning goes upon four feet*

*upon two feet in the afternoon,*

*and in the evening upon three?*

The Great Sphinx's riddle purred along the sands of the scorching desert. Kratos looked up at the gigantic stone face. A terrible riddle, Mimir had asked it often.

"Man." He growled out.

*Correct, ashen one. For the next trial....*

"I solved your riddle, now grant me passage to the pyramid, my patience grows thin."

*Only those who demonstrate strength of mind may be granted an audience with Sekhmet.*

Kratos drew the blades from his back, engulfing them with flames. A bluff, only Sekhmet knew where Ptah was hiding. Ptah could strengthen the blades, make them capable of slaying these odd gods. Kratos' new allies were helpful, yet he did not trust them. Only fools trust the gods. "Speak quickly Sphinx!"

*There are two sisters: one gives birth to the other and she, in turn, gives birth to the first. What are they?*

Kratos loosened the grip on the blades, letting them hang from his forearms. As he stood in thought a massive ibis landed on his shoulder. The massive beak of the black wading bird squawked in Kratos' ear. He glared at the bird.

"Preposterous, that cannot be the answer."

Another squawk accompanied flapping wings.

"I was unaware your kind believed such things." Kratos directed his attention back to the sphinx. "Day and Night."

*Correct, ashen one. Continue on your journey.*

As the sphinx spoke the swirling sands subsided. A towering white pyramid was revealed and accessible. "You may leave." Kratos barked at the bird. With a flash it was gone. Kratos secured his blades and marched towards the pyramid. The sphinx called to him.

*Do not take their help as a symbol of alliance. They will betray you......Ghost.*

Kratos screamed as he whipped the blades through the air, smashing into the stone nose of the sphinx, breaking it to pieces. "Let them. They will fall, same as the others. Every pantheon will crumble."
