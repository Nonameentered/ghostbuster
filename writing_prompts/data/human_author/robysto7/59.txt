*Icy chills pierce and crack the skin of the mortals who dwell in the north. Vinter vas my favorite time of the year. Goodvill towards men be damned. The long nights called to me here. I enjoyed being able to valk around the city in the late afternoon darkness. I musn't delay though, I promised young Shauna to help her vith her community service for senior year of high school. I could sign off our visits for the hours she needed.*

*Ve alvays met in ze back garden of ze manor for the old decrepit fleshbags. I procured some nice bottles of vino for our bi-weekly chats, Shauna always brought a black thermos adorned with crudely drawn human skulls. This evening's discussion had an unexpected guest. A strikingly handsome young man, broad shoulders, good chin, bundled up in a puffy coat and snowpants. He stood in stark contrast to the lovely Shauna. Her raven hair danced in the frozen air, it swept on forever. A tight leather jacket barely contained her heaving bosom, a tight short skirt hugged her ample hips. Fishnet stockings paired with heavy duty combat boots as always. Her neck looked delightful, I yearned for even the smallest nibble. That damned gold cross slung around her neck mocked me.*

*Shauna emptied the first bottle of vino into her thermos, she did the same for her gentleman companion with a thermos she loaned him. Good thing I'm always prepared, there was more than enough vino to go around. I gazed deeply into Shauna's mind, same as I do every time ve meet. She vas attracted to the young man, she lusted for him. Can't blame her. After a quick tour around her mind palace I tried to enter the gentleman's mental door. I couldn't. How queer. I wrapped my cape tightly around my shoulders. I breathed deeply. That scent, that ancient blood was afoot once more. A toothless smile crossed my lips, no steam escaping from them.*

"How does ze night find you young Shauna? Alvays a pleasure to speak vith the youthful. Whomever is zis striking young gentleman?"

*Shauna kicked her feet up on the garden table. They landed with a hard thud.* "This is Ferd, he's in my chemistry class. He's been slacking on his service hours so I dragged him here. I already fudged the numbers on our sign off sheets."

*Shauna retrieved the paperwork I needed to sign from her cleavage, the papers were warm. I flicked my sharp fingernail against my tongue to draw blood for the signature. Blood freezes quickly in the frigid air. Ferd extended his hand for a friendly shake. I gently caressed his palm, soft skin without a single rough patch. A far cry from his ancestors.*

"Do you have a surname young Ferd?"

"It's Ferdinand actually. Ferdinand Cel Tradat. Nice to meet you sir."

"A gypsy. I thought I smelled the sour stench of manure on ze brisk breeze."

*I think I offended ze young man. Centuries of battle against his kind hardened my heart to their foul offspring. A wonderful tale entered my memory, one I should share with the young ones.*

"Pardon my curtness young sir. I harbor no ill vill towards you personally, just your filthy gypsy blood. Has the lovely Shauna told you any my tales of conquest most blasphemous and cruel?"

*The young man meekly shook his head to indicate the negative. I rose from my chair and spread my cape wide forming a crimson curtain atop virgin white snow. Flames roared across its surface lapping at my back. Shauna smiled seductively, she liked it when I got dramatic.*

"Once long ago I scorched the churches of the villages that surrounded my castle. They prayed for a savior. None came to their rescue. Next were the armies from the east. I paved the road that led to my castle with their bones. Used their skulls for goblets. Hollowed out heads on pikes served as my lanterns in the night with their burning flesh.

I protected my children of the night from those who sought to destroy us. Labeled us abominations against God's will. What is a god to a nonbeliever? I rejected his grace after the gypsies betrayed me. I gave them land, ensured they would no longer be nomads, they spat in my face. Crushing my enemies distracted me from the true threat right before my eyes.

My first confinement lasted only decades, my children had protected me while they resurrected my flesh. Made me stronger. Revenge was swift, I sent the remaining gypsies into hiding. But like a lingering itch you can't scratch; they returned. I hold dominion over death itself. The gossamer strings of fate remain tied to the supple flesh I crave. But there are forces even I cannot fathom behind the veil of the moonlight. A vicious cycle of slaughter leading to rebirth, bloodfilled veins intertwined to create balance. Long has it been since my last slumber, these old bones could use a rest."

*A shrill klaxon rang out, shattering my dramatic pause. Shauna's annoying cellular telephone alarm. Hour's already up. I was getting on a roll. As the two young ones went off into the sensual embrace of the night a wolf howled at the near full moon. Hopefully this "Ferd" could provide a proper challenge, like his ancestor Gabriel all those centuries ago. Maybe I'll make him watch me drain Shauna of her bountiful blood when she forgets to wear her cross.*
