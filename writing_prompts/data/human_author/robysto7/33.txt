Incessant ticking trickled from the clock lined walls at the royal academy. A constant reminder that time never stops flowing, not even in a world of might and magic. I was out of options though, I hope the rumor about her is true. She offered me some ale, I slid the mouth cover of my helmet up to drink. Good dwarven ale.

Her slender fingers delicately manipulated the small tools needed to repair a pocketwatch. She didn't look up from her magnifying glass setup. "How can I be of assistance to you traveler?" Her voice sounded like multiple voices layered atop one another.

"According to the sage of the east you posses the ability help weary travelers like myself get back home. Can a witch like you really do that?" I asked.

She looked up from her magnifying glass, putting on a pair of thick dragon bone glasses. No matter what world you're in they all get the same look when you piss em off. "I'm not a witch. I'm a techromancer, didn't go to grad school for three hundred years for nothing. Neither creature fair nor foul can pluck the strings of time like I. Pardon me for asking but aren't you the one who slew the goblin menace of mount parang? Your odd metal armor matches the description." She asked.

"Yep, that was me. The villagers paid me good coin for that operation. That's why I need to go back to my world, the monsters there actually give me a challenge." I growled.

"Who am I to say no to the almighty coin. I must warn you, I can only return you to the moment your note was plucked from the sheet music. Not before or after. May I inquire as to what plagues your world, traveler?" She asked.

"Names are for friends, not monsters. I'm the last hunter unit alive, a hunter must hunt. I need to get back to killing my prey, doesn't matter where you place me, the war has no beginning, has no end."

The witch tossed me a bejeweled pocket watch with a stunning red ruby in the center. "Just like time itself. When that amulet strikes twelve, you shall no longer wander. Fare thee well, hunter." She snapped her fingers. I handed over every coin I had, had no use for them anymore.

I popped open the watch, t-minus five seconds.

Bombs exploded around me, drones whizzed overhead, the rumbling of tracks shook the horizon. I scavenged a railgun, some stickies, and a plasma shotgun. The radio inside my helmet crackled.

"Any........the..........respond......anyone!"

I knelt down and flipped open the comms panel on my wrist. "Hunter unit six reporting in." I racked the plasma shotgun. "I'm back."
