New Year's eve was the most wonderful day in Star City. Supers and schmucks agreed to lay down their arms in peace and brotherhood for two days straight. Out with the old, in the with new. Auld acquaintance be forgot. Dr. Neutron's war zeppelin floated silently over the city, a familial tradition to watch the masses celebrate a fresh slate filled with hopes and dreams. There was still some hours until midnight. Dr. Neutron and Fuzion lounged in the bar area while Atomic Girl played nearby. 

The clink of crystal rang out as the two sipped champagne. Dr. Neutron patted Fuzion's knee, her full length ballgown was soft. She looked radiant, green was her color. Matched Dr. Neutron's loud green tuxedo. Laughter punctuated the debate they were having.

"You did not beat me the first time we fought, in fact to my recollection you have never beaten me." Fuzion said saucily.

"Darling you're implying that I tried to beat you, every rule has an exception. And you are by far the most exceptional. I wouldn't stand a chance against you, we cancel each other out. An eternal stalemate, the perfect foil." Dr. Neutron gazed into Fuzion's pale orange irises, they burned with nuclear flames. 

She smiled. "That your idea of a compliment?" She playfully slapped Dr. Neutron's knee.

Dr. Neutron refilled their drinks. "I would not wish any companion in the world but you, nor can imagination form a shape, besides yourself, to like of."

"Nerd." Fuzion blushed, a flush of dull orange spread across her cheeks.

"I don't want to monologue but you know I can't help it. Look around us, supers are popping up left and right. They're a dime a dozen now. It's no longer about right and wrong, good vs evil, it's who has the most myspace friends. All a show for the media. Power corrupts, can't have any Jack or Jill running around with the power to level city blocks.

A fragile ecosystem needs a deft hand to guide it, make sure it doesn't implode on itself and murder those caught in the wake. I do that by making sure everyone knows the pecking order and that they know it well. You on the other hand darling, are special. You enforce the order by being righteous, you help the tired, the poor, the yearning masses; not for fame, but because that is what heroines do."

A high pitched roar interrupted Dr. Neutron's train of thought. Atomic Girl had crawled over while she continued playing. Her young mind was obsessed with dinosaurs, looked like the epic battle was coming to a close. Dr. Neutron hopped from his barstool and knelt down. 

"Who's winning?" He inquired.

"The velociraptors have cornered the diplodocus and are ready to strike." Innocent battle plans from a child wearing Hello Kitty footsie pajamas. 

"You've got it all wrong sweetie. Velociraptors and diplodocus didn't roam the earth at the same time. Missed each other by about sixty million years." Dr. Neutron held up two of the plastic raptors, they were incredibly detailed, Atomic Girl was getting more used to her powers. Dr. Neutron clasped his hands together, smashing the two toys together. He opened them to reveal a snarling plastic Tyrannosaurus Rex. "The mighty king of the jurassic is a more suitable opponent for the lowly diplodocus."

Atomic Girl's eyes widened, the same nuclear flames burned with childlike wonder. She scooped up the other three raptors and followed dear old dad's lead. It was a perfect recreation only a bit larger.

Dr. Neutron sighed. "Don't make it look just like mine, where's the fun in that? Use your imagination, make it your own."

Atomic Girl tried again with amazing results. One would swear the mighty reptile was pulled straight from the past itself. Fuzion joined in the fun, she played the diplodocus. Prehistoric hi jinks ensued for a while until the sandman made his appearance to shuttle young Atomic Girl off to bed. The clock was approaching midnight. Fuzion rested her head on Dr. Neutron's shoulder as they floated over the city square. The best place to see the fireworks. 

Dr. Neutron kissed the top of Fuzion's fiery orange hair. "I really hope she doesn't follow in our footsteps. She's too sweet to keep anyone in line."

Fuzion hugged him tightly. "We're doing our best to make sure she doesn't have to. We make good silent partners. Enough shop talk, let's enjoy the moment, this is my favorite moment of the year."

Comfortable silence hung in the air. The soft crackle of the gramophone heralded the new year. Flashes of color exploded in the sky in rhythm with the soft music.

*Should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot and auld lang syne? For auld lang syne my dear, for auld lang syne, we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet for auld lang syne.......*

A passionate midnight kiss to seal another year's worth of keeping order in the unforgiving chaos of Star City. It would not be the last.
