Monsieur Maximilien snootily laughed at his captor, the famous Detective Falcona as the two ate dinner in the opulent dining room. A feast of kobe steaks, fresh caught Maine lobsters, loaded baked potatoes and paired with a vintage Cabernet. The bomb collar around Falcona's thick neck kept him in line during his stay.

"My apologies Detective, I didn't know the girls' birthday was coming up so soon, what day next week is it?" Max asked.

"Their actual birthday is Sunday. Isabella wanted to have the party on Saturday, she wants to watch the game on Sunday with the girls, just the three of them." Falcona sighed.

Maximilien drank deeply from his goblet of wine. He produced a gilded cigarette case from the breast pocket of his tuxedo, he popped a cigarette into his long ivory cigarette holder. He lit one for the Detective too, Max knew the detective well enough to know he enjoyed a post dinner smoke. A sinister spiral of smoke swept from Max's lips.

"Saturday is cutting it too close, I need you off the streets until at least Monday to ensure my business deal goes through. Hmmmm." Max stroked his delicate chin. "How old are the girls again?"

Falcona smiled. "Turning fourteen this year. How time flies."

"A household of teenage girls, can't say I envy you detective. Do you ever get to use the bathroom?"

"It don't take too long to get this ugly mug ready in the morning. I don't get too much beauty sleep anyways." Falcona chuckled.

"Convince me." Max leaned back in his chair, kicking his feet up on the table.

"Of what?" Falcona asked.

"Why I should let you go to the party. The girls are going to have a lot more of them, so what if you miss one?"

Falcona cleared his throat, a couple sharp smoker's coughs dislodged the phlegm in his throat. "I'll be the first one to admit it. I ain't been the best dad to those girls. Or the best husband to my wonderful wife. I spend more time cleaning up the streets than I do spending whatever time I got left with them. I've sacrificed the present so that my daughters can have a good future.

I was so close too. Used to be only the four families I had to deal with. Illicit gambling, prostitution, little narcotics here and there, occasionally find a body wearing cement shoes in the harbor. Normal human stuff. All went to shit when the supers and shmucks showed up. Now we got people running around with super intelligence, super speed, super strength, and everybody wants to be one. Or work for one.

Criminals have lost their goddamn minds. Pulling bigger heists to show off their skills hoping to join a crew. Doing more and more depraved things in the dark alleys at night. Whole damn city is getting dragged to hell in a handbasket. Seems like for every one perp I put away two more pop up outta nowhere to take their place.

But I won't stop. Not until every single one of you maniacs is tossed into a cage you can't escape. One of these years I'll be able to give the girls the present I want to for their birthday. Even if this year isn't the one." Falcona grasped the bottle of Cabernet and topped off his drink.

"Dare I even ask what that would be?" Max smirked.

"The greatest gift I can think to give to my girls is leaving behind a world where they ain't gotta look over their shoulder walking the streets alone. I figure there ain't nothin after this life so I won't be able to protect them forever, hope I don't have to. And one last thing, if you don't let me go, Isabella is gonna beat the snot out of ya with a rolling pin. Trust me, that hurts. Make you a deal?" Falcona asked.

"I don't remember this being a negotiation." Max stated flatly.

"I won't say nothin about your business deal, and you can keep an eye on me at the party. You are now formally invited. Would be a nice surprise for the girls to see their 'Uncle Max'. Isabella's baking a big cake, chocolate fudge. I'm doing burgers and dogs on the grill, or I'm supposed to be at least."

Max rose dramatically from his chair. He gently removed the bomb collar from around the detective's neck. "Go get changed. I'll have my pilot ready up the Raven for a late night flight. What do the girls want for their birthday?"

Falcona rubbed his neck, Max had put the collar on tight. "Cash is king. Don't be stingy." Falcona slapped Max on the back and went to retrieve his trench coat and hat from the fancy guestroom he'd been sleeping in. Falcona knew the world he dreamed of for his kids would never come to fruition. Star City was a house of cards that towered high into the sky, couldn't shake it too hard lest the whole thing collapse on those living in its shadow. All Falcona could do now was make sure it didn't wobble too much.
