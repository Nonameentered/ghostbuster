"Alright kid what did ya find on the families?" The chief asked me. They had taken the shape of the stereotypical tough as nails police chief who doesn't take any shit from their detectives or beat cops. I took the shape of an old pulp comic gumshoe to play along. I dramatically slam down my thick notebook. I lock eyes with the chief.

"Money laundering, lots of it. Intimidation and protection schemes all over the city. Racketeering, some shady disappearances to top it all off." I put on a gravely voice to sound hardboiled.

"Money laundering first. Where the cleaners?" Chief barked.

I step into the dark corner of the office to ensure I don't burn when I shift into a vampire. "Dracula and his children of the night operate a chain of mechanic's shops. Have contracts with all the local hospitals, free repair and maintenance of their mobile blood clinics. They boost the parts, all profit, don't know what the hospital kicks backs to em. Pretty secretive on that.

Doctor Frank and his monster mash have a stranglehold on funeral homes across the city, cook the books, and the bodies so to speak. Washes his dough and makes himself new family members, keeps his numbers up, able to keep up with the other families. He's also an independent doctor who doesn't ask questions in exchange for a hefty fee.

Boogeyman and his boys run underground casinos. Profitable ones. He has a small stake in the other families in exchange for some help cleaning after big jobs. Boogey's succubi are high class escorts, also his eyes and ears in the bedroom of some very powerful people in the city. Probably the biggest threat."

Chief chomped on the end of his cigar. "Who's running protection?"

"Wolvies are the heavy hitters in that arena. In exchange for a generous donation the wolvies give business owners a silver charm to hang in their window, prevents something bad from happening during a full moon. Other than that the wolvies are pretty subdued, only meet once a month of course.

Lagoon creatures do something similar at the docks, enforce their own 'toll' for ships coming into harbor, make sure we don't have any oil spills or other environmental disasters. Hard to get close to them though, I can't hold my breath too long."

"Disappearances, which family is behind those?" Chief asked.

"All of em. Normally carried out by a merc, one of the slashers. Lot of options of there to off a guy. Chainsaw em, knife em, transport em to a hell dimension, kill em in their dreams, some real creative shit."

"Can we move on this?"

"Gotta talk to the people really in charge, legal team. See if we have enough evidence for a RICO case against at least one, maybe all of them." I took pride being able to say that, this was the longest investigation of my life. 

"Get back to work. Agent 3 is on a stakeout right now, undercover at the museum, go keep them company."

"Why there?"

"Catch the mummy when he tries to steal back his sacred ankh of the dead. Dismissed. Now get out of my office." 

The job never stops trying to bring down a monstrous mafia.
