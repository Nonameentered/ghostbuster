April 14th

Four days left. I really wish they would let me skip the 'deliberation period' before the injection. I've made up my mind. There's no turning back now. It's spread through my bones, there's nothing left for me here. If I have to go I want to go on my own terms. Living in the old folks home ain't exactly living life to the fullest.

Grace brought the kids to see me. They're too young to really grasp the situation, ignorance is bliss. Grace cried the whole time, she was sensitive like her mother used to be. Said she'd be back soon for one last visit. Her kids got a good mom, the apple didn't fall far from the tree with her, unlike her brother, wherever he is.

I'm so tired, I had to more to write but I don't really see the point right now. Got a long day ahead of me tomorrow.

My old war buddy Frankie Fleetfoot took me to the veteran's hall for happy hour with the last few members of our platoon that are still alive. That war was hell, we were just young men sent to grease the wheels of the war machine. Lots of good kids died in that conflict, too many in fact. All we fought for was meaningless, the world's still going to hell in a hand basket. Johnny Silvertongue can barely remember what he ate for breakfast that morning. Just a group of sad old men reminiscing about bad times. It was depressing.

Talked with the doctor afterwards to see if I could get the shot earlier. He said no. He's a fucking prick. If I had the strength like I used to have I would have already found a different method. I looked through the old photo album again. Those little moments of time all long gone. The story of my life laid out in faded Polaroids. I lingered on the pictures from my wedding day. If there's something on the other side, I hope Cheryl is there too.

Why am I even writing in this thing? Nobody is gonna care in a hundred years what I did. Who I was. An ordinary life lived by an ordinary man is not a story people want to hear. Everything hurts today, maybe I've been overdoing it. I would give anything in the world to be healthy, to not have my actions dictated by a frail old husk of a body. I just want it to end.

April 17th

This is my final journal entry. Not for today, not for this month, but for all time. I already said goodbye to Grace, I told her that I loved her more than anything in the world, and that I couldn't be more proud of her. Asked her to tell the same thing to her brother if she ever saw him again. Said my goodbyes to the boys over the phone, most of them won't even remember I'm gone come tomorrow. 

Doctor went over how to safely do the injection. He treats me like a moron, I hate that prick. Gonna sit on the balcony. Drink one last scotch, smoke one last cigar, watch one final sunset. No sunset will ever be as beautiful as the one Cheryl and I watched on that empty beach after I got home from the war. 

That is the final memory I hope to take with me, if I'm allowed to take things to the other side. To whomever reads this in the future remember to cherish your days. Time comes for us all, you cannot escape it. You cannot run from it. So don't. Face life head on without fear. When you talk with someone you love, always end the conversation with "I love you.". Because some day......there will be no tomorrow.
