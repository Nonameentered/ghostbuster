"And the vinner is............me! Ha ha ha!" Victor laughed in triumph. He was back to back champion of shitty cinema Saturday. He felt unstoppable ever since discovering that youtube channel.

Twilight, how predictable. Just what you would expect from a wolfman, he came in last. The godly Deimos had a good pick with Troll 2 but fell to third. The shambling corpse's choice of Tromeo and Juliet gave everyone a good laugh so it took second. These pitiful fools were not ready for my cinematic catastrophe. It left them speechless, shocked jaws dropped to the floor. Nothing could have prepared these ghoulish guests for the true horror the celluloid showed.

Little did those idiots know that Rem Lazar was only the beginning, just wait til they see Suburban Sasquatch, and even farther down the road, Shark Exorcist. His reign as champion shall be as eternal as the night.
