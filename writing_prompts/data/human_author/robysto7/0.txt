***Tagging Turkeys***

The flashing phone screen coupled with the shrill alarm shook Carter Cartwright awake. He frantically searched for his phone, it had migrated under his pillow. The bright light stung his eyes, he squinted to see what the racket was. A new notification, the only one allowed on his phone. Carter quickly rolled over, shaking his girlfriend Samantha's shoulder.

"Babe wake up! New G-Gang vid dropped!"

Samantha bolted awake. The two sat up as Carter opened up tok-tik.

"What up fleshies!? It's ya boy Bonerattler and Poulterghoul! Dropping this special Turkey Day video!" Bonerattler spoke directly into the camera, his almost transparent skull adorned with a pilgrim's hat. Poulterghoul's shadowy figure floated in the background wearing a feathered headdress. The two apparitions floated high in the sky, cars whizzing past them like ants entering a hill.

"We're gonna tag up some festive shit on the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge. We're about a thousand feet in the air, we scared!? Fuck no! We living that Ghost Gang Afterlife baby!" Bonerattler violently shook two cans of spray paint, the marble inside the cans rattled along with his ethereal bones.

"Ghost Gang!" Poulterghoul yelled, his shadowy tendrils forming an intricate gang sign.

"What was your favorite turkey day food P?" Bonerattler inquired.

"The souls of the damned homie! Ghost Gang!" P shouted.

"Damn that's some cold blooded shit, real gangsta. Respect. Me, I like green bean casserole, that shit is fire! Drop a comment on this vid, let us know what you fleshies like stuffing down your throats on turkey day!" Bonerattler knew comments would help with the algorithm.

The video continued with time lapsed footage of the two tagging the top of the bridge from a wide angle, the tag blurred out. The two apparitions tossed their spray paint cans into the air defiantly.

"Alright we tagged that bitch ass bridge up good! If you wanna see the whole piece get your ass on a plane to Turkey, ya turkeys! Ghost Gang out!" Bonerattler spread his arms, P oozed around him.

"Ghost Gang!"
