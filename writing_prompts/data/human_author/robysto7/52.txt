The squeaking of lab rats dominated the small makeshift laboratory Atomic Girl had constructed in the basement of her unassuming suburban home. Her father Dr. Neutron descended the basement steps decked in his old pale white lab coat. Salt and pepper hair exploded from the top of his head, thick dark tinted safety glasses dominated his sinister face. 

"Sorry it took me so long to find my old science lab getup. What seems to be the problem sweetie?"

Atomic Girl kicked her feet up on the cheap plastic folding table where her laptop sat. She sighed heavily while reclining in her gaming chair. "I have enough data to feel good about my hypothesis but I need a volunteer to be certain." She tilted back enough to look behind her, long flowing orange curls dangled from her head, the color just like her mother's. She shot her father a look she knew would get him to help out.

"Anything for you, I will happily volunteer. What do I need to do?" Inquired Dr. Neutron.

"Stand inside that hula hoop on the ground."

Dr. Neutron strolled into the center of the shag carpeted basement, a pink hula hoop connected to clear tubes was his mark. He picked it up, and swung his hips. Atomic Girl scolded him.

"Dad! Take this serious! I want to win first place this year." She stomped her foot. The green nuclear fire that burned behind her blue eyes raged. Dr. Neutron stuck his tongue out at her.

"An important part of the scientific method is to have fun. Volunteers always act up, they're not getting paid after all." 

Atomic Girl tossed the doctor a tennis ball.

"For a control test let's do something easy. Can you rearrange the atomic structure of that into a baseball please?" She asked with an air of authority, it was her lab.

Dr. Neutron slowly rubbed the tennis ball between his palms, after a few seconds it took shape. He tossed a brilliant white baseball back to his daughter, she missed. Sarah never was good at playing catch with dear old dad. Without a word the hula hoop split open, a clear nanocarbon dome formed over Dr. Neutron. A whistling hiss whined from the clear tubing. It lasted ten seconds before the entire apparatus snapped back into place.

"Heads up!" Atomic Girl shouted. Her throw was wide, Dr. Neutron made a leaping grab, he crashed onto the couch, hurt his hip. He shrugged it off. "Can you turn that back now?" She asked curiously. An intensely curious look crossed her face.

Dr. Neutron rolled his eyes and lazily rolled the ball in his left palm. It rolled, and rolled, and rolled, nothing happened. He squeezed it tightly and concentrated, his mind felt empty. Nothing happened. "What hypothesis are you trying to prove honey?" His voice quivered.

Atomic Girl smiled happily, she clapped her hands and shot her arms into the air in triumph. "That subatomic processes are a root cause of the modern super power problem. These nanospores are able to analyze and arrange attributes into a median range of human capability. A power dampener, if you will." 

"Take these things out of me right now young lady. Or you're grounded." Dr. Neutron spoke firmly. 

Atomic Girl gave her father the puppy dog eyes. "I thought you'd be more excited. Don't worry these are only prototypes, they can't survive in meta humans for more than six hours. Your powers will come back." 

Dr. Neutron swelled with pride. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine she would compete with him intellectually, much less at such a young age. She truly was the deadliest thing that ever walked the earth. Good thing the apple fell far from the tree with her, she took after her mother. "Sweetie that's not going to win first prize if it has such a short shelf life. Let's look over the data together, I won't tell anyone I helped. We can beat that little punk Magnetron, end his winning streak.

The two poured over research notes tinkering and tweaking the experiment. Scientific tunnel vision ran in the family, neither one heard Fuzion descend the basement stairs. "Hello? I'm home. Anyone care?" She playfully asked. Atomic Girl leaned back in her chair. "Hey Mom." 

Dr. Neutron gave Fuzion a peck on the cheek, she must have been home for a while, she was already changed into pajama pants and a loose fitting tank top. A sly smile crossed Dr. Neutron's face. "Sorry darling we were engrossed in the pursuit of scientific advancement. Speaking of which we need a lovely volunteer, and I cannot imagine one more lovely than you." He gently nudged her into the hula hoop. 

The physical changes to Fuzion slowly took hold. The green nuclear fire behind her pale orange irises faded, her eyes a cold blue. Raven black hair fell around her face, a few streaks of grey in her lustrous mane. Both Dad and Daughter's jaws dropped, they had never seen what she looked like before the accident. Fuzion ran her hands through her hair. 

"What the hell is this?" She asked. 

Dr. Neutron high fived his daughter. "I won the bet! Sarah bet your natural hair color was blond. I'm keeping ten dollars of your allowance as payment Sarah, I don't go for blondes." Dr. Neutron embraced his lover, he looked deeply into her real eyes for the first time. "I'll explain over drinks. Let's go to Paul's. Have a date as normal people for once, see what it's like. I already ordered pizza for Sarah. I'm going to go get changed."

Dr. Neutron retreated from the basement. His mind raced, he always knew Sarah would be his trump card, she had far exceeded initial assessments. Being the puppet master of Star City was finally within his grasp.
