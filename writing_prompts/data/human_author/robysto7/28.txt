"You again!?" My four pursuers shouted in unison. In the blink of an eye I found myself standing in the epicenter of a Mexican standoff. The deathly pale and thin woman drew a scythe from beneath her hooded cape, letting it rest on the soldier's neck. The gas-masked trench soldier aimed his browning automatic rifle at the bandit who had turned his six shooter on the black suited assassin. His nickel-plated silenced hardballer pressed against the thin woman's hood.

Passing cars whizzed past the small courtyard in the center of the apartment complex, now the center of my universe. Nobody said a word. It was getting awkward.

"So.......what's goin on? Why are you all after me?" I asked.

"Shut up!" The four yelled back.

The pale woman slowly scraped her scythe across the soldier's mask. "I was here first, he's mine. Things are getting a bit cold down below, my master senses great power not yet unleashed within him, needs him to light the fire." She hissed.

The soldier turned his rifle on the woman, the assassin and bandit turned their guns on the soldier. Heavy breathing emanated from his mask. "Negative. My mission is to acquire the progenitor of mankind's only hope against the skrugg. Failure is not an option."

Bandit boy used the barrel of his six shooter to adjust his cowboy hat. He smiled through clenched teeth, a plume of cigar smoke escaping from his lips. "You fellas got some balls on you for even considering I would let this inter dimensional bounty escape, you got some balls on you too madam. Getting paid a lot to track this sucker down, same as the last one."

Finally the assassin got received his turn. "This one a dead or alive bounty?" He asked.

"Yup." Nodded the bandit.

"I'll shoot him and split the money with you."

"Sounds good to me partner. Democracy prevails again. Two against one and one. Unless you two want to work together against us."

Solider and the woman from the other side conceded.

"Do I get a vote?" In retrospect I should have chosen something more poetic for my last words.
