Thanks for reading it. Good point. I maybe should have added more details about Detective Falcona, she's supposed to carry an air of a mob boss. When she has a meeting with someone they listen and don't talk back. She then does the old Irish goodbye walking away without elaborating. I'm glad you liked it, thanks for the feedback.
