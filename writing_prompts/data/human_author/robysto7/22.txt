Adding to the quickly growing database of super and schmuck identities was starting to become Detective Falcona's least favorite part of her job. Really took the fun out of figuring it out on her own. She suspected that was the reason the Super Society and Villa of Villains put her in charge of it. She always found out anyways, this cut out the middle man. At least it gave Falcona the opportunity to make sure to let the supers know who was in charge right off the bat, make a good first impression. Grilling supers was always fun.

"What's you name kid?" Falcona asked the young super sitting across the desk. They were bundled up in a puffy yellow coat paired with blue jeans. Their full blue face mask adorned with a lightning bolt down the center.

"Frank Benjamin." He replied.

"Powers?"

"Generate electricity than shoot it from my fingertips." Frank replied proudly.

"And?"

"That's it." Frank's response now carried shame.

Falcona couldn't stop a laugh from escaping her lips. "You really got shorted in the power lotto. May to want to rethink your application for the society, they don't need an electrician at the moment. What do you like to be called when you play dress-up?"

"Excuse me? Frank asked bewildered.

"Dress-up, play hero, what do you like to be called?" Falcona lit up a smoke, kid used a spark from his finger to light it. Not very impressive powers in Star City, this kid was doomed from the start.

"Electromancer!" He declared, striking a pose with his fists on his hips.

Falcona took a long drag, breathing deep and squinting her eyes. Her long black and grey hair quivered, her shoulders shook. Choked laughter expelled bursts of smoke into the air. Falcona slapped her hand on the desk breaking into a fit of laughter.

"Holy shit that is the worst fuckin name I have ever heard. You're gonna get eaten alive kiddo, that's the best you came up with? The schmucks are gonna have a field day bustin your balls! I cannot in good conscience let you ever say that name again."

Falcona caught her breath, electromancer hung his head dejectedly. "I thought it was cool." He mumbled.

"Your new name is Lethal Lightning. I'm gonna call you Bolt Boy. Cool?" Falcona asked.

"Can you please not call me Bolt Boy ma'am?" Frank asked politely.

"No can do Bolt Boy. Let's wrap this up, I gotta deal with more people like you today, wanna get done before happy hour. Take your mask off." Falcona ordered. With a press of a button on her desk the windows of the office tinted. Bolt Boy removed his mask.

"Wow you really need to wash your face better kid." Falcona grimaced at the oily, pimply teenage face staring back at her. Supers were manifesting their powers younger and younger, not a good sign.

"You're mean you know that?" Bolt Boy shot back.

"Truth hurts." Falcona snapped his picture, one front facing, one each from the sides. "Put your mask back on, you're better looking with it." Falcona winked at the kid, made him blush a little, she still had it.

"Alright we're all finished here, thank you for your time Bolt Boy. Be safe out there." Falcona waved the young super out of her office. She cleared her throat as he grasped the doorknob, causing him to turn his head.

"Little piece of advice young man. Don't go showing off your powers until the society finds a lane for you. Listen to the boss, Fuzion, respectfully, she knows what she's doin. Stay in your lane. Just because I'm a detective don't mean I can't write traffic tickets, expensive ones, ones you can't afford. Clear?"

Frank nodded his head. "Yes ma'am." he replied sheepishly before leaving the office.

Falcona leaned back in her comfy leather chair and kicked her feet up. "Fuck." She said exasperated. The hydra was growing too many heads too quickly, she couldn't keep up with all the beheading. She was running out time before the whole city would start spiraling down the drain. Falcona shuddered at the thought of teenage supers and schmucks, superpowers and raging hormones are a dangerous mix.
