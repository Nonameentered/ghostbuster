Glad you enjoyed it. I have to disagree with the thought of natural selection rescuing humanity. Natural selection is a cruel mistress, without the correct balance of environmental pressures species go extinct. Species go extinct a lot on a geological timeline. Only six people means we're boned, gene pool isn't deep enough and there are no similar enough species to interbreed with that could produce viable offspring. We'd end up like a lot of things, a dead end of an evolutionary branch.
