Earth year 1917. Universal galactic calendar cycle 7445879. Observation continues on the earthlings. Scientific and manufacturing capabilities continue to increase at a seemingly exponential rate. Their purpose for progress is finding new and novel ways to kill each other. Less than a cycle ago they were bludgeoning each other with large rocks and sticks. Now they kill from the skies. 

They launch mortars towards deep muddy trenches. Rudimentary aircraft force them from their trenches towards a line of automatic weapons fire. Thousands fall for an inch of muddy, pockmarked land. The species gravitates towards war; a vicious cycle of destruction and ever changing alliances. 

Earthling's capacity for suffering is quite high, the primal urge to conquer overpowers reason and logic. Young soldiers cry because they are still alive amongst the bodies of the fallen. Still they fight. While the rodents spread disease amongst the starved soldiers the bombs drop on crowded hospitals. 

Earthlings designed an ever changing war machine to control population growth, possibly unbeknownst to them. Estimated time before the long war is over is approximately one to two Earth years. The gas they use that smells like the flora of their opponent's homeland seems to be working well. 

End of report. Additional reports to be filed at continuing intervals of one mini cycle. Lieutenant Glaxorm signing off.
