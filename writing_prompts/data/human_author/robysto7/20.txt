***The Secret Sauce \[Pt. 2\]***

Falcona smiled at the butcheress. "You doin okay girl? Anything you want to get off your chest?"

Smoke and steam twisted from Belinda's lips. "It's just so mundane, Detective. Everyday the same familiar worn out faces stuffing their mouths full. Everyday the same routine. Get up, go to work, go home, sleep, repeat. Where's the excitement of the hunt? Of the kill? Of the butchering?" Belinda's words swelled with nostalgia.

"You still seeing Dr. Katz three times a week?"

Belinda nodded. "I'm makin progress. They're just fantasies, I don't act em out no more, I'm holding up my end. I miss it, I really miss it."

"Miss what?" Falcona asked despite her better judgement.

"Butchering a person, breaking em down piece by piece, my scalpel and cleaver the brushes, skin and sinew my canvas. Filleting flesh for feasts. Breaking bones for broth. Weaving wigs of human hair. Not a part wasted, ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

Falcona laughed, not because it was funny, she finally figured it out.

"The secret ingredient is love. Pretty obvious when I say it out loud."

Belinda snapped back to reality from her fantasy. "Excuse me?"

Falcona grinned. "After a long day of dealing with the stupid squabbling of supers and schmucks, along with the slimy creeps that crawl along the streets, there is nothing I want more than one of your sandwiches."

Belinda would blush if the temperature wasn't so low. "My cookin aint that good."

"Kiddo I'm italian, we bond over food, cooking and enjoying a meal with others is a most enjoyable thing to us. I can taste the love in your cooking, it reminds me of happier times. My Ma used to cook with a whole lot of love, I never got the hang of it. Great thing about food, it tickles all your senses, can transport you somewhere nice, somewhere you'd rather be, someone you want to be with."

Belinda rose from her stool and embraced Falcona. She kissed the top of her head. "Thanks darlin. It's not that easy though, I don't know how to get out of this rut."

Falcona gently pushed the butcheress off her and adjusted her burgundy suit. She took a long drag of her smoke, thinking intensely. A plan formed in her head, she didn't like it, seemed cruel but nobody would get hurt. Worth a shot.

"Little birdy told me that Dr. Neutron is toying around with making functional human bodies with the synthetic flesh that we've been supplying you with. Heard he's getting close. If you were to somehow stumble upon one of these mindless flesh shells and do what you love to do, would that toss you a rope to get out of that rut?"

"Do they have brains?" Belinda asked excitedly.

"You know you'll catch kuru if you eat human brain tissue Double B. Everything besides that will be anatomically correct."

"I can't really be held responsible if I just find one, right?" Belinda asked.

"Not at all, lack of evidence. I'll make a call, might take about a month. Don't get discouraged, it's something to look forward to. Feel better?" Falcona asked sincerely.

"A little. Sorry about the food being subpar."

Falcona hopped off the table and started making her way out of the slaughterhouse. "Don't worry about it, love can be tricky. Maybe consider seeing Dr. Katz four times a week, keep making progress. Proud of you girlfriend, I much rather have you here at my sandwich sanctuary than the nut house."

Falcona unlocked the front door, waving Vic over while she retrieved her umbrella. The two huddled under the umbrella preparing to leave.

"We're leaving? Didn't go so well did it, Mrs. Deft Hand?" Vic mocked.

"Went great actually. She's having an off week, happens to the best of us, you know that. I'm still fucking hungry, any ideas on where to go?" Falcona asked.

"Hot dog stand down the street?" Vic replied.

"Ewww. No dogs, you never know what they're made of."
