"Excuse me!? *Your daughter?* You want to maybe rephrase that if you want my help?" I can't believe that jackass just called Atomic Girl *"my daughter".*

The phone went silent for a second; a heavy sigh followed. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that, she's our daughter. Just going a little stir crazy is all and when she visits the loneliness goes away. I know you'll never come visit me, that's why I stopped asking Sarah to ask you." 

Dammit, why am I feeling sorry for him? I've never heard him this sad. "I just don't think I'm ready to come visit you, I'd have to get into my old costume to protect my secret identity. I'm not Fuzion anymore."

"I bet you'd still look glamorous in any of your old costumes. Do you still have that red two piece number you wore on New Year's eve?"

"The New Year's eve where you threatened to gas the city from your war zeppelin? But instead it was one of your "romance traps"?" I hadn't thought of that night for a very long time. Dr. Neutron used to spare no expense to get my attention.

"One of my better ones I'd say. Great food, fine champagne, a string quartet playing the classics. We floated silently above the city watching the fireworks light the night sky as the clock struck midnight. In my opinion that was one of our best kisses, a great start to what was a great year." 

I could hear Dr. Neutron choking up on the other end of the line. "That was a fun night. But that was a long time ago."

"Where did we go wrong? Sarah turned out great, why didn't we?"

"We were going in different directions. It wasn't meant to be. Hey I'm kind of busy so I can't keep talking. I'll call Sarah and see what's up. Bye."

"Goodbye Fuzion."

I hung up the phone and dialed my daughter. I didn't expect her to pick up, she was a busy young woman, she proved me wrong.

"Hey Mom! What's up?" She asked.

"Were you supposed to visit your Dad today?" I asked firmly.

"No.....I'm visiting him tomorrow, like I do every other Thursday." 

I chuckled. "Today is Thursday you knucklehead. I just got off the phone with him, he's freaking out."

"Oh shit today is Thursday! It must have slipped my mind. I was just about to go get coffee with this really cute guy. Shit, I better cancel that."

"Don't do that. Go on your date sweetie. Remember to use protection."

"I can manipulate matter on a subatomic level mom, I can hold my own. Well let me hang up and I'll call Dad and explain."

"I'll take care of that. I'm not really doing anything, I'll go see him. Let him know."

"You will? You're the best! Thanks Mom, I love you!" 

"Love you too honey." I tossed my phone on the couch and trudged upstairs. I dug through my closet. Where did I put that little red two piece outfit?
