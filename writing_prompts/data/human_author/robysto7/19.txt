***Super Problems Require Super Solutions***

The antique grandfather clock in foyer of the Neutron's home could barely be heard over the intense argument happening down the hall in the kitchen. This argument was unlike any other Dr. Neutron and his wife Fuzion had engaged in during their short marriage. Thunderous bangs on the front door got their attention, loud police knocks. Fuzion answered the door in her powder blue satin robe, it popped against her pale orange features. Her sister, the detective, always knocked loudly out of habit.

Detective Falcona had been rudely interrupted from her late night slumber to assist her sis in the as she put it 'meeting of the minds' taking place in the kitchen. Falcona yawned loudly, rubbing some sleep from her eyes. Fuzion's bright orange hair stood angrily at attention, she was the more emotional one.

"About time you got here." She said sternly.

Falcona lightly hugged her sister and pushed past her to hang up her pork pie hat. "Good evening, or good morning, whatever three thirty a.m. is to you too."

"Sorry. Didn't mean nothin by that. Can you please come talk some sense into him? He listens to you."

"Doc does wear thick specs. Maybe he thinks he's talkin to you, we are twins."

"I'm fucking orange!" Fuzion belted out. A wave of regret swept over her eyes, she gave her sis an apology hug.

"Obviously I am walking into a minefield, so I'll follow you." Falcona shoved her sister off and made her way into the kitchen. Dr Neutron already had a drink poured for the detective, he was a very well mannered schmuck. Falcona sat at the head of the kitchen table, flanked by her super sis, and schmuck brother-in-law. A swirling blue and white marble encased in a glass cube sat in the center of the table.

"What's this all about?" Falcona asked while she intently stared at the cube. She fumbled around in the breast pocket of her black three piece suit for her pack of smokes. She lit one without taking her eyes off it.

Dr. Neutron cleared his throat. "I would ask you to put that out but Fuzion's biology can handle second hand smoke while pregnant. That's why your lovely sister called you over here tonight."

Falcona sipped her scotch. "I know how babies are made doc, had that talk with pa a long time ago."

"Pa told you about that? Ma told me, can only imagine the gritty and gruesome details pop probably went into." Fuzion chuckled.

"He did know how to paint a picture with his words." Falcona laughed along with her sister.

Neutron tapped on the glass cube to get the women's attention. "It's late; can we postpone the familial reminiscence til morning? Is it morning? What time is it............nevermind. Since this isn't solely my decision to make we're at an impasse. I assume Fuzion called you since you will naturally take her side as blood. I'm sure you won't, I know you're a very wise and reasonable woman, you'll agree with me on this issue."

"You want to turn our daughter into a weapon!" Nuclear green flames raged behind orange irises.

Neutron bummed a smoke from his sister-in-law. "Everything can be a weapon, it's all about how you wield it. I don't want to turn our daughter into a devastating dirigible of destruction. She'll wield not an olive branch, but an entire grove. Look around you! Every generation yields a new crop of things more human than human. Some harvest only a single fruit, others many, all dangerous if left unchecked.

That is what Connor wanted. That's what we need to stop. And this gorgeous glass cell holds the key. Connor was looking in the wrong place, he never figured out how to tap into Starlight's power. I did. He was shortsighted."

"He was a fuckin maniac!" Fuzion screamed.

"Sis is right. I prefer to refer to him as a monster." Falcona chimed in.

The doc continued. "He was a complicated man living in complicated times. He wanted to use this on himself, become a god, doing so would have torn him apart. This must be cast into the primordial essence of a motherly womb, become one with the growing life. My daughter's only limit will be her imagination, honey I know you and I can nurture such an imagination. She will not be a soldier on the front lines.

If we keep playing our cards right she will never have to use even a fraction of this power. My greatest desire is to undo the mistakes of the past to pave a smoother future. When this works she'll be the most powerful, sweet, normal little girl walking the earth. I would trade anything but you darling to be normal again." Neutron sighed.

Fuzion choked up. "Me too. That's why I can't do it, power corrupts. Nothing can stop that."

Neutron squeezed his cigarette butt, reducing it to ash. "When the mice get smarter, you build a better mousetrap." His discourse turned smug.

"See there it is! Always wanting to spring a trap on people! How do I know you're not trapping me!" Fuzion screamed.

Falcona's piercing whistle put a stop to the yelling. She took a long drag of her cig and pointed at the doc. "Doc's right sis. World needs strong people, we're running out of fingers to plug up all the leaking dykes. Never hurts to have an extra ace up your sleeve if you get in a pinch."

"You're taking his side!?" Fuzion glared at her sister.

Falcona tussled her sister's hair trying to make her smile. "Sometimes a strong shepherd is needed to make sure the flock gets home safely, the strongest ones also tend to be the wisest, ones who know the land. You're gonna be a good mom, sis, no matter what you two decide.

Get some sleep before you make a decision though. It is too fucking early in the morning to be planning the birth of a god. Night you two. Walk me to my car sis?" Falcona gave the doc a noogie, that always pissed him off, he had a bit of a napoleon complex. The two sisters walked to the sidewalk outside the small suburban hideout. Fuzion had a million questions to ask but couldn't decide on which one to ask.

Falcona reached into her pocket. She stared into her sis's eyes. "Don't overthink it sis. Do what your heart tells you. It's your choice, you're the one who's gonna have a new roommate for eighteen years." She retrieved a glass box, identical to the one sitting on the kitchen table. "This is the real one, doc's is a fake. If you go through with this call me so I can swap em back."

"Where did you get that?" Fuzion's voice oozed with fear.

"Took it from Connor's cold dead hands after I blasted his brains out. Like I said, good to have an ace up your sleeve. Call me tomorrow after you sleep on it. Love ya sis, keep the doc in line for me."

"Love you too. Would I be a good mom for a god?"

"Couldn't be any worse than you are as a sister." Falcona gave Fuzion a smooch on the cheek goodbye. She peeled out of the neighborhood into the rising sun, the sun of a new generation of supers and schmucks.
