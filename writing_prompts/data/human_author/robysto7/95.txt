"Excuse me mister! Excuse me! Mister! Excuse me!" The young biped waved his fleshy arm in the air excitedly. He was being far too loud, the library is a silent refuge, not a playground. As I floated down from the shelves that scrape the sky the young biped jumped up and down excitedly.

"Shhh! We whisper in the library. Not yell. What may I do for you?" I asked the young creature. It was speechless, its eyes filled with wonder as it poked my liquid metal shell. The ripples cascading over my spherical shape.

"Can I give you my book? I heard that it will come true if I do." The biped stretched its arms out grasping a crudely bound book, the cover a crayon drawing of a black cat lying on a couch.

"As curator of the library I must read it first. Let me show you to the reading area." I floated ahead with the slow biped in tow to the cozy nook of the reading room, where knowledge and imagination reign supreme. Creatures of all shapes and sizes studied their favorite works. I manifested a comfy chair for the small creature and absorbed the book.

A picture book, crudely drawn and badly narrated. I determined it to have no artistic, scientific, historic, or philosophic merit. I returned the book to the thing. "No I cannot take your book. It does not belong on these shelves. Sorry to disappoint you."

The young one was not deterred. "Maybe you didn't get it."

What an audacious creature. Since the dawn of reality I have gathered and studied the finest works from every corner of the universe. Cataloguing them, using them to shape reality according to my design. Yet this pitiful creature questions me. "It's going to take a lot to convince me, think you can do it?"

The young one excitedly nodded his head. He started with the cover.

"This is Mr. Mittens, he was my cat. My family's cat. He had really long whiskers and bright green eyes, he was really soft too." The young one's voice was happy and innocent. Nowhere in the text was Mr. Mittens named. The biped continued.

"So this story is about him. There's my mom and dad and little sister Susie bringing Mr. Mittens home from the shelter. He was the runt of the litter, that's why I drew him so small."

The young child explained the various adventures of Mr. Mittens in details that were not present in the book itself. It was starting to make more sense. The last two pages were coming up.

"This is when we all had to say goodbye to Mr. Mittens, that's Dr. Allen, she's a good kitty doctor. But she couldn't help Mr. Mittens, there was something wrong with his heart. Susie cried a lot when it happened. Then the last page is Mr. Mittens going over the rainbow, that's my grandma in the background waiting for him."

I gave it a second thought but I wanted to be sure I was correct. "Why do you want this publication in the library?"

"Maybe if it's true that Mr. Mittens is safe and happy with grandma in heaven it'll be true and Susie won't be so sad anymore. I don't like seeing her cry so much, I miss Mr. Mittens too. That'll happen if the book is here right?" The child's eyes welled with tears.

I reabsorbed the book and floated up to a shelf right near the door, depositing it in the "Librarian's choice" section.
