***Super Dating For Dummies***

Detective Falcona lost track of the world around her, she was absorbed by the jazz band playing on the other side of Paul's piano bar. She dug through her coat pockets in the comfy back booth. A nasally high pitched voice cut through the music.

"Need a light?" She asked. The strike of a match and the dance of a flame lit Falcona's smoke for her.

"Hey Queeny. What are you doing here? You normally don't come in during jazz brunch."

Queen Bee winked at the detective. Her yellow and black striped sequined cocktail dress glowed in the early afternoon sun. A massive hive of honey blonde hair topped her head. She was striking, her features sharp, yet elegant. She started to slide into the booth.

"I didn't tell you to sit down. I asked you a question." Falcona barked.

Queen Bee rolled her eyes and stood up straight. "I was hoping to find you here. Is it safe to talk?" Bee looked around nervously.

"Sit down kiddo. You look nice today, really know how to put yourself together." Falcona sipped her mimosa and ordered another round from the server floating around. Service was impeccable at Paul's.

"Thanks, that suit looks nice on you, navy blue is a good color on you, matches your eyes, makes your hair pop. Do you want me to dye those grays or do you like the streaks against the black. Have you ever thought about going blonde? Ohhhh, what about redhead?"

Falcona put her hand up. "You're buzzing a bit too much, slow it down. We can have girl talk later, your're interrupting my brunch. I'm guessin you need a favor?"

"What does Mason Maniacal want for his birthday?" QB asked and downed half her mimosa.

"How on Earth would I know that?"

QB shot Falcona a stinging gaze. "Come on don't do that. You know everything about everyone in this town, especially us schmucks. I'll owe you big time!"

"Well my pa always used to say "cash is king, so don't be stingy" but that's not really something you give to your boyfriend as a b-day gift."

"We're not dating, at least I don't think we are. More physical than anything." Queeny blushed, her pointed cheeks flushed red, she tried to drown it with orange juice and champagne.

"Not according to my sources, little birdy told me how close you two are. He treatin you good?" Falcona asked.

"Oh yeah, oh yeah. Before you ask I treat him right. It sucks, like what if I get him something and he hates it? So much pressure." QB's face slowly returned to a normal hue.

"What's he into? On a personal level, not his schmuck facade." Falcona ordered another round of drinks, QB could throw em back pretty well.

"He likes football, although he doesn't like it when I bug him with questions about it." QB admitted.

Falcona finished her smoke, stamping it out in the marble ashtray on the table. "I gotta go powder my nose, back in two shakes of a lamb's tail."

Queen Bee slunk down in the booth. Maybe it was just a physical attraction, she really didn't know if there was a genuine spark in her floundering love life, heavy hangs the head that wears the crown. Falcona slid her cellphone across the table and plopped back down into the booth. She lit another smoke.

"Had an idea in the powder room, I think you'll like it." Falcona spewed out a slim spiral of smoke.

"Come on spit it out, don't keep me in suspense." QB pleaded.

"You ever been on Dr. Neutron's war zeppelin?" Falcona asked.

"I wish. I hear it's fucking awesome, like a floating fantasy island." QB bummed a smoke.

"It is. Two weeks from now the Star City Solar Flares are playing on prime time, you and your not boyfriend can use the zeppelin to watch the game from the best seat in the house. I bet once he hears that he'll be very excited. You know that he rambles if he's excited, maybe he'll drop some other clues for ya. If not this is still a damn good present."

QB leaned over the table and smooched the detective's forehead. "Thank you Falco. How did you get Dr. N to agree to that?"

"He hasn't yet but he will. I'm gonna call in the favor you owe me already. In one week there's gonna be a shipment of exotic flowers coming into port, dock c specifically. Melinda Muse and Will O' The Wisp are plannin something but I don't know what. Can you make sure those flowers get pollinated with this please?" Falcona slipped a small glass vial into Queeny's hand.

"Anything to ride on that zeppelin, you wouldn't happen to know if there's a bedroom on it.........do you?" QB whispered.

"Four of em. Just don't break nothin. Nice seeing ya Queeny, now if you please, can I get back to my solo brunch?" Falcona winked. QB got up and smooched Falcona's cheek. Falcona enjoyed watching her leave, the cocktail dress really showed off her stinger. Falcona didn't blink an eye while cleaning up the scum on the streets of Star City. She'd seen things people shouldn't have to see, the grim reality how people can treat each other. Not even she was willing to dip her toe into the dating pool, the odds were good here, but the goods were odd.
