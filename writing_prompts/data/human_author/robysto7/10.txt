***Helping Hands***

Snowflakes gently fell to earth, coming to rest on the cold streets of Star City. The usual cacophony of car horns and sirens fell silent on Thanksgiving, the citizens who normally packed the streets were instead enjoying meals with loved ones, watching football, and taking turkey induced slumbers. Star City's homeless shelter was no exception, every table full of somber faces enjoying a hot, home cooked meal, a rarity for them. Fuzion called all hands on deck to volunteer this year at the shelter. It was busier than it's ever been.

Supers worked the buffet line, portioning out all the traditional treats of Thanksgiving, trying to make a more personal effort to help those they protected on a daily basis. Fuzion supervised while mingling with the people, most were thankful, some standoffish, not everybody loved the supers. As she made her way around the dining the room an older man entered, his coat torn and thin, a grey beard frozen to his face, a worn out beanie pulled down low, stopping just above beady bloodshot eyes.

The man took one look at Fuzion and mumbled something to himself. Spinning on the ball of his foot he turned and exited the shelter. Fuzion followed him outside, he didn't go far, just down the street to a covered bus stop. He plopped down, taking a brown paper from his coat and drinking deeply from it. Fuzion approached him slowly, the snowflakes melting as they fell around her.

"I know it looks busy in there but we have enough seats and food to go around. Come on in out of the cold, warm up a little. I'm Fuz....."

"I know who you are, everybody does. I'll pass." The man grumbled.

"Can I sit down?" Fuzion asked.

"I'd prefer it if you didn't."

Fuzion sat down despite the man's request, the soft orange glow of her skin illuminated the covered stop, the cold metal bench instantly warmed up. "I feel bad that you know my name but I don't know yours." She smiled kindly at the man.

"Joe. Joe Simmons. Bum." Joe grumbled, gulping his cheap wine.

"Why don't you want to come inside Mr. Simmons? Nobody should be alone during the holidays. Friendly people in there, good food, like I said."

"Even bums have standards. Not gotta break bread with my enemies, doesn't matter what the calendar says. Not compromising on that one." Joe's eyes narrowed as his gaze met Fuzion's, the green nuclear fire behind her orange irises softly flickered.

"Not a fan?" She asked.

Joe fumbled around in his tattered coat, retrieving a crumpled softpack of cigarettes. Fuzion snapped her fingers, a small green flame burst from her thumb, she lit the smoke for him.

"Everything went to shit when you supers showed up, dragging the schmucks along behind you. Ruined my fucking life. Remember when Will O' The Wisp released that pheromone causing people to forget an entire week?" The smoke and steam danced from Joe's lips into the cold night.

"I do. Nighthawk stopped her without any collateral damage." Fuzion replied curiously.

"Tell that to my wife and kids. That pheromone interacted with some rare genetic disorder my wife had, one she passed on to my kids, sent them into anaphylactic shock. Least that's what the doctors told me. I don't remember, because no ones remembers that week. Where were you people?

Aren't you supposed to swoop down and save the day? My kids treated me like a hero, and I failed them, just like my heroes failed me. People pray for villains when their heroes let them down, that's what I did. Joined Will O' The Wisps crew trying to get close to her, to kill her, get my justice. Never got the chance, Nighthawk busted me, tossed me in the slammer.

Overcrowding granted me an early release. Wish I was back in jail, tossed me out like yesterday's garbage. Nothing to my name, only the clothes on my back. Nobody wants to hire an ex-con, especially not one that worked for a schmuck, we're deemed 'untrustworthy'. Why am I even tellin you this? You don't give a shit." Joe hung his head, slowly sipping from his wine bottle.

"I'm sorry for your loss Mr. Simmons. I really am. I know what it's like to have your entire family ripped from you while you're powerless to stop it. Worst feeling in the world. You never get over it, you just learn to live with it. Keep going, keep your head up and your feet moving."

"Easy for you to say. Having superpowers makes that a lot easier."

"Not really. I never asked for this. I never wanted this. All I want to do is make this city better for the next generation." Fuzion sighed.

"Great. Another generation of super people lording over us, can't wait. Why can't you all just leave? Things would be better without you people around."

Crunching footsteps interrupted the two. "Mom you out here?" Called out Sarah, Fuzion's daughter. She trotted over to the two, bundled up tight, only a few strands of orange hair escaped her hoodie, falling onto the wool scarf wrapped around her face. "Sorry am I interrupting something?"

Joe eyed her up, keeping quiet. Fuzion waved to her daughter. "Taking a little break, what's up?"

"Running low on mashed potatoes, Belinda needs me to run out to her place and get more. Didn't want to disappear on you, already told Dad." Sarah said cheerily, she couldn't staunch her sunny disposition.

"Drive safe sweetie, roads are slick. Call me if anything happens. Oh, this is Mr. Simmons." Fuzion cocked her head towards Joe.

"Happy Thanksgiving Mr. Simmons! Are you coming in? I'll be extra expedient getting the spuds refilled then. I'm Sarah, pleasure to meet you." Sarah extended her hand for a shake. Joe begrudgingly shook her hand. Sarah gripped his hand tightly, placing her free hand on his forearm. "You look cold, let me help ya with that."

As Sarah lightly squeezed the man's forearm his old tattered coat transformed into a heavy wool overcoat, paired with warm slacks, socks, and new shoes. Sarah reached into her hoodie pocket, pulling out a pair of gloves. "These should fit."

Joe looked himself over. "What did you do? Where are my clothes?"

Sarah pulled her scarf down, revealing a sheepish smile. "Those are your clothes. Did a little sub-atomic rearranging. Are they not comfy? Did I screw up? I can fix it."

Joe shook his head rapidly. "No, no, no. These are great, really warm. Thank you. Why did you do that? You don't even know me."

Sarah pulled her scarf back up. "If you can lend a helping hand, you might as well, you've got two of em. That's what I believe. I'm glad you like them. Nice to meet you Mr. Simmons, happy thanksgiving, I gotta run, make sure those spuds get into people's stomachs tonight." With a wave Sarah was off into the snowy night.

Fuzion rubbed Joe's shoulder, his new coat was soft. "I may not be the best hero, but I'm trying to make that right by teaching the next generation to be better." Fuzion choked out.

"Because that's what heroes do." Joe sighed.

"That's what family does. Funny thing about family, anyone can be it. You just need to keep looking, even when it's dark."

Joe's growling stomach echoed in the night. He finished off his wine and rose from the bench. Joe extended his hand to Fuzion, he helped her up as the two walked back to the shelter. There's always something to be thankful for, even if it's in your blind spot.
