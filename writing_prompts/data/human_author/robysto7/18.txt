***The Sum of Zero***

Distant thunder boomed on the horizon, dark storm clouds swirled in the sky while the waves crashed below. Detective Falcona was out of her jurisdiction in international waters. She pulled alongside the massive super yacht and boarded. No alarms, no guards, it was too quiet. She drew her forty four magnum, releasing the safety and slowly checked the deck. As she investigated flood lights snapped on, speakers played classical music. A slow clap echoed from the bowels of the yacht.

Falcona swung her gun towards the claps, her arch nemesis Connor Chaos ascended from below. Impeccably quaffed blond hair looked out of place against a loud hawaiian shirt and cargo shorts. He smiled at the detective. "Lunar eclipse party is next week Detective, you're early, I don't need that much help setting it up, I have hired goons for that. Surprised you found me this quickly, thought it would take you longer. How are you?" Connor asked in his gently devious tone.

"Probably shouldn't have named your boat after your ex-wife. Couple bribes here and there let me track down the good ship 'Starlight'. Add in some good ol' fashioned detective work, here I am. You're getting sloppy Conman." Falcona growled.

"Keeping the family tradition alive, maybe you are as good as dear old dad. Sorry to disappoint you dear but you have no power here. You can't lock me up on these waters." Connor smirked.

Falcona kept her gun trained on him. "The only place I'm gonna lock you up is in a casket." She growled. With a flash Connor disappeared, reappearing behind Falcona. He put his lips to her ear.

"How are you going to shoot what you can't hit? Besides, you think a normal bullet will put me down? Your reach exceeds your grasp Falco." He sneered.

Falcona didn't turn around. "These ain't normal bullets." Falcona fired two shots into the deck, they warped behind the two, Connor grasped her around the waist, teleporting them a few feet away making the shots miss.

Connor chuckled. "Well......that's interesting. Miniaturized my wormhole tech, how did *you* do that?" He asked while keeping his grip around Falcona's waist, lightly squeezing her.

"Little gift from your old partner." Falcona broke Connor's grasp and quickly turned firing off two more shots, both missed as Connor teleported up to the ship's mast.

"You should see the look on your face right now! You didn't really think assassinating me would be that easy, did you?" He cackled. Falcona couldn't take aim, Connor kept teleporting around the deck, mocking her. Connor was smart, no discernible pattern to his ports. Rain began to fall, Connor ported to Falcona's side.

"Storm is about to arrive, according to the radar it's going to be a rough one. Let's continue inside, I don't want your trench coat and hat to get wet." In the blink of an eye the two were inside the super yacht's bar. "That's your father's old get up right?" He asked while going behind the bar.

"Yeah, figured they were good executioner's clothes." Falcona took aim, Connor didn't move.

"You already shot up the deck, please don't shoot up the bar too. I like it here." Connor poured two glasses of scotch, waving Falcona over to a barstool. She hesitantly sat down, placing her gun on the bar, barrel pointing at Connor.

"Drink up. This is a friendly bar, not going to slip you anything." Connor took a sip as a show of good faith. "I don't remember you getting promoted to executioner......detective. I hate to repeat myself, but your reach exceeds your grasp. Killing me would bring about dire consequences, seems you didn't do any detective work on that front, did you?"

Falcona slugged down her scotch. "Gonna monologue at me about the moral implications of killing one to save billions? Don't. Heard it already." Falcona lit a smoke, Connor poured another round.

"Kill me, and you will kill billions." Connor's lips curled into a sinister smile.

"Christ almighty you have a big ego."

"Gods tend to, comes with the territory. Don't misunderstand me dear, I'm the keystone of the new world I made, remove me and the whole thing blows up......literally."

Falcona peered at Connor over the rim of her glass. "You think your doomsday crap scares me? I'm only killing a man, not a god, I don't give two shits if you made the supers and the schmucks. The machine's getting bigger Conman, now you're just a cog in it. Nobody's gonna miss you." She grumbled.

"You're not seeing the forest for the trees dear. I created them, thus I can destroy them. They exist because I allow it, they will end when I, and only I, demand it. Kill me, kill the planet. Not a fair trade." Connor finished his drink and poured another round.

"You're bluffing. If you told me the sky was blue I would still go outside and check." Falcona narrowed her gaze at Connor, she was the one bluffing.

"When I nudged evolution along not even I expected it to work as well as it has. Their numbers are growing, getting stronger, spreading far and wide, developing unforeseen powers. A success. I do enjoy watching their exploits, trying to stay human when they are so, so much more. Not even what they call superpowers can overcome the human dilemma.

Long story short detective. Once my heart stop beating it triggers a signal embedded in everyone's dna, specifically the one that triggers the initial genetic and quantum changes that give people their powers in the first place. If my calculations are correct, around two billion people carry the original sequence, another couple hundred million, give or take, carry the second generation. Third gen should be popping up soon. With those numbers, it'll be total annihilation."
