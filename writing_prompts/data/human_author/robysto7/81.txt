Dust clouds swirled under the scorching Texas sun. The thundering hooves of a war horse shook the large cattle ranch. Nicole was almost home, the last time she'd ever be there. She knew Ma and Pa would understand why. Nicole hitched her horse Gus to the barbed wire fence of the property. She wanted to walk the final leg of the journey, take some time to collect herself, stop her hands from shaking. Red hot fire burned in her veins, sorrow flogged her mind.

She strolled up to the house, Ma was sitting on the porch knitting while enjoying some iced tea. Nicole stopped at the steps up onto the porch, she took a deep breath.

"Pa get your ass out here now!" Nicole yelled, she knew that would get her Pa's attention.

Pa's deep voice boomed from inside the house, "Who the fuck is yellin out here!?" Pa's large frame squeezed through the front door. His broad shoulders the most prominent feature of his muscular physique. Pa took a puff of his cigar and locked eyes with Nicole. "Nick? Fuck are you doing here? Supposed to be drivin the cattle." A cloud of smoke enveloped the porch, Ma coughed.

Nicole sneered. "Cattle are still on the way, the other five are taking care of it." Nicole replied coldly, all Pa cared about was a making a dollar.

"Five? Where the fuck is everyone else? Why are you even here?" Pa asked.

"Billy and Rodrigo are dead. So.......so...........so is Jeremiah." Nicole choked out. The pounding waves of tears that she tried to suppress had finally crested.

Ma gasped. Pa bolted down the porch steps and embraced his daughter in a way he never had before. Nicole was the son that Pa never had, she was raised differently than her sisters. She was the lone cowgirl amongst a band of rowdy cowboys. She cried on Pa's shoulder, he held her gently.

"I'm so sorry sweetie. What happened?" Pa's voice was more gentle than Nicole had ever heard it. She wiped her tears away. There would be time to cry later. Business came first.

"Rustlers. Band of mexicanos. Ambushed us, took us completely by surprise, caused a stampede. They killed Jeremiah."

Ma started crying, Pa put his arm around her. "What did you do with the bodies?" Ma tearfully asked.

"Me and the boys buried em, didn't have anything to mark their graves with. Didn't bury the rustlers, we left them for the vultures. I beat the tar out of them to make sure they wasn't going anywhere, and to get the names of their amigos. I only came back here to let you know about that. And to get my things."  Nicole pushed past her parents into the house. She didn't need much, it wouldn't take long. She didn't have time to waste.

She raided the family armory. Couple double-barreled shotguns, a repeater rifle, and boxes of ammo. She could hear Ma and Pa arguing as she made her way to her and Jeremiah's bedroom. Ma entered the room and sat on the bed.

"Calm down sweetie. Can we talk about this? I'm so sorry about Jeremiah, I know how much you loved him. We're your family, let us be here for you."

"Calm down!? Those animals killed my fucking husband! And they are still out there somewhere! There is no discussion about it!" Nicole screamed in anguish. Her shattered heart was in control now.

Ma weakly smiled. "It  hurts right now sweetie but revenge isn't the answer. He knew how dangerous the job was, so did you."

Nicole seethed. "An eye for an eye."

"That leaves the whole world blind."

"Then I'll hunt in the dark." Nicole slammed her fist against the wall, it reverberated through the house.

Ma stood up and hugged Nicole lightly. "I love you sweetie. You're pigheaded just like your father, nothing I say is gonna stop you. Is it?"

"I love you too Ma. I can't stay here. Too many memories, I'll be safe. Jeremiah's looking down on me from heaven." Nicole hugged her mother tightly. She finished packing alone. Last thing to pack was the picture of Nicole and Jeremiah on their wedding day. Nicole took one last look at the room.

His boots stood still besides the bed. Snakeskin cowboy boots. Gaudy as all hell, didn't compliment any of Jeremiah's attire. He never wore em anyways, said they were his dancin boots. Jeremiah had two left feet, dancing was not something he was capable of. Said he was going to learn how after they retired and started their own family.

"Rest in peace honey. I'm gonna make this right." Nicole exited the house and saddled up.

The crimson sun peeked through dark clouds. An unending storm was coming.
