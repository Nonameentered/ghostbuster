I admit I'm not the most tidy person. Things can get a little messy around my place. There might be dishes in the sink left overnight and the trash not taken out until it overflows but I didn't think it was that bad. I guess unforeseen forces of fate thought differently. It's been here for three days now. It's cloak menacingly flows around it's rattling bones. Wielding not a scythe that could cut the gossamer threads of life, instead a platoon of cleansing weaponry.

Mops of various designs, brooms both short and wide bristled, sponges soft and coarse, feather dusters made of pheonix feathers, an unending symphony of sanitation. While its skull lacked any discernible facial features, I could feel a judgemental gaze fall on me from pitch black pits sunk into pearly white orbitals. Cold whispers whistled ethereal utterances from chattering teeth.

"When was the last time you dusted the baseboards here?" It inquired.

"Ummmm......don't know. Probably never." You're supposed to dust those? Learning a lot from this thing. A swirling whirlwind swelled as its cloak rapidly spun, a tornado of dust flung open the front door, scattering in the autumn winds.

"Have you ever changed the filter of your washing machine?" Another inquiry.

"The washing machine has a filter?" I asked. That can't be a thing right?

Bony fingers interlaced with mine. They were frigid to the touch, sent a chill down the spine. After a moment they warmed, a comforting warmth, like being held by a lover. We checked the washing machine. What do you know? It does have a filter on the back. Wow that's gross. It's all slimy and ookey. Gonna remember to check that more often.

"Our work here is almost finished. One last thing to do. Follow me." I was compelled to follow it, almost powerless to resist. With a snap of bony thumbs a bountiful bouquet of bathroom cleaners became to be. "Not even one as powerful as I clean the bathrooms. I supervise. Let us begin."

After getting eye level with every surface in my bathroom I'll admit it was kinda nasty. I'm the only one that uses it. It was nice to see it look so good after an eternity of scrubbing and drubbing away grime. We admired our work, the cloaked one floated silently behind me. A warm light fell over me, an embrace from behind, rattling bones fell silent, cold breath tickled my ear.

"There is no more to reap here. Do not force me to return, a little everyday goes a long way. Farewell mortal, my father shall visit you on August 14th sometime in the future."

I snapped back to reality. The presence that had hung so heavy in the air was gone. I looked up at the immaculate looking ceiling.

"What year!?"
