"Your honor my client won't be putting in a plea for the court, we've come to an agreement with the prosecution." Sleazy defense lawyer to the stars Harold Hamlin flatly spoke in the empty courtroom. Closed trial, no media allowed. The honorable judge Garlin looked up from her thick framed glasses.

"When did this happen? The court wasn't made aware of this." She asked as she shuffled through the court records.

"Permission to approach the bench your honor." Hamlin said.

"Granted, prosecution may approach as well."

Judge Garlin conferenced with the two lawyers. The DA was heading up the case herself for the state. She wore a bright red and green pantsuit, still in the christmas spirit it seemed.

"Apologies your honor the prosecution didn't have sufficient time to submit a revised plea to the courts. All happened last minute." The DA turned over the plea deal to the judge.

Judge Garlin rose from behind the bench. "I need to review this in my chambers. Wait here, court's adjourned until I get back."

Hamlin interjected before the judge left the courtroom. "As an aside if this plea falls through my client and I are ready to file a counter suit against the state for defamation of character."

Hamlin went to lay down on a row of courtroom seats. Mr. Clause stood over him, his belly jiggled like jello. "What's the ho-ho-holdup Hamlin?"

"Judge has to make sure we crossed our tees and dotted our eyes. Stop worrying so much Nick. I told you I would take care of this. Like I did when the elves tried to unionize. Keep your red pajama pants on."

The ticking clock droned in the courtroom, not a creature was stirring. Judge Garlin loudly banged her gavel to resume the proceedings. She chewed on the end of her glasses and shook the stack of papers at the DA.

"Mrs. Greene are you aware of what you are agreeing to with this plea deal? Has the DA fully explained it to you?"

Short and sweet little Anges smiled widely at the judge. Her warm grandmotherly aura swelled in the courtroom. "Of course I am sweetie. I mean your honor. Being old makes you wise. I can read legal talk."

Judge Garlin shrugged her shoulders. "By the power vested in me by the great state of New York this case is now officially closed. All records will be sealed following Mrs. Greene signing the NDA. Mrs. Greene you are not to publicly defame or slander Mr. Clause lest you be held in contempt of this court. You agree to no longer refer to Mr. Clause as I quote from your deposition 'A fat sack of shit with an ugly whore wife.'

In exchange the defendant has agreed to permanently put you and your family on the good list for all perpetuity, and to make good on all the presents you did not receive from him that you nicely asked for in all the letters you wrote him. Mr. Clause are you able and willing to uphold these conditions."

Mr. Clause's rosy cheeks drooped. "Yes your honor. You always were a good little girl, not like Agnes."

"You want a piece of me fat man!? Come on, I'm right here!" Agnes shook her tiny fist at Mr. Clause.

"Order in the court! Order in the court!" The judge banged the gavel in time with her words. "No more outbursts or I'll hold you all in contempt! This isn't the north pole, this is my courtroom and you will behave! Don't make me make my own naughty list. Now according to terms of the deal Mr. Clause you are required to give Mrs. Greene her present that you did not deliver on Christmas of 1945."

Mr. Clause reached into his endless toy sack and rang a small bell. Jingle bells rang out with each step of the brilliant white Clydesdale pony that trotted into the courtroom. Agnes' eyes lit up with childlike wonder. She shuffled over to the pony, slow going on account of her cane. She pet its long nose, all she ever wanted when she was a little girl was a pony. She snickered as she rode triumphantly out of the courtroom, Agnes didn't celebrate Christmas, she had to get home to celebrate the sixth night of Hanukkah.
