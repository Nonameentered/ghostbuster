She clicked the heels of her slippers, whisking her away. Crystal balls served as the studio lights and broadcast cameras at Full Moon studios. The audience of scholars groaned when Ashleigh appeared behind her podium.

The third contestant of the trial of champions took offense to that, "Oh please! Even I have standards." Maslow purred. He arched his back and roared as loud as a black cat could.

Dessandre sneered at Ashleigh. "You're going down this year you Mary Sue."

Ashleigh stared up at the crystal balls, she hated being on this stupid show, but she always won. Her five year winning streak was going strong. Ratings were through the roof each year, everybody cheering for Ashleigh to lose. Wizards, warlocks, and witches all united against her, she mastered techniques they had spent centuries learning overnight.

She was resented for showing off her gifts here, and resented for not showing them off there. The producer calmed the audience down. The crystal balls dimmed over the audience. Showtime.

His flowing orange robes popped under the studio lights. He tapped a stack of index cards on the podium. "Alright contestants get your buzzers ready, the Trial of Champions starts now!"
