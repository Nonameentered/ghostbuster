***Blossoming Buds***

Slits of moonlight peeked through patchy clouds providing a natural nightlight for the greenhouse on the grounds of Star City minimum security correctional facility. Will O' The Wisp was on her nightly stroll, checking up on her babies, nothing was in bloom at the moment. The prison didn't allow her to grow anything exotic, only run of the mill flowers one could purchase at any florist. She gazed into the night sky with a heavy heart, maybe her stint in the clink wouldn't be as easy as she thought it would be. The only buds she had to talk to didn't talk back.

As she started back to her cell a familiar scent crept through the air, not one of floral blossoms, but of expensive cologne, he always did wear too much when he visited. Will O' The Wisp peered into the shadows in the corner of the greenhouse. She played it cool, slowly strolling to the supply closet in the greenhouse to retrieve a bottle of red wine she had smuggled in, along with two glasses. She sat down at the picnic table in the center of the greenhouse and poured a drink, gazing into the shadows.

With the snap of her slender, porcelain fingers a small orb of light emanated from her palm. She playfully tossed it into the corner. Nobody was there. She took a deep drink of her wine, questioning if loneliness was playing tricks on her. Two black leather gauntlet clad hands clamped down on her shoulders, she shot up. Ashen eyes twinkled back at her from behind the shadowy cowl.

"Got ya! Please Willow you know me better than that, I never enter the same way twice." Nighthawk smiled at his nemesis, although that label was wearing thinner by the day. His chiseled jaw wore a big smile, his tight suit looked ready to burst at the seams, Nighthawk's mood unusually cheery this evening.

Willow shook off the startle. She removed her hair tie, letting her pale blue hair fall softly around her delicate face. She winked at Nighthawk. "I knew you were behind me. Only playing along with your dramatic entrance. Thanks for not crashing through the ceiling this time. Shouldn't you be out breaking bones of the ne'er do wells of our fine city?" She asked while returning to her seat.

Nighthawk sat across from her, pouring himself a drink. "Slow night tonight, had some time on my hands. Wanted to stop by and say thank you." Nighthawk raised his wine glass. Willow didn't reciprocate.

"Don't know what you're talking about." Willow bluffed like any good schmuck.

"So it wasn't you who had Falco leak the intel about Vicky Venom's secret project to create an army of super intelligent kittens to act as a spy network for her?" Nighthawk asked still raising his glass. Willow finally indulged him, the clink of crystal echoed off the glass walls.

"It was a stupid plan, cats with that kind of intelligence would end up ruling this city by the end of the week, more than they already do. I'm happy you got to make a bust." Willow chuckled.

"Nice to be useful for a change. How are things around here?"

"A bit dull, same boring routine everyday. None of my babies are in bloom right now so I just sit quietly in anticipation. Lot of daydreaming. Lot of planning." Willow's to-do list once she got out was getting longer by the hour.

Nighthawk unfurled his cape, gently placing a small glass box containing a beautiful bud on the table. Willow's eyes widened, sparks shot from her fingertips. She snatched it quickly, softly rotating it, eyeing every angle.

"Is this a *Dendrophylax Lindenii*?" She asked excitedly.

"A Ghost Orchid in the flesh. I know you don't have one of those in your collection."

Willow sighed, placing the box back on the table, gazing at it wistfully. "Because I can't grow them, Nathan. These are delicate, special flowers. They need the exact right environment to grow. Having the orchid alone is not enough, it needs......."

Before Willow could explain further Nighthawk gave her another gift, another small box, this one containing a fungal colony. "I did a little research. It needs this right?" He asked.

Willow leaned over the table to give Nighthawk a kiss on the cheek, sparks flew from her lips on contact. "The orchid can't use photosynthesis alone to grow, the fungus attaches to the roots, exchanges nutrients for sugars. On their own they can survive, but together they thrive. Thank you so much Nathan."

Nighthawk rubbed his cheek, it had gone numb from the electric shock. "Can I come watch it bloom?" He mumbly asked.

"Of course! It might be a while though. These don't flower reliably, so it might never bloom. That's what makes them so rare." Willow's gaze never broke from the bud as she spoke.

"I'm sure it will, it's in good hands. I think it would look nice over there." Nighthawk pointed into a secluded corner of the greenhouse. Willow turned her head, she didn't like the spot, too isolated. "I think it would look much better over here." As she turned to point out her spot, Nighthawk was gone. He never was one for goodbyes.

Willow anxiously paced the greenhouse, looking for the perfect place to plant the orchid. Supers were a dime a dozen in Star City, like cheap grocery store flowers that bloom and wither in a week. Friends, on the other hand, were as rare as the orchid Willow held in her hands. She couldn't wait for it to bloom.
