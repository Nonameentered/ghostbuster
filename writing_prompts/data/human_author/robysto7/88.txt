"We were pinned down by the dough. We had to hold the line until reinforcements arrived. Our bullets were useless, so I ordered the men to affix bayonets and charge. Their war cry still haunts me to this day, the rallying cry for freedom snuffed out by an amorphous adversary that engulfed everything in it's path. It couldn't be reasoned with, it couldn't be destroyed by our flimsy rifles or bayonets. Wave after wave of good soldiers died to defend Mr. Coffee, all they could do was slow down the creeping menace. If we failed; the lego defense wall would have crumbled.

It blotted out the sun when I charged at it. I was running directly towards damnation. Semper Fi. That's when the cavalry showed up. Their advanced weaponry incinerated the writhing blob, the battle turned in our favor when The Autobots showed up. Prince Adam and the other Masters Of The Universe flanked it to push back into the hole it had crawled out of. 

Today we dedicate this memorial to those brave souls that made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of the freedoms we still enjoy to this day. We have repelled the monster, but now we know that our combined resolve shall ultimately triumph." 

Brass horns played 'Taps' as everyone saluted with a warm cup of joe. The bitter taste of victory.
