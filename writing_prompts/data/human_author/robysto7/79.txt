"I looked across the table at Adam. We'd been together for almost three years now but things were getting stale between us. I started noticing that even the little things about him annoyed me. I mean who holds a spoon like that to eat cereal? It was like a caveman struggling to use a stone tool. Adam looked down at his hand curiously. His soft gaze met mine.

'You're doing it again.' His voice was passive, almost dismissive. A wave of panic crashed over me.

Doing what? I implored.

'Narrating your life. Think you might need to go get a booster shot.'

How many more needles would need to pierce my fair skin to quell this ghastly disease? Why was I more afflicted than others? Adam hadn't needed to get any booster shots, his immune system must have been robust. He didn't know it but I resented him for that. I resented a lot of things about him, the passion simply wasn't there anymore. The world continued slipping into insanity, there might not be a future in store for me. I'm still young with so much more to experience. I would never do that chained to this mediocre life. This mediocre man.

Now he's laughing at me!

'Let's get you to the pharmacy. The melodrama stage is starting to present itself, I'll warm up the car.'

Adam kissed me on the forehead gently, maybe I was being rash. He was a sweet soul, despite our differences we made a good team. Every journey has its slumps, that's why having a good partner in crime is so nice. They'll always pick you back up and offer a hand to hold while life's needles pierce your skin."
