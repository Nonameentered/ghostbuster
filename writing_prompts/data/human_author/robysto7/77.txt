"So what happens next?" Dr. Maniacal asked. 

"Ummmm, I don't know." The Marvelous Mallory replied sheepishly. She sat up with her hands upturned in confusion. Dr. Maniacal lightly pushed her back down.

"The story can't just end with us lying on the ground. There has to be some kind of resolution. Use your imagination, like we talked about. You've defeated your arch-nemesis after he stole all the ice cream on Earth, he has to be brought to justice, right?" Dr. Maniacal tried giving the narrative a little push. Marvelous Mallory's eyes lit up. She stood tall in triumph. 

"I've defeated you, villainous scum! Return the ice cream immediately! And say you're sorry."

Dr. Maniacal cackled. "But I don't want to! And I'm not sorry! Go ahead and lock me up, throw away the key while you're at it."

Marvelous Mallory helped the mad doctor to his feet. She hugged his legs. "Too much ice cream rots your teeth, I'm just looking out for you. You can say you're sorry while you scoop ice cream for the people you took it from. It's fun to share!"

Dr. Maniacal accepted defeat. "I haven't been to an ice cream social in years, might be fun. I'm sorry. Eating that much ice cream would have given me a tummy ache anyways."

Before Marvelous Mallory could enact her unique brand of justice the two were interrupted by Mallory's mother. Dinner was ready. Susan was a great cook, she made a hearty beef stew. Warmed a person up on a cold winter night like tonight. 

"Sounds like you two were having fun. What did the dastardly Dr. Maniacal do this time?" Susan asked. Mallory excitedly told her mother all about it while they ate. After dinner they watched that boring superhero movie Mallory loved, must have been the fiftieth time they all watched it together. The three snuggled on the couch, Mallory had fallen asleep in Susan's lap. 

Susan kissed her husband on the cheek. "She is going to be a terrible superhero, she is far too sweet of a kid. If only she knew how powerful she really was. Things are proceeding nicely."

Dr. Maniacal winked at his wife. "Now there's the Queen Bee I fell in love with. Once her powers really manifest we're home free for our master plan. No super in their right mind would kill their parents, we'll be unstoppable."

Watching a plan come together really was a thing of beauty.
