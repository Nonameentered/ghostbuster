Another slow news day in Metropolis didn't provide much to talk about during happy hour at the Ace O' Clubs down in Hob's Bay. So the conversation drifted into familiar territory, the secret life of superheroes and their villainous counterparts. I'd only worked in the Daily Planet's mail room for a few months but in that time I'd heard some crazy theories about the gods that walk amongst us. Everybody was wrong, they all had it backwards. I took advantage of a lull in the conversation to offer my insight on the matter.

"I'm telling you guys, Clark Kent is a supervillain."

Ashley Alstott scoffed. She was the Daily Planet's celebrity reporter. "Farmboy Clark Kent is spreading terror across Metropolis? I know you're new around here kid so I'll chalk that up to ignorance and not stupidity. Clark wouldn't hurt a fly, besides what villain is pussy-whipped like that?"

The others at the table laughed at her retort to my suggestion. It was true that Clark was a lapdog for Lois Lane. I understood why, she was a real looker. Something was off about the boy scout though. Nobody projects that kind of goody two shoes image unless they got a dark secret to hide.

"You all are letting personal bias cloud your judgement. Where does Clark go every time something happens in this city or hell even Gotham? Nowhere to be found. He's working for the villains, keeps the news cycle going."

Ashley ordered another round for the table from Bibbo, owner of the bar and Superman's number one fan. "So which costumed menace does Clark cosplay as?" She asked.

"That part I can't be certain of. Possibly Deathstroke, maybe one of them Brainiac robots in disguise, or he's just some goon jacked up on venom."

They kept laughing at me, Jimmy Olsen laughed so hard beer came out of his nose. "Now he's a drug addict?" He snorted.

"Nobody's ever seen him at a gym, you don't get those kind of rippling muscles and perfect jawline writing news stories behind a desk. Maybe he's Bane himself, that spanish accent is offensive with how stereotypical it is. You tellin me you'd want to run into a jacked up musclebound freak like him in a dark alley?"

"He goes home to Kansas every weekend to help out on the family farm. That's what keeps him in shape." Ashley continued shooting down my theories. "You got something against Clark? He's a nice man, he does his best. He's just a little goofy, maybe he's hiding in the bathroom when the shit hits the fan, he's reported for decades on the superheros, he knows what kind of destruction they can cause."

The music in the bar abruptly stopped, Bibbo switched the sound system over to the tv. I looked over to see what was up.

"Lois Lane here with breaking news! Residents are advised to shelter in place until further notice. Mr. Mxyzptlk has returned, turning everyone he touches into leprechauns!"

Ashley groaned. "That little fucker again. I forgot St. Patrick's day was tomorrow."

Superman took a quick second to address the television audience. I didn't pay attention to it, something in the background caught my eye. He was right down the street. I paid my tab and rushed out the door.

Had to move quick through the panicking crowd seeking shelter. I grabbed the small lead box out of my pocket, the letter still wrapped around it. Small beams of green light emanated from the box. I tossed the letter, the wind blew it down the street.

'Dear Future Ally:

Greetings from Stryker's Island solitary confinement wing B! A little birdy told me that you have some suspicions about a mild mannered man. You are correct, Clark Kent is not who he seems to be. If you want to know the truth, get close to Superman and open the box. He knows who Mr. Kent really is. Godspeed fellow fighter for Truth, Justice, and The American way!

Best of Luck,

L.L.'
