*They all thought it was a joke. Generation after generation always told me to be serious when they discussed the inane ways they were going to improve their life, make the next year better. Take it from me kiddo, nothin you do is gonna change the big picture. Losing a few pounds of belly fat don't stop the world from turning. Life comes at you fast.*

*Remember what Frankie Blue Eyes said. "You're flyin high in April, shot down in May." Lots of twists and turns on the road, gotta be flexible. Bettering yourself due to some arbitrary social ritual is a recipe for failure, that water needs to come from a deeper well. Society is collapsing because everybody wanted a drink from the well at the same time, thirsty people are greedy people. I'm too old for this shit.*

*Never seen the ocean before, it really is beautiful. The red sun is falling below the waves, the breeze feels good through what little hair I got left on top of my head. As I slowly walk along the shore I keep my eyes out for a good sized one. Something I can get a good grip on. The siren song of the crashing waves sings in my daughter's voice. The first time she ever asked me that stupid question echoed in my ears. She was a cute kid.*

"What's your new resolution thingy Dad?" My daughter Angelica asked.

"Same thing as every year sweetie. I'm gonna stop throwing rocks at whales."

"Where are you gonna find a whale in Nebraska honey?" My wife Marie would always respond with her typical sarcastic retort.

*I never thought Marie would die before me. I've come to terms with that, that was years ago. Really never imagined that I'd have to bury Angelica. No matter what she tried the bottle kept dragging her back down to the bottom. She didn't even get through March. Year's almost over. That's a good one. I put my all into the throw and watch the rock hurtle through the air. I gotta hit one eventually.*
