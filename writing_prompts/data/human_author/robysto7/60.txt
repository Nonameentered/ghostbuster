Morose moonlight peeked through the clouds, softly illuminating the flowers of the greenhouse that sat on the grounds of Star City Minimum Security Correctional Facility. Will O' The Wisp silently strolled its aisles, checking up on her babies. Her glowing blue hair provided a soft nightlight for their delicate petals. Her porcelain skin washed out by the moonlight, almost transparent against the loud orange prison jumpsuit. In two nights the Daturas would bloom under the full moon, anticipation makes time crawl slowly. The delicate aroma was intruded upon by a most familiar scent.

Ash colored eyes peered from a dark corner of the greenhouse. Will O' The Wisp breathed deeply. He always did wear too much cologne when he visited. "If you've come to watch the Datura blossoming you're early. You always were punctual, I like that about you. Stop being a creep and come out of the shadows Nathan."

Nighthawk slunk from the shadows, his cape ominously flowed behind his muscular shoulders. His cowled face stared at the floor, his muscles tensed. "Evening Willow. Sorry for barging in like this." His gravely voice strained, Willow knew that tone.

"Always nice to have a visitor. So what happened this time?" Willow asked softly. She retrieved a bottle of nice red wine she stashed in the greenhouse cabinets. She poured herself a drink first, then Nathan. They sat at the small picnic table in the center of the greenhouse.

Nathan sighed. "It's that fucking girl scout again. Stole another collar from me."

"Which one? There's too many do-gooders around nowadays. No offense." Willow mocked.

"None taken. Scarlet Shadow. I was all set to raid Dr. Dark Matter's underground laboratory. Stop him from opening up a miniature blackhole at the convention center. Once me and Nightdove arrived though the doc was already in handcuffs. Detective Falcona was loading him into a squad car while Scarlet Shadow talked with the reporters." Nighthawk drank carefully, didn't want to burden his butler with cleaning out a red wine stain from his costume, Albert already had to clean the scum's blood from it often enough.

"You can't win em all Nate. Lots of wackos still out there to round up. If I could be out there playing with my friends again I would. Too bad they won't let me out of here, even though I ask very nicely." Willow put her hand on top of Nighthawk's thick leather gauntlet, electricity crackled from her fingertips.

"I feel like I'm becoming a relic of the past. Criminals are more advanced now, more supers pop up each year to fight them. Hard to accept being left in the dust by your superfriends, I'm thinkin about hanging up the cowl, let Nightdove fly solo. She's a good kid, stronger than I ever was." Nighthawk finished his drink.

Willow hadn't seen Nighthawk this despondent since that dark stormy night on the bridge. She leaned over the table to plant a soft kiss on Nighthawk's sneering lips. She held the kiss long enough for the pheromones to seep in. She watched his eyes slowly close.

"Now that's not the kind of talk I expect from the fearsome Nighthawk who sweeps into the dark alleyways of Star City to catch his prey. A name spoken of in hushed tones around clandestine circles. Always watching, always waiting to strike. The wings of justice delivering evil doers into the waiting arms of justice.

A beacon of light that shines from a pit of shadow, a soul struggling to organize an inherently chaotic and cruel world. To right the wrongs, reverse causality, atone for misdeeds and misfortunes. The Nighthawk never sleeps because evil never takes a vacation."

Willow monologued as any good villain should while gathering a special bouquet for her visitor. She pinned a Datura flower to Nighthawk's cape, gave it a splash of color. His eyes fluttered open, slightly glazed over, it was a weak hold against a savaged mind such as his, wouldn't hold for more than a few days. That's all Willow needed.

Nighthawk struck a power pose. "You're right. The city still needs me. Needs to know that I'll never stop hunting them, that justice will be served." A new resolve flowed through his words.

"There's the Nighthawk I know. Nice to have you back sweetie. I have a little secret that's going to perk you right up."

Nighthawk listened intently, his mind merely clay for her to mold. He wouldn't remember any of the details, just his instructions.

"In two days your bouquet will bloom brightly under the full moon. Place them on the bridge where I threw your brother off as a memorial to him. He was a good man, he should have known not to get in my way. They and my other babies will also bloom releasing a concentrated pheromone, the one you're currently under, should take about two hours before the citizens come under my control.

I need a vacation, about a week or so. Want to do some shopping, let my hair down. So I'm going to have some light hearted fun and then you can capture me. I'll see you in a week at Paul's, we can plan out your heroic victory over my heinous villainy over a couple drinks. Maybe go dancing afterwards."

She kissed Nighthawk once more to increase the dosage, that would give her enough time to enjoy herself. Without objection Nighthawk grasped the bouquet and slunk off into the night. Willow crossed another thing off her list. Summer vacation would be one to remember.
