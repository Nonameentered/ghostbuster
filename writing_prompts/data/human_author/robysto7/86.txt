Thunder shook the Earth, lightning crackled through the sky, pelting rain soaked me to the bone. The long prairie grass swirled in the gusting wind. I pressed the barrel of my six-shooter against the monster's head. I cocked the hammer back. He was on his knees quaking.

"Want to beg for your life Zed? Or should I just fire away?" I growled at him.

"I thought you were human. That you wasn't gonna kill no more." Zed was defiant to the end. What else did I expect from the man that had taken everything from me. Stripped away everything I ever held dear.

"I ain't been human for a long time Zed, thanks to you."

Zed licked his lips. "I didn't know I meant that much to you darlin, I was your first right? I know I wasn't your momma's."

I pistol whipped the son of a bitch. Knocked a couple teeth out. His toothless sneer disgusted me. I jammed the barrel of the six shooter into his mouth. "I personally would have gone with something more poetic for my epitaph." The gunshot boomed alongside the thunder.

I kicked Zed's dead body for my own personal satisfaction, stomped his face in with my spurs. He deserved it. I pulled out the list and scratched Zed's name off. Two more to go. I saddled up on my pale horse and rode into the night. Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.
