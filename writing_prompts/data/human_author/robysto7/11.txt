***A Better Tomorrow***

*The road is bumpier than I remember, mundane time flies by fast. I always knew this day would come, just not so soon. Thought I would have more time before that bastard made good on the threat he made on his deathbed. No time to say goodbye, I hope they understand. I'm the last line of defense, the only super left, they trusted me to keep the peace after they took the cure, leaving me alone.*

*Wow this place has seen better days......hope it still has power. I wipe the dust from the retinal scanner, it turns on. The heavy door creaks open for the first time in ages, doesn't open fully. I have to suck my gut in to squeeze past. I duck under the tangled spiderwebs as I descend into my former home. Even in the pitch black I can navigate the steep steps, I hope he wakes up.*

"Wake up A.V.I." I declare.

*Nothing turns on, solar generator should still be working. As I slowly make my way through the darkness the lights turn on, the bank of computer monitors in the command center flicker on. A still blue waveform running across each screen. They start to peak and valley.*

"How good to see you again! Sorry about that, was in sleep mode. Give me a moment to restore power to all systems, this may take a moment." A.V.I.'s soothing digital voice emanated from speakers running along the command center.

"Not necessary. Only need a suit."

"Which suit shall I send down?"

"Zeta."

"Are you sure about that?"

"Just do it." I bark

*The pneumatic tube whooshes above my head, the payload slams down hard in front of me. The door hisses and slides open. I slip on my funeral suit, all black. No mask for this one, no point in hiding it anymore. I don't have a lot of time. I quickly sprint to the command center. I pause a moment to let my gaze linger on my former home. The countless hours of my youth spent here preparing to protect this city. Protect those I cared about.*

*The lonely nights I spent grieving my son, the one person I couldn't protect. My failure as both hero and mother hung like a storm cloud over me. I couldn't remember the last time I saw the sun. The only shoulder to cry on a virtual one. Life's cruel joke continued when Martha passed, what good is saving the world if you're powerless to save the people you're doing it for? I can't fail another generation, those kids have suffered enough, they deserve sunny days.*

*I stop before ascending the steps, taking a deep breath, trying to calm myself down.*

"You can go back to sleep A.V.I., thanks for always being here for me. Good night." I choke out.

"I think I'll stay up a little while longer. Come back so I can hear about your exploits. Be safe, friend."

*No delaying the inevitable. The cobwebs clear as I speed past them, still got it. Smoke rises on the horizon, I fly off towards it. I hope they understand why I have to do this. Time to keep my oath. My promise. To leave this city better than I found it.............for them.*
