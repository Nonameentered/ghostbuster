Freezing rain pelted the glass exterior of Tracy's diner in downtown Star City. Ambulance sirens rang out in the distance, warbling through dark alleyways. Slow night on the streets, the police scanner silent all night. Somnus pulled her hood down as she hustled down the street, needed a warm cup of the best joe in Star City. Place looked empty. Detective Falcona was on her way out, maybe there was something going on tonight. She normally went to Paul's, not this dive.

The eponymous Tracy was already pouring out a large mug of coffee for the nocturnal super. Somnus shook off some rain droplets and took her usual seat at the countertop. Somnus loved Tracy's, looked like a place George Jetson would go, had that retro futuristic feel. 

Tracy leaned on the countertop, the wrinkles on her face multiplying as she smiled. Wispy grey hair dangled at her shoulders. "Sweetie I say this with nothing but love in my heart. You look like shit, you need to get some shuteye. Looks like volcanoes are spewing from your eyeballs."

Somnus took a large sip, it warmed her up, even Tracy's great coffee was starting to have less of an effect. Somnus worried about what would happen if she needed something stronger to stay awake. "Justice isn't always pretty Tracy. Apex predators hunt best at night." Somnus yawned loudly. 

Tracy rolled her hazel eyes and went to brew a new pot of joe. She checked on the other people in the joint. Somnus hadn't noticed, tunnel vision was starting to set in, her eyelids felt like sandbags. Rodney was tucked away in a back booth studying for his finals, young kid was too highstrung for his age. Tony and Linda sat at the far end of the countertop, bickering as always, they never stopped. 

Somnus checked her phone, no notifications, all quiet, no bumps in the night tonight. Maybe Tracy was right, it could even be dangerous to be so tired. Somnus didn't know the true extent of her extraordinary abilities, she was scared to find out. She turned her phone off and got another large cup of joe. As the world sleepily turned a familiar perfume snapped Somnus back from the dreamworld. 

"Hey Sommy!" Pheonix, a local dancer at 'Vav-a-Voom', exclaimed. She hugged Somnus tightly from behind, her fur coat was warm, she vigrously rubbed Somnus's chest to warm up her hands. "Fucking cold outside." She kissed Somnus on the cheek and plopped down on the barstool next to her. Tracy got her a shot of espresso. 

"You're up late. Don't tell me you're just getting off work?" Somnus sleepily asked. 

Pheonix nodded, her platinum blonde hair bobbed around her face, it didn't hide the fact she was wearing more makeup than usual. "I hung around and chatted with the other girls. Slow night tonight, nobody wants to go out and freeze to death, not even for a lapdance."

Somnus ordered her another espresso and one for herself. "But you braved the elements to come here after a slow shift? That's not like you."

"Didn't feel like going straight home. Not really tired, this is the only place open this late." She replied meekly while clutching the collar of her fur coat. 

Somnus lightly rubbed her back, she leaned in to get a closer look at her. "I don't want to pry into your business but I'm asking as your friend. You using again?" She asked quietly.

Pheonix shook her head no.

"Is he?"

Pheonix nodded. "Not as much as he used to, just every now and again."

Somnus licked her thumb and flicked it across Pheonix's cheek. A deep purple bruise hidden under the surface. "Why do you stay?"

Pheonix's eyes watered, her mascara started running. "I don't know, part of me knows I should, another part of me tells me not to. Love makes you do stupid things sometimes."

"I ain't gonna preach to ya. Do what you think is right, I'll have your back either way." Somnus rose from her stool, she stretched out to engulf Pheonix in a friendly embrace. Pheonix cried on her shoulder. "If you need a safe place to crash you have my number, my door's always open, I don't sleep much, stop by anytime." Somnus pulled her hood up and made her way to the door. She turned her phone back on, no new notifications. Time to call it a night. As she turned to wave goodbye her phone vibrated. An address with a short message attached.

'Don't hurt him too bad, maybe just give him a little scare? :) :P'
