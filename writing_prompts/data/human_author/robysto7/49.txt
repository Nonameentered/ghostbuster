'Ave Maria' rang from the stained-glass covered walls of St. Denis church on the outskirts of Star City. Meteor Man had a beautiful tenor singing voice. He was a barrel-chested brick shithouse of a super. Tears dripped from the eye slits of his black half face mask, matched his subdued black suit. He closed the song out with a mighty crescendo that brought even the strongest super or the most depraved schmuck to tears.

Detective Falcona kept watch from the back. Her elegantly braided raven black hair was tucked up under her old patrolman's hat. She'd donned her old dress blues for the occasion. They were ancient, looked like something you would find in a police history museum, still fit like a glove on her. She bit her lip trying to hold back a tear, she didn't know Double M was a songbird in disguise. She scanned the pews, supers sat on the left, schmucks on the right. They all knew the rules, no fightin in church, especially not at a funeral.

Meteor Man turned and said one final goodbye to the guest of honor, Jimmy "The Blowfish" Barino, and began his eulogy.

"Thank you all very much for coming today, it means a lot to me. I know it would mean a lot to Jim as well. I'd like to share a story with you all, I'm sure many of you have heard it, but Jim asked me a long time ago to tell it at his funeral. Still bossing me around from the other side.

Jim used to love betting on the ponies. He loved it so much that once he retired from the Carmona crime family he bought the old racetrack outside of town. All a front for money laundering, or so I thought. Jim caught me snooping around his office after hours. I expected a mighty confrontation, but I was only shown friendship. Jim had gone legit, imagine my shock when he showed me everything was above water.

"The Sport of Kings" he called it. Now I am unfamiliar with this earthling concept of royalty but Jim always had a way of breaking things down for me." Meteor Man cleared his throat and wiped away a tear. He put on his best tough guy accent.

"It makes you feel like a king when you bet on the right pony. Ain't about who's pony is the strongest or the fastest. It's about who controls that kind of power correctly, knows how to jockey for position, when to speed up, when to hold back. You don't always get to race in the best conditions neither, sometimes it's real muddy out there." Meteor Man sighed and returned to his normal speaking voice.

"We went for a race around the track that night. Photo finish. We tied. I never told Jim this but I suspect he was trying to let me win. It sounds like something he would do. Godspeed friend, may you always pick the winning pony at the racetrack on the other side."

Some of the more sensitive schmucks cried, some laughed. Supers shot them dirty looks from across the aisle. Couple more eulogies followed before it was time to load up the casket for the procession to the graveyard. Detective Falcona helped Meteor Man load the casket into the back of the church. Double M flew off to lead the line of cars.

Falcona opened the lid of the casket, she retrieved a syringe from her breast pocket and jabbed Jimmy in the neck with it. His eyes fluttered open, he yawned loudly, his elbows popped as he stretched.

"The big idiot buy it?" He asked.

"Hook, line, and sinker." Detective Falcona slyly smiled. She lit up a couple smokes for the two.

"Never thought I would have to say goodbye to this city. Did you get it on tape?" Jimmy asked.

"Sure did. I'll email it to ya. It's been nice workin with ya Blowfish." Falcona helped Jimmy out of the casket. They replaced his body with some sandbags, didn't want to arouse any suspicion from the pallbearers. Jimmy had been one of Falcona's many confidential informants over her lengthy career. Jimmy never went legit, that's why the feds were about to come down on him. Falcona made him a deal, kill two birds with one stone.

"Alright I held up my end of the bargain kid. Remember, you're a ghost now, I don't ever want to see you in my city again. Stay in your lane from now on. You hold up your end of the bargain?" She asked.

Jimmy tossed a ring of keys to her. "Boxes 108, 114, 432, 567. Second bank of Star City. I'm gonna miss you Falco, stay good alright?" Jimmy winked.

"Tell Carol and the kids I said hello. I got to get going, can't be late to put you six under feet under." Falcona waved goodbye. She was the hearse driver. She jotted down the safety deposit box numbers quickly, bank was open tomorrow. Only a few more supers and schmucks to go before Falcona's contingency database was complete.
