*Why are the hot ones always crazy? I knew I shouldn't have matched with her on Mage Mingle. Should have known having nine black cats was a red flag. But damn that pointed hat and black dress look good, bonus points for her knowing her way around a broom shaft. The pictures on her profile must have been a little old, possibly shopped, but I was in a slump. Maybe she only believes in one stupid conspiracy theory, I'll hear her out.*

"Astrological towers don't just implode like that. And what about the alchemist's a block away? That wasn't hit by a dragon at all yet it collapsed perfectly in on itself, explain that."

*Her smile was pretty, most witches' teeth were crooked, looks like she'd had some dental work done. What is she rambling about?*

I snapped back to reality. "A bunch of dragon scales crashed through the alchemist's and destroyed multiple laboratories. Pretty potent stuff, enough to take down a building that size."

"But why the alchemist's? Why the astrologers? How come they didn't attack the castle?"

"Enlighten me."

"Follow the coin. Who benefits from this? I'll tell you who, the shapeshifters, they pull the strings in this kingdom."

*Now there's shapeshifters!? I gotta get out of this.*

"I'm gonna think about that while I go to the bathroom. Excuse me."

*Oh great now she's ordering another round of ale. I locked myself in the bathroom stall and retrieved my crystal ball. Pick up, pick up.*

"Yo! Sup bro? I thought you were on a date?" My buddy Grabliel the night elf would know what to do. He had a few centuries of being a bachelor under his belt.

"She's a conspiracy nut! I can't keep talking with her, it's asinine." I declared.

"She hot?" Grabthar inquired.

"Yeah."

"Think if you put up with her bullshit you could seal the deal?"

"Maybe." *I don't like where this is going.*

"Seal the deal then ghost her, that's how dating goes nowadays. Make sure to wrap it up if you do."

"Yeah, yeah I know the spell of protection. Thanks buddy."

*I returned to the table, there was a fresh stein of ale for me. The date continued. Despite our opposing views on what she claimed was a vast and intricate conspiracy we both enjoyed the magical arts. I steered the conversation in that direction, it was the best decision I ever made.*

"And that children, is how I met your mother."
