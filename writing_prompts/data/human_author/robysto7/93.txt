*Knock, knock! The pounding of the door beats in rhythm with the pounding of my head. I'm itchy. Why can't I move my arm? Handcuffs? I'm in that dingy basement again. Was it a full moon last night? My head gets foggy the closer the moon gets to being full, it's hard to keep track of time.*

"You awake?" Coach's raspy voice filled the room.

Coach shuffled into the room wearing his worn out grey tracksuit, his thinning black hair slicked back, the wrinkles on his faced multiplied when he smiled. He unlocked the handcuffs. I scratched my face first, then all over.

*Every part of my body itches when I turn back, feels like I'm still covered in coarse fur. My nails are still a bit sharp, I drew some blood from the scratching. I got out of bed and stretched, every muscle in my body was tense. Coach tossed me a gatorade. Needed to replenish my electrolytes.*

"Did I fight last night?" I asked.

Coach pulled a huge wad of bills from his pocket. "You dominated last night kid! You tore through Frankenstein's monster like it was tissue paper! I ain't ever seen you so bloodlusted before! It was beautiful. We keep training hard and one day soon you'll be champion, take down that jackass Dracula."

*Coach wasn't exaggerating. He showed me the tape, I was a monster in the coliseum. Didn't know I had that in me, the baneful wolf blood in my veins was getting stronger, able to take more control and abolish any inhibition or mercy. The crowd roared as I slaughtered the grotesque creature Dr. Frankenstein created, devouring it's necrotic flesh. I gave a good howl at the end of the fight.*

Coach tossed another huge wad of bills at me. "There's your cut. You interested in a fight next month. Little tune up before we try and challenge Drac?"

"Who's it against?"

"Some guy named Alucard, an untested fighter. Heard a rumor he fights like Dracula, would be good practice. Big payday."

"Sounds good to me."

"Get dressed so we can go grab some breakfast, gonna need to bulk up for this next fight."

*Life never stops on the way to the top of the Monster Mash Association.*
