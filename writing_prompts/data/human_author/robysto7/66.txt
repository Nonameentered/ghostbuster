*Okay this is weird but I think I get it. I can see and hear them, they can't see and hear me. Pretty cool to be honest, a living breathing slice of history. Like walking through an oil painting. A raucous crowd of puritans jeering at a homely young woman who stood defiant amongst them.*

"I swear by the grace of the Lord that I partake in no such craft! The Lord's love guides me, not the temptations of heresy!" She spoke with anger, her eyes pleaded with the courtroom.

"Objection! The court shall not entertain words that ooze from lying lips! Eyewitness accounts prove that she dances with Baphomet himself around hell's fire in the forest. She will damn us all unless we purge her sinful flesh from the Lord's graceful Earth." Preached the holy man.

*Damn this woman is screwed. She doesn't even have a lawyer. I'd read that they were religious people but wow, they're intense. I got the gist. Let's see what happens when I spin this thing counter-clockwise. I look over and there's Annie. Back in the library.*

"Shit. It's random." Maybe I should actually hit the books instead of finding a shortcut. "You want to try it?" I asked her.

"They can't see me right? I look a hot mess." Annie's hello kitty pajamas would confuse people of the past.

"Invisible, like a ghost."

"Sure why not, I hope I don't go back to what I have to study. I need a break."

"What are you studying?"

"Cambodia under Pol Pot's rule."
