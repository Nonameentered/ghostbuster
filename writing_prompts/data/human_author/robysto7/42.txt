Graven giggles echoed ethereally against the glass walls of Will O' The Wisp's underground botanical laboratory. An unusual response, most supers yelled in pain when Willow zapped their flesh with a mere graze of her slender porcelain fingers. Maybe she didn't know as much about her captive as she thought. Detective Falcona was a hard nut to crack. She hadn't cracked yet while being electroshocked in the makeshift electric chair.

"Ha, ha, ha. You know, ha, ha, ha. That ha, fucking hurts. Can you uh? Ha, ha, ha. Turn down the voltage please?" Falcona couldn't stifle the giggles escaping her lungs.

She was in no position to laugh. Willow had gotten the drop on her while she was squeezing one of her goons for information about a new strain of lust pheromones Willow was developing. Hard to handcuff a schmuck that can turn into a cloud of electrons. Falcona preferred Willow's humanoid form, a petite pale skinned beauty with neon blue flowing locks.

"Sorry Falco. You know I can get a little too eager sometimes." Willow's soft voice was muffled by the collar of Falcona's trench coat which she was currently trying on, she looked good in it, sometimes the mystery of what is underneath is more tantalizing to the mind. Willow gently ran her finger down Falcona's face, stopping it above her heart, static shocks danced from her fingertip.

"That's a cute bra. Where'd you get that?" Willow asked.

"A...a.....amazon. On sale. Ha, ha." Every nerve ending of Falcona's skin vibrated with laughter. The static causing her thick raven hair to float in the air, before long she'd share be sharing hairstyles with Marge Simpson.

"Ewww, you bra shop online? Caveat emptor. You never know if it'll fit or not." Willow groaned.

"I'm a busy gal Willow. Ain't got too much time to go to the mall."

"I'd go with you, shopping spree with the gals! I'll invite Belinda the butcheress. Both of you need to update your wardrobes. I mean this coat you wear went out of fashion sixty years ago. Gotta get with the times girlfriend." Willow twirled around her captive, the coat flowing around her. She plopped down in Falcona's lap gently. She gently squeezed Falcona's soft cheeks with her left hand while her right applied a shade of pale blue lipstick to her lips. Willow cradled the detective's face and kissed her deeply, letting her lips linger letting the pheromone take hold. Sparks flew from the smooch.

Willow licked her lips seductively. "Wow you have soft lips. Still taste like an ashtray though."

Falcona's eyes slowly fell closed, her head drooped.

"So cute when you sleep. You should be under my thumb now, so I'm going to ask you some questions detective." Willow bummed a smoke from the pack in Falcona's coat. "Where's the hard drive that contains your contingency plans for the supers?"

*ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz............*

Sonorous snoring seeped from Falcona's nostrils.

"Oops. Might have given her too much." A few light shocks to the armpits morphed snores into belly laughs. "I never knew you were so ticklish girl!" Willow took advantage of this newfound knowledge to have some fun. Her ivory fingers gracefully played along Falcona's body. Tears streamed down the detective's face.

"Stop it! Ha, ha, ha! Stop it please! HaHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! Come on this isn't fair! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!"

Willow stopped. Falcona gasped for air, her heart and lungs pounding, blood crashing and careening in her veins. "If you prick us do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? Why do you think I always wear suits with a long coat and gloves? Happy now?" Falcona gasped out.

"Not yet. Always figured you had a weird weakness, since you don't have any real powers. I'm not concerned about that though, I know that you know what the supers are weak to, what they're afraid of. Heard you were keeping a list, like Santa Claus. So where are you keeping the list?"

"Give me a smoke and I'll tell ya." Falcona sniffled, snot dripped from her nose from laughing too hard. Willow lit a smoke for her, an experienced smoker can smoke without use of their hands. She took a long drag. "Connor Chaos has it."

Willow gave Falcona a good jolt when she tightly squeezed her thigh. "Chaos is dead, you killed him."

Falcona sneaked a peck on Willow's cheek. "That's what I want you schmucks to think. I keep Connor around in a deep dark pit for reasons you wouldn't understand. He's got the other half."

"Other half of what?"

"Everything's a double edged sword kiddo. I know how to take down the supers if necessary, he knows how to take down the schmucks. We balance the scales so good looking broads like yourself can play super villainess and the hunks can play superhero. Put on a show for the people, keep em distracted. Just like I'm doing to you right now."

"What?" Before Willow could utter another word a swarm of bird shaped drones surrounded her. Concentrated coolant sprayed Willow head to toe, freezing her in place.

"Took you long enough. The beacon in my coat should have gone off an hour ago." Falcona yelled into the darkness.

Nighthawk and his partner Nightdove emerged from the shadows. Hawk made sure Willow was frozen as an icicle while Nightdove freed Falcona. She gave the young super a hug.

"Sorry we're late detective, there was more security at the docks than anticipated. We secured the pheromones and tossed a bunch of goons in the slammer, like you asked."

"Good work kid." Falcona shivered. Nightdove rubbed her gloved hands on Falcona's back, another eruption of giggles. "Stop it Dove! Ha, ha, ha. I'm fine. Let's thaw her out so I can get my coat back, don't want to be standing here in my underwear."

Nighthawk wolf whistled at Falcona. "I think you look good for your age Falco. I wouldn't say no."

"Well I would never say yes. Hurry up, I'm freezing more than she is."

The drones switched over to uv lamps to slowly thaw the villainess out. Grogginess is a side effect of the rapid freezing and thawing process, Willow didn't put up a fight while Falcona retrieved her coat. She let Willow rest in the chair this time, have the drones close by in case she tried anything. Falcona only needed a few minutes. She snapped her fingers five times off rhythm.

"You two go stand close to her while I make a call." Falcona barked. She grabbed her phone and dialed. After a couple rings it picked up.

"This better be important, it's late." Horus groaned over the phone, he didn't like being rudely awoken.

"It is. The blue haired bitch dosed me with something, it's not too strong but I could use a quick flush. Already let something slip I shouldn't have."

Horus popped up on the screen waving a golden pocketwatch. "Keep your eye on the birdy." He said slowly.

Falcona's eyes locked onto the watch, her mind went fuzzy for a moment. A snap of Horus's fingers brought her back. "Thanks. One last thing. Need a protocol four, let's say.......six hours. Make em forget I was here."

"Who are we working with?" Horus asked.

"In addition to the blue haired bitch I got Birdboy and Birdgirl here. They don't know nothing but Birdboy saw me in my underwear, don't want to give him spank bank material."

"Sounds like a fun party, sorry I missed it." Horus chuckled.

Falcona held the phone up towards the captive audience. Horus worked his magic to wipe Falcona from their memories of the past six hours, her secret safe again. She'd let them figure how to take it from here, they'd be out of the trance in five minutes. Falcona needed a cup of coffee, needed to stay hydrated after releasing a torrent of tickled tears.
