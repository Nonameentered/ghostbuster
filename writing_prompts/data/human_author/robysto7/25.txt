***Should I Stay or Should I Go?***

"I don't want to go..." Detective Falcona repeated herself once more, raising her voice so the speakerphone could pick it up. She lit a smoke and laid back on the couch.

"Please? It would mean a lot to me." Her sister pleaded over the phone.

"I don't want to go..."

"It would mean a lot to him."

"I don't want to go..."

"It would mean the most to *her.*"

Falcona rubbed her forehead while shutting her eyes tightly.

"I don't want to go..." She groaned, slowly giving in.

"Stubborn as always. If you can squeeze it into your *busy social schedule* it's tomorrow night, in the gymnasium, seating at six thirty, show at seven. Love ya sis." The call ended.

"I don't want to go..." Falcona mumbled.

Falcona scooped up her niece, she gave her a peck on the cheek. "I came extra early so I could get a front row seat. Break a leg out there kiddo, remember to say your lines loud enough so the people in the back can hear you. I don't want to go..."
