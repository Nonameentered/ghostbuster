***Can You Repeat That?***

*It's too cold today to be trudging through the snow on the street, damn uber driver missed it by a mile no matter how many I times I politely asked her to stop. Typical. Where is this place? I've only heard about it, sounds expensive. Here we are, 'Paul's Piano Bar'. Why am I doing this? I know why. First non spam text in years inviting me out. Probably walking into a catfish scheme, no way she would talk to me. Maybe I'm actually in trouble now, cops probably lied to me. Would be nice to have a conversation with a person instead of my cat, the only thing that pays attention to me.*

*Heat's on full blast, feels great on my face. Text said to talk to the bartender, have them direct me to her. Good thing the bar's mostly empty, service should be quick. I politely wave and smile at the good looking bartender. I like her red hair, she must work out, those slacks look painted on, same with her tux shirt. She's looking at me. Nothing, she turned around. Typical. I wave harder while still making it look polite. Come on. Come on. Typical. I loudly clear my throat. That got her attention.*

"Welcome sir! What are we drinkin on this chilly day?" She asked.

"Water please."

*She thinks I don't see it but I can. People roll their eyes at me a lot. Takes her a long time to come back, I think she forgot about me. Gives me time to look around the place, nicer than I expected. Like stepping back in time to a lounge in the roaring twenties. Alright here she comes.*

"Welcome sir! What are we drinkin on this chilly day?" She asked again.

*Typical.*

"May I please have a glass of water, and I know this is going to sound weird but I'm supposed to be meeting someone I've never met here, they said you would point me in their direction." *I always forget to not make simple statements, people tend to tune me out.*

*She hands me my water and points to a booth in the back. Don't know how I didn't see her, she stands out. Like she crawled out of a film noir. Looks better in real life than she does on tv when she busts those schmucks. She doesn't see me as I walk over, despite waving. She's absorbed in her phone.*

"I thought I was early. Hi I'm John, you wanted to see me?"

*Nothing, her eyes still glued to her phone.*

"I've seen you on tv, I'm a big fan."

*Still nothin. I loudly clear my throat, that seems to work in most situations. She just about jumps out of the booth. Her eyes lock with mine, beautiful, intense blue eyes.*

"Holy shit don't sneak up on me like that!" She rasps out.

*I stifle a laugh, never gets old startling people, happens all the time.*

"Sit down." She orders.

"Like I said big fan, I thought I wasn't in trouble anymore."

*She props her cellphone against her pork pie hat on the table. The viral security footage was playing on it.*

"Did you do this for real? Or is this some sort of elaborate youtube prank?" She asked.

*So much for the world's greatest detective, not even she believes it. Maybe I am invisible.*

"That's me. Like I told the cops, nobody stopped me, they even let me in to the vault when I asked to look around. Guess they forgot I was in there so I figured why not? Poor judgement on my part, I'm sorry. Won't happen again."

*She watches the video again, lights a smoke and takes a drink. She checks her watch, nice gold antique pocket watch. I think she forgot I'm here. Typical. I snap my fingers quietly, that snaps her back.*

"Oh sorry kiddo, kinda spaced out there. What's your name pal?" She asks.

"John Doeth."

*Her eyes go blank.*

"Can you repeat that?"

*Typical.*

"John Doeth."

"How do you pay the bills John? What do you do for a living?"

*She takes a big swig of her drink, her brow is furrowed, looks like she's really trying to concentrate, atypical.*

"Nothing really."

"Unemployed? Needed some quick cash?"

"Not at all. Couple years ago I stopped going into the office, nobody noticed. Checks kept getting deposited to my bank account, actually got a promotion and raise a few months back. No idea how that happened."

"Can you repeat that please?"

*I go over it again.*

"How would you like to do something meaningful with your time, with your gift?"

*Didn't know loneliness was a gift.*

"Like what?" I ask.

"Could you repeat that please?"

"Like what?"

"My line of work revolves around information. Intimate knowledge of things that go on behind the curtain so to speak. If I go poking my nose behind the curtain it's gonna get chopped off, they recognize me, know me and my crew. My gut is tellin me that as soon as you get up I am going to forget everything about you. How you look, what you sound like, hell probably what we even talked about.

I could use someone like that. Hide in plain sight. Be a fly on the wall. Nothin dangerous, easy work. Just observe and listen, tell a joke every now and again. The pay is good, hours are flexible, get to work with some interesting folks I'll tell ya that. Completely up to you though, not gonna twist your arm."

*Doesn't sound half bad actually. Things are kinda boring, maybe if I did something risky I could get out of this rut. Maybe I'll meet some cool people, make some friends. No risk, no reward. Fuck it, let's do it. We shake on it. She gets my number.*

"When I find a spot for you, I'll call you. Don't call me. What was your name again?"

*Typical*

"John Doeth."

"I'm never gonna remember that. Oh! I know! I'm gonna put you in my contacts as Plainzo. Much better. Nice talkin to ya Plainzo."

*Not gonna protest the nickname, she probably won't remember me. I hope she does though, anybody will do at this point. I wave goodbye. She doesn't wave back. After making my way a couple steps away she clears her throat. I turn around.*

"You're late kid. Take a seat. Got something important to talk to you about."

*Well that was fast, probably a record. We go through the same song and dance, I make sure she records it this time. Typical.*
