***The Secret Sauce \[Pt.1\]***

Belinda's butcher shop and delicatessen was one of the hidden gems of Star City's cuisine scene, all it took was one bite of Belinda's cooking to get hooked. Normally the line stretched out the door and around the block, the torrential rainfall pouring from the sky caused a slow day today. Only a few tables were occupied in the dining room that flanked the deli counter, the open kitchen and butchering room provided a macabre ambience to the joint.

Detective Falcona shook the rain droplets from her large black umbrella and tossed it in the can at the front door. She and her lunch date Victoria shook off the cold and waited in line behind two well dressed businessmen.

"You ever been here before?" Falcona asked.

"Not since I had that crazy idea to go vegetarian, that was a mistake." Victoria replied.

"No idea how you went two years without eating meat. Animals are delicious. Life's too short to deny oneself such earthly delights."

Victoria playfully smacked Falcona's arm. "Why do think I chose here to rejoin the carnivores?" She roared.

"Cause you got good taste Vic."

Took the businessmen forever to order, Belinda's menu was a bit too large for most people to take in quickly, Belinda was not a patient woman, she looked peeved as the two ladies stepped up to the counter to order. That changed when she laid eyes on the detective. Belinda's plump lips curled into a smile on her round face. Belinda is a big gal, could barely tie her leather apron around her waist, her wispy blonde hair tucked into a hairnet.

"Howdy Falco! The usual?" Belinda's southern drawl was out of place in Star City.

"You know it. Hot pastrami on Rye with everything, don't skimp on the spicy mustard this time."

"And for your delectable looking friend?" Belinda intensely eyed Victoria from head to toe, Victoria was in good shape, hit the gym four times a week, couple that with walking miles behind the bar at Paul's during her shifts she was quite a looker. Having long fire red hair only made her stand out more.

"Philly. Extra peppers and onions please." Vic replied cheerily.

"Coming right up. I'll bring it over to you two, grab a seat." Belinda went about preparing their order.

Belinda's place operated under the pretense that good food takes time, it was very unusual for it to arrive in under fifteen minutes. Falco and Vic received their food in eight, Belinda dropped it off without a word, something was wrong. Plating was awful, if sandwiches had emotions these would be some sad sandwiches.

Falcona cautiously took a bite, chewing slowly. Terrible. She watched Vic choke down a bite of her cheesesteak, it almost came back up. "Did my taste buds change or is this just bad?" Vic choked out.

"It's missing the secret ingredient." Falcona replied flatly.

"The what?"

"Shocking as this may be but not even I, the city's greatest detective know what it is but Belinda swears by a secret ingredient that she puts into everything. My theory is that it's MSG."

Vic started to stand up. "I'm gonna take these back, see if we can get new ones."

Falcona grasped Vic's hand tightly. "That's not a good idea."

"Falcy it'll be fine, I work in the service industry I can handle this. I'm not gonna go all Karen on her." Vic pulled her hand from Falcona's grasp. Falcona stood up.

"Don't take this the wrong way please. Complaining to Double B is not a good idea no matter how good you think you are at smoothing things over, she requires a more deft hand to deal with. If you're not careful around her, she'll chop that deft hand off with her cleaver, trust me. I'll be right back, hopefully with new sandwiches." Falcona gently pushed Victoria back down in her seat. She scanned the dining room, only the two businessmen were left. They were distracted in conversation.

Falcona locked the front door and flipped over the 'Be back in ten minutes' sign. Next stop, the counter. "Double B may I speak with you in private please?" She asked.

Belinda sighed. "I didn't do anything illegal."

"Not about that, can we talk in the slaughterhouse? I know there's no cameras or mics in there." Without waiting for a response Falcona went behind the counter, Belinda led her into the glass encased slaughterhouse. Cows in varying states of dismemberment hung from heavy cold hooks, Falcona hopped up on a metal prep table, sent a chill across her cheeks, she lit a smoke to warm up. Belinda pulled over a stool and bummed one.
