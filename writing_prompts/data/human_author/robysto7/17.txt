Falcona yawned, she knew that got on Connor's nerves. He continued anyways. "Once that signal activates it triggers a sub-atomic rearrangement of the human body, creating a heavy radioactive reactor, then the reactor melts down. In essence a walking nuclear weapon. Imagine the horror of billions of nukes going off all at once. It would be........Chaos."

Falcona shot back her drink, even if it was a bluff she didn't have the chips to call it. "You ain't gonna live forever Conman, pretty shitty dead man's trigger." She scoffed.

"False. After analyzing the data I acquired when I..................*experimented* on you and your sister, I concluded you were a success, your sis went a little haywire, sorry about that."

Visions of a dimly lit hospital room flashed in Falcona's mind, the sound of her sister sobbing flooded her ears. She pushed the thoughts from her mind. "I ain't got no powers, you failed on me."

Connor's menacing laugh echoed off the glass liquor bottles. "Haven't figured it out yet? When was the last time you got the flu?"

"Can't remember." Falcona couldn't remember getting any sort of illness in the past decade.

"I strengthened your white blood cells, made them super efficient, also tinkered with your telomeres. Repeated the procedure on myself. Natural death is no longer a concern to us. Once you write your magnum opus, you stop writing. Anything else would be a let down. That's why I live the pirate life now in solitude, watching from the sidelines forever. I needed a companion, I could think of no lovelier companion than you dear." Connor blew a kiss to Falcona. She put her gun to her head.

"So I'm gonna survive this?" She cocked the hammer back.

"I wouldn't do that if I were you." Connor said coldly.

"Why not? Sounds better than spending an eternity with you." Falcona was bluffing again, she had a hunch Connor had a contingency plan for this too.

"Because I tied our hearts together for all eternity. You have a dead man's switch in you too. You'll kill us all. You'd be history's greatest monster.......too bad there won't be anyone left to write the history books. Your choice detective, I know you'll make the right one." Connor raised his glass, Falcona put her gun down and raised her glass as well. Connor breathed a sigh of relief. "Cease fire? I know you hate me for a multitude of reasons but this is in everyone's best interests. I'm retired, I want to keep watching from the sidelines, you can meddle all you want, just stay out of my lane. Stay safe dear, wouldn't want anything bad to happen to you, you're still fragile like a normal person."

Falcona rubbed her hand over her face and slowly leaned over the bar. She planted a deep kiss on Connor's lips.

"Well that was certainly unexpec........" Connor's body froze up, his head hit the deck hard as he fell. Falcona wiped her lips on her sleeve and took a drink. Lit up another smoke to get the taste out of her mouth, her stomach turned. She looked down at Connor as she hopped onto the bar top. He was stiff as a board, his eyes wide open, fear danced in his irises.

"Quit bitchin, you're fine. Think of it as a waking coma, your organs still work, your muscles not so much. Still flesh and blood Conman. Thanks for indulging my curiosity, always did wonder what you did to me. You didn't think I came in here without an ace up my sleeve right? Don't answer that. Might hurt yourself. Should last about three days, by that time I'll have you settled in your new digs." Falcona hopped down behind the bar and searched Connor's pockets. She took the gigantic ring of keys for the boat off him along with a strange small glass box containing a swirling blue and white marble. She'd ask him about it on the voyage.

Falcona left Connor lying on the deck as she explored the yacht. It was nice, little too opulent for her tastes. Luckily for her the yacht was mostly automated. She plotted a course for back home. She hoped the boat was fast enough to outrun the storm on choppy waters. With the truth in hand Falcona sailed into the abyss of the night.
