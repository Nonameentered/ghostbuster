***The Best Laid Plans***

Star City memorial hospital wing D was constantly undergoing renovation, or so it seemed to the public, in actuality wing D treated only a certain percentage of the population. The supers, and the schmucks. Generous private donations kept prying eyes away from it, kept it secret, kept it secure. The warm and welcoming waiting room the site of Doctor Neutron's greatest victory. Years of manipulation, treachery, and subversion would finally come to fruition. He paced back and forth, his mind racing. Endless possibilities raced inside his synapses. He chewed on the end of his cigar in nervous anticipation, deep in thought, that was soon broken.

"Can you stop pacing like that Doc? It's startin to annoy me." Demanded Neutron's sister-in-law, Detective Falcona, who coincidentally served as his most trusted confidant. Her blue eyes peered over her phone as she relaxed in one of the large easy chairs of the waiting room. Her eyes matched the powder blue scrubs the two wore to blend in at the hospital. "Why are you even in here? Shouldn't you be in there?" She asked gruffly.

"You know I'm not that kind of doctor. My doctorates are in chemistry, physics, anthropology, astronomy, and home economics. Besides have you ever seen something give birth? There's a lot of...................goo." Neutron replied disgustedly.

"So that's the scientific term for it, was wonderin about that." Falcona mocked.

Neutron plopped down on the armrest of Falcona's chair, he put his hand on her shoulder. "Nerves. For as much as I've prepared for this day, having it arrive still caught me off guard."

"Even the devious Dr. Neutron gets nervous, I'm learning a lot, this is a great day for science. Calm the fuck down doc. This is supposed to be one of those days you always remember, like your wedding day, your favorite Christmas, or the first time you got some."

"What if I fail? Wouldn't want to carry that memory around." Neutron sighed, a small puff of cigar smoke escaping his thin lips.

"I'm already on record sayin you ain't gonna win no 'Dad of the year' trophies. Good thing you have the woman who is gonna be the world's greatest mom on your team, should balance out." Falcona lit a smoke to join in the festivities.

"That's what I'm worried about......."

Before the doc could finish his thought the door of the waiting room slid open, a young nurse popped his head in. Good lookin kid, strong jawline, deep brown eyes, nose a bit too big for his face, it's only flaw. He waved Neutron over.

"Here we go. Come on." Neutron rose from the armrest, extending his hand to Falcona to help her up, she didn't move.

"Dad sits above Aunt on the pecking order. Go welcome your daughter to the world. Congrats." Flacona smiled.

Neutron took a deep breath, this was it. The culmination of his efforts. Playing both sides, convincing the supers and the schmucks he was one of them, gathering intel on their enemies, preparing to strike. Secretly marrying the world's most powerful super, not because of love although that did blossom, but for power. His wife Fuzion perfectly countered him, a perfect foil, an unmovable obstacle in his path. Once the mice become smart enough to avoid the trap, you have to build a better one. Neutron did.

His footsteps rang in his ear as he strolled down the hallway to the room Fuzion was moved to after labor. The pale orange setting sun peeked through the curtains, complimenting Fuzion's orange hair and skin tone. She smiled weakly, her eyes drooped tiredly. The new bundle of joy held tightly in her arms. Neutron kissed his wife gently on the forehead, tasted of salty sweat, she gave him a peck on the cheek. "Hi honey, got someone here I think you'd like to meet." She said meekly, labor was difficult with Fuzion's biology.

Neutron gently took the child from her arms. His herald. An amazing feeling swept over him, a wave of realization. He was holding god in his arms. Nothing would stand in his way now, all would kneel, or they would die. Just had to keep playing his cards right, learn to harness and control her powers, meanwhile work on getting the pesky detective out of the picture, she couldn't be turned.

"Hello Sarah, I'm your dad. Welcome to the world, what a glorious world it's going to be." Neutron stifled the urge to release a maniacal laugh. The newborn's eyes fluttered open, smoky hazel irises surrounded flickering green nuclear flames.

"She has your eyes." Fuzion whispered.

"But she has your fire behind them." Neutron replied in amazement, she was perfect.

Soft crying broke the silence. Neutron rocked the newborn gently, softly bobbing as he walked towards the window. Tiny hands reached out from the swaddle, grasping Neutron's index finger. Another wave swept across the doctor, realization, but of another kind.

"What am I doing?" He whispered aloud.

"Did you say something?" Fuzion yawned out.

"Get some rest sweetheart, I'll still be here when you wake up. We can talk about it then. I want to remember this."

Dr. Neutron kissed his newborn daughter on the forehead. He gazed out the window, streetlights below turned on in sequence, the stars beginning to pierce the dusk sky. Tears welled in Neutron's eyes, he was misguided. His path to power still laid ahead of him, maybe it could be built with a helping hand, not a balled fist.
