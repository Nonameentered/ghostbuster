***Morphin' Time***

*Of course Morph Machine has a new transformation! Wonder how long this one is going to take? I, the Magnificent Magnetron, have no time for such foolishness. The only reason I indulge this idiot is because I like seeing the look on his face when I rip his new power armor apart piece by piece. Why would a man in a metal power suit take on a person who controls magnetism?  Doesn't even use non ferrous metals, such a buffoon. Is it stupidity or masochism? Possibly both......*

*Oh seems he's added some new lights to the transformation process, red and green, how festive! That armor looks sturdy, I love the shingling of it, looks almost medieval. Classic look for battle. Bit of a postmodern twist with the jet boots but it gets the point across. Oh now the lights are blinking, that's gaudy as hell. Gonna close my eyes. This really is taking a long time for all those pieces to snap into place I bet if he used.........*

*Maybe he's stalling for time? That sounds feasible. Make me sit through this dreck while the cavalry is on the way. I hope that is it. Maybe Nightdove will show up, wonder how she's looking nowadays, she would be a worthy foil. Not this second rate tin man. I should be getting into superior super scrums than this.*

*The big leagues, the big show, my name in lights! Battling the likes of Frozen Shadow, Meteor Man, hell why not go right to the top and take on Fuzion herself? How has a noble villain such as myself been relegated to the back pages of the book? Is he done yet?*

*My schemes and plots are good. I can rip a bank vault from its foundation without ever going inside! I can rip the iron out of red blood cells, carve a bloody path of carbon based corpses. I can even cause heart attacks for a more subdued approach. This city, nay this world, should be cowering in fear at my feet! Yet I sit at the table meant for children, fighting with their castaways, their garbage, their lessers. Insulting really. Still not done transforming yet....*

*It's that damned Detective. Only one that knows my weakness and would never hesitate to use it. Why am I so afraid of her? Playing her games does allow me to indulge my voracious, voluptuous villainy. Once I figure out a way to get her out of the picture I'll be able to truly show what I'm made of. Okay, take a deep breath. I'm going to open my eyes and see a fully transformed Morph Machine ready to engage in fisticuffs most grand. One......two.......oh son of a bitch it's still happening!*

*Nuts to this, just gonna chuck him across the city. Get a good grip on the suit and..........there we go! Outta the park homerun! Score one for the bad guy. What was I doing here? Was I going to steal something? Completely forgot why I came here........I need a bite to eat, Tracy's is still open this late. Change back into my alter ego and grab a late dinner. Wait a minute.............wait a second.............is that why? No..........that's preposterous...........inane.............but maybe............*
