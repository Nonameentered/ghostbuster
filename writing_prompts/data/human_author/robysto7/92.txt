The soft light of dawn kissed the dew covered hills of the countryside. A quaint isolated cottage the only sign of life for miles. Professor Gnudsen was enjoying his morning coffee. He made a mental note to mop the black and white chequered floor after his work was done for the day. 

Another long day in the small laboratory refining the process for Gnudsen's most potent venom to date. He shook the vial of pale yellow liquid, it was more viscous than he wanted. Perfection was still a long ways off. It would have to do for today, he had enough test subjects to last him a few more weeks.

Old wooden steps creaked with each step as he descended into the storm shelter. The flashlight swept over the cages that lined the walls of the dark, dank shelter. A young girl began whimpering from a cage in the back, one of the professor's grad students. Nothing but skin and bones now, her formerly thick and luscious brown hair was falling out in chunks. 

Her dilated pupils merely dots of ink on a pale hazel canvass. A terrified scream filled the air. "STAY AWAY FROM ME!" Her voice was hoarse. She cowered in fear at the back of her waste covered cell. She couldn't overpower a child, much less a grown man. 

The needle went in easily, the pale venom seeped into her veins. Complete shutdown of bodily processes took eighteen seconds. A new record. Subject A-17 was cremated in the fireplace of the shelter to provide heat for the other subjects after taking relevant tissue samples.
