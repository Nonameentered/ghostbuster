I rubbed the sleep from eyes and pinched myself so hard it drew blood. Familiar eyes peered from under my king sized bed, four smoky eyes swirled in a spiral of menace. Caused me to piss my pajama pants. I scrambled to the far side of the bed away from the monstrosity.

"It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's only a manifestation of your anxiety. Just breathe." I tried to stop panicking. The four armed hairy beast smiled with a mouthful of rusted razor teeth.

"Sorry for barging in like this kid, I like what you did with your hair, you've finally grown into your body." The monstrosity from beyond embraced me tightly with two arms, the other two gave me a noogie. "Like I was asking, you still have that NES?"

Maybe I need to up my meds. It's not real, just go along with it, it can't hurt you. "No I gave that thing away years ago."

A mighty roar bellowed through my darkened bedroom. Rage that could rip the fabric of reality.

"I've got an emulator on my computer."

"Sweet! I've finally figured out the tech for it! We can finally do it!" Menacing eyes sparkled with newfound hope.

"Do what?" I asked.

"I can solo level three of Battletoads for us now! I finally taught my left hand how to do it. We can finally see what's past that level."

"Bullshit. Not even you can do that!" I don't care how terrifying this thing is I'm still gonna call it out.

I had forgotten how bullshit two player Battletoads is. You have to be perfectly in sync with the other player, it's a brutal ballet. The jet bike level is the car crash ending to it for most players. I handed it my controller and leaned back in my chair. Almost fell out of it when the monster pulled off a perfect run, looked like a TAS with its precision and timing. It roared in triumph and gave me a high ten.

"LET'S GOOOOOOOOO!!!!! LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!!" Hype filled the room, felt like old times.

Be careful with hype. The larger it is, the harder it falls. The game only gets harder and more unfair after that. Riding giant mechanical snakes in a room full of insta death spikes. One of the levels is actually impossible for two players to complete due to a glitch, thanks google. Have to replace my controllers after the monster smashed them into splinters. It stomped back to my bedroom and slowly slid under the bed.

"Sorry to disappoint ya kid, we'll beat it one day. I'm gonna keep practicing. See ya in a few decades. Be good. Don't let the bedbugs bite." With a flash of red light it was gone. I made some coffee while I tossed my urine soaked sheets into the wash. I miss couch co-op, even when it was a little janky.
