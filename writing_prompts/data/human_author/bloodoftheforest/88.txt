Mother died today. Or maybe, yesterday: I can't be sure. All I know is that I spoke to her last week and she was alive and now I can see her outside my window with the others.

I considered going to her, of course I did. She was a short walk away and she lived all on her own. But really, was I any less vulnerable? Younger, sure, fitter, yeah. But in the end I am fit in a "has been known to take CrossFit" kinda way not in a "could singlehandedly fight off 23 zombies" kinda way. I worked on my body in order to look cute on my upcoming holiday to Algeria but it turns out I put all my effort into the wrong things. I feel so fucking stupid now.

Ironically enough, getting 'beach body ready' as they call it might mean I die faster than if I'd kept last year's holiday fat. I don't have unlimited food here. And just like I can't fight through zombies to reach my mother, I can't fight through zombies to go grocery shopping either.

I tried to calculate how long I could realistically live at one point. Weighed myself, wrote down the calories on everything I own and tried to do the math to figure out how long it would take me to die. How I'd need to ration all of the food to keep me breathing the longest. I'm not sure I got the numbers right but it doesn't matter so much, I ignored them all in the end.

I know that I don't have enough food to last forever but I eat what I want, when I want. I know I need to conserve energy if I don't want to accelerate my demise but I turn my music up so loud it almost hurts and I dance until I can barely breathe. I know nobody can see me but I put on perfect makeup almost every other day. The world's in turmoil but here I am, trying to look presentable and struggling through a book for a book club I know will never happen. It seems almost petty but somehow now these little rituals are more important to me than ever. When anything can happen, everything matters.

I'm not going to lie and say I haven't contemplated giving up, even before today. When you know death is so very imminently inevitable the actual timing can seem a bit pointless. I don't really believe I'll be rescued. I'm not important, I'm not so vital that anyone with the firepower to do so would fight their way to get to me. But I'm *alive* goddamnit, and that's something. So all this time I've stayed alive despite the pain. Live to the point of tears.

Today though, seeing someone I actually know through the window, it feels different. It doesn't hurt the way it probably should, just a dull ache that of course this happened. What did I even expect? I swear sometimes she looks up at me. I know, somehow, that one day I will simply go outside and join them all. Perhaps I've gone mad. Perhaps this is the penance I must pay for not being brave enough to at least try to reach her and being torn limb from limb will be my absolution.

I sit watching from my window until night falls and I see nothing at all. Today is not the day I go outside. It feels perverse in a way; to force a body so destined for death to go through the banalities of being alive. My body is hungry and tired and my mind is half broken and I know that some day soon I will join the figures outside my window. But now I must sleep.
