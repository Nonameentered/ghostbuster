Not for the first time I had chosen to lose my adventuring party. At it's heart, the problem was friendship. After the first few months of adventuring I had finally managed to create basic speech. It didn't sound entirely right but even some regular adventurers had worse. But faces were harder. Much harder.

There was a quest on the noticeboard. No matter the village, there always was.

Nobody else in the square was wearing armour but nobody gave much thought to a full suit of armour striding noisily across. I reached for the board to examine the quest and...

...and then it was gone. Clasped in the hand of a scarred woman in leather armour. She turned away and I grabbed her shoulder.

The pause dragged a little, to be honest. But summoning speech is tricky at the best of time and I didn't really know what to say.

*"I REQUIRE THAT NOTICE"* I said with effort.

She laughed in my almost-face.

"Seriously? No way, I saw it first. Anyway, judging by your fancy armour I need this far more than you."

I was able to see the notice. The reward was high but what truly caught my eyes was the task itself.

*"THAT'S.... THAT'S FOR A DRAGON. YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT QUEST. LEAVE IT WITH ME."*

The woman shrugged out of my grip and began to stride away.

"No way! I saw it first, friend!"

She had seen the notice first. But I knew then that there was no way she'd seen a dragon before. The last time I'd seen one it had been with a whole party and not all of them made it back.

I could have left it. But instead, I followed her.

The tavern was noisy but the corner she'd sat in was quiet. I had intended to watch her from a distance but she had instantly gestured me over to meet her. The irony of not being able to be secretive didn't escape me but there hadn't been a convenient moment to transform.

"I know who you are." She said quietly. "I didn't at first but I've figured it out. I know you've seen a lot of action, dragons included. And I know you usually travel with a competent party. But I can't allow you and your party to poach this."

*"THERE IS NO PARTY."*

"Oh." The woman said and gulped her ale thoughtfully.

The silence lasted a little too long. Her hand brushed the hand of my 'armour' as she put her flagon back on the table and she apologised. She rubbed her hand on the coarse fabric of her shirt.

"The table... the table is kinda... sticky..." she murmured then added "But you know, if you don't have a party right now *I* could be your party. I guess that'd be okay."

*"I DO NOT WANT A PARTY AT THIS TIME."*

"Why?"

*"I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU."*

She sighed.

"Well, I don't want to give you this reward and I know that you haven't seen all the details you need or you wouldn't have followed me. And you know I'd be willing to split it or you'd have given up on this conversation and left or murdered me in an alley, whatever, I don't know your alignment."

She finished her ale.

"So tell me. Or don't, and leave. But I swear - those are your only two options here. Tell me why you don't want a party and I'll tell you if it even applies to me. Or go away because I swear if your the alley murdering type I will not go quietly."

I had ale in front of me that I hadn't touched. The mystery woman reached over and helped herself to it without asking.

*"FRIENDS WANT TO KNOW WHO I AM. FRIENDS AND LOVERS ALIKE WANT TO SEE MY FACE. I ONLY DID THIS FOR ADVENTURE. I DON'T WANT TO REVEAL MYSELF ANY MORE THAN IS COMFORTABLE. IT SEEMS TOO AWKWARD AND HUMAN TO BEAR."*

Mystery woman nodded.

"Okay, yeah. Cool. So.." she shifted in her seat slightly "I already know you're a mimic. It's fine. I don't care. You're just kinda... sticky. And so there's way too many leaves stuck to your boots and that doesn't happen
usually and that's fine, I don't care! Just, you know. Constructive criticism?

"So, the friends thing. Yeah, I get it. I've done the adventure as a party thing too and noped out at the first 'let's share our backstories' bullshit so I have no intention to dive into that. As for the lover thing - ew, gross no. And that's not because you're a mimic, it's just that that whole thing sounds not awesome. So I have no intention on trying to see what's going on under there. Even though, as I said, I already know."

She finished my ale. Of all the things that I know about her apparently "can drink fast" is on the list.

"So, I'm Thea. Are we a party yet?"

I thought of what she said. I couldn't really find a fault with it.

*"YEAH."* I said.

I didn't smile but only because I can't.

*"I GUESS WE ARE."*
