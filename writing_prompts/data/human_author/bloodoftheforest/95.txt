The elves continued to walk in, musician after musician dressed in finely crafted armour that Duke Antimony had financed for them. The elven commander watched them all file in calmly whilst the Duke simmered at the insult. That the elves would take his money was bad enough, that the lack of archers would cost him the battle was far worse. Relations between humans and elves had never been good but if the orcish army was to be victorious here then there would be nothing stopping them from attacking the elves homeland next. These were all points that Antimony believed that the elven commander understood and agreed with but with this bizarre insult they were both surely doomed.

There wasn't even time to argue. The elves had walked away without explanation and Antimony had to prepare his men. He had been promised ranged weapon specialists from the elves so none of his own men had been assigned the role of archers. As quickly as possible, Antimony tried to rectify that. It was when he was leading this hastily formed archery division to suitable locations on the fort that Antimony saw it.

The first thing Antimony saw was the orcish army, approaching quickly and in a number that he had expected but still filled him with dread, but the second thing Antimony saw was the elves themselves. They had left the comparative safety of the fort and were stood outside, instruments in hand. One of the elves was holding nothing at all and Antimony realised with confusion and wonder that she was positioned as though to act as a conductor.

Antimony could hear the orcs now and they had fired some shots at the elves even though they were not yet within striking distance. The conductor nodded to herself and then sang a beautiful, clear note. In less than a moment every instrument had matched it and then, as the conductors hands moved in deft patterns, the elves began to play.

Every instrument that the elves carried was recognisable to Antimony but he had heard this song without seeing them he would have been unable to name a single one. The music itself was beautiful but it haunted Antimony and everyone who stood by him. Memories of the orca devastation so far came to his mind unbidden and he felt more pain than he thought he could stand.

The orcs, it seems, couldn't stand it at all. For the first time they had to feel the pain they had caused completely and the unfamiliar guilt was just too much for them. They cried in rage and pain at first but as the music reached a crescendo each one of them found a way to no longer be living.

The music stopped and Antimony was surprised to find himself sunk down on his knees with fresh tears coating his face. He would have been ashamed if not for the fact that every soldier he could see was in a similar state to him. The elves, for reasons known only to themselves, did not try to renter the thought. And by the time Antimony had collected himself enough to try to thank them they were long gone.
