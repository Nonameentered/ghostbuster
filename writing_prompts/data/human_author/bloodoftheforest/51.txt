I'll never truly know the taste of death but I've lived long enough to be familiar with it by proxy. I know that some deaths hurt more than others. And as my wife lay there, wincing from some familiar ache, I knew that this death was particularly painful.

Cassie shifted her weight as though to sit up, something she was in no condition to be doing. I hurried to her side and as Cassie gently brushed her hand against my cheek she spoke her dying words:

"Tag. You're it."

----

When I first met Cassie, I was supposed to kill her. A murder has taken place in our village and the bastard who'd perpetrated it saw the village outcast as an easy scapegoat. He whipped almost the whole village up with tales of witchcraft and I was tasked with her arrest.

I was to hold Cassie in my house overnight whilst her hanging was scheduled. She sat perfectly still with her eyes closed until I spoke to her.

"Why do they call you a witch, Cassie?" I asked.

She opened her eyes and I had never seen fury like it. She didn't even look scared, just filled with a quiet rage.

"Because I know things."

Cassie snapped her eyelids back shut and part of me wanted to let it go. Path of least resistance.

"What things do you know, then?"

Her eyes didn't open for this question but she did a strange twisting motion with her fingers which made me question if she really was a witch.

"I know that Sarah was killed by her husband, Jacob. I know he is the one that framed me."

"How do you know that?" I asked.

"Because I listen." Cassie replied and at first I thought that was all I was getting but then she continued. "I know because when people have needs that they are ashamed of, I am the one that they turn to for help. Herbs to make bruises lessen, to numb pain, to calm a soul that is under constant attack."

She was strange but we talked for the entire night. I found I enjoyed her company more than any I had previously met. I wondered if she was charming me in the magical sense but I only wondered it idly. If Cassie's words could make me find her agreeable, was that any darker than Jacob's ability to turn her into a scapegoat?

"I think you're right, actually. But I don't understand how someone could do that to his wife." I said and she scoffed.

"It's just a word. *Wife.* I could be your wife right now, it wouldn't suddenly make you like me more."

"We'd need a priest." I laughed but in response she tore the hemming off the bottom of her skirt.

"There are other ways of becoming wed." Cassie said as she snaked the material around our hands and muttered something in a language I didn't know. "There. Married. Does this make you like me more?"

"No, but I think I liked you plenty without you having to go and tear your skirt."

There was a pause and she looked at the door thoughtfully. *This is where she asks for her freedom*, I thought, knowing I would grant it to her.

"There is a bottle of mead in my house sealed with red wax. Give it to Jacob. Drink none of it. They will not suspect you."

I considered this.

"I will do. But I want you to run."

----

My wife was shot as she fled and died her first death that day. My heart thought it would break over a woman I had only just met and when Jacob drank the poisoned mead I offered him I almost wanted to take a sip myself.

It wasn't until two years later I learned that I could've drank the whole bottle without consequence.

----

"Excusez-moi, mais Ãªtes-vous anglais?" The parfumier asked me.

I'd been in France for a couple of hundred years at that point and nobody I was currently associated with has knowledge that I'd ever been English. If anything, it was the parfumier's accent which sounded off. It had a strange falseness to it which I only understood after looking more closely at the bearer.

*"Cassie?"* 

"John? It's really you?" She laughed, no longer bothering to deepen her voice.

She closed her shop immediately and I took my somewhat-wife out for food. I filled her in on what I'd done in the years after her death, including killing Jacob. She told me of the literal lifetimes I had missed - each beginning somewhere new and starting afresh after death. As we'd so instantly been faced with the impossibility of either one of us still existing, talking of further impossibilities was easy. I told her that I couldn't be killed just as casually as I told her my favourite type of sandwich.

We had a nice life there. Cassie explained that parfumier's had to be male to have an ounce of respectability and so rather than have her continue to pretend we simply moved the shop elsewhere and I became the face of it all. We married more formally this time around and lived in relative comfort until the day that Cassie tripped and landed all wrong.

-----

"Boo."

England again, and I grabbed Cassie in the street only to be cracked across the face with a handbag.

"I'm so sorry! I didn't know it was you!"

I cradled my face in my hands.

"No, I guess I shouldn't have snuck up. But - ow!"

Cassie's eyes flicked to check nobody was watching before she pulled me into an embrace.

"Just be glad I didn't use my hairpin."

----

America, briefly, and she sighed when she saw me.

"I thought for sure I'd find you first this time."

But she was sick even when I found her and our time was limited. We married hastily and I asked her what death was like.

"It's just like breathing out, darling." Cassie told me and I had no way to know if she was lying.

----

And that brings us to this cycle, this life. These last few grains of sand running through her hourglass, that I can only hope is one of many.

For a witch that led me to murder, she is the best thing that has ever happened to me. So I can only hope that she'll continue to happen to me.

Again and again.
