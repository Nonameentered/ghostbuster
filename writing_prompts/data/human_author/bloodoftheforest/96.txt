When the sun stopped wailing it *hurt.* Almost all of humanity heard the sudden absence and felt like they could be driven mad by the loss. As it was a sound like no other, nobody quite had the same term for it. Some called it a wailing, some a droning, some even described it as a singing. Nobody had ever thought of it as particularly upsetting because nobody had particularly thought of it at all. Even now we don't fully understand what that noise was - whether it had been the Sun's normal breathing or a prolonged, almost unending death rattle.

Really our folly had been thinking that we understood anything at all.

We thought we understood stars too, you see. We thought that we could understand every stage of them in terms of advanced physics straight form their births to their deaths. And it's not even that we were entirely wrong but there is something more to it than that. I hate to use the term soul but time is running short so there you have it, stars have souls. Moreover, the thing that we used to think of as a star's death isn't really it's death at all. Left to its own devices a dead star looks no different to a living one.

The things we used to think of as a dying and then dead star was the corpse of a star being scavenged.

The *beings* or whatever term you want to use for them took out a chunk of Neptune first. Not Pluto, simply because of the orientation of the orbits. We couldn't even detect these things that ruined a planet at first but we could detect the damage to Neptune itself and soon astronomers around the globe were working together to figure out what had happened. These beings are not visible but we can detect them, just about, and we can definitely detect the damage they do.

Once it became clear that these things were headed for the sun someone had the bright idea of seeing if there was similar data around the deaths of any other stars and then overnight physics went from thinking that the lifespan of a star was based on solid, scientific rules to knowing for certain it depended how quickly gigantic, invisible scavengers could reach it. As the beings got closer our scientists could almost trace them. Closer still and they realised that these scavengers would tear through Earth before even made it to the Sun.

When it was announced the entire world went mad. People looted and suicides shot up whilst the sick were left to die unattended in hospital beds. I wouldn't have announced anything if it had been me but I suppose that too many people knew to keep it secret. 

We know it's soon. If not tonight, then sometime this week. One thing that we have been told is that it will be quick. Outside of a laboratory nobody will be able to notice the approach of the scavengers and the devastation will be so quick that it's unlikely that we'll notice anything wrong until we're all already gone.

Sometimes I can hear noises from the chaos of people with nothing left to live for but the other noise, the one I long for, isn't coming back. Still, I have run out of fear and sadness now and instead find myself fascinated by music, trying to listen to as many songs as possible now that the sun is not there to offer it's own unique notes. This is the only plan I have left.

So each night I sit on my garage roof as I drink whiskey, stare at the sky and listen to every song that has meaning to me. 

And each day I wander around outside and I sing, unaccompanied by the Sun.
