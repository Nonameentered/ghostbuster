The path through the woods is so twisted and winding that it doubles back at some points and at others you could cut out five minutes of walking if you were willing to race just a few hundred yards straight ahead.

Nobody would, though. Don't be foolish.

I have been walking for half an hour when a see a pair of cherries on the path but not touching it. They appear to have fallen perfectly so that their stems are held up gently by ferns. I duck down to examine the berries and find them almost perfect and I reach my hand to touch it when-

*Don't pick up their gifts.*

-one of the warnings I've heard all my life rings clearly in my head. Are these fruit really a gift though? There are certainly cherry trees in these woods and though I can't see any right now that doesn't mean that there are none close enough for this to be a natural occurrence.

I eat the berries and continue on my way.

In our village, adults tell children what to do in the woods before they are old enough to venture out there. Before they're even old enough to walk, in some cases. If you take Their gifts, listen to the whispers in the forest, insult Them or leave the trail for *any* reason then you could be taken. Some children who are taken are replaced by false, corrupted versions. Some are merely removed, never to be seen again.

They never replace the adults. As a teenager teetering between childhood and adulthood I wonder whether their rules would allow them to send a replica back in my stead. I wonder if they would even want to.

The whispers started up a few minutes later. I can't remember if they alarmed me the first time but I've been on this trail many times before today. The whispers are not things that we should listen to but despite that, or perhaps more likely *because* of that, they are beautifully melodic. I've heard riddles, insults and compliments over the years - each one in a compellingly sweet tone.

I've walked these paths so  many times that by all rights I shouldn't have tripped. But whether due to Them or my own poor coordination I fall hard and slide down the slope to the left of the track. No matter how you look at it, I'm definitely off the path now.

I hear giggling all around, though I can't see a single source. 

"Oh yeah! You think you're funny! You really think you're clever?! Your tricks are stupid and you're stupid and you just-"

The trees creak and I feel the pressure in the air change. The light shifts and I hear a cracking noise behind me.

I spin round and I see Her. Beautiful, horrific and altogether inhuman. I sob as I fall to her feet.

"I didn't mean it..." I whisper. "I didn't mean it. It was just the last rule that I had not broken."

I haven't been honest with you, I suppose. Not entirely. I told you of the rules that adults tell children in these parts and I let you believe that I was told these myself, rather than only ever hearing them from parents who were actually concerned about their kids. I told you how I ate the berries and left off just how much I hoped they were a gift. That I tripped was perfectly true but the additional truth that I had fully intended to purposefully leave the path at a later point would have shifted the tone somewhat.

"Why did you come?" She asked me.

Whilst parents told their children the rules of the woods what mother who truly cared about their child's safety would not only fail to catch them but actively *allow* their child to walk this way, time and time again?

"My mother told me that you take people and send them back all wrong. That a good, pure child have been taken from her and I was sent back instead."

There was a pause and I could hear creaking as She breathed.

"That is not the truth of the matter."

"I know that. I know it. I have no memories of the woods before the age of eight and she'd already started telling this story by then. So I know it's just a story and that I didn't come from here. But this is still where I want to be."

I'd stopped crying, perhaps because there was no longer any point. I'd made my case and she would either choose to accept me or she wouldn't.

"This choice cannot be undone and our ways are not like the ones you've known. We are not what you might consider kind."

I shrugged.

"Neither were they."

All children learn the rules of the Woods but so too do all adults. They take alarming truths and flavour them with suspicion and fear. They use stories of the forest to hide truths from inside the village in a place that no neighbour will dare to scrutinise too carefully.

It is true that the beings in the forest will steal those who break their simple rules. 

But it is also true that sometimes, every so often, there are those of us who want to be stolen.
