My name is Ellia and I am the last of my tribe. I have harnessed mystical secrets that will be passed on to no other. I have trained with mystics, fought with dragons and right now I have an entire army chasing me as I go in search for the one artefact that could truly change the course of this war.

The only slight niggle is that said artefact does not exist and I know it.

It's true that I'm the last of my tribe and that some secrets were passed onto me but almost all of those were simply spells and charms which make me faster. It's this background which made me an ideal candidate though - 'last of her kind' sounds very much like the kind of person who'd unseat a demon lord and 'really, *really* fast' is the exact kind of person that demons would find tricky to catch.

Trained with mystics is true as well, actually. They were very nice people. Frustrated at my lack of talents but still pretty pleasant to be around. I spent a decade with them, long enough that if I'd had any sort of magical aptitude they could have made me a very decent warrior. But that wasn't the point of me and so combat magic was barely touched upon, much to our mutual relief. I came out of that training with a bit of somewhat shaky divination magic and some truly convincing illusion spells. Perhaps equally importantly it allowed anyone looking into me to check "trained in magics" off my growing chosen one resum√©.

The dragons though, that's where this whole thing starts to dissolve into bullshit. I have *met* dragons, though less that the tales of me tell. However I can no more slay a dragon than I can detach my head and use it as a cannonball. Which, just in case bards across the land have gotten really quite silly with their songs, I also cannot do. Most of the 'slaying beasts' stuff is just made up by what I guess you could class as my propaganda department but some of the dragon related stories have an even odder origin. 

Dragons are much smarter than humans and so even though they don't agree with us on almost anything they knew that if we were wiped out then they would be next. So they helped us, so secretly that almost nobody knows of it. Dragons who were soon to die anyway would take poison and come to public places to 'fight' me until eventually dying at my feet. If the chosen one, the real chosen one, can't end the demon lord then they will join us in the last battle. But until that time, they have decided they are most useful pretending to be entirely apart from us, staging mock fights with me and scouting out operations for our advisors.

To have me chasing an artefact was frankly a stroke of genius. It meant that I could draw the army away from populated areas and send them through routes too bottlenecked for them to be fully useful. It also gave me, chosen one and unstoppable mage, a reason to be running *away* from the fight instead of towards it. I was trying to quickly find my way to an artefact, that's the only reason I am speeding away from these highly trained killers. The advisors had planted the idea that there was an artefact only the chosen one could access for years now through every channel they could think of. Bards sung of it, mages 'found' scrolls telling of it in ancient ruins, even one of the demon lords own seers predicted it (a double agent is a wonderful thing). Eventually it took on a life of its own and nobody really needed to stoke that particular fire. All whilst I was off gallivanting around and building my own reputation.

I don't know who the actual chosen one is. That kind of information is above my pay grade so to speak. All I know is that for whatever reason she isn't ready yet and I am going to do my damnedest to make sure nobody finds her before she is.

So that's why I'm here, freezing my ass off on a sacred mountain whilst being chased by an army of demons who want nothing more than to make me die. And I suppose that one day one of them will get that wish. But not for a while, I don't think. After all, I'm very fast.
