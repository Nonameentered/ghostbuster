The flight attendant stared at me blankly for a second before standing and yelling once more.

"Are there any doctors on this plane?"

Next to me the businesswoman in bright compression socks tried to shuffle away as subtly as possible. The man in front of us was behind a curtain but I didn't need to see him in order to know that he wasn't dead. Not yet.

The flight attendant came over to me.

"We, um, there aren't any doctors on this flight. What did you say you do?"

I started to untangle myself from under my blanket.

"I'm a necromancer."

"What is a necromancer?"

Before I could answer a teenager from across the aisle leant towards him.

"It's not real! It's a made up fantasy thing that raises the dead and I have no idea why someone would joke at a time like this. You need to find someone else."

I stood up and walked towards the loud girl. Unlike myself, she had not chosen to eat any of the chopped carrots that had formed part of this flight's meal. I didn't exactly blame her but it did give me an opportunity.

"Hey!" She squealed as I deftly scooped the orange mess into my hands.

I muttered the appropriate words in a low, repetitive chant. Ideally i worked with subject that were a little less mutilated but plants are generally easier to work with so it wasn't the hardest thing I'd done.

When the chopped and slightly mushy vegetables had formed a complete plant I held it out for both the teenager and the flight attendant to see.

"Necromancers are real. They're just secret. Maybe don't tell anyone about this."

The flight attendant grabbed onto one of the chair backs with white knuckles and looked away from the plant. The teenager couldn't stop staring.

"I can't help him until he's dead though." I clarified.

The flight attendant ran off to quickly vomit into the toilet.

"I know first aid. Will that help?" The teenager asked quietly.

I thought about it.

"I don't know. Depends what state this guy's in aside from the dying thing." I paused then added, "Do they teach you people skills as a first aider? He might be a little alarmed and it's not something I excel at."

"I don't know. I helped out a kids sports team for a while though - I had to calm people down there."

"Close enough then." I decided and we headed towards the curtain.

I placed the carrot plant gently on my tray table as I passed it, much the alarm of the woman who'd been seated next to me.

On the other side of the curtain was the flight attendant who had been asking for a doctor and a second flight attendant who had presumably been back here watching the patient. They were talking in hushed and panicked voices that I couldn't make out whilst occasionally looking over at me.

The patient or the not-dead-yet guy or whatever you want to call him was almost motionless on the floor, though sometimes he would suddenly jerk or moan. He'd been in the recovery position when we'd gotten here and my new accomplice diligently put him pack every time his jerking shifted him out of place.

"Can you help him?" She asked, looking far more alarmed now that she was kneeling right next to a dying man.

The answer wasn't that simple. I could bring him back, definitely. But if whatever killed him was a chronic issue then he'd probably die again once I was done. Maybe not right away, but eventually. Some things heal with rebirth but humans are more complicated than carrots and I can't fix everything.

I chose not to include that in my answer.

"Not yet." I said. "We have to wait."

*It won't be long.*

The five minutes before he died were awkward at best. He stopped moving after one and then shortly after, he was gone.

*Time for a reset.*

I chanted more forcefully this time and clamped my hands on either side of the des man's forehead. 

"In the names of the gods of the dead, in the names of the rolling shadows, I command you to rise up and honour my will!" I yelled and at least one of the flight attendants just ran.

I could feel my life force burning within me, far more than any one human should have. I felt it cascade out of my into the man on the floor and as I chanted relentlessly my mind silently begged this to work.

A flicker. Just a flicker. A tiny difference in voltages between two cells. Then a small clump of cells agreeing to interact. A twitch in his hands as nerves flared into life and then finally, a heartbeat.

The man groaned and rolled over to his side. When I took my eyes off him I realised that we no longer had either flight attendant but that the teenager was still nearby.

"What was that about this guy "doing your will"?" She asked.

"Oh. That. Yeah, that's an integral part but it's easy fixed." I looked back at the man and whispered, "I command you to live your life exactly as you would have done if you were not under my command."

I grinned at the girl.

The no-longer-dead man coughed and brought himself up to sitting.

"What happened? What's going on here?" He asked with alarm.

"Well," I said, "you got on a plane and we've been flying for a while now so I think we're probably nearly in Chicago-"

"I've got this." The teenager said forcefully and I was only too happy to let her take over.

As I walked away I heard her talking to the man in tones more gentle than I would have credited her with.

"You've had a bit of an issue and you weren't very well. But we've fixed you up and you should see a doctor when you land.."

I sat back in my chair and started to fill in a sudoku. It had been an interesting flight.
