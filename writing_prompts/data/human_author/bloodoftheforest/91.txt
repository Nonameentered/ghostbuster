"I see you are wearing a beautiful jacket!" Susan said. "In fact, it is so beautiful that I would like to buy it from you! Is it for sale?"

She turned to me with alarmingly wide eyes and her arms were making odd, exaggerated motions.

"I'm not wearing a jacket." I replied.

Everyone in the room sighed, with Susan even offering a disgruntled "hmph!" for added emphasis. Emma gave me a small, tight lipped smile.

"Look, we've been over this," she told me, "when anyone you're in a scene with makes a suggestion - and that's *any* suggestion, even if it makes no sense - then the response is 'yes, and...' Okay?"

"This just isn't exactly what I wanted to learn when I signed up. I was hoping that you'd be teaching more useful skills."

Emma gave me a withering look.

"Well, by all means - let me know what I could do to make this a useful class to you. Never mind what the syllabus that you read actually says, how about you just tell me why you specifically signed up for the class and we'll work around that?"

Despite my lack of improvisational theatre know how I could recognise sarcasm when I heard it. I understood that those statements were meant to make me shut up and let another group act out their scenes. But as Emma is a bitch and couldn't really object to me doing exactly what she asked I decided to tell her everything.

"I wanted to learn death scenes." I began, and continued quickly before Emma could speak. "I saw a theatre course and I thought it'd be a great place to learn death scenes. To be honest I've managed to fake a lot of deaths over the years without having to be even halfway good at acting but in the olden days it was easy."

"You've had to fake your own death before?" Susan interjected, even though I'm damned sure I didn't really pause.

"Yes, the fact of it is that I'm immortal. So the first couple of times I faked my death it was just by accident. Someone saw me take a fatal would in a battle and I just took it as an opportunity to move on. After a little while I realised that the heroes I trained not only didn't mind that their mentor had died - they performed better for it. It seemed to spur something within them. So I started to make a habit out of it."

"What do you mean by train heroes?" Jeff asked from the back of the room. "Like, sword and shield kinda heroes?"

Jeff is perhaps the only person in the class who is worse at acting than me. I was somewhat surprised to hear him speak up and from the looks of some other faces I was not the only one.

"Yes, at least to start with. The kinda heroes of myths and legends. I had all of the time in the world to perfect my combat skills and I was more than happy to pass those on to others. Then as time went on the heroes got less traditional. Spies who were willing to do anything for a greater good. Protestors who needed to fight just to know how to avoid getting killed. Vigilantes who needed to hunt evil. It was a vigilante who was the first one who I had to act for, as it turns out. We were hunting Jack the Ripper..."

"Jack the Ripper!" Susan scoffs and looks to Emma to shut this down but for whatever reason she's choosing not to.

"Yes, the police had had no luck but they hadn't questioned the right people. A prostitute named Rosy was on his trail after being unable to get the police to believe her and I'd joined up with her to polish her hopeless fighting technique and stop her getting herself killed. When we caught up to him the fight left both me and him with fatal wounds. I told her "go" but she said she refused to let another one of Jack's victims die alone. Even when I pointed out that they'd pin the murders on her she insisted she'd stay but the more talking I did the more she realised I wasn't dying. Then we did hear police and I sprinted away, pulling her with me. We didn't get caught and I never made contact with her again."

There were other stories but I trailed off awkwardly. I'd never told anyone that story before and the irony that I was telling it in a class I took to be a better liar was not lost on me. Suddenly and confusingly Emma began to applaud.

"Excellent! You see, in that little story you used 'yes, and' perfectly! Now, if only you could bring that sort of inspired creativity to your actual scenes then you'd be sorted."

"Thanks.." I said and then slid weakly into my seat whilst the next pair stood up to act out their improvisational scenes.

Later that night I wondered if I should quit the class altogether. Maybe even if I could learn to die more convincing deaths that class wasn't the place to get those skills. I rummaged in my bag to find my phone and instead found a reason I had to see at least the next class through. A piece of paper had been slipped into my bag and on it was a short note.

'I believe you. Call me.
-Jeff"
