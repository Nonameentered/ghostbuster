This wasn't the first heated argument I'd come across between Kate and Emmet. As soon as Kate introduced the phrase "useless tosser" I started inching towards the door and by the time Emmet had suggested to Kate that "I have absolutely no idea how you got into this school" I was only one foot away but unfortunately this was exactly when they noticed me and Kate said the most dreaded phrase.

"Come on, settle this."

*So, so close!*

"I don't even really know..." I said and then added, "I guess I think they're both good?"

"Right, but if you had to choose just one?" Emmet pressed.

I sighed and thought about it. I just wanted this argument to be over.

"Staff, I guess."

"Why?" Kate asked as Emmet grinned smugly.

"Um, it's bigger?"

Kate laughed forcefully.

"Typical bloody man. A wand can be taken anywhere. A staff needs one hand free just to carry it whereas my wand lives in it's wrist holster easily and conveniently."

She whipped out her wand to show me with practiced ease.

"Could you do that with a staff? Emmet isn't even holding his staff *in an argument about it's superiority,* doesn't that tell you something?"

Kate was jabbing her wand at me almost threateningly as she made this point so I gingerly took it out of her hand and placed it beside me.

"Sure, wand then. Yeah, you've convinced me. Wand."

Emmet shook his head at me patronisingly.

"A wand? Really? You're telling me that if Edgar the Broken stormed the academy you'd grab a *wand* to defend yourself? A stick that can barely amplify your magical energies up to twice the strength they are naturally at? A staff had the power of *thirteen* wands, you know. Thirteen! But sure, I bet your little wand would scare Edgar right off."

"Stop it!" Kate exclaimed. "He's already decided. The question wasn't 'which would defeat Edgar' anyway, it was a question of which one is better. And if Edgar did storm the academy then most people have their wands on their person, whereas staffs rarely leave the dormitory due to being cumbersome, clunky-"

"Oh yeah? Funny how 'he's already decided' didn't apply when he was on *my* side. You worried that an actual logical argument might persuade him as easily as your pathetic little wrist strap thingy? Or were you going to try and convince him some other way?"

"What the hell is that supposed to mean? It's not my fault he only agreed with you because-"

"SHUT UP!" I yelled.

The room was suddenly, blissfully silent. I don't yell. Not usually.

"You're both *so annoying.* And I was trying to blend in, collect information and keep my head down."

A frown flickered on Kate's face at my odd phrasing but Emmet hadn't caught it yet.

"I don't know what I'd use in a fight against Edgar but if I was sent as a spy to wait in the academy for further orders then I bet I'd know what tool he would insist I brought with me. So go on, aren't you going to ask me? Wand or staff?"

Kate looked at her wand on the table next to me and knew she couldn't reach it in time. Emmet had finally caught on, the dense bastard.

"Ask me." I insisted.

"Which-" Emmet began at the same time that Kate lunged forward.

Two shots rang out across the common room.

"Gun." I answered.
