If FTL travel was difficult, perhaps the inventor would have been able to simply never tell a soul. There are countless weapons of war that have never made it out of the labs that created them and were destroyed so they never will - histocompability nanotech was unknown to almost the entire world at one point and whilst the Soft Blue virus is well known to have been created, the team involved destroyed all data and then themselves in the name of a fairer world. The world is better off without some things.

The problem was that FTL *wasn't* difficult, not really. The component parts of the technology we now think of as FTL were in the public domain for years before some bright spark realised how they could combine and like the invention of the telephone centuries ago, two people claimed to be the inventor at roughly the same time. The problem was the fuel - quintessence. The stuff primitive societies used to call 'souls' or 'life force' or 'spirit' but that science had pinpointed long ago. One 'soul' for one journey of any number of people, beings or goods to any location you could care to think of.

Of course, nobody thought that was a fair trade to start with. This was all still far before my time but to begin with the average person was up in arms at the concept that somebody would be murdered just so a few boxes got what they were going a bit faster. But then the thought experiments played out. What if terraforming missions were allowed a unit so if there was a catastrophic malfunction then it would only be a death sentence for one crew member instead of all of them? What if ambulance ships were given one so if several people would die if they didn't get to a hospital within seconds then only one life needed to be taken?

Across my lifetime, FTL in these situations was no longer remarkable. If you don't want to donate your quintessence in the event of a near-fatal emergency then the situation is entirely opt out and the selfishness means you can kiss certain other privileges goodbye. My great-aunt wouldn't be here today without FTL and in my work I spend a lot of time campaigning for violent criminals and healthy volunteers to be applicable as fuel instead of just those who will likely die anyway. As it stands, if a single person suffers trauma or illness so intense that it needs to be treated at a hospital within minutes then unless a second near-dead person is hanging around to serve as fuel then the poor individual is needlessly condemned to death. Opening up who is eligible to be fuel would save so many lives.

Today made this hit harder than most. Our cruise ship hit an unexpected asteroid and gas from the coolant tanks flooded floor thirty two, a fast acting poison that will take the lives of all who breathed it in unless they are transported to an on-planet treatment facility. 

Floor thirty two was the VR suite and it wasn't the floor I'd been on when the collision had occurred. But my son Ethan had.

I raced down to the floor, grabbing an emergency oxygen mask and arriving to see the ship's medics setting up the FTL device. There were sixteen people on the ground, would that be enough.

"Miss, we're going to need you to leave the room. One of these kids is going to be chosen and then everything in this space is headed to the nearest relevant hospital."

"Don't take him." I pleaded, gesturing to my unconscious son.

The medic at least had the humanity to look uncomfortable.

"You know the rules. The person with the least promising prognosis is chosen or in situations such as this we are asked to either make a judgement call or use random chance. I am not in any way allowed to consider the input of non-medical bystanders."

It took a moment for all of these facts to settle in my head. Ethan was in good physical health, better than my health and better than average. But averages are just statistics and without knowing the health report of everyone else in the room, statistics don't mean shit.

"Don't take him." I insisted again, calmer now.

I loosened my mask and let it fall to the floor before taking a deep, chemical-filled breath.

"Take me."
