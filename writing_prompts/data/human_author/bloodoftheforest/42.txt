My Sunday bike rides through the nearby woodland were a firmly established ritual by the time of the accident. I had made the commitment to exercise more regularly after a small health scare and had thanked my good fortune that I had not only the funds to purchase a decent mountain bike but also that I lived only fifteen minutes away from the edge of a proper forest. The routine stuck with me in a way my previous flirtations with weights and squash never could and I was soon boring my coworkers with tales of my latest routes every Monday.

I considered myself a competent cyclist but on that Sunday some unseen obstacle caused my front wheel to jolt and rather than falling to my side straight away I instead turned, hurtling straight off the edge of the flatter ground onto a steep slope.

Down, down, down I tumbled.


My head had hit a tree hard on the way down, but not hard enough to make me lose consciousness. Far more concerning was my ankle. I tried to stand up as soon as I'd stopped falling and when I did so my body was suddenly flooded with pain my brain had been protecting me from. I fell back down to the ground as rain began to fall.

Getting back up the slope with an injury would take time and the rain would mean I'd get far colder than I was dressed for. If you are injured or lost, cold can be deadly and so that is why when I noticed the cave I headed to it instantly. Better to wait the storm out than get wet.

I limped along, using my surprisingly intact bike to lean on awkwardly. The last thing I expected to see in that cave was a door.

A figure came out to me, wearing a long hooded coat and gestured for me to enter. I pushed my bike towards the door and the cold steel of my bell touched their hand. They shivered.

Of course now I know that what I then saw as a shiver was unimaginable pain, just as I know know that steel is an iron compound. All I knew then was that I was told not to bring the bike inside and I agreed without argument.

The room inside was unimaginably beautiful and I was handed a gorgeously carved walking stick as soon as the door was closed. The figure removed their cloak and she was stunning - seeming both strong yet ethereal and surveying me with a calm sense of amusement.

"I have food for us," She told me, and I limped to follow her to a table laden with a dozen different dishes, "will you stay?"

I agreed instantly and had almost forgotten about the storm. I ate with her for what must have been nearly an hour and thanked her profusely for her kindness. When we had both finished eating I told her it was time for me to head home.

"It's dark." The woman said and I realised with a sinking feeling that she'd be right.

I'd set out for my bike ride in the early evening but I'd been riding almost an hour before the accident. I'd have had half an hour at most before the veil of twilight started to lower and after that the darkness would have settled in fast. Even with a torch the way back would be treacherous but I never took my phone with me on these rides so I was unsure what other choice I had.

"Can I use your phone?" I asked my host. "I don't have anyone's number memorised but if I could just check online for-"

"I don't have a phone." She replied. "They don't work here anyway."

Ah, that was a problem.

"I won't make you leave though."

An unexpected solution.

She led me through to a richly decorated bedroom and then tapped the bed softly.

"Do you want to lie with me?"

It was inviting. But, no. Obviously no. I was a happily married man and had no business sleeping with a strange woman in a cave.

"No, thank you though." I fumbled. "I'll just take the chair back out here for the night."

She rose up to meet me for the briefest moment her eyes sparked with mischief.

"Will you take my hand?" She offered.

"Yes." I answered, expecting some sort of trick.

But all she did was led me back to the chair by the fire.

The next day I woke early and limped back towards the door. It was unlocked but as soon as I tried to move my foot through the threshold it froze.

"You said you'd stay." The voice came from behind me. "So you are staying."

I gaped at her.

"Don't be ridiculous!" I exclaimed. "I have to get back to my wife."

That my wife was still on her business trip for another week was not a detail I felt like sharing.

"I am your wife. You said you would take my hand."

Even though I barely remembered saying it, a deep instinct told me that my careless words were as binding as any contract here. Details that should have been obvious instantly suddenly piled up - that she had a walking stick carved to match my hand exactly, that she was beautiful but did not look entirely human and that she had left her home to come look for me when the storm should have been enough to cover all sounds of my approach.

"You aren't human." I muttered and then switched my tone to pleading. "I need to go back. I need to get back to my wife."

"I am your-" she began, but I cut her off sharply.

"No, you and I aren't the same. I need to be with someone who is the same as me."

She nodded.

"Okay," she said and I was relieved until she added, "I can change you."

I don't understand now why her words made me scream during my last few moments as a human. I am... something not-human now, something altogether different to the thing I was before. There are various things I don't understand anymore, but far, far more that I do. I don't understand my previous emotions but I understand why iron can burn us so. I don't know why I loved my previous wife but I know the importance of words, and the power of them.

And the forest, I understand that now too. I understand that most of all.
