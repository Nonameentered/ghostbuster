I was so used to all calls being through my mobile that I tried to answer the jarring, echoing rings on that device before correctly identifying them as from the landline that came with the house. I lifted the old, heavy plastic and held it to my ear.

"Fairy floss flowed freely." The voice on the other end said and I instantly smashed down to the floor.

I woke up with the flavour of blood filling my mouth. I remembered the phonecall and punched in the numbers to call back whoever had found reason to send me such a message. No key I pressed made any sound though and my attempt to find the source of my falling was fruitless. I could perhaps have believe the phone was merely faulty had I never found the frayed cable. Not merely snapped but *chewed* until the cords proved impotent and fallow.

The light that danced through my frayed curtains was wrong, different somehow. I opened them with fervour and felt a frantic racing in my chest when I saw my normally neat yard was overgrown with foxglove. A fatal flower I had never forced nor welcomed into my yard, yet I now found there anyway.

I ran into the kitchen and towards the back door but as I attempted to force my way out to freedom it appeared the door was in some way locked or barred. My nose twitched and I flinched as I noticed the smell. I turned my head towards the fruit basket but instead of fruits there was a strange liquid ooze.

*Fear the ferment.* my mind told me as I looked at the goo and I giggled even as the flutters in my terrified heart strayed into full on fibrillation.

How much time had fell to pass whilst I was fainted? Four days? Forty? Four hundred and forty four?

I heard strange military footsteps outside and fell apart, my lips moving before I even knew what I was doing.

"Fairy floss flowed freely." I said and just like that, I fell away again.
