In my hotel, appearances are everything. The front desk is a perfect example of this. The desk itself is cheap plywood with several hairline cracks and the carpet tiles are so thin and discoloured with the occasional sticky spot. The hot air is neither dry nor humid but *oily* - a detail that few consciously notice but is universally hated. First impressions are everything and I want the first thing a customer feels when they arrive here is discomfort. Everything else can come later.

The woman (who is of course no more man or woman than you yourself are an aubergine) who works the front desk has a disinterested, nasal voice. The way she rolls her eyes is so perfectly calculated to infuriate that it should win Oscars but when these eye rolls are not being deployed she alternates between not looking at the customer or withering gazes of contempt. If you ask her a question she will generally go out of her way to be unhelpful, often answering with questions of her own.

My office is small and filled with papers I don't need. This level of detail is excessive as nobody makes it back here but I enjoy being a perfectionist. Besides, it's not like I'm back here often enough for the setting to bother me.

"Hey, a guy out here wants to talk to the manager." I hear my employee yell.

Of course he does. They always do.

The man I walk out to meet looks small and unassuming. His eyes dart around the place, the overall wrongness of our establishment getting to him. He already knows he is dead but some part of the human mind needs to seek out a reason for things appearing 'off' even when said reason is handed to them on a plate, if you pardon the pun.

Oh, right. It's a pun because the dead man is a cannibal. We serve only the worst here.

"There's a mistake, I don't belong here." The small, slimy man tries to appeal to me.

"I'm sorry, did Janet fail to explain the situation to you? Or do you just not understand? You have earned your stay here, this is your room key."

I slide the key across the desk and the scraping sound it generates makes him flinch.

"You can't make me go." He says and I laugh quietly.

I allow myself to make him float slightly and then drop him suddenly. There is nothing I can't do in my hotel.

"Don't I get a trial or something?!" 

Feigning distractedness, I shuffle some paper around on the desk before answering. Pauses are good in conversations like this. Pauses in which you can appear to forget the other person exists are even better.

"No, no trial. Just a room key and then in that room, punishment. Execution."

He swallows hard.

"H-how will it happen? What will I find when I open my door?"

I grin. It alarms him but even if it didn't, I don't think I could help myself.

"Remember your first? The way you beat her and then it took her days to die as you just couldn't decide for sure if you could go through with it? That's what you'll find when you open your door."

He takes his key, trying to think of a way out. Failing, of course.

"That's my punishment. One of the ways I killed someone."

*Oh?!*

Oh, he still doesn't understand. This is simply too delicious.

"Not quite. I think perhaps the word 'execution' through you and made you think it was final. You already know you died and you think what - that you could *double die?*" I laugh so hard I have to take a moment before continuing. "Here you will die the way of your first. But it won't really kill you. Then, keeping hold of that pain, you will die the way of your third. Then your second. Then I like to throw in a quick drowning - I know you didn't drown anyone but think of it as a palette cleanser. We'll go back to the first and then straight towards the eighth. Everything beyond that can be a surprise but rest assured, I have a whole schedule planned"

I make the man grab his key and float, struggling, along the corridor. 


"In life, you did unspeakable things to so many, many people." I remind his clammy, panicked face. "So in death I get to *savour* the unspeakable things I'll do to you."
