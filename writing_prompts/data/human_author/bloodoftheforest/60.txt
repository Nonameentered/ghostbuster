My mother always told me "No gift nor curse can decide for you who you are." and I suppose that's why when the dark lord came to recruit me, I didn't see it as fate. I saw it as a choice.

Necromancy has a bad reputation but, just like any other skill, some people who are good at it just don't quite fit the stereotype. Take Nancy for example: lethal with a bow and arrow and comes back from every single hunt satisfied but still one of the sweetest, kindest women I've ever met. I guess I'm like that too. Not the sweet and kind part, though I do try my best, but not what you'd expect if all you knew about me was my power. I've been able to do these things since being a child and my parents made sure I understood that this did not define me.

Over the years my powers have refined and grown and I have learned more about the responsibilities of working with death. Who to save and who needs to be let go. It's a hard job and my visits are not always without sadness but all in all I am as valued as the village healer, smith or carpenter. I have made good friends and no true enemies. When the dark lord's contingent came in we all hoped that he was just passing through. Nobody spoke of me. But he knew of me regardless, most likely from some scrying spell, and he told me to leave with him in two days time.

The innkeeper put him and his people up until it was time to go. I think this was to give me time to wrap up any loose ends in the village, pack my things, anything else like that. I don't think a single one of the dark lord's men expected that I wouldn't want to come.

The thing about stereotypes is that they blind us from both sides. The dark lord found me and assumed that as a powerful necromancer, I could only ever be an asset to him. Likewise, he saw the rest of our village - a place with no soldiers or mages - and assumed that there were no threats to him there.

He was wrong on both accounts and that made him weak.

Our apothecary was an honest man and did not grow poisons. But every medicine can be misused and on the night before I was due to leave, a herbal honey to assist with sleep was added to their mead. There would have been no way to add enough to kill them without them tasting it but it was enough to ensure that these skilled and merciless warriors would wake up groggy and less able to fight.

Nancy, the hunter I mentioned earlier, picked off two of his men as they came to collect me then slipped away just before they could strike back. Foolishly, the lord had only brought four men. With two lying dead on the ground he now had only two.

He must have believed this was the work of a singular assassin or at the very least he did not assume I had any hand in the attack because he continued on to my door. When I did not answer, his men barged right in.

Carpentry and smithing are valuable skills on any day - but on this occasion they had made a most excellent trap. A man was skewered to death in my doorway whilst I waited upstairs silently. 

Cautiously now, the lord and his remaining man searched my home until they opened the doorway of my room and found me sat on my bed, waiting for them. But I was not alone.

The lord opened his mouth to speak. I'll never know what he intended to say.

Nancy's hawk, a beautiful bird I had reanimated a year ago, flew down from the rafters whist the blacksmith attacked from the left. The hawk's talons went straight for the warriors face and the smith's hammer struck the lord's knees then the warrior's ribcage.

From the ground the lord turned his head first to his dying soldier and then to me and the friends I had with me. He laughed.

"Is this your big plan? Get your friend to smash my head in and then take my position as dark lord? Well I have news for you, my men would never accept you and prophecies have confirmed that no man or woman can kill me."

I crouched down to his level.

"I don't want your position or your power. I just wanted a normal, happy life. And I no that no human can kill you, that's why I've brought Collette." I stepped away so that he could take in the other woman in the room, a small brunette wearing green robes. "She's our healer. More powerful than I am, I reckon. In all the time I've lived here I have seen her heal sicknesses and injuries that I thought for sure would kill. I understand death well, but there are some days I think she knows it better."

Collette approached the lord, the smith standing ready to defend her with his hammer if anything happened. She placed her hands on the dark lord and concentrated furiously whilst he laughed in her face.

"What, you think that healing my legs will endear me to you so much that I'll let you all off? When I do not return on schedule my mages will scry for me and even if you still somehow have me captive then and I have not murdered every last one of you, they will trace my life essence to this place and they will burn it to the ground." He last the last part so intensely that flecks of bloodied spittle ended up on Colette's face. "Besides, some healer you are anyway. In all the time you've been focussing, it hasn't felt like you've been healing my leg at all."

"I'm not." Collette muttered, still deep in concentration.

There was a moment of silence and then the dark lord's head fell to the floor as if it was suddenly too heavy for him. 

"What did you say?" He asked Collette, his eyes glazed and unfocused.

"I'm not healing your leg. I'm not healing you at all. One of the first things I learned as a healer was that there is some measure of health and sickness in all of us. That in order to cure someone who is terribly sick you must focus not on destroying their sickness but in strengthening their body. Giving them the power to fight the disease themselves."

The dark lord started to shake and for the first time since he'd arrived, he finally looked scared.

"But I'm not doing that to you. Instead, I am strengthening the diseases you already carried. No matter how minor - I am giving them power to fight and live, to grow and change." The lord spat blood on her face again but this time it was an uncontrolled splutter of a cough. Collette wiped it off with a cold indifference.

"Now, I wouldn't say that those sicknesses are human at all, would you?"

I couldn't watch it all to the end but I don't think Collette ever looked away. I heard it, and that was enough and when it was done she tapped me on the shoulder to let me know. Her robes were no longer green and the body on the floor barely resembled the man who had walked in. The smith struggled to meet the healer in the eye when she thanked him for his help and looked uncomfortable with her, but I know he'll get over that in time.

Because in this village we accept people for all of the parts of who they are. Be it the necromancer with a heart or the healer filled with venom.
