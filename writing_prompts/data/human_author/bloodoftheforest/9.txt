Partly because Edward wasn't entirely wrong about it being an initiation task to see how much he could be trusted. But mostly because they have no idea what the book does and if it gives Alice some awesome destructive powers or the knowledge instantly and violently destroys her and those around her... well, Edward is *very* expendable.
