"I was only seven when I was given this sword, maybe that's why I gave it the wrong name." I told the broken man bleeding noisily at my feet.

The man's name was Aaron but nobody called him that. To everyone who spoke of him he was referred to as 'Bladewielder.' It was ridiculous, of course. We all wield blades. More people had owned them before this whole mess simply because swords were woven into our culture as much as the food we eat or the way we dress. Then the war began and everyone picked up a blade. We couldn't afford not to.

Naming a sword cannot be undone. Once a sword is named it can only be used to fulfil the potential of its name or put down and never used at all. My older brother, a strong man who traded a short blade for a greatsword at the age of 19, named his blade 'Force Edge.' He trained extensively and eventually his sword could cut with more power than his body could physically give. My best friend had simply called her sword 'Flit' and though no cut it gave came anywhere near to the quality of my brother's, she could administer three in the time he took to cut once.

Aaron, 'Bladewielder,' or whatever you want to call the sorry bastard who was bleeding out in front of me had chosen to call his blade 'Fleshrender.' In a practice situation, against inanimate targets, his sword was useless. But that didn't matter when all he wanted to use his blade for was to break his fellow men. He wasn't the leader of the enemy but he had been *waiting* for a war or an invasion or some other excuse to inflict every act of violence he could dream of. He took great joy in his work, and the horrors of what he did could speak for themselves.

It wasn't that Aaron was the fastest or strongest but he still did more damage than any other soldier either side had. He was still the reason that we could never win whilst he lived. The instant his blade found flesh it would cut deeper than it had any right to. Not only that but they were never clean cuts but *tears* - as if either side of the sword's mark had been pulled apart by some inhuman force.

He was the reason we had lost so many.

He was the reason that my wonderful brother bled out with his leg detached from his body.

He was the reason that my best friend's brain snapped as he killed those around her but left her alive around those she couldn't save.

But now, I was the reason he was cut. I was the reason that he kept trying and failing to get up from his fallen position and I was the one that he wanted to kill most out of every enemy he had.

"Is this your sword?" I asked, walking towards Fleshrender.

I knew the answer of course and Aaron growled at me as I lifted it from the floor. I held it in my arms and then swung the thing as hard as I could.

It hit the corner of the brick wall in front of me. I swung it again and again as Bladewielder screamed at me, until the sword was ruined and my forehead was slick with sweat.

I returned to Aaron and pulled out my own sword, the one I had used to injure him. I am not a better fighter than Aaron, or my brother, or my friend. My sword had never amounted to much despite my practice but today was the day I could finally help it live up to its name. Shaking ever so slightly I held the blade's edge against his neck.

"Without you, the people you fought alongside will retreat. Our country will no longer be in danger." I told him. "But that isn't why I'm doing this. I'm doing this because you are a monster and deserve the hell death will send you to. You fight not out of necessity but out of cruelty."

I pointed at his ruined sword.

"Nobody will ever use that thing again and you will not live to name another. I want you to know all this. That nothing you've done will truly last beyond today."

I pulled my sword back from his neck just a few inches to prepare for the swing.

"What did you name your blade?" Aaron asked me, his eyes finally betraying a hint of fear.

I smiled.

"I didn't truly understand the naming convention when I was a child. I knew you had to call it something that you wanted it to be, but I picked a person. I named it after my mother."

I twisted my hips into the swing and the cut sliced his neck open quickly and cleanly.

"I called my blade 'Hope.'"
