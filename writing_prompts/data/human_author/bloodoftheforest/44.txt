Do you have any idea how terrifying it is, to run with no idea where you are going? Not to know if you are going to race into something, or to know if you will trip and slam hard down onto the ground? Now think how much scarier the thing must be that I was running from.

I'd slipped out of the house as silently as possible but of course he heard me. I'd be stealthily creeping away at a slow pace until I heard the front door clatter open. After that I ran as fast as my legs could carry me.

There are some trees around our house before you even reach the forest and I didn't know where they all stood from memory alone. One more reason he thought I'd never escape, I guess. I got lucky and didn't hit anything until the sharp incline told me that I was leaving the clearing and entering the woods themselves.

The trees were densely packed enough here that there was no way that Victor could sprint after me but by the same token the obstacles were far riskier to me than to him. I'd left under cover of darkness but he would have been smart enough to bring a light. I moved as quickly as I dared, arms out in front of me to block trunks and branches; grasping thorns tearing at my calves.

In the chaos I'd gotten turned around. Crap. No way to know which direction was safety and which was just *him*. I strained to hear how close he was but all I could hear were my own quick, panicked breaths and racing heart.

I slid down to the base of the tree my hand rested on as I tried to get my bearings and calm myself enough to hear clearly. As I did so, I felt the grass against my left hand. Much longer grass than was in any part of the proper forest, which was mostly only carpeted with moss and fallen leaves. Either I'd gotten so turned around that I was now back next to the original clearing or I had found a new, faster way through the trees than I'd previously known.

I stood up cautiously and wandered a few steps further but in doing so, he saw me.

"Stay there, bitch!" He yelled but of course I ran.

As he gained on me I heard his angry, guttural breaths getting louder and louder until suddenly they stopped.

No breaths, no footsteps. Nothing, until-

"Turn and run from this place and no harm will come to you." A female voice said levelly.

I turned to face the owner of this new voice and took a few steps towards her. She breathed strangely, almost as if she was quietly hissing.

"I'm sorry, I can't go back that way." I pleaded with her. "I'm being pursued. If you could just let me hide here until he's gone or if you could direct me how to go around the edges of my property without trespassing then I would be forever grateful."

The pause seemed to stretch forever.

"You can't see." She said, almost as if solving a puzzle.

"No." I replied nervously and then realising something myself added. "You're armed, aren't you?"

The voice chuckled in bitter amusement.

"Yes, you could say that."

I suddenly didn't know which danger was greater. Do I stay with an armed woman whose land I have just trespassed on or run towards the man who claimed to love me? I stood my ground.

"I'm not going to hurt you." She said. "And neither will he. Let me take your hand."

I stayed motionless as the stranger's hands grasped mine. Her fingers were slender yet the calluses on them spoke of a life of hard work. She pulled me a few steps back the way I'd come and just as my feet began to feel the softness of moss once more she placed my fingers on some rock at my shoulder height.

The texture was strange. It felt almost woven, as though someone had spun pebbles just as easily as wooled threads and then criss-crossed them together. I traced my hand further upwards and the texture changed, becoming smoother but with tiny, needle-like protrusions sticking out which did not hurt me but snapped under my finger pad's pressure. There were more and more of these protrusions as my hand ventured upwards and they got longer too as well as somewhat curled.

By the time my hand had explored up through the statue's beard and onto his lips I recognised the face of my husband. Perfectly still and made from stone but nonetheless undoubtedly him.

"How did this happen?" I asked.

"Me."

I considered this in silence, my hands still touching Victor's cold, silent face.

"Let me take you back," The voice offered, "you're shaking."

The woman introduced herself as Medusa and took my hand as I directed her back to my home. She left me there then, in a house no longer filled with screaming and violence but calm. I cried myself to sleep that night for reasons I couldn't fully understand. No longer scared in the same ways I had been before but merely afraid to be this alone.

At least until the next night came
