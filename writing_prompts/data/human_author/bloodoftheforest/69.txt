The day my luck finally ran out wasn't the return of the cancer that had gone into spontaneous remission like I expected but just a bad fall. The clich√© is that your life flashes before your eyes when you die but as I saw the corner of the pavement race up to meet me my only thought was "oh."

Then I was gone.

When people close to me or even animals close to me have passed away I've always struggled to accept it, but there was none of that here. I awoke in a sterile room that I knew with uncanny certainty wasn't part of the world I'd just left and all I could think was that all things considered, I'd had an unnaturally good innings. I'd nearly died so many times that really, I was profoundly lucky not to have passed earlier. 48 is young for someone too die, an age I'd have felt was far too young if it'd been someone I loved, but there were so many things that should have killed me that I'd done very well for myself.

I heard a door open behind me, a surprisingly heavy looking oak thing adrift in a sea of white. A woman as beautiful as a statue gestured for me to come into the next room and of course I obliged. The room was the most beautiful library I'd ever seen. Carved wooden shelves were stacked high with leather bound books and huge armchairs circled around a roaring fire. The woman gestured for me to sit at one of these chairs and sat on another herself.

"Do you know, will my cats be okay?" I asked.

Being able to have helped as many feline friends as I have was probably my crowning accomplishment in life. I'd always loved cats, ever since the stray I rescued when I was seven years old. When I'd been lucky enough to garner some success as a writer, most money that didn't go on bills, rent or food went towards the cats I rescued or related charities. But I had a rocky relationship with my family and whilst I had some friends it was not a particularly large number and I didn't necessarily even talk to them more than once a month. Being a writer meant that I had no physical workplace to check into and my next deadline wasn't for two weeks. I wasn't certain who would know how to look after my pets now I was no longer there.

Fortunately, the woman smiled.

"After calling 999, the man called the most recent contact in your phone. As this was Jess, she knew exactly what to do and came to stay in your house for a week until arrangements could be made. She ended up keeping the tabbies rather than risk them being split up and all of the other cats went to the shelter you donated to. By the end of the month, all of them were settled into new homes with loving owners."

I breathed a sigh of relief and sank back into my chair a little more. Then I thought about exactly what she'd said.

"Month? I've only been here a few minutes."

A warm, comforting smile cross the woman's lips as she lifted a book from the small table beside her.

"Time works slightly differently here. The way you would understand it, some of those things have not happened yet. But they remain as certain as the building of the pyramids or the journeys to the moon."

She flicked through the book she held.

"Before we discuss what you would like to do with your next chapter of existence, may I confirm a few facts?"

Who was I to deny this kindly being who appeared to either essentially or literally be an angel? I nodded for her to ask whatever she wants.

"Your name is Liz, you were born in Bristol and you died due to a car accident, correct?"

For the first time since dying, I frowned.

"No. I mean, the first bit's right but it wasn't a car accident. Maybe it says that because I was next to a road?"

"Hmmmm, it says here that you dropped an orange and when you went into the street to retrieve it, there was a collision?"

"No?"

The angel closed the book and walked to the door.

"I'll be right back, one moment please."

Even though I wasn't lying when I told her that wasn't how I died it did seem naggingly familiar. As the door closed behind her I realised it seemed familiar because it had happened, just a very long time ago.  The door swung back open and a pair of glimmering emerald eyes looked me over before disappearing behind the door again. I heard hushed voices.

"Does she *look* ten years old?" A male voice asked sarcastically.

"I don't know. Maybe? Anyway, it's what the book said either way."

After a few moments the door opened more slowly this time and both angels joined me in the room. The one I had not yet met picked up one of the books on the small table and flicked through the pages with alarming speed before pointing at one page to his colleague.

"See? It says right here - cause of death, choking."

The first angel picked up the book she'd previously been holding and held it up.

"But see this, it says that she died due to a car accident."

"I... I didn't choke either."

"Hmmmm..." the male angel said and then suddenly he sped off, at a speed I couldn't even really see.

Noises of flickering paper and an occasionally visible blur were all the evidence I had to make me realise that he was checking the other library books. All of them. After a few seconds he had returned with a small stack.

"There are quite a few deaths here." The angel said, perturbed. "Tell me, Liz, have you had any contact with any demons, angels or minor gods?"

"What? No."

"Hmm. Have you practiced the art of witchcraft of any denomination for three years or more?"

"No."

"Were you in possession of any item over three thousand years old that claims to grant wishes?"

"No."

"Have you devoted any number of years of your life or considerable effort to helping any of the following creatures: brownies, fae, devas, cats, gnomes-"

"Cats?" I asked, cutting him off without thinking.

He flicked through one of the books he held and relaxed at the mystery which seemed to now be perfectly resolved for him.

"Yes. Cats. Okay, this all seems relatively simple now. You were kind enough to cats that at various points in your life several of them spent one of their nine lives towards ensuring your death wouldn't stick. Not exactly unheard of but I have to say this is an unusually high incidence. Now, what would you like to do next?"

"They saved me? I didn't... they didn't owe me anything."

He smiled at me.

"I know. They know that too. They did it out of love, Liz. Aren't their instances where you would have done the same, if you had that power instead of them."

"Yes." I said, not needing to pause for thought. "Several."

"It isn't a limitless gift though, and it seems this particular death isn't one they could help you with. We can discuss this further, or we can discuss what you'd like to do next. It's up to you. Or you could visit them, if you'd like."

"Visit?" I asked.

"Of course. Their is a reason that cats are so well versed in death and life and that same reason lets them see the dead. If you want to say goodbye to them, I'm sure they'd appreciate it."

"I would like to say goodbye." I said, tearing up despite myself. "So much."

The sudden darkness was jarring after the light of the fire but I then remembered it had been late evening when I'd died. I stood in my bedroom, wondering what to do next, when I heard the soft patter of paws. Just one set at first, then others.

As my eyes adjusted to the darkness I saw light reflected and realised that every cat I had had chosen to come into the room to see me. Then, one by one at first but then quickly rising into a grand chorus, my friends began to purr.
