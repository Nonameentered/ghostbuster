Tired and defeated, I knocked on Fi's door for the hundredth time. I heard a few scuffles and then a cheery yell of "one moment, just looking for my keys!" At least that was one problem I could solve.

"They're on your kitchen counter!"

A sound of footsteps, a jangle of keys and Fi's door opened to reveal her smiling brightly at me.

"How did you kno-"

"I died again." I interrupted her dejectedly.

"Oh, I see. Shall I make us some tea?"


Fi was the only person who knew about my little condition. Before the alien attack the vast majority of my deaths had been self inflicted. This wasn't for any particular desire to die but simply because after a few deaths proved to me that I'd get the day before my death back, I started using them to protect my friends and family from not only death but other things which could ruin them. Not every little thing but serious, life ruining choices. Usually I'd rely on my charm and lies to get through to them but for Fi, I told her the truth. Given that I was able to use my abilities to prove I was either truthful, psychic or an excellent con man, she has helped me ever since.

"You're not going to like it." I warned Fi.

"*I'm* not going to like it? It's your death. Anyway, I'm not squeamish. What is it, beheading? Immolation? Some sort of unlikely acid-based accident?"

"The planet gets blown up."

Even Fi didn't have a smart arse response to that.

"Really?"

"Well, if I'm lying and tomorrow's just fine then I'll give you a thousand pounds."

"You don't have- wait, the whole planet." Fi sighed through her teeth in an odd kind of whistle. "Fuck."

We drank our tea in relative silence for a bit.

"Have you tried alerting NASA?" she asked.

"Yup. Everyone space-related with contact details and every intelligence service too for good measure."

"Have you tried sending some sort of signal yourself? I think technically it could be done.."

"It can and when we tried that out it wasn't even that hard. But either they can't hear me or they don't care what I'm saying. Maybe both. It's not like I have anything to really offer them anyway."

Fi tapped her fingers thoughtfully.

"Do you know it's the whole planet? Maybe-"

"In a few run throughs we've managed to get flights to various different countries. Haven't literally managed the other side of the world due to flight and time constraints but it seems to be everything."

Fi began to make more tea.

"How many times have we had this discussion?" she asked quietly.

"I've done the whole run through roughly one hundred times. I've come to you more often than not."

"Do I ever have any more ideas than this?"

I shook my head.

"No. Sometimes we try and puzzle through it for a while but most times we just try and have a nice evening."

Fi finished making the tea and smiled half heartedly at me.

"How about I go beat you up at Smash Bros then?"


Six fights later and I had won every match.

"This isn't fair! How are you even doing this, I can usually wipe the floor with you?"

"Well, you always choose this game and then you always pick the same character and the same arena and-"

"What?!" Fi exclaimed. "No! That's cheating!"

Even though this exchange had also happened before it still made me laugh.

"It's not cheating. You're just jealous, you just wish you had access to this kind of power."

Fi dropped her controller.

"Say that again."

*Wait, this is new.*

"You're jealous?"

"No." Fi grinned. "The other bit. You said earlier that it's possible to send signals up there but maybe they aren't interested because you have nothing they want. But you have the ability to manipulate time. That has got to be some sort of bargaining chip! And once they're interested enough to not blow the planet up we can look at getting some more professional negotiators involved."

"I guess it's a start." I said, but even an idea this crazy and unlikely was promising enough to excite me.

So, here we go, attempt number one hundred and something - me and my best friend beaming up details of a superpower I don't understand to aliens who can blow up a planet.

Bring it on.
