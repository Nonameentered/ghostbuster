Though their methods may take time, our seers are flawless and so because of this it has been a requirement for many generations now that each ruler is told his end. I can't say I truly wanted to know, all those years ago, but I understood that it was my duty. Some rulers had found out the rough year and been able to prepare their successor all the better thanks to knowing when their time would come. Other times no timing was given but the details were still invaluable - one queen was killed in a war which we only had time to prepare for thanks to the seers. She died, but hundreds lived who would otherwise have perished.

Weeks after their rituals had started, the seers finally sent word to the castle. I went alone and I was disturbed when the seer I spoke to couldn't meet my eyes. I should have known then that my end was to be particularly bad but the news that it was to be at the hands of one of my own made me suddenly struggle to stand. I had only two children, gifts from my true love before she'd passed. They were so young and innocent that I couldn't imagine either growing to be a killer.

Of course I was asked what the prophecy said, but I simply refused to answer. I'd made up my mind before even leaving the temple that fates be damned, I would never treat my children any differently as a result of what I'd just heard. I didn't ever want to burden them with what I knew and so I made the decision to keep it a secret from everyone.

I was not thought of well for that particular decision but I would rather be a good father than a good king.

Originally I thought that my eldest would be the easiest to give a good life. The kingdom would be his some day and though the thought that he might murder me to get it did cross my mind in dark moments it turns out I had no need to fear that. It turned out that he had no designs for the throne at all. Ever. He came to me with this issue himself and I had to admire the courage it had taken, no matter how surprising the revelation had been. 

Documents were written up during my lifetime so that any ruler who had no desire for a kingdom which was legally theirs could waive their right to do so. I discussed this matter with both my son and my advisors and together we reached the conclusion that this must all be done openly, with full knowledge of my subjects. Any secrecy would mean that my son would still have to pretend to one day rule, which he would surely resent, and that other political powers would feel tricked after my death, putting the kingdom in peril and my daughter with it.

My daughter was more than willing to accept a future as ruler. A serious, even tempered woman, she will make a fine queen one day. And yet ensuring she had a happy life was far more challenging than simply rewriting centuries of legal precedent.

At the age of ten it became apparent that my daughter possessed certain gifts. Magic had been outlawed until only the reign before my own and many still feared it. Even worse, her talents were especially strong when it came to mind telepathy and telekinesis. Once again I had to make the awkward decision whether to act privately and publicly.

I think she'd have forgiven me if I'd chosen to keep her gifts secret. Understood even, perhaps. But she shouldn't have to hide and so I worked tirelessly to create a world in which she didn't. Mages were brought into the court both to tutor her and act as official advisors. Covertly, mages taught me how to defend my secrets from magical means without ever knowing which specific secret I most needed kept hidden. Discussions as to how magic could be perceived of better and helped the kingdom began tentatively at first but as the years progressed the changes became more astounding and attitudes towards magic became more resolutely positive.

My daughter would be the first queen who could use magic and my son would be the first direct heir who was under no obligation to rule and astoundingly my kingdom was finally in agreement that these were both good things.

Perhaps I had grown foolish in my old age but this past year I had begun to believe that the seers were wrong about me. They had no previous failures but my children were so happy and so loved that I thought I would be the first.

Then one day everything went black.

The integration of magic had meant that we could diagnose things unerringly but it did not  yet mean that we could cure them all. The disease which grabbed me is fatal and it is not painless. My daughter was crying before we were even told and I thought then that she'd used her powers to diagnose me before our healers had even gotten a chance. Not quite. The three of us were left alone to process the news and it was then that my daughter spoke.

"I read your mind, when you were unconscious. I didn't mean to but I just wanted to know what was wrong with you. Instead of finding your illness I got all of your thoughts and memories. Even your secrets."

She looked so guilty and I wanted to comfort her but even the slightest movement was excruciating.

"I know that you think one of us will kill you, that that's what the seers told you." My son jolted with surprise at this. "And I just want you to know... they're right. Not because you didn't love us enough though but because you loved us *perfectly.*"

My daughter scrunched up her face in that peculiar mix of sorrow at what comes next and joy at what has been. It took a moment before she could continue.

"Anyone else would have heard that prophecy and jumped at our every move. Or worse - ended us before we could lift a hand to you. But instead you gave us a world where there was no suffering that could be avoided. And even though it hurts we would be amiss if we failed to do you the same kindness."

I smiled at my beautiful children but they were blurry and my head was full of pain. Even though it seemed I'd barely been awake I felt so very tired.

In what will be my last conscious moments both children took it in turn to gently kiss me on the cheek. And when exhaustion takes me and I drift off one of them will kill me, just as the seers had predicted.

Not out of hatred though.

Out of love.
