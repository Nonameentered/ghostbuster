It was the first real day of summer, the time when sleepy folks start leaving their dens more often and dormant mysteries run wild. She walked into my office and I knew straight away that we had a new case cooking. You don't get to where I am today without instincts faster that a postman's retreat and as soon as that golden entered the room I knew straight away where we were headed.

The golden's name was Mary and this wasn't the first time she'd brought mystery right to my paws. She was a leggy thing, with gams higher than my snoot could reach but she sure wasn't using those legs for speed today. We headed to our destination at a leisurely pace but I already knew where we were going.

Dog Park, they called it. A place where the only rule is that there are no rules and also that all messes must be collected at risk of a fine. Now, most times I take a walk round this neighbourhood I'm dressed the part. They call it a lead, because of all of those there leads I've been chasing but here the dress code is different. More casual. With a gentle clink Mary releases the lead and finally the job truly begins.

I've solved all kinds of different cases in this here Dog Park, chasing small sticks and medium size sticks with the ease of a true professional. Hell, I've even chased down large sticks once or twice. Should I have known that this was going to be the case that changes them all?

I watch Mary pull her arm backwards and at the sudden jerk I race towards where I already know it will land.

But, it doesn't.

In my confusion I search the surrounding area, sniffing the grass and even peering into the nearby bush but there's nothing. Really, totally nothing.

Then I hear it. A musical sound that in any other context would cause my tail to wag in a heartbeat but against the confusion it's different. I turn towards Mary's laughter and it's only then I see it.

The stick, held in her hand this whole time. Betrayal by the one person I thought I knew.

So yeah, that's the day that changed me.
