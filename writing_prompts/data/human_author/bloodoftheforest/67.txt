*Tap, tap, tap...*

I wasn't even fully awake when I first heard the noise. It crept into my subconscious and there was nothing at all but the tapping and endless, grasping darkness.

*Tap, tap, tap...*

It took me a moment to realise that I was in my bed and that the darkness was merely a result of closed eyelids and the late hour. Nothing menacing or alarming about it. I rolled over and pulled the duvet a little higher and prepared to drift back off.

*Tap, tap, tap...*

Wait, if I was awake then what was the tapping? It didn't sound like rain, too singular and muffled. I blinked open my eyelids and to my alarm saw that there was a human at the end of my bed. The tapping stopped.

"Good, you're up." A female voice said.

I considered my options. There was no way to attempt to leave the room without going straight past the mysterious woman. I didn't exactly have any weapons to hand. I decided to plead ignorance.

"Look, take anything you want. You don't have to hurt me, I haven't even seen your face, s-"

"I can fix that." The figure interrupted and flicked the light switch.

*No!* I thought before light flooded the room and my night got altogether weirder.

The person in front of me wasn't human. I knew this not because of her violet hair, that could have been dyed, or even because of her strange but *almost* human proportions. I knew that this woman wasn't a human because that was not the backstory I had written for her.

"Elellania." I whispered.

Elellania was a powerful psychic turned space pirate. She could be a decent mechanic when necessary and a terrifying fighter on occasion but the thing that she could never, ever be was real. So how was she standing in my bedroom?

"Get up." Elellania ordered.

I complied awkwardly, wishing I was wearing something more flattering than pyjamas in need of a wash. Elellania was the version of myself I wished I could be. I would never admit that if asked but with her standing here I was bowled over by how obvious it was that I created this character to fix things about myself that were lacking. She was an assertive badass to counter my indecisive tendencies, string where I was weak, beautiful where I - OH CRAP SHE CAN HEAR THESE THOUGHTS.

"Yes," Elellania said in response to my internal monologue, "I don't care. Come with me."

I should have thoroughly considered the possibility that I was still dreaming but instead, I was excited. One of my favourite fictional characters out of my novel (and a half) had appeared and needed my help. I was only too eager to follow her but to my disappointment Elellania led me not out of my front door but into my tiny home office.

"Boot up the laptop." She ordered.

I poked the power switch and then waited awkwardly for the system to start.

"What do you want from me?" I asked.

Elellania looked right into my eyes and her stare was exactly as piercing as I'd written it.

"I want you to write. Open the new novel."

I typed in my password and then opened the document which contained the new third of a novel (but definitely half a novel when I'm talking to my publisher). I waited expectantly.

"Right." Elellania said. "I don't care how you do it, but Ki'vah lives."

"What? No! See, Ki'vah has to die in order for the ship's Astral Engine to gain a second surge of life. Without his death, the ship would have drifted without power into the seventh sector and ultimately the entire galaxy would be destroyed. Not to mention, readers generally say that the romance between Elellania and Ki'vah would have been doomed to failure anyway as they never would have fallen in love under normal circumstances! And even disregarding all of this - Ki'vah died last book. I couldn't change it now even if I want to. Which. I. Don't."

I sat up straighter, somehow forgetting how ridiculous this whole situation is.

"How did you even get here?" I asked.

To my surprise, Elellania left the room and gestured for me to follow.

"Pit gave me- well, I guess you gave me. Anyway, you gave me an artefact which is believed to allow 'travel between any realms.' Guess what? Turns out it does."

She stepped to the side and I saw a glimmering, shifting gateway in my kitchen. My legs went wobbly and a very annoyed main character pulled me up before I could really fall.

"See that there? That is a plot hole. I had something that could travel between realms and I needed an escape. I turn up in this world and I find a frankly ridiculous drawing of me on a book cover in one of your stores. I mean, was that the chest you wished I'd actually have? Ugh. Anyway, I found the book, you gave me excellent psychic powers since day one and so I used my new toy to come and find you."

Elellania led me roughly back to my office.

"I've gone to a lot of trouble to find you. If necessary, I will go to similar lengths to ensure that every one of your secrets is told to your family, friends and enemies. So bring him back."

I tapped my fingers nervously, touching the keyboard too lightly to actually type.

"I'm sorry but I really can't. I described his death and that book has already been published."

To my surprise, Elellania actually laughed at this.

"You *can't?*" she mocked. "Marie, on this plane of existence there aren't any psychics at all yet I come from an ancient lineage of them. Your spaceships can't even leave the galaxy and yet my second-hand junker can traverse universes. There are a million impossibilities in my world compared to yours, coming back from death isn't impossible."

She was right. Technically, I could write whatever I wanted.

"I'm going to leave you with a choice. I'll return to my world, for now at least. Then you can either leave Ki'vah dead, and remain true to what your fans think is right. Or, you can resurrect him, and do what I, and therefore you, think is right. But choose the former and I *will* come back to ruin you."

I thought about this.

"I could write it so I'm safe either way."

Elellania grinned.

"Could you though? You sure as shit didn't write this."

She removed her left earring and placed it carefully on my desk and with that, she left. I stared at the earring, the only proof that she'd actually been here, until natural light started to pour through the cracks in the curtains. I considered my options.

And with that, I started to type.
