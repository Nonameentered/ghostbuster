Miles was the only person in the room who was from the League and was faced with five members of the Government Ethics Board for Superpower Affairs. He stood nervously as the board officials regarded him with mild surprise.

"As you are well aware, the government has an incredibly robust self screening process. Our judgements regarding heroes and villainy are not up for discussion. This meeting was only supposed to be an opportunity for you to discuss minor changes in the procedure by which-"

Miles dropped a file on Marissa's desk, cutting her off mid sentence.

"There have been significant findings that support what I'm telling you. There are also wider trends which don't bode well, such as the Board's 100% villainy judgment rate for telepaths."

"Now that's ridiculous," a different official spoke up, "telepath are simply more prone to maladaptive behaviours. Not to mention the fact that as telepathy is a psychic-cluster ability there is the risk that the individual could develop telekinesis or even mind control."

Miles shook his head.

"Thought manipulation has only been observed exactly once and it was an incredibly mild case at that. And even though that individual showed no malicious intent or dangerous behaviour not only was she drugged and removed from the general population, the ability itself was clustered with telepathy as if the two are often hand in hand."

The head official took the file from Marissa and gave a few pages a cursory glance.

"Whilst I'll send this to our internal assessors I don't see any evidence here. And frankly, this is not behaviour that we have any interest in working with."

"Good. That's kind of the point."

There was a brief moment of silence before the head official responded.

"If you truly intended for the League to no longer have our cooperation then what exactly would the point of this meeting be? You can't have imagined that we'd agree. So this is clearly some kind of bargaining tool and it is not one that we are willing to bow down to."

Miles grinned.

"The point of this meeting was just to get you here. I don't need you to agree to anything. Petra!"

At the sound of her name a young woman walked in. She was wearing professional clothing but seemed less familiar with the garments than others in the room. Her hair wasn't as perfectly done and her make up was a little too dramatic. Whilst everyone else in the room was wearing work clothes, she wore the same thing as a costume.

Miles turned back to the officials.

"I have another interesting fact to share with you. The League has suspected the biases I mentioned for two years now. In that time we have become... a little lax with how quickly we've reported new superheroes. Some, like Petra, never got reported at all."

Petra took the pen that was attached to her clipboard and began frantically taking notes.

"What is she *doing?*" one official murmured.

Miles grinned at the room.

"Hey, you said yourselves we need more evidence. And ideally we did. So right now Petra is rifling through all of your brains to find out exactly the evidence we need."

Marissa took her phone out of her pocket to call security only to find the screen blank. She stared at it in confusion when suddenly it *winked* at her.

"They didn't come alone." a voice said.

Other figures filed into the room. Two came through the door and another three stepped right through the exterior wall. Out of the whole group who had joined Miles exactly half were registered heroes and the other three were 'technically undiscovered.'

"Stop her!" The head official insisted but nobody really moved at the command.

Nobody tried to somehow get through a crew of superpowered people to attack Petra, the smiling man in red assured that no phone calls to security of police could be made and Petra took notes for some time. The battle was over before it begun and when the notes were finally finished a pale, freckled teenager phased people through the outer wall one by one.

"Thanks for the meeting!" Miles said just before he was helped outside. "And can I just say, it is a pleasure to no longer be working with you."
