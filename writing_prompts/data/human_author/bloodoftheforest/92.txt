I was 19 years old when I learned that Steven wasn't allergic to broccoli and it took me three months to fully get over the treachery.

"What do you mean you aren't allergic?" I asked after going outright frantic that he'd decided to try my mysterious soup.

"I'm just... not..." he mumbled.

"You've always been allergic..."

"I'm not." Steven said, looking weirdly embarrassed about the topic. "Kind of... the opposite?"

The penny refused to drop and he had to help me further.

"Like you and silk?" He offered.

"It makes you good at dancing?" I said, bemused.

"No, of course not. You get better coordination and such, I get smarter. It's my attuning substance. Silk makes you a dancer, peanuts make Emmy better at fixing things, asbestos gives Paul better memory capabilities and broccoli makes me smarter. More specifically it's a kinda common sense thing."

Steven left the information hanging in the air and though it took some time I reached the only real available conclusion.

"You didn't want to have common sense around us." I said and then thought on it some more. "Were we really that bad?"

Steven shifted on his seat and placed the half eaten bowl of coup on the table so he could focus on me more fully.

"Oh, Alex. Of course you were-"

"THIS IS YOU DELIVERING THE NEWS WITH THE BENEFIT OF YOUR FUCKING BROCOLLI-SENSE?!"

Steven winced at the outburst.

"This was always going to be a difficult conversation, but I think you're old enough to deal with it now." He said as I glared at him furiously. "Of course you made terrible decisions. You were meant to, you were kids. And I was meant to really, but if I was attuned to my potential then my judgement skills were a few years ahead and frankly, it was lonely. I couldn't have been all that helpful anyway, I don't think."

I wanted to stay enraged at him but his explanation made a lot of sense and my anger cooled down to a mere simmer. Would we really have believed Steven anyway - if he'd simply announced that he was the smartest? Pretty unlikely. I opened the fridge to grab myself i beer and then grabbed an extra one too.

"When did your parents find out you were faking?" I asked him.

"Oh, instantly." Steven chuckled. "Broccoli might make my judgement a bit better but it certainly doesn't give me any acting skills. They kept up the pretence for other people though. Mum said that missing out from the opportunity to learn from age-appropriate mistakes and failures could end up causing severe developmental issues."

I grinned and sat down at the kitchen table with him.

"Yeah, that certainly sounds like your mum."

"So. You're not mad?" Steven asked hopefully.

"Well, that depends." I said, sliding a beer over to him. "I suppose I could be persuaded to be incredibly forgiving and mature about this *if* next time you meet any of my future boyfriends you just so happen to be snacking on a whole load of broccoli."

Steven grinned and took a swig of his beer.

"I think that could probably be arranged."
