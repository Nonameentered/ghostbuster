"What..?" 

"You heard me," the voice boomed impatiently, "genies don't have any magic and no magic even exists. Time is merely stopped whilst you resolve matters using mundane means to answer the wishes you are tasked with."

My heart sank. I'd been looking forward to the day when I'd be a proper, employed genie all of my life but now it all made sense. Why so many of the wishes genies granted came with unforeseen and often painful consequences. I'd sworn I wouldn't be like that but was there truly any way around it?

The man who had found me had only wished for food for his family. A simple and unselfish request but with no magic that food had to come from somewhere. His neighbours are just as poor as him and taking their food would be terrible. Without time moving as it should, I could theoretically walk to the nearest city and take food from someone so rich that they wouldn't need it. But wouldn't someone, somewhere get accused of that crime? Not to mention how long it would take me to aimlessly search of food I could take and try to bring it back to...

Wait a minute...

"What did you say about magic?" I yelled into the ether.

"There is none. No magic exists. You'll just have to figure it out for yourself."

"Right," I began, "but time freezing is magic, isn't it? I mean, it's certainly not mundane."

There was a lengthy pause.

"That doesn't count..."

"Uh huh. And booming voices that I can't see, they're magic, aren't they?"

"That's different. I'm different. There is magic, you just don't have any."

I shook my head vehemently.

"No, that's not what you said before. And what do you mean that you're 'different?' What exactly are you?"

Another lengthy pause and a short, musical sound.

"Management." he offered but it was already too late.

I'd recognised the sound that had preceded his statement - it was the wind chimes on my current assignment's door. Contrary to myth, genies are fully capable of escaping their own bottles and so I did just that.

The being in front of me looked shocked and guilty but more shockingly than all that was the fact he looked *normal.* Just another normal genie. Just like me.

"Why are you doing this?" I asked.

"You don't understand!" The genie who called himself Management spluttered. "Genies can't know that they have magic. There'd be wars, or chaos or something. So we're in place to make sure that they never learn the truth. Not you, though. You can join me."

As he spoke I could feel the power crackling through my veins and I wondered how I could have ever ignored it. How one simple lie had brought me so close to not understanding what we could really do.

"It isn't limited to human's wishes either, is it? That's how you can stop time in the first place."

Management opened his mouth to deny it but then closed it again wordlessly.

"That's what I thought. You went along with this so that you could have power over others but with the magic we really have, we can grant our own wishes."

He tried to run but he couldn't. I wouldn't let him. He had lied over and over to us, screwed us over and made us screw over countless humans in turn. We could have done things so much better.

"What would you wish for?" He asked me.

The answer was obvious.

"A revolution."
