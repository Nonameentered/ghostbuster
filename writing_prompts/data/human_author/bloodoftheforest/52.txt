Hi! So, I intentionally left it vague and gave myself the little challenge of seeing if I could fit a few extra 'f' words into it. My general idea was that the phrase said on the phone ("fairy floss flowed freely") was a trigger phrase that not only made the narrator pass out for an unnaturally long time, as evidenced by the growth outside and rotten fruits but also did something *bad* to her brain, hence all of the additional f's from that point on. Why someone did this to her is left a mystery, as is exactly what has happened to the world outside. There is no more to this particular story but [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/oogi3t/agnostophilia/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) kinda has a similar tone.
