"It will take an hour from you."

I nodded eagerly. This might not have been common knowledge about genies but I had researched enough to find them so the idea that they took life was not new information to me. I just wanted proof and I stared at my foot as I waited.

"So which hour?" He asked me.

Now this, this I didn't expect.

"What do you mean?"

The genie sighed. He was only asking for so little, why did he seem so sad?

"I take something from your lifespan but you can only bargain with the parts that are already yours. So for your foot to be healed, you need to tell me which hour to take. And it will be completely gone, I need you to understand." 

He looked upset with me or perhaps just for me. 

"You've asked to deal and I can't undo that. But whichever hour you choose - you will never remember it again. You won't have learnt anything from it and nobody will remember you being there at all. Nothing physical, mental or spiritual you gain from it will be there anymore. Gone, forever gone."

I didn't understand why it mattered. It was just an hour.

I thought about it carefully, though. An hour of sleep seemed safe enough. I ruled out any important dates and cleverly avoided any exam seasons where I might have spent the night cramming instead of snoozing. Aside from all that I picked it almost randomly - recent felt safer so I chose 2am exactly two weeks ago.

The bruise faded and it was done. I didn't feel any diffferent. I didn't understand why he cared.



The day I snapped my leg before a dig was the day I learned that the time wasn't always so short.

"Three days." The genie said.

It was a sharp increase but for a small bruise versus a broken bone it seemed fair. I toyed with the idea of removing the day I actually broke it but in doing so I'd also lose important knowledge about the dig itself. Again I avoided obvious dates and time periods and whilst I felt a little more uneasy it was worth the cost.

The bone healed, the dig went well, everything was fine. I didn't see what all of the fuss was about.



"Hey, can you tell me how much I'll lose before I commit to the deal?" I asked the genie one day.

"I can tell you how much time you'd need to sacrifice." He replied.

It's so stupid, I really felt like I'd outsmarted him that day. And because he'd asked the question I'd meant it didn't occur to me that he'd avoided the question I'd actually asked.



I asked about a lot of exchanges and in the beginning I didn't take that many. But when you learn that the illness that has you hugging the toilet only costs a day, it's tempting. Little ulcers in my mouth cost an hour each. Feeling drained was anywhere between four hours to six. I didn't make the trade for all of these things, but I did for some. And every time I asked, I got just a little more comfortable with it.


By the time I got my first heart attack I'd been talking to the genie at least once a week. I think I was accepting just over half of the trades we discussed at that point, it's hard to know.

But a heart attack - that's scary stuff. That's top of the range terror there, near death experience. I didn't even ask how much it cost before asking it to be taken away. Two months, it turns out. Two months to get rid of something that literally kills people? I rattled off some dates as quickly as I could and the pain stopped. I was okay. I was okay.


I'm pretty sure it wasn't long after the heart attack that the amount of traded I made started to spike upwards. My career wasn't doing so great and I didn't have time to be sick or tired. I needed to be better. It seemed like people I used to consider my equals were constantly getting better opportunities than I was and I needed to catch up. My colleagues often seemed to be distant from me.

"I can't feel ill today. I'll trade you a few hours from the night of 23rd April last year." I demanded. "However many it is, I don't care."

The genie shook his head.

"You've used that time. It's gone."

I stared at him in confusion.

"What?"

He repeated himself patiently and I, for my part, cursed myself for being so careless.

I still made the deal though. I just changed the date.



A couple of months later a coworker pulled me aside.

"Look, I know we don't know each other very well but are you okay? You seem really smart a lot of the time but then other times it's as if you've forgotten really basic things. I don't know if it's the heat or if you're sleep deprived or something else but if you need to talk then I'm here. Or if you think it could be more serious maybe get checked out or something? I don't know. It's probably not my place, sorry."

She stood there awkwardly for a few moments and then suddenly found a different coworker to talk to. Which was fine in a way, she'd given me a lot to think about.

For instance, why didn't we know each other very well? We were both archaeologists studying a similar field. A little online stalking of her revealed that we'd worked on the same digs before now, attended the same conferences. She was extroverted and friendly and seemed to have no trouble connecting with coworkers she'd known for less time than me and I'd always thought of myself as easy to get along with. Until these past few years I'd always managed to find a lot of friends.

When was the last time I'd hung out with friends or family? When did I last go on a date?

The sleep deprivation comment got to me too. I'd been thinking of sleep as time that was free to trade with but some online research suggested that was when we do a lot of things that are vital to our health. Mental health. Physical health. Even heart health.

I felt sick to my stomach and my pulse raced. I realised I didn't know how many trades I had made and I began to panic. Hadn't the old me been organised? If nothing had been taken from her, would she have let this slip through the cracks?

"Genie!" I yelled. "What did you take from me?"

The genie just stared at me.

"It's gone."

I understood, I think, but I still needed to know.

"No, tell me! Would I have people if I made no deals? Did I miss out on moments that would have turned to friendship or flirting? Would I be smarter? Healthier?" My breath began to catch in my throat. "Would I even have had a heart attack at all if we'd never met?"

The genie looked mournful and offered no answers.

"I don't know either. It's gone."

I knew what I'd done, then. I understood why stories with genies never ended well, even if most of them got the details wrong. I understood why they're often regarded as tricksters even though I only tricked myself.

I knew my life was empty and that I was the one who hollowed it all out.

But the thing is, all of this knowing and understanding was making me panic so much that I felt ill and I had so much to do. One more trade couldn't hurt, right?

Just one more.
