"Come on, my life for her life."

The woman didn't even look up from her work.

"Sorry, can't do. She has more years of life to give than you do, nobody's going to make that trade." She took a long and noisy slurp from her mug of coffee.

"But you can have mine, you can have mine right now with no questions asked."

She sighed and finally met my eye.

"I have absolutely no reason to lose out on this deal. Now, Sierra still has two months to find the money. But if she can't then she *knows* what she agreed to. So until you can come back to me with the right number of years or dollars, kindly fuck off."

Sierra had needed money for medicine. I've learned a lot of 'donations' come from people with long term illnesses. Once life became a commodity certain companies realised that forcing someone to live in pain and suffering made them much more likely to donate those sweet, profitable life units and so medication cost skyrocketed. It went from difficult to afford to impossible to afford almost overnight. Some agreed to donate at this point whereas others, like Sierra, turned to loan sharks as a way to generate enough income to afford the pills they need.

Ellie and her lot will have known from the start that Sierra wouldn't be able to pay them back. However if you look at the contract she signed it said that she agrees to pay them back in either money or life units and people who sign contracts like that often don't ask for nearly as much as if they were outright selling their life. It's all *technically* legal - it is a fundamental right to be allowed to sell or donate your life force. And the stuff is literally useless to anyone else if ripped out without consent so the fact that it can't be stolen is another point that's often trotted out when anyone complains about the practice.

Sierra was crying in the car. Outright sobbing in terror but in a few months time when Ellie collects her life it will be viewed as 'consensual.' It makes me sick.

"Don't worry, I'll think of something." I soothed. "There'll be something."

-----

I don't think there is any moral way to seek out life force from others but in my defends I did my best to ensure they were all people who wanted to give it anyway. People who had no other options. People who were dying but would at least add a few more months to the total. And me, I was still on this list.

When I had gotten as many people as I could, we arrived in droves and I spoke to Ellie once again. 

"I have enough life units for Sierra." 

She looked surprised but nodded.

"Then as long as they agree then she's off the hook."

I sighed in relief but I wasn't done.

"Who else?" I asked her.

Ellie looked at me in confusion so I clarified.

"Who else's life can I buy with the people I've brought?"

I swear I could see the dollar signs in her eyes as she realised that not only the people in the lobby but the small crowd of people outside were with me. She spent nearly an hour walking around and doing quick health assessments to judge how many years they had left. She came back to me with the total.

"And me too," I added, "I'm also part of this."

Because I had to be. How else would I be able to live with the guilt?

-----

I never really agreed to the term 'consent' being thrown around in discussions of life unit donations. If it can be coerced or threatened from you then that isn't really consent, is it? However despite all of that it seems that some principles apply.

Ellie's business hinged on the fact that everything she did was legal. There are black market places that offer similar services but hers isn't that. Once I signed a contract saying those people were free to go, they really were. And once I signed the page saying I consented to my life force being removed she had every right to take it.

But whilst researching how life units worked in the hope of finding some legal loophole I came across something interesting. In the rare cases where life unit had been consensually donated to a specific person but  was then stolen, it had been useless to the thief. For all the talk of consent there is one aspect that seems to have been ignored - it can be general or specific.

The cases I read about failed life unit theft didn't mention any need for a legal contract *saying* that the life force was going to the specific person it was meant for (a woman donating it purely because she's told it'll go to her daughter for example) so it seems that unspoken intent is enough.

The contract I signed only says that they can take my life units and I didn't lie. They can indeed take them. But each and every person I talked to before that day was in agreement that we needed to bring that business down. Taking away their legal right to the life units they had and in exchange for units they can never use should do that.

And so as they kill us all we will have one thought about where our life may go:

*"For Sierra."*
