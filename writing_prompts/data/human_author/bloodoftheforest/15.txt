I'd fought well but in the end she was faster. It didn't matter who was stronger or smarter or in the right in the moments before she cut me, just a simple matter of reaction time. She saw an opening and sliced with a practiced precision. And just like that I went from holding my own in the fight to keeling over onto the tiled floor.

I heard footsteps and then a harsh grating sound that I realised was from a chair being dragged across the floor. I painfully shifted my position to look at the source of the noise and saw Marie sat there staring at me.

*Of course,* I thought, *she's waiting for me to die.*

Getting rid of me entirely might have been a possibility for her but there was always the chance that I hadn't been careful enough breaking into this place and either a human or a camera had seen me approach. It would not look good for the last known location of a disappeared person to be Marie's own office. On the other hand, she certainly couldn't let me live. And though my injury would be fatal giving time, a good team of paramedics and doctors could end up fixing me up if she called them too soon. 

So now we wait.

Marie looked at me with something resembling bored disinterest and then tilted her head with a sudden thought. She swiftly grabbed back onto her blade and then held both hands out in front of her. With a series of brutal swipes she cut up her left hand, some strokes getting stuck in the gaps between her splayed fingers. I watched in confused horror until I realised why she'd done it.

*Oh. Defensive wounds.*

Still horrified but no longer confused, I tried to pull myself up on the side of the desk.

"Don't bother," she said, "I'll only have to put you back down again if you get up. And, ugh, look. You're getting blood on the paperwork."

The papers suddenly shifted under my palm and I fell back to the floor as they tumbled down around me. I made eye contact with Marie and smeared blood straight across the one closest to me.

"Whatever," She sighed, "I'll just get someone to come in early tomorrow and print off whatever's missing."

*She must be a nightmare to work for,* I thought but that reminded me of my wife's own nightmare boss. Always trying to get her to come in a little early, stay a little late, have lunch a little less... my thoughts snagged in the jagged reality that I'd never see her again and tears started to prick in the corners of my eyes.

This wasn't right - I wasn't meant to be here, bleeding and crying. I'd been smart, disciplined and brave. I deserved better.

I looked at the paper stuck underneath my bloodied hand and choked a laugh at the header.

*Happy Endings Incorporated.*

"Where's my happy ending?" I asked the monster in the chair.

She shook her head at me.

"Don't you get it? The entire point of a villain is to die. You don't get a happy ending."

Her voice lowered.

"You don't get to take me down, or uncover me or kill me. You just get to die here on the floor. You don't get the girl, to be rich or to be famous."

She smiled.


"I can make you infamous though. That I can do."
