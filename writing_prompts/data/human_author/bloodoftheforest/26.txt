Oh, you're definitely right to be sceptical of eye witness testimony. It's frighteningly easy for people to forget, misremember or outright make stuff up without meaning to and if there's a weapon present then that scrambles things even more. People understandably want to think of their own memory as being some sort of perfect and infallible truth but really brains are squishy and weird and can end up doing some truly bizarre things. Neuropsychology is fascinating.

And whilst I've never thought it before you mentioned it I can exactly see what you mean about Brad and Jennifer being the same person with different haircuts. In fact I'm not sure I'll be able to unsee it now. Ho hum.
