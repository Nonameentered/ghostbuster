"I haven't seen that one yet, can I?" I asked Michael, gesturing to a door. "I mean, it's a green clearance so I think it should be okay."

"Sure." Michael said, whipping out his keycard.

Then we were in the room with a staircase that stopped just before the ceiling. There were maybe fifteen steps, wooden with a garishly patterned carpet. There was nothing behind or next to these stairs and they looked almost laughable in the stark white room. Still, I saw that there were photos on the wall and knew enough from other artefacts that those showed the lives that these stairs have somehow taken.

"What is it exactly?" I asked.

"It's nicknamed the staircase of truth. It reveals a new universal truth of the universe with each step."

I thought it would be insensitive to ask how it murders people but Michael saw my eyes flick over to the photos and elaborated anyway.

"Nobody's ever made it past step three. At some point on one of the steps they just die. Our theory is that it's more knowledge than the brain can handle but it's only a theory. One of the smartest people I've ever met died before he was even really settled on the second step. Didn't look like it hurt, he just keeled over and then he was gone."

"I'm sorry."

Michael walked over to the photos. There were twelve of them, the tiny plaques under each one showing that the first person died here nearly seventy years ago. Michael sighed at the most recent photo.

"It's- he would've passed anyway. That's why he did it, I think. Nobody had tried it in about eight years at this point and the three truths we have gotten from these stairs have been immense. Some of the containment equipment we've created here relies on it, the handful of artefacts we've made here ourselves would not be possible without it. There is an understandable reluctance among staff to give it a go, knowing it's pretty much certain death. And even if we could morally justify experimenting on unwilling participants, what if they gained more knowledge but used it against us? So when Art got diagnosed he put in the request straight away. Anyone who works here would have been permitted an attempt, let alone in situations like his."

Michael turned away from the photos and eyed the stairs with no small measure of melancholy. After a decent pause I spoke up.

"Anyone who works here? Even me?"

Michael laughed bitterly.

"Sure, if you want to sign your own death warrant then-"

He stopped abruptly once he realised I was serious.

"You're an intern." 

"I still had to be vetted. Wouldn't that make it okay?"

Michael didn't say anything. I pressed the issue.

"I've seen incredible things these past couple of weeks. I know you only get interns in for the grunt work and god knows I'm not suited for much else but if I could go up these stairs then maybe I could help. And if not, at least I never really have to leave."

"But you aren't going to miss this place when you leave, Alice. We give you-"

I cut him off.

"You remove these memories with The Whistle and put in the previously agreed upon cover story with The Chime. I know. That was covered in day one. But I don't really want to go back to being who I was without this place either." I grinned at him darkly and added. "Anyway, I've got a free afternoon."

Michael thought about it.

"Now? Really? Look, if you want to do it then I can't really refuse it. And I'm certain that my manager will say yes if I ask. But are you really, really sure?"

I nodded and Michael headed for the door.

"Then I guess I'll get it authorised and go grab the medics. They won't, well, they won't actually be able to revive you once you fall. But we'd be monsters not to try."

-----

It turns out that getting authorisation and grabbing medics only took twenty minutes. Michael came back with three other employees, presumably his supervisor and two medics. The latter carried through hefty bags of supplies and a defibrillator, which made me finally feel the nerves that I should have felt all along.

"You can change your mind. And if you're done on step one - nobody has actually said they felt they couldn't just walk straight back down. You don't need to do this." Michael said whilst his supervisor shifted awkwardly on his heels.

I walked to the staircase and after one deep breath up I stepped. I felt more than heard a kind of layered whispering. It went on for a few seconds but then it was gone. My face fell.

"What did it say? Just so I can confirm it for our records." The supervisor asked me.

"It didn't make much sense." I admitted and turned my head back to see him frowning slightly.

"That's okay," Michael said gently, "just tell us what you thought you heard."

I relayed the message across and they seemed satisfied with the nonsense. Step two had a similar result.

"I can relay it across but I still don't understand. I don't even know half of the words."

I turned around and repeated what I'd heard. Michael's supervisor had the same frown as before but Michael himself looked mildly bemused.

"Which words didn't you- um, which words has your physics course not covered?"

I laughed.

"I dropped physics pretty much as soon as I started the course. Turns out science is not for me, I can just about manage political science though. They said all this was fine on my first day?" I said, a little concerned. "Do I need to come back down?"

After a quick whispered conversation, Michael answered.

"No, only if you want to. But, um, if you're not wanting to be a scientist why did you apply for something advertised as a laboratory internship anyway?"

I shrugged.

"I applied for a lot of things. You accepted me."

I did the third step with my eyes closed but nothing. I was fine. I heard Michael's sigh over even my own and then I lifted my foot and prepared for almost certain death.

Step four. Still nothing, nothing bad anyhow. There was a sudden scrambling as recording equipment was switched on and other members of staff I hadn't even heard of were told to get here quickly.

By step five there was an audible hum of excitement in the room. Three new people had joined us and a second recording device was set up in case the first failed.

Two steps later and the room was packed. I had been handed a voice recorder as well as the two already present in the room and I was now being videoed as well. Nothing I said made any sense to me but everything I said provoked excitement from someone in the room.

I think maybe it was the understanding of the facts rather than the facts themselves which caused the previous scientists so much issue. I've already been told that I have a job here for as long as I want. Michael's told me that the offer stands even if I come back down and I believe him, I really do, but I think I'll keep going.

There are only so many stairs. And I no longer think a single one can kill me.
