We'd been warned of the possibility of nuclear attack for months now so at the very least I knew where to go. Every streaming service had their episodes bookended with information telling us what to do if the siren went off, so many leaflets about it had been posted out that my artist friend was using them in some strange collage and whilst I don't actually listen to the radio I've been told there was as much advice littering those airwaves as everywhere else.

In short, we were informed and so because of this a small part of me felt prepared. That part of me died the instant the siren went off for real.

"No..." I whispered quietly and I just sat there without moving for a full five minutes until July gently nuzzled my hand.

I stood up and tried to remember what exactly I was supposed to take with me to the shelter. I had kept one of the original leaflets of course and it had been thorough about some of the things that citizens might need but it had left glaring holes that I was only noticing now that this situation was no longer a hypothetical.

We were told to bring any current medications and a printout of our medical history but not whether we'd need tampons. We were told that no cigarettes or cigars would be permitted as smoking would be entirely forbidden but I had no idea if the same ventilation clothes excluded perfume. I don't drive so I'd only be able to take with me what I can carry and so I found my self second guessing the bag I'd prepared weeks earlier. 

July meowed softly at my feet as I dragged the backpack and her carrier out of the closet. I pounced on her before she had fully realised what was happening and shoved her protesting form inside the box. Her angry meows layered over the chaos outside as I strapped the backpack on firmly and headed out.

The walk to the nuclear shelter would have been a very manageable distance under normal circumstances but in the chaos of that night it was anything but. The carrier's weight shifted every few steps and the straps of my backpack dug into my bare shoulders. In the end it didn't really matter that I couldn't drive as the roads were somehow already completely gridlocked. Some people were sobbing whilst others showed no emotion at all.

There were only a few people outside the shelter and when I saw the speed with which the guard checked the papers I understood why. The documents that we had been told were vital in order to ensure admittance were barely glanced at as the guard let each of the people in front of me pass. When my turn finally arrived though, he shook his head.

"No pets."

As if in response the carrier tilted backwards in my grip.

"No pets?! What? Why?"

The towering man shrugged at me.

"There isn't enough food."

"I can go and get her food! I can bring her food!" I said, yelling without really meaning to.

"Move aside, Miss."

With that he gestured to the woman behind me to move forwards in the queue and the matter was considered settled.

I took off the backpack that I hadn't needed after all and began to walk. There was a park nearby were July and I could sit together. I settled on a bench before removing her and convincing her to sit in my lap, albeit grumpily. I petted her gently and stared absently up at the dark sky.

"Can I sit with you?" A voice asked.

I turned my attention back in front of me and saw a wiry man holding the leash of a huge husky.

"Oh, she won't bother your kitty. She grew up with cats, knows that she's below them in the chain of command." He explained.

July for her part seemed utterly unconcerned at the panting animal in front of us. I nodded my agreement and the man joined me.

"You couldn't do it either then?"

"No. I didn't realise that... I guess I just didn't realise."

There was an awkward pause.

"All the people involved in all those announcements and letters and not one of them thought about the animals?" He shrugged. "Maybe we'll be better off out here."

We were alone in the park to start with but as the night progressed, it seems we weren't the only ones to make the same decision. There were some tears but many shared tales of their animals. Someone passed around a bottle of whisky and of all of us who ended up gathered in that park - not one changed their mind and left.

As the sky brightened with alarming intensity we each knew why we'd chosen to be there. And though the air would burn around us, we made that choice out for love.
