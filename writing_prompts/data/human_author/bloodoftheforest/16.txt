*I'm so late... Do I still go to the lecture? Will he kick me out because I got here so late? Will I get in trouble? Will he care?*

It seemed like different lecturers had wildly different attitudes to latecomers and since this was my first class of Introduction to Theoretical Physics I had no idea whatsoever what approach this particular Professor would take. I weighed my options as I ran full pelt up the stairs and decided that there was no way I could afford to skip the class. Sure there was a possibility that I'd be punished or mildly humiliated but finding someone in a lecture I'd not been to and trying to figure out what was said from their notes would be way worse. I barrelled down the corridor, threw open the door to the lecture theatre and hurried in.

Then I stopped dead.

*Jack is here.*

The voice in my head that had told me that Jack wasn't there for so long that I had stopped consciously hearing suddenly told me the exact opposite. My blood went cold and I could feel my face drain of colour as I stood frozen in place.

The lecturer hadn't said anything about my late arrival but now looked mildly annoyed that I wasn't finding a seat. I gave a quick 'sorry' expression and quickly found a space since no matter what this meant, I still had a degree to avoid failing.

Focussing on the material was hard and half of the time I found my eyes flitting around the hall trying to guess who 'Jack' was. I recognised some people from other lecture modules but plenty were strangers and most of them were men. Not even like gender would even necessarily narrow it down - a woman called Jack would be strange but nowhere near as strange as a woman who hears "Jack is not here" in her head every time she enters a room.

Well, almost every time I guess. Every time up until today.

The lecture filed out and I heard 'Jack is not here' as I left the room. It was a reasonably long corridor and I heard 'Jack is here' again before I left the building but I couldn't see behind me clearly enough to see who it was. I guess I could have stayed near the corridor's exit to wait for the change in message but main brain was frazzled and there's more than one exit to that corridor anyway.

That was also the first time I'd heard the voice update me on whether or not Jack was present without me entering a room. Too much new weirdness. I had to regroup.

Back in my room I sat on my bed and considered what I knew. I knew that the voice would tell me if Jack was or wasn't in a room either when I entered or he did. It seemed a logical assumption that the voice would also update me if Jack left a room but I didn't. I knew Jack took introduction to Theoretical Physics and I knew a handful of people he wasn't. I knew Jack hadn't been any of the people who'd left the lecture before me, not that I could really remember them.

What I didn't know was who Jack was. Not only in the sense that I didn't know his age, gender, personality or star sign but also in the more general sense that I didn't know why I was told about Jack in the first place. Was he a threat? I'd assumed as much but really he could mean absolutely anything to me.

It seemed like my best course of action was to find him. Even if he *was* a threat, I had no intentions of quitting my degree and running away to safety so it'd be far better to recognise him. 

I went to a lot of events that week. I probably would have gone to some out of general interest anyway but instead every bar, society and club I went to I was checking off "Is Jack here? Is Jack here?" It went from scary to annoying and simply exhausting pretty quickly and so it wasn't particularly surprising that I wasn't exactly up bright and early that Sunday.

*Knock knock knock*

"Hey Jess, you up?" Amy's voice rang through my door.

"No." I replied. "But come in, I guess."

Amy came in and saw me half sat up in my bed.

"I thought we were headed down to the cinema together?"

Of course. There was a Film Appreciation club and it was yet another opportunity to find whoever Jack was.

"Right. Yeah, of course. Just give me a minute?"

We walked down to the cinema exchanging small talk as I tried to wake up. I walked into the screen-

*Jack is here.*

-but we were late and it was far too dark to see faces clearly. I sat down and tried to enjoy the film despite how tired and on edge I felt. After it finished the alert in my head changed-

*Jack is not here.*

-but I hadn't got a chance to see his face and there were too many people queuing up to leave for me to force my way past and try to catch up with him. The slow trickle of people out of the screen seemed to take forever and the second I left the screen two unexpected things happened. One was that I heard-

*Jack is here.*

that Jack was here even though I assumed he'd be long gone. But the other, far more alarming thing was that the second I left the screen I was yanked to the side by a nervous looking man.

"I'm not a creep, I'm really sorry about that." He said as he let go of my arm and held his hands in front of him in apology. "I wouldn't ever do something like that normally, it's just that I really have to know-

Are you Jess?"
