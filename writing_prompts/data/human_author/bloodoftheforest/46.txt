If it hadn't been for that moron stagehand then my plan would've been flawless.

I'd switched the fake knife that's used on Erica with a real one - simple but genius. I'd have plenty of time after my scenes to slink away into the audience to watch her die before finally disappearing into the night amid the chaos. Nobody here knows my real name so even if they figure out I did this, they just don't me. Perfect.

At least until the stagehand shoved our neat little piles of props to the end of the table to make room for a broken light. All of the outwardly identical knives were now in a jumbled pile and cast members took them at random before I'd even registered what had happened.

The victims of our play are Bob, Nellie, Pete, myself and Erica. In that order.

Bob survives his death and Nellie's performance is similarly dull. Pete stumbles back when he's killed and for a moment I think that one's for real but he leaps up when the curtain's down. I guess he's just clumsy.

Me or Erica then. Just like in the casting call that prompted all this.

I could admit what I'd done and save myself - but if I do that I'll never get near her again.

Knife goes in...

There's a gasp in the audience as someone sees all of the red and the poor guy who stabs me actually screams. 

It was sharp enough, in the end, even if it found the wrong victim. My blood continues to coat the stage as people desperately fumble for what to do.

Erica stole the role of a lifetime from me. But with a final grin I realise that today means I'll now be more famous than she ever dreamed.
