*Leave,* I begged silently, *please.*

When I'd started to run I'd been heading to the road but a glance over my shoulder had shown me that the lights had flicked on in the house. That, despite my best efforts, I'd woken them up. I might just have been able to reach the road before they caught up I certainly wouldn't get much further. And it isn't a busy enough route to ensure a car would find me.

The voices faded as they headed to the road. Of course they did, what kind of a moron would duck into this tiny boathouse? There was barely anywhere to hide and the boat itself was rotten. So I was left in the dark with the remnants of my teenaged years - a soggy deck of cards, a carefully stored bottle of vodka and a ouiji board that Matt had bought as a joke.

*It's not like I have any other options,* I thought as I gently placed the board upon the floor.

I'd been about to 'call upon the spirits' but the planchette jerked wildly before I could get a word out. 

W-h-a-t-d-o-y-o-u-w-a-n-t, it spelled.

"Help, please. They won't let me leave now that... I just can't them find me. I'd rather die."

I realised only when I said that how true it was. Death would be preferable. But the realisation made me sob so hard that I didn't hear the door open.

I was never implicated in the deaths that took place that night. How could I be, when the injuries maimed their insides didn't leave a trace anywhere externally? 

I should have feared what that spirit could do and yet for the rest of my life when I think of it I don't feel scared.

I feel protected.
