"Tell me where they are."

"No."

"Then you've sealed your own fate."

I shrugged and the static from the speaker disappeared. 

That was five days ago.

-----

"Tell me where they are." He commanded again and I fought the urge to smirk.

Of course he wasn't done with me. Of course he would keep talking to me, going over and over the same questions like picking at a scab. He needed to feel as though he'd 'won,' whether by getting the answers he wanted or killing me. Ideally both.

"No." I said, staring right at the camera now I'd figured out where it was.

"You fool. This chamber was built to handle people like you. Maybe the animal you're linked to gave you armoured skin, maybe it gave you fast reflexes or whatever. But I'm not some fool with a knife like you morons who call yourselves superheroes usually go up against, I'm-"

"I don't."

There was a pause.

"What?" He asked, equal parts confused and irritated.

"I don't call myself a superhero. In fact, I don't know anybody who does. That's just a newspaper thing. I don't call myself a superhero any more than you call yourself a supervillain."

"I'm not a-" he said before cutting himself off. "Anyway! My point was that this room can give you more than you can handle no matter what your power is. With just a press of a button I can fill the room with such fire that your blood will boil."

I shrugged and sat down on the middle of the floor.

"Okay."

Areas of the room were sectioned off by clear walls that I assume were meant to shield those areas from the heat, whilst still allowing the camera, speaker and microphone to function. Flames appeared in a square around me - small at first but quickly roaring into their full forms. I didn't move and stared at the camera until the heat disappeared.

That was four days ago.

-----

I heard the subtle tell of the speaker being clicked on.

"You know, most desert animals can't survive cold temperatures without some form of shelter. There are systems I can use to make this room colder. Much colder. So tell me where they are."

I didn't react.

"I'm not a supervillain. I'm not one of you freaks. I'm a decent, complete human."

I sighed.

"You are neither decent nor complete. And you have used your resources to cause untold suffering. Supervillains don't need powers, read a damned comic book."

"You won't be so smart after the cold." He replied and the walls came back up.

A series of zig zags on the floor began to look almost as if they were smoking and then steadily became coated with frost. I lay down unconcernedly and waited for it to be over.

That was three days ago.

-----

"Everything needs air." The speakers said.

"Ok." 

"Even if you bonded with a sea creature you still need oxygen. The fact that your animal might breathe in water doesn't mean they don't breathe at all."

I didn't say anything.

"Tell me where they are."

"No."

"Then die."

I heard a whirring and felt the pressure change. Pulling the air out, perhaps? Either way, by the time the whirring stopped it had not left a complete vacuum but probably a drastically lower amount of oxygen than had been available to me previously.

He didn't actually want me to die anymore, that alone wasn't enough. He needed me to give in, to explain my mysteries and to suffer.

That was two days ago.

-----

Yesterday he didn't talk to me at all. The air was back but there was no new attempt at torture, there wasn't even a new demand I tell him where my superpowered colleagues were based. Just nothing.

Which brings us up to today.

-----

He stormed into my cell and I smiled at him serenely.

"Tell me where they are and tell me what you are!" He yelled.

He was pointing a gun at me and the door had locked behind him.

"If you come any closer to me I'll shoot your fucking head off." He said though I hadn't even moved.

"You've been focusing on all of the wrong things." I told him and those extra walls sectioned off areas of the cell.

I mentioned earlier that those walls were probably to protect the camera, speaker and microphone but I should probably also have mentioned that they section off the door and its internal lock. He spun around in alarm but I kept talking.

"You focussed on us 'superheroes' because in your arrogance you assumed that we were the only people who can defeat you. But whilst I do indeed have powers I was never meant to do this alone."

I bit his wrist suddenly and the pain made him drop his gun. I kicked it away and held him tightly, unsure of just how long the technician would need.

"You said fire was just a button press away but who has access to that button, now you're away? You really weren't very selective with who could incinerate people you've imprisoned, were you?"

As the nozzles began to flame he fought against me but even though I am not super strong, I didn't need to be. Even in his panic it took considerably less than superpowers to restrain him.

"It's the same with me. You assumed I must have come here to kill you but I merely had to *outlast* you. We all knew that in your hubris you'd walk right into your own trap."

He was too weak to struggle now and I let go of him as he sank to the floor.

"What did you bond with?"

I decided to tell him, to mercifully grant the final wish of a dying monster. To tell him I'd bonded with something that he wouldn't even class as an animal at all.

"Tardigrade."
