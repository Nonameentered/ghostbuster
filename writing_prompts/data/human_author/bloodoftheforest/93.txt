When Earth found out about the asteroid that was headed towards it, it responded in ways just as shitty and amazing as you might expect. Those with fortunes bought tickets to the safe side and those with airlines who could take thousands across every single day for free instead sold tickets to the highest bidder. On the other end of things though, there was a coordinated scientific effort that was truly unprecedented in human history. No scientific discipline was truly irrelevant - from the astronomers calculating the asteroid's entry point to the biologists trying to figure out which plants and animals would survive where once climates and environments had shifted.

Everyone chose their side, or had the choice made for them. The scientists that the new world wouldn't be able to live without, they were sent to the safe side. Those without masses of inherent value but with enough power and funds to buy their way across settled there too. Whilst flights were exorbitant for anyone not deemed to be of immediately vital value some managed to make the trip across using other means.

A much smaller exodus took place from the safe side to the not so safe side, but it still happened. Planes that brought people to safety still had to make the return trip after all and these tickets were not so expensive. As the meteorite would cause enough havoc that even the safe side of the globe would suffer some ill effects, some people left because they were afraid they'd be a liability to their families. Some left to be *with* their families, those with jobs that had them on the safe side but felt a few months with their families was better than a lifetime without. Finally, some people left because they didn't think they'd be able to cope with the new world and so instead decided to go out with a bang.

All of these decisions were made with some kind of sense to them - not a fair kind of sense, but a sense nonetheless. Until the initial prediction turned out to be wrong.

There was no reversing the decisions at that point. Our moon had been hit, which was expected, and the fragments from its surface had entered the atmosphere and caused conditions which made flight impossible, which was also expected. However, the angle and deceleration was all off - likely the result of the meteorite not being composed of exactly the substances scientists expected.

To say 'chaos ensued' would undersell the events in both magnitude and pointlessness. People tried to leave the now-unsafe side despite having been told again and again that it was futile. People who had given everything for their own safety suddenly didn't even have that. The scientific minds who were judged to be the most valuable were suddenly sending what information they could to their less valuable colleagues.

That was, of course, all on the previously-safe side.

On our side, a reaction of numb disbelief was as common as joy. Barely anyone here had wanted to die but a lot of us had come to terms with it. We hadn't planned for life. When I awoke one morning, the day before the asteroid had truly hit, the house was strangely quiet. 

I walked downstairs and found my sister sat in the living room with her laptop. Like me, Emma had moved home so we could be with our family towards the end. She was scouring the internet for information that we might need once we had no power - scribbling some things in a notebook and printing others. Emma didn't seem happy about the news we weren't personally doomed exactly, but she seemed incredibly *focussed.*

"Where's Mum?" I asked.

Emma didn't even look up.

"At the bottom of the road."

As there wasn't really anything at the bottom of our road I didn't fully understand but I left Emma to it. I walked down to find Mum and sure enough, she was at the bottom of the road. There was a plot of land there that had no particular use and certainly didn't belong to us and there she was, digging away at the ground with clawed gardening gloves only intended for use with her indoor herb garden. She had at some point made a sign saying "Community Food Garden."

"What are you doing?" I asked her as she waved at me merrily.

"Planting." Mum told me and gestured to the plate of kitchen scraps next to her.

"I.. I don't know if this will work. I don't think that this is the best location and some vegetables have seeds that do nothing so they can sell more and-"

"I know that. I understand that this might fail." She said, putting one soil covered, clawed hand on my shoulder. "And I'm glad that you're trying to protect me from disappointment. But Amy, what if something might grow?"

The idea that some parts of our new life - *any* parts of our new life - might be okay hit me like a freight train and I found myself starting to cry. I'd been prepared for death and then for everything to be terrible but I hadn't been prepared for gardens or for my family to cope in strange, unexpected ways.

We planted seeds until darkness fell and my nails were black with dirt.
