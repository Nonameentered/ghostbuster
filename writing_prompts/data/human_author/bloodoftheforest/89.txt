"We're lost, aren't we?" Dan exhales.

I can sense where we're supposed to be but I've just been driving around in circles.

"It feels like it's right here..." i murmur and then sharply pull the car over. "I'm going to check my messages."

My husband and I are professional nobodies. Basically anytime there is a character that a story could not progress without but isn't actually given a backstory - maybe isn't even bothered to be named - at least one of us is there. And whilst it's always nice to be on the job together I curse my luck that the one time I get lost it happens to be on one of the reasonably few assignments we are on together that I manage to get lost. I whip out my phone and check my emails to see where in the hell in suburbia our date with a gangland shootout is meant to be.

"That kid looks weird." Dan says as I continue to tap away at my phone. "Not physically necessarily, I just think he looks... conspicuous. What's he even doing just stood in a garden anyw-"

"Oh no." I whisper.

After a moment with no elaboration Dan turns away from the child and looks at me.

"What do you mean 'oh no' ? You can't just say 'oh no' and then not tell me what you're saying it about!"

I put my phone away and think how best to approach this. A teenage girl's voice is yelling something in a nearby house but aside from that the cul de sac is almost eerily quiet.

"So," I say, "the good news is that the shoot out is our next assignment, so that's going to be such fun! That's how I got lost, my senses told me I need to be here but I'd opened the wrong email. And the other good news is that we only have, like, ten more assignments until we're due a promotion. Minor villains! Sidekicks! Friends and family of main characters!"

"Baby, your sudden positivity is not filling me with limitless optimism. What is it? Is it a horror?" Dan nods to himself and continues before I have time to correct him. "I think I could handle a horror. I mean, I've likely been through worse."

"It's not a horror. It's a fantasy." I mutter. 

"Huh? Well that's fine! I know I said fantasy isn't my favourite but-"

"About an all powerful witch." I continue. "Written by a thirteen year old. Who cast herself as the main character."

Dan's previous relief shattered instantly.

"Oh *hell* no! I'm not doing it."

"Dan, if we refuse an assignment we'll have to do a hundred more to compensate. This can't be that painful."

Dan sighs melodramatically.

"What do we even have to do?" He asks

"We try to kidnap that kid, who is her brother, and she wants so much to keep him safe that her powers manifest."

"Why do we kidn-"

"For no reason. Literally no reason is ever given to a single character why we are kidnapping someone." I say through gritted teeth.

We sit in silence for a moment.

"Do we still need the guns?" Dan asks.

"No."

"Could we bring them anyway to put this story out of it's misery?"

I grin but shake my head.

"No."

We pause for just a moment longer, dragging out turning up to this job more than getting bitten by zombies, being shot or even being turned into a tree. Finally we nod at each other and get out. I take the kid's feet, Dan grabs the shoulders and finally over the sound of the kid yelling I hear:

"UNHAND MY BROTHER!"

I see Dan roll his eyes and then we are both knocked into the air in a vivid, multicoloured blast.

Mondays, am I right?
