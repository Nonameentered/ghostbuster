There is a secret to immortality, it's just not an immortality that any of us would want. We cannot kill them, so we send them to the desert. Drop them in the middle of it - literally drop them straight from the sky. They fall down, they smash open, and yet they live. They heal.

Sinners may die, but sins are forever.

I wanted to research them. My department deals with all kinds of wonders and monsters that'd shake the regular world to its sleepy core but I wanted to research the sins. Things that used to be human a long time ago but got corrupted and stronger. Things that could, if our records are accurate, in very rare circumstances change back to being human. Redemption in its most extreme form.

Perhaps it was the idea that some of them could now be humans that appealed to me. Perhaps it was the opposite, that I wanted to see the worst things a human could possibly be. Either way I only regretted my decision for a moment, the moment before I leapt out of a helicopter down to their territory.

I got a parachute, of course. But beyond that and the crate of supplies that was waiting for me on the ground there was little difference between my descent and that of the sins themselves.

I walked to the crate and listened to the fading sound of the helicopter as it flew away. There was no set meeting place or time, it would come back only when I radioed that I was done and it was safe to collect me. Or only *if* I was done and safe, as my supervisor had phrased it.

Dick.

And wrath sin would murder me pretty much as soon as it saw me. I had a gun but the absolute best case scenario here is that I slow it down. I don't know where I would hide. So basically I had to hope never to see a wrath sin or at least to see it before it saw me.

The first sin I saw was gluttony. 

The thing was obese beyond any human could ever be, its body more akin to some kind of grub than its original form. The exception were the arms which were now long, skeletal things with too many joints which were constantly feeding the creature. I approached as quietly as I could to see a handful of sand shoved into its gaping maw. Its mouth was bloodied by whatever it had been cramming in there and there were open wounds on its torso. I wondered if it had gotten into a fight and recorded the being silently.

I found out the cause of those wounds moments later when one skeletal, clawed hand suddenly forced itself through the stomach's skin. Bloodied flesh was extracted and pulled up to a waiting mouth and I tensed up as I tried not to retch. The eyes of the face didn't seem to register anything. Not pain or disgust but not pleasure either. Whatever human this used to be, this was their life now.

After a few more minutes of filming I backed away, determined to find others. I would find them all, eventually, but the next one I saw was pride.

Pride was sat naked in the middle of what looked like a mandala or some kind of summoning circle drawn into the sand. When I was some distance away I had been surprised at how human pride seemed but I didn't have to get much closer to see that pride had been mutated by her own sin too. In this case, extra eyes had grown on the front and backs of her hands. She moved them constantly and elegantly, gazing at herself with unconcealed wonder.

Then, she saw me. She saw me with several of her eyes and she smiled. Her long, delicate fingers beckoned me to come closer and her sharp, claw like nails reminded me how dangerous it would be to do so.

Obviously, I approached her. My camera still recording, I walked towards her. When I got close enough, I panned my camera around the elaborate mandala she'd constructed. Most of it was just lines in the sand but some patterns were formed by blood, other features accentuated by rocks. Desert roses, those hunks of selenite that have been whipped into beautiful rose shapes by sandstorms, had been placed at regular intervals. 

I found myself oddly in awe of her - finding these rocks would have been task enough in itself but it was incredibly likely that some of these rocks had been broken apart and we sure as hell hadn't given the sins tools when we'd dropped them off. A lot of us preach self love but who amongst us is so enamoured with themselves that they would form elaborate patterns in self worship and tear at rock with nails or teeth to create appropriate art for that worship?

"And let it be known that I alone brought us to our great destiny." The pride sin said, apparently to nobody.

She looked at me with one or two of her six eyes at all times but the others were focussed on herself. Her head was tilted downwards and her hands moved so either the eyes of her palm faces her or the eyes on the backs of her hands. 

"Tell me child, why do you believe you have come here?" She asked me.

I hadn't really anticipated being asked a question by any of the sins but nonetheless I answered.

"I'm here to record you. For research purposes."

Her face had already shown a slight smile but at this the smile got wider.

"And let it be known that the eighth sin did come and bring us our freedom!" She announced loudly and I heard sounds from behind me.

I kept hold of the camera in one hand but fumbled for my gun with the other.

"What's the eighth sin?" I asked.

For the only time, pride turned an entire four of her six eyes towards me.

"Why you are, of course."

She pounced. I shot but I still hadn't let go of the camera and so not only did the shot miss wildly but the kickback ripped the gun from my hand. She held me still at first but then other beings approached from behind to hold me in place. Strange limbs twisted around my own and I began to sob.

"What's the eighth sin?!!" I screamed and a horrible part of me realised that I wanted the answer almost as much as I wanted to leave.

"Let me show you." Pride said in response, tearing away at my top layer of clothing.

Pride's nails clawed through the skin of my chest and then she used a sharp rock to get deeper. At first I felt agony like no other but then, slowly, I felt no pain at all. My lips were constantly asking what the eighth sin was and when my rib cage was snapped open I heard it rather than felt it.

"The eighth sin is foolishness." Pride whispered. "You came here, on purpose, to a land of vicious immortals. You came to study murderers so perfect in human life that they killed hundreds before caught who then mutated to a wrath beyond any humanity. To study those so greedy that they would take out your every bone merely to collect them. To study a being as powerful and perfect as me."

I didn't believe what I was hearing. I refused to believe I was in the same category as any of these creatures.

"Your sin is foolishness, and you shall set us free." Pride said and she held something in her hand in front of me.

The realisation that pride held my own heart clunked into place and it was then and only then that I finally believed her.
