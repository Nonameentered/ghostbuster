Victor had made sure I didn't know anybody when he moved us here and the house is so isolated that there were no neighbours I could try to befriend. Because of this, I was alarmed to hear a knock at my door.

"I wanted to check you were still okay." Medusa said once I had invited her in. "Was this house just for you and him?"

"It was. And yes, I am okay. Thank you. I'm sorry I intruded on you last night. Thank you for... for what you did."

"I didn't do that on purpose. It happens to everyone around me."

I frowned in confusion and she clarified.

"Everyone who can see me."

I took this in.

"Well, you still helped me when I needed it. You're a very kind woman."

"I'm not kind." The woman protested and the strange hissy-breathing intensified. "I'm not even a woman."

"A kind witch, then."

Medusa snorted.

"Witches are just women who sling blessings and curses. I myself am a curse. I've been cursed and now I'm a curse to everyone who sees me."

I touched her hand softly.

"Well, to me you're a blessing."

I slept better that night after Medusa had left and the next morning I woke with great purpose. It occurred to me that when Medusa had come into my house she had seen so many things that belonged to Victor and that wasn't part of my life anymore. Maybe she even smelled him, I could catch his scent in some places. I dug a small hole outside and got to work throwing away the things of his that I hated. The boots that smelled strange. His favourite cup. I was going to throw out his shirt before realising that I liked that shirt, I liked the way it felt. I could keep some of his things.

I strolled into the kitchen and rummaged through the cupboards. This was the room where I felt most at peace. He insisted I cook and barely entered the room so it had always been the closest thing to my own space. Today I poured herbs into a pan with boiling water until they filled the air with sweet scents. I carried the pan around the whole house, making it smell less like the past and more like hope and cloves. Finally I shoved the shirt into it, forever getting rid of any trace of the man I knew on its fibres.

When Medusa visited again after the sunset I wasn't surprised. I made her tea and asked her why she had come.

"I need to know that you won't tell anyone about me. For their safety as well as my own."

I shrugged.

"Medusa, I have nobody to tell."

She sighed.

"But won't you leave now he's gone? Or do you want to be alone?"

I hadn't had someone ask what I wanted in a very long time and it confused me.

"I don't- I..." I shook my head. "Whatever happens, I won't tell anyone."

Medusa came around the next few nights, always with an excuse. She had gathered too many fruits when foraging and needed to share. A storm was coming and my house kept the wind out better than wherever specifically she lived. Her wine would turn to vinegar if we didn't drink it soon.

Finally, she came to my house with the truth.

"I like being with you." She admitted. "I like not being alone. But you don't understand what I am."

"Then tell me."

She brought my hands to her face, her beautiful face, and gently guided them higher to her hair.

Snakes. Actual, moving snakes attached to her head and yet somehow moving. The sounds I had attributed to her strange breathing had been from this all along.

I recoiled sharply and then gently moved my hands back.

"Do they bite?" I asked as I gently touched one of them.

She laughed.

"They're part of me. They don't bite without my knowing anymore than my hand would strike or my foot would kick."

Victor had been a short, handsome man without much fat or muscle yet he had been cruel beyond words. And now here I was sat next to a literal monster and she had shown me nothing but kindness.

"I understand that this changes things." Medusa told me but she was quite completely wrong.

"Stay." I told her, and that was the first night that she didn't leave.

Medusa didn't stay every night for the next couple of weeks but she stayed for a few. She told me of the area around the house in such detail that it was as if I had a map drawn out in my own mind. She brought me herbs from the woods that I would have struggled to identify and I made her meals from the vegetables on our plot of land. Finally, she asked a question that seemed to have been burdening her for some time.

"Are you going to leave? This house is lovely but it's isolated and lonely. Have you decided if you want to be alone?"

I shook my head with certainty.

"I'm not leaving but I don't want to be alone here."

Medusa sighed.

"If you bring someone to see you then I can't visit anymore. I would love to but everyone I meet turns to stone and you would be alone again in an instant."

"Medusa," I said softly as I took her hand, "I want to stay here with you."

She stroked my hand gently and I could hear her hair move nervously.

"It would only be us two, hidden away forever. If you have me then you would never be able to safely bring anyone back to your own home. You deserve more."

I pulled myself closer towards her and rested my head upon her shoulders.

"Nonsense. I've been isolated here with a man who was cruel to me and hated every second. But since I have met you, you have given me kindness that I've never known before. You have given me strength and freedom even though that could have meant never talking to anyone again and I could never be trapped with you because there would never be anywhere else I'd rather be.

If you'd have me, Medusa, I would be honoured to be hidden away with the woman I love."
