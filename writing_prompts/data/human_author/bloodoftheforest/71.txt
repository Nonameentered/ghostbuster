"Hey Chris, what's going on here?" I asked my coworker as I heard the door close behind me.

"What? I'm not late, that clock's wrong."

*Yes you are and no it isn't.*

"No, I mean this." I clarified, pointing at the screen in front of me. "Cell 48."

Chris chuckled.

"What, you've been here for two weeks and you still don't know about 48? I thought you were meant to be really on the ball. *Everyone* knows about cell 48."

Chris's patronising tone went through me like nails on a chalkboard. If I did my job better than him, I was acting too up myself. If I did it worse than he did, then I wasn't fit to be a guard. Between being a hard worker but new to the role I could never seem to win and I don't think there's been a single conversation we've had where Chris hasn't been either a patronising git or downright hostile.

"Well, there are a lot of people here. I've done my best to learn as much as I can about as many of the prisoners as I can but I hadn't gotten around to him yet. The only reason I looked at his record today was because he's been released in two days. It says that his sentence is two *hundred* years, how crazy is that? What a weird typo, do you think-"

"What did you say?" Chris interjected suddenly.

I suppressed a sigh. Chris interrupting me was the least of our issues together and showing my annoyance would only do more harm than good.

"Two hundred years."

"No, I know that. Everyone knows that. When did you say he was due for release?"

"The day after tomorrow. Why?" I asked as I turned to see Chris frantically leafing through sheets on the notice board.

"Who's processing that day, who's processing that day..." Chris muttered to himself, sounding far too nervous and looking slightly pale.

"It's us." I said quietly. "Chris, who is he?"

Instead of answering my question, Chris stormed out through the door.

----

Chris was gone for a while and whilst I only overheard one conversation, I can imagine the rest of his time was spent repeating a variation of it. I heard him telling Jack that he'd just realised he'd booked an important appointment the day after tomorrow and could they switch shifts so he'd be out in time? That Chris didn't want to do this switch officially so he didn't even care that this would mean Jack would suddenly have a shift two hours shorter and vice versa. To my surprise, Jack laughed in his face and didn't consider it for a moment.

"You think I haven't seen who's being processed out that day? No way, you keep your quality time with 48 and I'll keep my sweet, sweet extra hours."

Defeated, Chris finally returned.

"I don't understand." I said finally.

I think my biggest hint that something really concerning was going on was when he didn't even mock me for this.

"Chris, who's in cell 48? The dates in the length of sentence and date first imprisoned match up so if it's a typo someone decided to change the other to match rather than fix it. We don't have an official name for him - it just says 'unconfirmed' and the box for 'reason for imprisonment' is just *blank.* I didn't even know that box could be blank. What do you know about him?"

"Nothing." Chris answered dully. "None of us know anything about him. But everyone who works here has a bad feeling about him."

I raised my eyebrow slightly and Chris gave a single, hollow bark of a laugh.

"Sure, you think having a feeling about something is stupid. But it's not just the guards. 48 never says anything but nobody has ever tried to get in a fight with him or pick on him or so much as make fun of his hair. Once Jim from 53 knocked his lunch to the floor and *Jim* apologised to *48.*"

"So you think maybe he's violent?"

"Nobody's ever seen him throw a single punch. Not the whole time I've been here or the guys who worked here before me. And not like maybe we sort of saw something but we decided not to look to closely to save ourselves the paperwork - nobody has ever seen or heard 48 do anything to even slightly provoke anyone else but every other inmate here is scared stiff of him."

I chose to ignore the confession of negligence for now.

"Well, if he's not done anything so far then we have no reason to believe he will when he leaves, right? Everything will probably be fine."

-----

The shift in question finally rolled around. Chris looked pale as a ghost and kept rubbing the side of his head so vigorously that I occasionally saw hairs fall loose. I myself had been biting my nails for the past day, a habit I hadn't had since being a child. I'd completed the relevant forms and Chris for his part went to grab 48's possessions.

"This is bad." Chris said, rubbing his head so hard it looked painful. "Look."

48's only possession in our storage was a doll so old looking that I could believe we'd had it for centuries.

"It's probably his daughter's or something. It's fine. You're fine."

Chris nodded whilst still looking unnerved as hell. I probably looked no better. We went to collect 48.

----

48 didn't look pleased to be leaving, but he didn't look anything. His icy eyes betrayed no emotion as we spoke to him. His expression only changed when I slid across the tray containing his doll. 48 looked at it curiously and at first I thought that he was examining the doll itself but then he lifted a hair from it. One of Chris's hairs from the looks of it. Then, instead of flicking the hair to the floor 48 chose to place the hair back onto his doll and picked it up.

Nearly done. Chris opened the door for 48, the last door that required our keycards between here and the exit. 48 walked through the door and smiled at Chris.

*Crunch.*

Chris fell to the floor with his neck at an angle that humans don't live through. An angle that I hadn't thought even a dead man's neck could actually make.

"Wh-what did you do?"

I hadn't seen 48 touch Chris, had I? I must have, but I could swear that hadn't even been standing very close together.

"Why don't the records say why you're here?"

48 spoke and his voice sounded strange. Hoarse and brittle but still almost melodic.

"That crime, it does not exist in your life time."

*What crimes could he have done that no longer exist?*

He continued to walk away. I could've just let him leave. I shouldn't have asked anything else, I should have just believed that what happened was a normal, if violent, attack. I could've told myself I'd been in shock.

"What crime?"

48 turned back to me and grinned as though the entire situation was delicious and perfect. When people say that their blood ran cold I never knew how literal that can be until that moment.

"Witchcraft."

With that 48 finally left our prison and I screamed. I screamed and sobbed until the other guards came to find me.

And the guards feared 48 too much to come to me quickly.
