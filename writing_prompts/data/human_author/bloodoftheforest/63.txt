A lot of great scientific discoveries over the decades have been triggered by curiosity, love and hope for a better future but I really think that we as a society downplay the role that spite has had in scientific discovery. The rivalry between Edison and Tesla spurred both on to greater genius than they'd have achieved without it and I probably never would have invented anything in my life if it wasn't for Jeffrey White.

I was an entomologist by training and I couldn't believe my luck when during some standard research on the European spruce bark beetle I appeared to have found a brand new beetle species. When I returned to the lab I brought back not only the hundred or so samples of spruce bark beetle but also the one singular 'new' beetle I'd found. Yet it turned out that my beetle was just suffering from a relatively uncommon affliction. Was I angry? No. Disappointed, sure, but not *angry.*

That was until I found out that one of the lab techs who had thought one of my spruce bark beetles looked 'kinda weird' had submitted it to additional testing and had found out that it was a new species entirely. And that to him that all credit to this discovery went. Not to me, the woman who had earned a PhD in entomology and had spent over a month gathering data and samples in Białowieża Forest. Not even to the other tech who had run the battery of tests which proved it to be a new species. 

No, all credit went to the useless lab tech who barely scraped a science degree in a decidedly substandard university and lucked into his job in the first place. To the layabout who was known in the lab for finding any excuse to avoid work. To the aggravating, lazy, lucky bastard whose one single request gave him credit for a whole species.

To Jeffrey *fucking* White.

Fuelled by rage over this turn of events I changed my focus of research quickly from forest beetles and their role in ecosystems to how we could more easily detect insect species. Years into my research I began work on a rudimentary prototype of the device I now hold in my hands and came to the shocking conclusion that the readings which would allow this device to correctly identify an insect species would work for any species. Not only that but I could see potential further tweaks that could allow it to show the full taxonomy of a scanned organism and even what other species it could breed with.

I am mostly left to my own devices in the lab. I publish enough papers to make the department happy and I have given them vague, hopeful updates on my main project. They know, for example, that I had ideas on a device that could potentially scan new organisms. They have no idea whatsoever that I've built it and even less idea that I've sneaked it out of the lab.

My fingers tap nervously on the side of the device. I prepare to scan myself when Bast walks into the room. Well, I suppose that she is a far more fitting test subject than I am. If this device is even slightly successful then I will go down in history - if she is my first subject then perhaps she'll join me.

I type 'cat' into the 'suspected species' box, a feature I added once I realised that adding what species you think you're looking at massively decreases the time and energy the system needs, and I scan her. The scan itself is instant but processing the data takes a little time. Every one of my muscles is tensed. Finally, the results show.

*Suspected species - cat*
*0% match*
*Species analysed (loading...)*

I cry out in frustration and punch my sofa. As I sit, cradling my sore hand, the device finishes it's analysis.

*Species analysed - unregistered species*

"Unregistered species? *Seriously?!* It's a cat!" I yell.

Then I realise that despite my outburst, Bast has remained perfectly still. More still than I've ever seen her. And then I hear something. Not through my ears but in the same way you feel as though you can hear a memory.

"*You weren't supposed to know about me.*"

Bast shimmers and flickers as if she isn't there at all. All at once, I am afraid.

"*This device should not exist.*"

The shape which was once a cat elongates and the edges are unclear. They are not blurred, exactly, it is just that if I try to ascertain where the creature begins or ends my head simply pounds and swirls. It could be the size of a horse or larger right now and I'd be none the wiser.

"*We cannot allow existence of a device which could find us.*" the creature says and my device is suddenly stabbed with a limb that I can barely see.

I fight the urge to vomit and stand up ready to run. But it's too little too late. The creature, the form, the *being* is between the door and myself

"*We cannot allow existence of the human that made it.*"

I am stabbed and though there is pain, it is perhaps not as much as I would have predicted. The thing which has ended me folds back into itself to form Bast once again.

I fall to the sofa and then slowly sink to the floor. My gaze lands on my ruined device and I remember all of the times I talked to Bast about my plans. She knew that I was uncertain my device would work and that I told my colleagues so little that there is no way they would be able to replicate it.

Bast looks at the device for a moment and then pads softly over to me. I wonder what exactly it was that she really was. The blood loss has already weakened me and I don't try to move away. When I look at her I don't see the monstrous thing which killed me but the sweet tabby I have known and loved for years.

I fade in and out of consciousness and though I know I am near death, I do not panic. I can feel Bast's soft fur against my twitching palm and I wonder if my sense of calm is in some way caused by whatever it is that she really was. If she remembers my kindness to her as a cat and has chosen to show what little mercy she can to a threat which she could not allow to live.

I have spent my whole life working to achieve something but my greatest accomplishment will never be recognised. Yet as I lie dying I am allowed to feel pride in my work and, for the first time, a great feeling of peace.

Whatever Bast is, she is dangerous.

Yet, in some ways, she is merciful.
