"Maybe it's just hopeless." I said shakily.

Erin shook her head vehemently at the very suggestion, gnawing on her lip hard enough to draw blood. She drew some matches to light the candle by her mirror but I held her wrist still.

"You've tried that. It's okay." I told her quietly.

If you'd asked either of our parents what we were doing, they'd have thought it was just a normal sleepover filled with silly, petty gossip. Instead we were both desperately trying to come up with some way that I wouldn't have to die.

The latest anyone has ever manifested their gift is seventeen years and six months. To give a small margin for error, proof of gift is only demanded at age eighteen. Fail to come up with anything and it's lights out, time to go, don't let the door hit you on the way out. Come up with something evil and there's a decent chance they'll shoot you where you stand.

I'm seventeen now and I imagine my parents are starting to get worried but if they knew the truth. Having no gift would be bad but the one I got? Literally the worst one out there. Considered evil by pretty much everyone in the world.

Erin doesn't think I'm evil. Her gift is not considered evil but it's one of the very few that people see as in between. Prophecy is just too damned useful to be considered evil but when it comes down to it, people hate the idea that they can be predicted. When her gift developed she was instantly shunned and since I have been pretending my gift hasn't surfaced for six years now we got to be weirdos together. 

She'd been trying to trigger a vision of a future where I get out of this and it hadn't been going well. As with most prophets, her gift is erratic. Some environments, like dark rooms barely lit by candlelight, can help but it's never guaranteed. And even then, it's extremely difficult to get a specific request answered.

"Maybe if I just focus harder-" Erin began but I cut her off sharply.

"No. Look, we tried. We've come up with a couple of ideas and then a quick Google revealed that genius plans such as 'very late healer' have already been covered. Prophets like you are tested for the weird eye thing you do-" Erin frowned at this and glanced away self consciously, "and just saying I have no gift would only delay my death by a day or two whilst they filed the paperwork. Fuck it. If this is my fate then you know what Erin, we're gonna celebrate it."

I started to shove my boots on and Erin copied even before she asked where we were going.

"Out. Bring weed. Vodka. Whatever you've got."

Aside from some occasional drinking and the odd joint that her parents don't know about, Erin is pretty much a stereotypical good girl. That she crept downstairs and returned with a bottle of nice looking gin was surprising but it was the first nice surprise of the night so I was happy to take it. We wrapped up warm and headed out.


"This is what you meant by celebrate it?" 

I guess maybe Erin had thought we were headed to a nightclub instead of a graveyard.

"What can I say, I thought that my best friend should join the party. My *other* best friend." I added quickly.

Necromancy returns your body to the state it was moments before death. A fly smushed into goo will go back to being a fly. A cremated best friend will go back to being a best friend. At least it meant we didn't have to dig too long to get to the urn.

"You sure about this?" Erin asked and I nodded.

Maybe she was just nervous, she'd never actually seen it happen after all. We poured the ashes onto the ground and I focussed but honestly, it's never been that hard for me. Perverting the balance of life and death should take more effort, right? Erin can make herself physically sick with too many visions and nosebleeds are common but for me, I might as well be lifting a pencil.

"Nathan!" Erin yelled with delight as I shushed her. We were trespassing after all.

Nathan took in his surroundings, remembered the accident and whistled between his teeth.

"So, I guess I should have picked 'truth'?" He asked and I found myself laughing despite myself.

"It's almost as if going through with drunken dares is never a good idea. If I'd have been there, I... I should've been there."

Nathan hugged me and I gingerly offered him a joint with fingers covered in soil. He took it without a moment's hesitation.

"Who the fuck brought me back then?" Nathan said but his eyes were only on me. Erin had been a prophet for years now, long before his death. Whereas I'd shown him no gift and well, we were the only ones here.

"Guilty. This is a last party before I join you down in the ground." I said with a sombre smile.

Nathan blew out smoke whilst Erin continued to look at him, amazed that our friend was back among us.

"No." Nathan said. "Unacceptable, that simply won't do."

Erin sighed.

"We've tried. We've really, really tried."

"Well, you didn't have me before." Nathan retorted.

"I don't think there's anything you can think of that we haven't. We've tried our best but-"

"You don't understand." Nathan interrupted. "I'm not talking about ideas. I'm saying that you didn't physically have me here before."

I rubbed the bridge of my nose and took another swig of the gin.

"How exactly is proof of my crimes meant to help me out in this situation? I feel like maybe it does the opposite of help."

"Telekinesis isn't on the banned list."

I shrugged at Nathan, still not following.

"I'm not telekinetic."

He grinned at me with a smile I'd missed far too much.

"How'd you feel about changing that?"

In a flash he was gone. I'd already known his power was invisibility, a perfect fit for a habitual troublemaker, but his plan had taken me far too long to fall into place. The bottle was pulled from my hand and waved around in the air.

"Nooooo... Halllllliiiiieee... stop using your mind powers on this vodka!!!" A disembodied voice said.

"Yeah, thanks, I get it." I said as Nathan flicked back to being visible. "And anyway, it's not vodka it's gin."

Nathan pulled an exaggerated face of disgust.

"You brought me back to life for *gin*? Maybe keeping you alive isn't such a good idea."

Erin stole my lighter and barrelled to a quieter corner of the cemetery, turning back briefly.

"I'm going to try the vision thing again. But I really think that if he can keep his mouth shut then this could actually work!"

Nathan handed me the joint and took a swig of the gin he'd claimed to be so disgusted by. We sat on the ground above the more well-behaved dead and I dealt with the idea that I might through this after all.

"Good to have you back, Nate."
