There is a condition called prosopagnosia which is characterised by some level of inability to recognise faces. Until last year I'd thought that surely the worst things that this condition could do to me had passed. I've arrived to second, third and fourth dates without recognising the person who joined me. I've totally failed to acknowledge a boss who I'd already met in an interview on my first day on a job. I recognise family and eventually my stupid brain manages to store new important faces but it takes an embarassingly long time.

Last October things like that quickly became the least of my concerns.

My friend Melody was one of the first people who went missing. I'd known her since childhood and we complemented each other in a number of ways. One of them was that whilst I can barely remember any faces she has near-perfect recall. She'd tell me what colour shirt the boy who'd flirted with me yesterday was wearing so I could pick him out or tell me the name of the person who'd just enthusiastically greeted me at a bar was.

As our lives progressed, Melody ended up having to go to an NA meeting. The specifics don't matter here but what is relevant was that I knew about it and that I decided to check up on her after.

"How did it go?" I asked.

The phone line was silent for a moment. There was a sigh.

"I don't know if I can go back."

I didn't know what to say. I knew it was hard but I hadn't been through anything similar enough to *understand.* I tried to think of something encouraging to say before she spoke up.

"Kit, they aren't human."

She texted me an image, though she must have realised how unlikely I of all people was to be able to judge it. To this day I don't know if she sent that blurry photo to anyone else. Would it have been enough, that picture? Could someone else have felt the same if they'd only seen it? Could someone have gotten her out?

"Do you think I'm crazy?"

I shook my head, even though she couldn't see me.

"Of course not. I think it's just the stress of it all. You can stick with it though, I know you can. I love you."

Two weeks later Melody was gone.

Whilst I was alarmed by Melody's disappearance I had initially assumed that something had gone wrong and she'd ended up in some kind of intense rehab where they didn't allow phones. We didn't have any mutual friends anymore and she had deleted all of her social media years ago. I didn't have any kind of contact details for her family. I knew that rehab wasn't a possibility that had been entirely taken off the table for her and after what she'd said I thought it might be for the best.

Then other people started saying similar things. 

There was a wave of 'delusions' and people claimed that their new therapist wasn't human, or their new doctor, church group or even boss wasn't human. Tiktok was blamed until it was clear that young people were no more prone to this than anyone else and so news shifted to calling it some sort of mass hysteria, maybe even a symptom of a plague.

Eventually, too many people went missing to be ignored. More and more unhumans were sighted in larger and larger groups. Sometimes they even tried to imitate people that used to exist - pretending to be a coworker who had vanished last week. 

Almost everyone could recognise them but not for any one specific feature. All they knew was that these people looked 'wrong' and that in itself was cruelly difficult to unpick from mere paranoia.

It goes without saying that I couldn't recognise a single one of them.

I can't stay in this house forever. I've boarded up the windows and barricaded the doors but as I count the number of tablets that I have left I know that I'll leave willingly. 

The city is only two hour's walk from here and sometimes when I peek out between the window's boards at night I can see cars heading towards and away from it. It is definitely still populated. Who or what it's populated by is quite another matter.

We still don't know what exactly unhumans do to people. We know that their victims go missing but nobody seems to know what happens next. There have been murders, certainly, but all of those appear to have been quite human in origin.

Tomorrow I head into the city. 

I have no way of knowing how many of the others who I'll meet there won't be human and the terrifying thing is that I still won't know when they're right in front of me. The only certainty I have is that if I don't try this, if I don't get to a pharmacy, I will die.

Tomorrow I might find out if dying would be preferable.
