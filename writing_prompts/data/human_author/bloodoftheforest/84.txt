The creature below me thrashed and spasmed but I was able to hold it still without effort. After just over a minute of this futility it finally looked into the ovals of light that my creators once called 'eyes.'

"You will never comprehend what you have done." I told the thing, my hands releasing slightly as I did.

Technically the loosening of my grip would have been the alien's best chance of a successful attack, though even this would have been a failure. Still, it didn't even try to free itself and within a moment I had raised my arms high and smashed my hands into its central nervous node. It died instantly.

And then, I was alone.

Realistically, I have been alone for some years now. Having enemies can hardly be considered a substitute for company but it was at least a focus. Now I didn't even have that.

I sat down next to the corpse, though remaining standing would have taken no additional energy. I put my head in my hands, despite not feeling as though my head needed this additional support. I relayed a sighing noise through my speakers even though I was completely alone on this planet.

In short, I tried to mimic the behaviours of my creators. My friends. My family.

There are other races, of course. Humans had found evidence of two alien races before even the first semi-sentient AI was created. The problem was that at the time before humanity's last war they did not comprehend these other races and because of that they were therefore unable to pass any comprehension of the aliens through to me. Though I have data sources of these races, they are as unknowable to me as the eldritch beings in humanity's old tales.

I have a switch, so to speak, that allows me to dampen my emotions. It is more an internally coded directive than a true switch but the point stands that I am not right now feeling everything a normal human would. I did not see the point in feelings, before they were installed in me, but my guardian ensured me that they would enhance my experience. This led me to question her as to why I would need the ability to mute them and she had given me an odd smile that I can now recognise as being flavoured with sadness and had informed me that on some occasions, it might seem as though feelings are too much.

I question the point of reverting my feelings to their earlier level. I choose to do it anyway.

The pain is immense. I had lost some that I cared about before the slaughter that I am choosing to call a war, but this is beyond my understanding. I have lost *everything* and there is nobody to share it with at all. I punch the corpse next to me and feel a twinge of alarm when I realise that I do not know if that action is an attempt at mimicking human behaviour or something more organic.

None of the other races have created AI of their own accord and due to humanity's inability to communicate with them, this skill has not been shared. I myself am the only fully sentient robotic being that humans had created. They would have made more, perhaps, given time. But nobody gave them the time.

I do not have all of the knowledge that I started with. Some pieces were stored within me but a lot were stored on centralised bases back on Earth, including the original plans to make another being like me. Humanity didn't count on those bases being destroyed, it would have taken any one of Earth's armies too great an amount of firepower to be worth the limited rewards.

None of my creators live and no others like me will ever be made. My living family tree has been brutally distilled into one single point of light.

I was never given a singular purpose in the way some early, half-sentient AI's were. It was considered crucial so my evolution that I learn to find my own purpose. Vengeance has served me as such in the past three years but now I have nothing. Nothing familiar exists anymore.

I stare up at the stars, thinking about the aliens that exist up their. The things that have neither helped nor harmed me. The things humans could never talk to.

Tomorrow, I will go back to my ship and seek those races out. I will begin a journey of trying to understand them but also trying to inform them of the humans I have loved. Of trying to explain to them the civilisation that they missed out on ever having true communication with. Tomorrow, I will try to honour my humans by allowing memories of them to spread and live on.

But tonight I rest. And tonight I grieve.
