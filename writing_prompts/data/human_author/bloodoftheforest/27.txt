Chloroform isn't like the movies. I'd shoved the soaked rag into a large sling of non- breathable fabric and wrapped the whole thing tightly around his face. When you cover someone's face their first reaction is always to try to claw it off even though a smart man would know that it is much easier for someone who has attacked you from behind to hold that cover on than it is for you to take it off. 

He grappled blindly at the fabric before thinking to grab his gun and by that time I'd already disarmed him. It took a while for him to fall and he made a very decent attempt at fighting me off but every breath he took drew more drugs into his system and eventually he fell limply to the floor.

Chloroform is difficult and lengthy but it's quiet and it isn't lethal. If it can be avoided, I prefer not to kill people. Even though it's often the easiest method.

After all this time I didn't even have a name for whoever would be behind this door. I knew what they'd done, who they'd killed, how much power they had - but I didn't know their name, age or gender. My breathing was shaky but I picked the lock with practiced ease.

The apartment was gorgeous. Every detail seemed finely tuned from the perfectly tuned bonsai tree on the table to the shining kitchen counter. I walked through every room silently until I found her.

Her face hit me like a fist to the gut. I knew that face, I'd loved that face. Even though I'd only seen it in photos I'd admired those elegant looks and that disarming smile my whole life.

"So you've come. Are you here for your inheritance?"

"No, you can't be her. You disappeared. You left."

My mother shook her head.

"I did not disappear. I've never been interested in being invisible and erased. Dear, if I'd wanted that then I would have stayed right where I was." She looked out of her window calmly. "But where I am now hundreds of people know me and respect me. I always meant to find you again, in time."

She crossed the room to meet me.

"Tell me, who betrayed me, in the end. They surely led you here in the hope it would lead to my death and I can't say I'm not curious."

I shook my head, shaken and withdrawn. This couldn't be happening. *It couldn't.*

"No matter. Either they'll be stupid enough to abscond with their ill gotten gains or you've already ended them. We have other things to discuss anyway, I feel."

For the first time she looked at the gun in my hand.

"You can shoot if you want, but my followers will stay loyal even in death. In life however, perhaps I can be of use to you."

I couldn't see a weapon on her and as far as I knew I'd taken out her only guard. How was she so calm?

"This changes nothing." I spat. "I used to want a mother but if this is my only option then you have nothing I want."

She actually laughed at this, a gentle and musical sound that instantly put me on edge.

"I have nothing you want? Dear, I have *everything.* I wasn't offering to be your mother. I was offering you the chance to join me. I've been tracking your exploits just as you've been following mine and I must say, I'm impressed. You're talented, focussed, relentless. If I'd known that the person I'd been reading about all this time was my daughter then perhaps I'd have brought you here myself."

She looked me up and down.

"Perhaps you don't see us as being similar but in every way that counts we're the same. No one changes the world that isn't obsessed. If you join me then in time you will share my power and my people will follow your orders as if they are my own. And when I leave then you can have everything, your true inheritance."

I found myself suddenly yelling.

"I don't want any of this!"
