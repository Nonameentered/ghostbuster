My house has thirteen mirrors and each one of them is covered. It didn't always used to be this way. Decades ago, the idea of having even a single one of these mirrors covered would have felt like heresy to me. Each one used to be lovingly cleaned and often I would also have smaller mirrors easily accessible so that I could more easily see myself closer up or at an angle that my larger mirrors couldn't accommodate alone. What would a transformation be without an opportunity to admire my handiwork?

&#x200B;

I haven't uncovered a single mirror in at least a year and even that was just a quick, fleeting glance before putting the cover straight back on. I don't want to see myself because it's never myself that I'm seeing. I don't even remember now if there was a particular inciting incident that made me realise that I don't know what I look like or if the idea just infected me subtly and slowly over years. I do remember that it didn't distress me at first. Why would I need to know what my original form was? I was born a boring humanoid of some appearance I can no longer recall and now I can be the most attractive man or woman in the world, should I care to be. I have lived alongside humans long enough to know which type form will cause a reflex of respect, endearment or lust. I can be any specific human that exists and reap the benefits of the life they had sowed. I can even spend time as an animal, though that has always been distinctly more difficult for me.

&#x200B;

Eventually though, the lies got to me. Not directly - no, I've always found the idea of being caught more thrilling then terrifying. Every time someone has come close to realising I'm not the exact figure I say has simply prompted a surge in adrenaline. Nobody has ever fully discovered that I am an imposter in any one of my previous guises and even if they were to - what exactly would they do next? How could a mortal human even go about understanding that the person who looks \*exactly\* like a leading politician is somebody else entirely? And even if they were to arrest me, how would they keep hold of someone who can disappear into an ant the second their back is turned?

&#x200B;

The lies got to me because if you pretend to be someone else for long enough, you start forgetting who you are. This isn't something a lot of humans could understand, though some do, due to a shorter lifespan and an inability to change literally everything about themselves. I can lie almost flawlessly because as a shapeshifter I can simply will my face into projecting the correct expressions, I can create a perfect smile at a joke that disgusts me with barely any effort. I can stop myself from crying with merely a thought. After some time living in the skins of others though I realised that I wasn't certain which bits were lies and which weren't. A man offers to take me to an expensive restaurant and I say I love it there because that's what my skin would say, but find myself unable to remember if my earlier delight at being there had been real or fake. I can't remember clearly which parts of my previous lives I have loved but pretended to hate or despised but worn perfect smiles to. It all became a blur and I found myself lamenting that even my physical form was just another lie.

&#x200B;

Today might change all that. I climb out of bed and get showered and ready. For the first time in a while I wonder if I should at a mirror but I decide against it. I wear the same form I've worn for years. It's nobody in particular and I haven't even stolen particular features from particular people. I consider switching to a form that Zach will find more appealing in some way but decide against it, sure he'd see right through such a cheap ploy. I pull on clothes and my hair twists itself into a neat braid that I finish with a hair tie that I obviously don't really need. I head out.

&#x200B;

Zach hadn't told me what form he'd be taking but he did tell me what table we'd be sat at. He's a woman in her late thirties, wearing casual clothing and drinking a very frothy coffee. Physically, Zach looks average at best but his casual demeanour makes him seem far more appealing than a woman twice as attractive. I find myself quite surprised that I am completely unable to tell if this feature is real or an act.

"Hi Emmy," he says as I sit down, "what's up? You sounded pretty serious on the phone."

I hadn't wanted to broach the subject of why I really wanted to talk to him until I could see him in person. It had seemed vitally important that we be able to physically see each other for this conversation but now we're both actually here, I'm unable to speak. With nobody here I can really fool I find myself nervously tapping on the table.

"Then again," Zach says after a few moments awkward silence, "I guess you've always been the serious type."

"I have?!" I blurt out and Zach laughs at my outburst.

"Sure. What's this really about?"

"I don't know who I am anymore. I don't know what I look like, what I've loved, what I've hated or what memories are of me being genuine and which ones are fake. It's-" I pause, unsure if I should finish before continuing, "it's destroying me."

"I can see how that would be an issue." Zach nods.

"It wasn't for you?"

"Hell no. But that's a different kettle of fish. I'm nowhere near as talented, I couldn't choose to be another person for years straight even if I wanted to. Even a single month would be a very serious challenge."

I consider this. I hadn't really known I was special. No shapeshifter's power is at it's maximum when they first get it and I'd always just assumed that eventually everyone got to the same point I did. The idea that for some shifters there was any effort to it, no matter how small, felt foreign and bizarre.

"Anyway," Zach says, "just because you don't know what you've liked in the past doesn't mean you don't know what you like now. Take that coffee you ordered. Do you like it?"

I inhale the coffee deeply and nod at him.

"There we go then. And as for appearances, what you're doing now is pretty much exactly what I'd expect adult Emmy to look like."

The idea that my subconscious might know what I look like had never occurred to me, the fact that it had influenced my default form these recent years was startling.

"I look the same?" I ask with a tone approaching wonder.

"Well. You've dyed your hair."

I have to laugh at that and it's a sudden, genuine laugh. We order a bite to eat and for the first time in a long time, I chat to somebody without lying at all.
