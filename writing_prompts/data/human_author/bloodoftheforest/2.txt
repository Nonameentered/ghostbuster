"So how do you know if she's awake?"

Dr Raine laughs and waved his hand so close to my eyes that he brushes my lashes. I don't flinch.

"Eva doesn't sleep or wake like we do. She merely has periods of activity or stillness. It's not like you'll get any sense of her in either one though!"

The intern has the conscience to look alarmed that I might hear this but the doctor has decided long ago that I can't. He's wrong though, I hear everything. That's the problem.

Right now I can hear the two men in the room with me, but also each patient along the hall. And across the street, the county, the country. The globe. Further.

I can hear their realities and their dreams, their pasts and their futures. I can see them too. I can smell the perfume of Dr Raine's mistress from twelve nights ago and I can feel the prickle of pink on his cheek when his wife slaps him over it tomorrow. I can taste the intern's favourite childhood food even though he's long forgotten what it was called.

I can read you just as easily from half a world away.  These things should feel infinite but compared to what else I know they feel so very, very small. I try not to think about that but it's futile. I'll never fully be able to avoid thinking of it again.

*Yellow.

Yellow.

Yellow.

Red...*

"Christ, is she awake again already?!" A voice asks with dread.

It's neither of the men from before, it must be days later now. But days are moments and moments are nothing less than infinite...

"Dave? Dave I'm going to need your help here."

They come in and see the blood on the wall, messy splodges combined with runes they've never seen before.

"I think there's something still in her mouth."

Between them they manage to prise the mangled finger from between my jaws. One bandages my hand whilst the other calls the real hospital but neither act is done with particular urgency. They move me to a more soundproofed room to continue my screeching whilst they begin cleaning up.

"How did she even get out of the restraints in the first place?"

Dave shrugs.

"Who knows? But she always does. When she first got here the staff used to try all sorts to keep her in place but now they mostly don't bother. The cuffs are more of a token gesture than anything else, nothing can really be done. Put me off lucid dreaming for life."

Nora looks at Dave questioningly.

"What do you mean?"

"That's how she got here. She used to be sane, smart even. Then she started having these dreams about a yellow door and insisted there was something incredible and unknowable behind it. So she taught herself how to lucid dream so she could take a look."

"Oh? And I suppose she told you that herself then? Since she's *so* chatty..."

"It's true! She was an artist and she kept incredibly detailed journals filled with inspiration that got sent here with her. The themes of her art were strange or forbidden knowledge so the idea that her dreams were keeping secrets from her really intrigued her.

Anyway, in her dreams she got closer and closer to the door. But on the night she finally reached it she didn't open it. Woke up the next day, went about her normal business and then wrote in her journal that her next dream would reveal what was behind that door. And the next day she was *this.* "

Nora snorts.

"I don't believe a word of it."

Dave could have tried to convince her further but he doesn't. Not so much because he gives up but because he doesn't want to think about the yellow door anymore. He doesn't really want to consider the idea that this could happen to him.

And it *could* happen to him. Now that I see from behind everyone's eyes I can tell that there are other Yellow Doors out there. Not all of them doors outside of metaphor but each one a possibility. If the future was to nudge a little to the left then Dave could find one two weeks from now.

He'd run from it though, whereas I needed to see behind it. I needed to know what was on the other side but it turns out that understanding it was an altogether different matter. We were not meant to understand.

Maybe one day though I'll no longer just be listening with your ears but whispering into them too. So that when should find *your* door, five months from now, I can give you a little push towards it.

You have to see it. It's just so beautiful.
