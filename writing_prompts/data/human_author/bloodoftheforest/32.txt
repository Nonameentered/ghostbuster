"You knew?!" I exclaimed. "How did you even find out?"

Trish laughed as she began to place the candles at key locations around the room.

*"How?* Has nobody else you've been with mentioned that you're a contortionist in your sleep? Like seriously, you could probably work for cirque du soleil if you could somehow arrange to always be napping at their shows."

Oh. I did generally wake up pretty sore but I'd always assumed it was just my shitty mattress. As to how it hadn't been brought to my attention already, my previous relationships had all been short and sweet. By which I mean 'tinder hookups that I didn't even invite to my house, let alone to stay for an entire night.' Perhaps characterising them to Trish as ex-girlfriends had been unintentionally dishonest but right now probably wasn't the time to go into it.

"If you knew then why did you stay?" I asked.

Trish shrugged at me as she rifled through her pockets for her lighter.

"Well, when that was my only hint I didn't know that it was literally demons. And by the time I had enough clues to know what was actually going on it just didn't seem like a good enough reason to leave. I mean, you stuck around when I lost my job."

"That's not the same th-" I shook my head and cut myself off. "Anyway, it won't work. I've tried an exorcism by an actual priest. It doesn't stick."

She dragged her desk chair into the centre of the room.

"See, that's where you went wrong. Did you know that in medieval times members of the Church would summon demons themselves in order to gain insight into matters of philosophy? Christian exorcisms are just to politely close the line of communication with a demon who had been *invited.* Think of it as hanging up a phonecall rather than dragging an assailant out of your house kicking and screaming."

Trish gestured towards the chair and I sat down. She then pulled a coil of heavy duty rope from under the bed.

"So once I figured that out, because don't get me wrong my first thought was 'exorcism' too, I started to wonder who would've wanted these demons gone. And since the Church persecuted witches it stood to reason to me the witches themselves would want to fuck over the Church."

*I love this woman,* I thought as Trish started looping the rope around my legs. Her intelligence was one of the first things that had drawn me to her and so that she not only hadn't left me for my 'problem' but had also formed a well researched plan meant that this was probably the hottest I had ever found her.

"Holy water is a churchy thing though." I said.

"Yeah." She replied slowly, double checking some images on her phone so ensure that the knots she was tying would stay put. "I mean yes, it is. But after about the fourteenth century a lot of European witchcraft ends up with Christian stuff in it and there aren't many surviving sources to say what it looked like before then. The houseplants I've been growing are herbs that are traditionally used for things like this though, and the candles themselves have been dressed with oils. Not to mention - I've bought so, so much salt for this. This whole room is surrounded by an incomplete salt circle so if this all screws up then I just need to add a smidge more salt on my way out to trap the demon. And you, unfortunately, but it'll give me time to come up with plan number two whilst also giving us a bit of leverage."

She pulled out a large knife from her beside table, to my not insignificant alarm.

"Just a precaution." Trish smiled. "Not to mention, I think your demons will take me more seriously if I'm armed."

She went around the room, lighting candles and checking on odd little things I didn't really understand. Before lighting the last one, she paused.

"I've done my research on this but I can't swear it will definitely work. If you don't want to do this, I understand. Last chance to back out."

I raised my eyebrows.

"This is easily the sweetest thing anybody's ever done for me. You can't begin to imagine how okay with this I am."

Trish nodded and flicked her lighter back on.
