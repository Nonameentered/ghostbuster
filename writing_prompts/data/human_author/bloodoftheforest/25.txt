Kayleigh abruptly stopped crying out of sheer confusion.

"You *put* it there?" She said dubiously.

Her mother nodded and stroked Kayleigh's hair.

"I did. He used to be my monster and he has protected me for most of my life. He will always protect the life of whoever is in the bed above him and so up until recently he protected your daddy too. We would never have gotten rid of him but we decided, together, that it was better for him to protect you instead."

Kayleigh didn't know how to feel about this. The thing that she had half-seen in her mirror had been terrifying but the way her mum had described it was as if she had been given an important gift.

"He won't hurt me?" She asked.

Her mother laughed.

"Oh, darling. Never."

As the years went by Kayleigh accepted the monster under her bed as part of her normal life, mundane almost. She knew not to tell anyone but the idea that something she accepted as standard had to be kept a complete secret was no stranger than children who know that they have to hide their mother's alcoholism or pretend that they have never once spent full nights in a completely empty house. In many ways it was an easier secret than either of those by virtue of the fact that whilst it was impossible at least it didn't hurt.

Kayleigh's family moved often and the monster moved with them. At first they told her that the moves were because of her father's work but late one night she heard hushed voices about how he hadn't found anywhere new to work since moving and they were burning through their savings fast. When her father's job had supposedly transferred him again just two weeks later she didn't see any reason to let them know it was a lie.

One year after that move, Kayleigh's father was gone. By this age Kayleigh had gotten smart enough to realise that her mother's sudden obsession with making sure Kayleigh understood to hide under the bed if anything bad happened in the house were a direct response to this change. There was no longer enough money to facilitate regular moves and Kayleigh was switched from homeschool to regular school so her mum could work.

"Remember, if anything strange happens to you then just tell them you're sick and I'll come get you." Her mum had said frantically before Kayleigh's first school day. "The same goes with if you see anyone suspicious. Please be careful. Please be careful."

The paranoia made sense five weeks later.

There was no knocking on the door, just the sound of a sudden blast of splinters whilst Kayleigh and her mum ate dinner.

"Go to your room." Kayleigh's mother whispered and Kayleigh nodded silently.

"WE KNOW YOU'RE HERE MARISSA!" a voice bellowed.

Kayleigh tried to balance speed with silence as she raced to her bedroom door.

"Get the hell out of my house!" Her mother yelled.

Kayleigh closed the door behind her, praying that it wouldn't creak. Luck gods smiled upon her and it didn't, though her mother's yelling and swearing would probably have hidden the noise anyway. For the first time in her entire life, Kayleigh slid under her bed.

The darkness was sudden and sickening, an effect of the monster's presence. He seemed to radiate darkness in the way some creatures radiate light and Kayleigh couldn't even see her own hands by her face.

*Hello,* an unfamiliar voice said, *You're very close.*

Kayleigh was about to beg him to be quiet when she realised that the voice was inside her head. Outside her door there were flashes of bright, colourful lights and the sounds of a fight.

*Do you need protecting?* the voice asked.

Kayleigh nodded and then decided that with all of the commotion outside she could probably whisper.

"These people. They blew up our door and now they're calling my mother by a name that isn't hers. Why didn't she hide here with me? I don't know what they want."

*Oh,* the voice said with disappointment, *I can answer that. What those men want is me. And the reason that your mother isn't hiding is that she thinks that she can handle the fight herself. Ever since I've stayed with your family the person I've been closest to has developed some kind of power. She has already used this to take down three of them. But it won't be enough.*

The shadows shifted and I realised that the monstrosity was pouring itself out into the room from under the bed.

*I vowed to protect you. And if I let them take me then they will have no reason left to fight. But before I go.*

One of the sharp appendages wrapped itself gingerly around my wrist and I felt a sudden flash of knowledge. I had a collection of memories of great grandparents I'd never met rescuing this thing from a lab. I knew what my powers were and how to use them. I knew a small, incomplete explanation of what this monster was - just enough about it so I wasn't driven mad on the spot.

"Wait!" I yelled.

This thing had protected us for so long. I didn't care if my outburst attracted the attention of the men outside.

"I don't want you to go. We'll stay and fight, all three of us."

Swallowing hard as I did so, I looked directly at the monster.

*We could lose.* the monster said.

"Maybe," I admitted, "but we have to try."

I closed my eyes and focussed on readying a power that up until five minutes ago I hadn't even known existed.

"You're family."
