Yeah, I'm really pleased with how his arc is shaping up! Here's the next part! - 

When one doesn’t know where to start for information, look for rumors. That was advice Nydas took to heart, and in the complex political machine that was the government, he was rather overwhelmed. Rumors, however, he could handle.

The tricky part about searching for rumors is finding out which ones are credible. Fortunately, over the years Nydas has found contacts he considered reliable. Well, one contact. He took a deep breath, hoping they had the information he was looking for.

The door was already unlocked. He expected nothing less, his contact already knew he was coming. The moment Nydas swung the door open he was hit with a strong scent of incense. He smiled, it was a scent he hadn’t experienced in much too long.

The only furniture pieces present in the room, if one could even call them that, were pillows. Lots and lots of pillows, drapes and beads hanging from every archway, incense burners lining the floor which was covered up by thick carpets.

His contact sat on the floor, eyes closed. Her hair was in thick braids, and within those braids were were various trinkets and beads. Her nails made her fingers look twice as long, and she wore loose fitting silks that draped every which way on her form. Showering her in every color imaginable.

She smiled, eyes still closed, “I’ve been expecting you.”

Nydas smiled back, “I’d expect nothing less, Veila”

Veila grinned, opening her eyes, “now tell me, Nydas, why have you come to my abode?”

“Why do I ever come here? Rumors,” replied Nydas.

Veila smirked, “I presumed as much, but one can never be too sure. Perhaps you simply wanted to catch up.”

Nydas shrugged, “who says I haven’t? It’s always nice to see you, Veila. Though I do have business as well.”

Veila nodded, “of course, you’re a busy man. Though you seem different this time.”

Nydas sighed, “in a way, perhaps. But business first. Have you heard any rumors regarding a conspiracy in the royal castle?”

Veila chuckled, “not so fast, thief. That’s a tall order, coins first.”

Nydas dropped some coin into her hand, “will this be enough?”

Veila took a look at it and frowned, “not great, but for you, I’ll give you a little bit of information. I know that you’re a wanted man, after all.”

“Indeed I am,” Nydas responded.

Veila patted his shoulder, “things will get better soon, at least I hope. You asked about the royal castle, yes? That’s unusual for you… curious. Well, there are indeed rumors of a conspiracy, though there are always multiple plots in the darkness occurring in such a cutthroat place. You’ll have to be more specific.”

Nydas scratched his head, “what about one involving the King? And his illness?”

Veila nodded, “I think I’ve heard a little about that. They believe it is not truly an illness, correct? Yes, I have.”

Nydas grinned, “excellent. So he was telling the truth.”

Veila raised an eyebrow, “who was telling the truth.”

Nydas blushed, “n-no one.” Nydas cursed inwardly. He should have known better to say anything aloud to her. Veila was an etherborn, which meant that she was born infused with ether. It is an incredibly rare gift, but also a powerful one. Zeris was a mage, which meant he used ether for magic, but he needed an outside source to power his abilities. Veila on the other hand, needed no source, though her abilities were less diverse. They were tied to whatever her ether connected to, for her, it was her hearing. Closing her eyes and drowning her nose with incense blocked out her other senses, strengthening her hearing. With her many years of training, she could hear across almost the entire city, collecting hundreds of rumors. Though one had to hope she was listening to what one found valuable.

Veila chuckled, “doesn’t sound like no one to me. Is that all you wished to do? Confirm a conspiracy existed?”

Nydas shook his head, “there is a group of crown guard, the ones after me. They are all commoners who want to become something more but barred due to their lack of noble blood. They are led by a guard captain named Diane. Though she takes order from another. Do you know who that is?”

Veila sighed, “I have not. Though I can direct my attention there in the future if you come back with more coin.”

Nydas nodded, “thank you, Veila.”

Veila smiled, “of course, dear. Though, from what little rumors I’ve heard on the matter, I think there is a connection between your two inquiries. The guards took the artifact back from you, yes? I believe that artifact is related to the conspiracy involving the King. I know not the specifics, but it is worth investigating.”

Nydas blinked, “oh… curious. I’ll look into it.”

Veila grinned, “thanks for coming by, Nydas.”

Nydas bowed, “it was my pleasure. Have a good evening.”
