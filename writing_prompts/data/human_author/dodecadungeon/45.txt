Most people with my power are art collectors, their entire homes encompassed in various paintings and landscapes for them to explore. The rarer the painting is, the fewer copies there are of it, which means, with the ability to enter paintings, they will only emerge where another painting is found, in another home of a powerful art collector. They have developed an elitism, enjoying their authority and abilities, but I have none of that. I only have my child’s picture books.
  

  
I cannot travel to the homes of the fabulously wealthy to enjoy their parties and social gatherings, but I can travel to numerous homes across the globe. I can travel to stores and factories where the books are made and produced.
  

  
What the picture books lack is beauty. Simple images, forms of shapes easy enough for children to understand and draw, some made of crayon, others of symbols that represent things in the child’s life. It is a place that is helpful for the child to view, but there is a reason none of these things exist in the real world. They are terrors.
  

  
Every time I journey through the books, I must pass through the horror that lies within. Those insects may seem cute on the outside, but within they are massive hungry beings in a bleak world, as aggressive as they need to be to survive. Sentient objects that are jealous of my form which can so easily talk, walk, and live among others. No matter what the book is about, there are always horrors that lie within.
  

  
Why do I subject myself to such horrors? Why do I leap back into the nether each time just to traverse the space between? I will do anything for my child. Get her a bracelet from halfway across the globe, show her a fish at the bottom of the ocean, and take a picture of wondrous views, because I cannot afford to have the painting of that view in my home. So I will continue to experience the fearsome realm between worlds, all for her.
