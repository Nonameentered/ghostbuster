I gasp as I wake up, I accidentally wore my jester hat to bed instead of my nightcap. My nightcap gifts me with wondrous dreams, but my jester hat brings out the chaos in me, and also my dreams.
  

  
Shaking off the discomfort, I put on a chef hat, which evokes within me the desire to make food, and the talent to do so. Fortunately, that bad dream woke me up early, which means I have time to indulge in what the hat wants, to make an ornate, restaurant-worthy breakfast. It took an hour to make, but it was spectacular.
  

  
Then I put on my suit and a fedora to match. It gives me a sense of sharpness, of lofty value only an employee like me has. I do not thank the worker at the kiosk as I pick up coffee on the way, it is simply a business transaction after all…
  

  
The air conditioner turns on full force and my hat flies right off, as the door opens up the wind carries it out into the street. I panic, searching around for another hat, grabbing one of the extra barista hats within the coffee shop.
  

  
Dave is going to miss his shift because he has to take his daughter to piano practice, so I take over, making coffee beside the barista I did not thank for the coffee. Now in her position, I feel upset at my costumer self for not thanking the hard work of a barista. How hard is it to say thank you? I could have tipped, at least. But I’m working right now, it’s not the time for idle thoughts.
  

  
During break, I shift to a casual baseball cap, no logo though. I’m not in the mood to be a sports-crazed fan, I simply want to take my foot off the gas. I apologize to the barista for earlier, and she asks if I work here. I’m not sure how to answer, I’m not wearing the right hat for this. I try to deflect the conversation by making light of my lost hat. She laughs and we easily break the ice. Conversation comes so easy in this hat, though not much else. If I were to start work again in this cap, I would be fired by the day’s end. Which is why, I suppose, it is fortunate that I don’t actually work here. While wearing my cap, I also have the tendency to get myself in trouble by doing things like asking the barista out on a date.
  

  
She said yes! Looks like I’m going to need to buy another hat. Thank you, you wonderful, stupid cap.
