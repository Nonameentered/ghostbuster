“Please, leaveth me alone.” Reginald pleaded.
  

  
Sarah smiled, “don’t worry, I won’t hurt you.”
  

  
“That is not what I worry about,” the werewolf sighed.
  

  
Sarah grinned, “I know you’re a lycanthrope, and I’m not scared. In fact, I’m fascinated. Please, give me a moment of your time.”
  

  
“If thoust are sureth… cometh at thou’s own risk.”
  

  
Sarah smiled and entered, sitting beside Reginald, “why do you talk in middle english?”
  

  
“What does thou mean?”
  

  
“You don’t talk like me.”
  

  
“I have been not in civilization in many a year. I must have fallen behind.”
  

  
“Oh… so you’ve been in seclusion for hundreds of years? How terrible!”
  

  
“At least I will not harmeth anyone.”
  

  
“But you’re gentle.”
  

  
“I am a monster.”
  

  
“No! You’re a wonderful creature!”
  

  
“Thou believeth I am wonderful?”
  

  
“Of course! You’re a unique, majestic beauty.”
  

  
“I doubt others shareth thou’s opinion.”
  

  
“Perhaps, but maybe I can help ease them into it, show them how special you are.”
  

  
“Thou would aid me?”
  

  
“Yes! Though until then you can stay with me, no questions asked. I’d love to spend more time learning about you.”
  

  
“Thou is very beautiful, thy is an angel of kindest.”
  

  
“Oh you! I miss chivalry, you’re so charming! You’re quite handsome yourself. Perhaps this could bloom into something special.”
