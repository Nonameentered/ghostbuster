Thanks! I enjoy writing them! The sibling relationship and banter was really fun to write! Here's the next part! - 

“You shouldn’t be here,” stated Count Veris.

Nydas shrugged, “I shouldn’t be anywhere, I’m being searched for all over the city, this place is as safe as any.”

“I can’t protect you if you bring them back to me, you should have let me know you were coming, I have another entrance-” Veris started.

“Did you set them up?” interrupted Nydas.

“Nydas, please. Be reasonable.”

“Reasonable? My party has been captured during a meeting with you and your men, so yeah, I’m being reasonable.”

“What did you intend to do if I did? What do you intend to do if you find the people who set up your friends? Waltz into their dwelling and accuse them? You’re just one man, Nydas. You have no idea how deep this goes.”

“Then tell me, dammit!”

“I can’t tell you here, I-”

“I don’t want to hear excuses, my friends are gone! You know them, Veris. Hells, we broke bread with you. Reese, Selvin, Francis, they all trusted you!”

The Count sighed, “and you didn’t.”

“Thank goodness for that!” exclaimed Nydas.

“I was counting on that,” responded Veris.

Nydas paused, “what?”

The Count smiled, “that’s why I got there early, with guards stationed. I hoped you would believe there was something wrong. I was right.”

Nydas clutched his head, it felt like it was spinning. So it wasn’t just his desire to search for excuses to stay? His gut had really been right? “I… it was just a feeling.”

The Count nodded, “you had survived on that feeling for longer than any of your companions. It has never failed you before, and it did not fail you this time.”

Nydas’ shoulders relaxed a little, maybe he didn’t have to quell his feelings for the prince completely. They were illogical, sure, but they had perhaps saved his life and given him a chance to save his friends. He stood in thought, then began to put the pieces together, “what do you mean you counted on me? So you did know about this?”

“I did. They learned about the deal. Apparently we weren’t the only people who had eyes on this artifact, and they discovered my plans. I don’t know who among my contacts betrayed me, but they left me with little time to warn you, that was the only thing I could do to give you a chance. Thank goodness it worked.” 

“How do I know I can trust you, trust what you’re saying?”

“That depends on if you think I would betray you. This won’t work unless you trust me, I wish I could offer you more evidence, but making sure you made it out was the only way I could acquire it.”

“You’re not putting me in an easy situation, Veris.”

“When was our job ever easy, Nydas?”

Nydas sighed, “damn you.”

The Count chuckled, “damn right. Wine?”

Nydas shook his head, “I could use a good drink, but no. I need to keep my head clear. I’m with you for now. But it’s because I have no other choice. I know you want me to trust you completely, but this is the best I can offer.”

Veris smiled, “that’s enough for me, I hope its enough for your friends.”

“It better be,” responded Nydas. “Now, let’s not focus on what you don’t know. What do you know?”

The Count nodded, “wise. Were you informed of the crown guard involved?”

“Yes, but I wasn’t able to figure out if they were legitimate,” answered Nydas.

“They are indeed legitimate. I told you this runs deep, Nydas. Someone on the inside got the crown guard to do his bidding,” stated Veris.

“Or someone on the outside bribed them,” suggested Nydas.

Veris shrugged, “a possibility, but to find the answer to that question you’d have to interrogate the guards themselves.”

Nydas sighed, “I was hoping to avoid that.”

The Count sipped his wine with a nod, “I can help lower the risk, but I can only help so much.”

“I’ll take what I can get.” Nydas smirked, “now, where can I find those crown guards?”
