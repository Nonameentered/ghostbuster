Thank you! I'm glad the interactions turned out well, they were a lot of fun to write! Here's the next part! - 

The Lief’s Inn was the kind of place Nydas could see himself at, not a crown prince. Though, he should have known better, Wylan was much more than any ordinary prince. A lot better looking too.

It was in a remote part of the town that always seemed much more shrouded in shadow than the other areas. Quiet, except for the distant sounds of rats and seedy characters scuttering, an ominous feeling hung in the air, like Nydas was being watched. This was nothing new for Nydas, however, he had been in areas like this before. He just had to stick to the shadows and keep his head low.

He entered the Lief’s Inn, heading up to room 245. The door was locked, just as Wylan had said, but one lockpick later and it was as good as open. Nydas tried to compose himself as he opened the door to see that beautiful red haired prince once again, but he could not help but gasp a little, his heart racing.

Wylan smiled, “you came.”

Nydas smiled back, “of course I did, you called.”

Wylan rushed up and embraced him, which caused Nydas to eep with happy surprise, hugging back. The prince was so free with his affections, though he should not have expected anything else. He must’ve had many many partners over the years. Romance was a second language to him. Wylan grinned, “still, I’m glad.”

Nydas hugged tighter, “so am I.”

Wylan beamed down at him, “you’re a great hugger.”

Nydas chuckled, “oh please, I’m a novice compared to you.”

Wylan giggled, “agree to disagree, then.”

Nydas laughed, “I can live with that. What did you want to talk with me about?”

Wylan ended the hug, “well um… I wanted to see you again.”

Nydas blushed, “Really? I thought from that hug you weren’t going to turn me over to the crown guard, thank goodness I was right.”

Wylan shook his head, “never. But I do have a question for you.”

“Anything,” Nydas replied.

“Would it be possible to acquire your expertise for a task? I find myself in a bit of a bind,” explained Wylan.

Nydas blinked, “oh no, are you alright?”

Wylan nodded, “it’s not my own life I fear. Though if I tell you more, you have to swear to secrecy.”

Nydas sighed, “I wish I could do that, and I want to trust you, I really do. But we aren’t alone, are we?”

Wylan shook his head, “no, we’re not. But she’s a friend.”

Nydas looked around, calling out, “reveal yourself.”

Wylan called out with him, “it’s alright. You can come out.”

A woman with the same fiery red hair as Wylan popped up from a loose floor board underneath the room, “you could have danced around the question a bit before revealing me, Wylan. Though now that I’m out of that cramped space I can at least stretch my legs,” she sighed in relief, stretching.

Nydas blinked, “who is she?”

“She’s my-” Wylan started

“Servant.” the woman finished.

Wylan groaned, “he’ll find out sooner or later who you really are. Royal blood doesn’t go unrecognized.”

The red head rolled her eyes, “see? This is why you need my help, you’re way too honest. Dammit! You’re blowing my cover.”

Nydas raised an eyebrow, “wait a minute, are you Acrasia? The crown princess?”

Acrasia sighed, “that’s me, unfortunately.”

Nydas chuckled and turned to Wylan, “your sister is quite a character.”

Wylan smiled, “she certainly is. Love her to death, though. Please excuse her dishonesty, she was only trying to protect me.”

Acrasia nodded, “yeah, no offense, but you are a wanted criminal.”

Nydas shrugged, “that’s fair enough, I suppose. That was a clever hiding spot, you just move too much.”

Acrasia looked down at the floorboards, “I can’t help it, it’s cramped in there.”

Nydas smirked, “well get used to it, there’s a lot worse places to be.”

Wylan glared at Nydas, “watch it, that’s my sister you’re talking to.”

Nydas gulped, “my apologies, I only meant to-”

Acrasia cut him off, “he’s right, Wylan. It’s fine.”

Wylan sighed, “fine. But don’t speak ill of her again, Nydas, understand?”

Nydas nodded, whatever romantic magic there was in the air had dwindled significantly since the addition of Wylan’s sister. Though he had to admit, it was cute how much he cared about her. Nydas supposed she was kind of like one of his party members. They squabbled and gave each other trouble, but at the end of the day, they would come to one another’s aid in a heartbeat. “I understand.”

“Good. Now, has my honest proven enough?” Wylan asked.

Nydas thought for a moment, “I… I believe it is.”

“Wonderful, it’s about our father,” began Wylan.

Nydas blinked, “wait, the King? What’s he got to do with this?”

Acrasia groaned, “I told you this was a bad idea.”

Wylan rubbed his temples, “Acrasia, please. Now, Nydas, the King has fallen extremely ill. We believe it is more than just a simple illness, that there is a conspiracy at play.”

Nydas gasped, “what? Are you serious?”

Wylan nodded, “I know it sounds ridiculous, but please, you have to believe me.”

Nydas quirked his lip, “this is not what I expected to hear when you told me to meet up with you in this room.”

Wylan sighed, “I know, I know, and I’m sorry. But we’re in desperate need of aid, and you have the right skillset and, I don’t mean to use you, I will compensate you of course, I just… I really need your help.”

Nydas scratched his head, “I… hmmm… howabout this. I’ll do some digging, and if it turns out there is some truth to what you are saying, then I will help you. If not… then perhaps our paths will not cross again.”

Wylan gulped, “Nydas… thank you. I wish we met on better circumstances.”

“So do I,” he paused for a moment, “and, if this does prove true, could you perhaps do a favor for me as well?”

“Anything,” replied Wylan, voice soft.

“I don’t have access to the array of knowledge you have. Your royal library might provide the answers I need. Could you perhaps look into ether, particularly infused ether, at the royal library and see what turns up?” asked Nydas

Wylan nodded, “it shall be done.”

Nydas leaned forward and planted a kiss on Wylan’s lips, causing him to blush bright red. The Thief giggled at Wylan’s reaction, flashing him a wink, “for luck.”

The prince stood there, mouth agape, as Nydas leapt out the window, smiling as he raced back to the manor.
