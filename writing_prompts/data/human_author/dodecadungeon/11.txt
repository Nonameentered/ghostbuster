Those who knew him called him the red coat, those who didn’t call him a drunk.
  

  
Those who knew him told tales about his adventures. How he outdrank a man twice his size and four times his weight. How he arm wrestled a bear and won. How he surfed the perfect wave. How his bathtub moonshine was the best damn whiskey in town. How his handshakes were a good luck charm. How after spending a night with him any woman who walked the streets would immediately rise the next day with a new purpose, finding a stable job and leaving the streets behind.
  

  
Those who didn’t know him thought he was crazy.
  

  
Those who knew him knew he died a hero. The bar which so many who knew him called a sanctuary was going to be foreclosed, a wealthy robber baron sent his men to roughhouse the bar until the bartender gave it up. The bartender was about to give up when the red coat challenged the bruisers himself, battling four of them at once. He would have won, if they didn’t play dirty, drawing their knives, figuring no one would remember a drunk like him. They were wrong.
  

  
Those who didn’t know him thought he was simply another dead drunk, those who did would never forget him.
