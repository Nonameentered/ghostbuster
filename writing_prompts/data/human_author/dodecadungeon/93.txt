I infiltrated the enemy territory disguised as one of them. I have been doing some intel gathering and learned that the general who commanded the infantry has a secluded daughter. If I can seduce her, perhaps I can learn what I need to do on their parents to take them down.

It’s working like a charm! There was a soldier’s ball the other day and I asked her to a dance. She is actually quite elegant and charming, but I must stay focused on my task and continue my seduction.

I’m falling for her, I told myself I wouldn’t, but I am. She genuinely cares for me and makes me smile, I can’t help but enjoy being around her. My family demands justice… but I don’t want to hurt someone she loves.

I confessed to her why I’m here. I thought it was best, she deserved the warning and truth. I thought it would break us up and I could carry on without remorse, but instead, she hugged me tight and talked with her parents about reparations for me. They were not so generous… I fought them and almost won, but I could see her face in them, and couldn’t go through with it. Both of us ran away together in exile. After my family died I never thought I would be happy again, I’m glad I was wrong.
