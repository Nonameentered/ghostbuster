They told me not to go after the Mad Doctor, but they never told me why. Are you telling me that this doctor, who treats both heroes and villains, doesn’t have some sort of power and influence? He could end any villain or hero he wanted, let them die, blame a death on an accident. I asked these questions but got no straight answer. Everyone is so hush hush about this whole thing, so I decided to find out on my own. 
  

  
Ask yourself this, if all the Mad Doctor’s paying customers, not his volunteer clients, are super-powered, why are politicians, celebrities, and dignitaries all entering his office? They’re all super powered. Don’t believe me? I checked. The doctor has DNA samples of nearly everyone he attends to. That’s why these powerful people go to him in the first place, they have to keep their secret under wraps. 
  

  
So, is this guy really costly? Does he get paid to keep silent? His prices, I’ve discovered, are rather reasonable. Then what does he get out of all this? Power.
  

  
If you have politicians in your pocket, any policy you want to pass will. If you have celebrities in your pocket, they’ll endorse anything you want. But the Mad Doctor can’t be the only one who can provide treatment to these individuals, right? There has to be others. No. None, not a single other doctor treats super powered individuals. He had a monopoly.   
So what’s the deal with all this volunteer business? It’s a front. He sets up a clinic in some low income neighborhood where he has some volunteers give out sub-par aid while in the back he runs his operation. He needs the law off him so he sets up this deal, but  behind the facade of altruism is where he does his real work.  
You see, the only reason why the Mad Doctor is the only one who can treat all these super powered individuals is because he’s the one who created them. Every single one. Most of the heroes are his test run, but he’s since moved to higher priority clients like politicians. If someone doesn’t stop him soon, he’ll have the entire world in his pocket. I don’t care who comes to stop me, who tries to silence me, the truth must come out.
