Regardless, thank you. This story has become much more than I expected it to thank to your support! Here's the next part! - 

Nydas’ heart was still racing. He had managed to get one of the crown guard alone for a moment enough to take him out before he could alert the others. Fortunately, the crown guard appeared to all be wearing helmets, which meant at least for now that their faces would be concealed, making it much easier for Nydas to blend in.

He chose to take out a guard with a similar build to his own, making the uniform decently well-fitting. Nydas hated obscuring his face, but in this case, once again, he had little choice. He raced back over to the other crown guard, who were beginning to call out the name of the missing crown guard worriedly, “Doyle? Doyle? Where the hell are you Doyle? This isn’t a joke, get back in formation.”

Nydas strolled out of the alleyway, rejoining the group, “apologies, I… got distracted, is all. It won’t happen again.”

The crown guard raised an eyebrow, “you cried out, ‘I found him’ and then just ran off. What is this all about, Doyle?”

Nydas sighed, “I thought I found the rogue we’re looking for, but it was just a beggar.”

“Ah, we all have those days. Maybe you’d have less if you stopped drinking on the job,” the other guards laughed heartily at his quip.

“Hey, that’s enough. Poor Doyle’s home life hasn’t exactly been a model family. Give the poor bastard a break,” said a tall figure, striding forward and the other crown guard groaned, dispersing. The figure looked at Nydas, “don’t let it get to you, alright? You’ll get through this rough patch. You’re stronger than you think.”

Nydas nodded, “I’ll try to remember that, thank you.”

“Good, now I think that’s enough searching for today. Everyone, how about we head to The Friendly Spirit for some celebration?” The whole group roared in enthusiasm, the tall guard chuckling and pointing toward the pub. While all the other crown guard appeared to have masculine voices, the tall one had a feminine voice and a long braid that snuck out of her helmet. She stuck back with Nydas, patting his shoulder, “if you don’t want to come, you don’t have to.”

Nydas shook his head, “no, I want to come. It might be a good chance to help get my mind of things.”

“A good attitude,” responded the guard, “we’ll find that rogue soon enough. Don’t go wandering off just because you need the prize money. Look, next time I’ll arrange us in teams, that way no one gets lost again. You can come with me, and together, I’m sure we’ll find that bastard rogue. How does that sound?”

Nydas both smiled and scowled under the mask, he appreciated her kindness, but being called ‘that bastard rogue’ was not the most flattering of titles, “that sounds excellent. It’s almost unfair to the other teams, having you as a partner.”

She chuckled, “there’s the old Doyle! I hope to see more of him on my team tomorrow. We’ll need him if we hope to have a chance at catching the prize.”

Nydas nodded, “he’ll be there. You can count on it.”

He could tell she made a slight grin under the mask, “perfect. Ah, here we are, The Friendly Spirit. Let’s have some fun tonight!”

The group entered the pub, filling up the entire bar counter. The others began placing their drink orders to the bartender, Nydas placed none. He knew if he got a drink, he might have to remove his helmet to consume it, which was a bad idea considering the circumstances.

One of the crown guards sighed, “damn rogue. It’ll be a week at this rate before we find him. We’ll have to comb through the whole darn city!”

Another crown guard shushed him, “not so loud!”

The first guard shrugged, “it’s not unusual for guards to be searching for fugitives, mate. I can talk as loud as I want, aren’t you getting a little tired of this fruitless hunt?”

The other guard lowered his voice, “it doesn’t matter if I’m tired. We have a job to do, and if that rogue tells others about the set up, they may start putting the pieces together.”

The first guard nodded, “you’re right, you’re right. Damn it all!”

The second guard removed his hemlet, “damn it all indeed. But let us forget about all that for tonight and focus on our drinks, eh?”

The other guards removed their helmets and cheered, knocking back drinks. One of the guards turned to Nydas, tilting his head, “what’s wrong, Doyle? On most nights you’d be knocking back drinks already.”

Nydas sighed, “I’m good, I already drank enough earlier. Impaired my judgement and almost screwed everything up.”

The guard shrugged, “suit yourself. But take off your mask at least!”

Nydas shook his head, “not in the mood.”

The female guard patting Nydas on the back, “Doyle doesn’t have to take off his mask if he doesn’t want to. Fella’s had a long day.”

The others nodded, “you’re right, Diane. But with Doyle out of tonight’s festivities that puts you as the one most likely to drink us under the table!”

Diane grinned, “you’re not wrong there! Let’s see if you bastards can finally beat me!” She smirked and knocked back a drink, earning a cheer from the other crown guard.

A guard at the other end of the bar scoffed, “damn. Look at us. We’re trained fighters, we shouldn’t be guards, we should be soldiers!”

Another guard took a drink, “that maybe so, but we’re not noble born, we aren’t allowed in the King’s army.”

The distant guard shook his head, “doesn’t matter. We’re more skilled. I’ve gone toe to toe with those soldiers before on the training ground and have held my own every time and won my share of bouts. We’re soldier material, that’s for sure.”

The other soldier shrugged, “rules are rules, mate. As long as the King is in charge, the old ways will remain sacred.”

The first guard smirked, “fortunately, that might change soon.”

“Don’t get your hopes up just yet though.”

“Yeah, and if that useless son of his takes the throne we might even be in a worse position than before. He’s woefully inept as an heir. He squanders the luxury and wealth of the royal family on his outlandish galas. What a fool.”

Nydas made a fist under the table, that was his prince they were talking about! “Hey! The prince is a member of the royal family, he has been tutored and prepared. The crown is a lot of responsibility, he’s taking advantage of his current freedom. But I have a feeling he’ll rise to expectations when he takes the throne.”

The guard chuckled, “are you actually defending that idiot, Doyle?”

Diane took another drink, “he has a point. It isn’t like the King wasn’t a rebel in his youth. This phase will pass.”

The guard sighed, “fair, but it still doesn’t make him a good leader. Look at the current King. He’s stuck in the old ways.”

Diane nodded, “but we just have to stick to the plan, and that has a chance to change. Then we can have the positions we deserve.”

The guard grinned, “I’ll drink to that.”

“But do we trust whoever could bring that change?” asked Nydas.

The guard slammed his fist on the table, “with my life! He’s on our side, Nydas. He promised us change, there is passion in those eyes. It’s already beginning, the plan is in motion. It’s only a matter of time before that dream is realized.”

Nydas winced, “sorry, I didn’t mean to-”

The guard stood up, “what is up with you, Doyle? Speaking well of the prince, speaking ill of our employer?”

Nydas gulped, “I need some air…” He raced out of the bar, sneaking into a back alley and throwing off his guard uniform, leaping up the side of a building and disappearing into the night.
