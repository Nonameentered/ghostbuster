A tragedy, I don't have much to offer by means of condolences, but here's the next part for when you're ready - 

Wylan took another sip of wine. He knew he shouldn’t be drinking tonight, he was supposed to be obtaining information to help his father, but he needed something to calm his nerves. Acrasia still hadn’t arrived. He knew how she felt about balls, but if she bailed, things would be much more difficult. He not only needed her help, but her support. Just thinking about the conspiracy made his heart race with fear and his eyes go wide with worry. What made him almost as worried, however, was wondering what Acrasia might show up in, having made such an adamant point about bringing her own outfit.

He knew it was Acrasia as soon as she walked in. The outfit was not some poor garments unbecoming of a gala, but rather, it fit the occasion. That was the minimum criteria it met, and that was it, however. It matched none of the current fashion styles, nor did it match the gala’s theme. It was nothing any other noble would be caught wearing, and that made it perfect for Acrasia.

Despite the strange garment, Acrasia seemed to make a dazzling entrance. Her dress had a spiderweb pattern on it, silver webbing over black dolly-like fabric, textured in the shape of spiders. Half of her face was paled with make up, black lipstick and eyeliner, the other half was untouched. Her hair matched this dual pattern, half of it tumbling in curls, the other half tied up in a bun. Her wild red hair was a dramatic contrast to the dark colors present on her outfit. She wore a black glove on one hand, and a silver glove on the other. Her stockings at least were the same color, as were her shoes. Though they were not any shoes Wylan had seen before. Overall, Wylan couldn’t care less what she was wearing. She was here, and together they could not only investigate the conspiracy together, but also aid in one another’s romantic endeavors.

Wylan chuckled, walking over to Acrasia, “I never took you as someone to be fanfared by a dramatic entrance.”

Acrasia shrugged, “you said this gala was a chance for me to live out my romantic fantasy, right? I figured why not go all the way?”

Wylan smiled, “an excellent attitude. I know how you feel about galas, so thank you for coming, it means a lot.”

Acrasia smirked, “save the compliments until later, fancy boy. I may learn to resent you for bringing me here.”

Wylan giggled, “fair enough. Still, thank you.”

Acrasia grinned, “don’t mention it, brother. Is your masked dancer here?”

Wylan sighed, “I don’t believe so. Though if he were here, I don’t think he’d be wearing a mask. I don’t know what he looks like under the mask. Only that he has amber eyes, raven black hair, handsome features and-”

Acrasia cut him off, “okay, okay, you don’t need to gush. Just, keep an eye out for someone who fits that description.”

Wylan nodded, “I will. Though I have foun a particular captain of the guard…”

Acrasia blushed, “she’s here?”

Wylan laughed, “we said we were going to try and dance with our persons of affection, why then are you surprised.”

Acrasia groaned, “oh hush, you know I didn’t actually expect to hold myself to that promise. I didn’t think she’d show up!”

Wylan rolled his eyes, “you have got to be kidding me! Acrasia, you know we’re part of the royal family, right? Pulling strings is as easy for us as it is…”

Acrasia smirked, “you didn’t plan a metaphor, did you?”

Wylan shrugged, “there’s something there, it just didn’t reach my brain. Well, we should probably start investigating. There’s a lot of people and ground to cover. I’ll get the right side, you get the left.”

Acrasia nodded, “that sounds pertinent… wait, mine is the side with Diane!”

Wylan winked, “oh, it looks like it is, I hadn’t noticed.”

Acrasia chuckled, “you sneaky little liar.”

Wylan smiled, “now go, mingle. I’ll be right over here if anything goes wrong, alright?”

Acrasia began wandering over to the left side, Wylan smiling as he headed right. He kept a look out for the masked dancer, but could find none matching his description. He sighed, trying to get his mind off him as he began conversations with various nobles. Their conversation seemed so bland. They prattled on about politics and economics endlessly. Wylan had never spent his galas in conversation with powerful figures before, he mostly just danced with attractive youths. It all seemed pointless now, however. There was only one person he wanted to dance with, and that person wasn’t there.

The first conversations provided little in the way of information. There were problems abroad as always, the ones that kept his father so busy, but he suspected those were not where the conspiracy lied. He thought perhaps there was a secret motive within the affairs abroad, but he couldn’t be certain. He didn’t have the political acumen to determine the true meaning behind a politician’s words. He wished Benedict were with him, hells, he’d even take Rene, anyone who spoke snobbish noble.

Benedict was no where to be found, however. Though, Rene, on the other hand, was present, much to Wylan’s surprise. He was speaking to some guards off to the side, probably making sure the gala was secure after the theft last time performed by none other than the thief who had stolen Wylan’s heart.

His heart began to flutter at the thought. Could Rene be talking to the guards because there was a problem with security? Did the thief sneak in to steal once more? Wylan shook away those feelings. He had a conspiracy to uncover, and a thief returned was likely not the case. He would have to inquire about the guards and Rene later, just for posterity’s sake, but right now, he had a lovesick sister to help.

He grinned as he noticed Acrasia continually glancing in Diane’s direction, face reddening each time she did so. Wylan made his way over to the left side, slipping behind Acrasia and giving her a shove in Diane’s direction, stifling his chuckle as Acrasia eeped, stumbling toward the captain of the guard.

Diane gasped and intercepted Acrasia, helping her regain her balance as she placed her hands on Acrasia’s shoulders. “Thank you, I can be so clumsy sometime-” Acrasia stopped herself, looking up and realizing it was Diane who caught her, blushing furiously as she fumbled over her words.

Diane chuckled, “it was no issue. Just be careful, alright? And go easy on the wine, you’re already flushed with it.”

Acrasia’s color was beginning to match her wine, glancing down into her glass bashfully, “still, um… thank you.”

Diane nodded and raised an eyebrow, “Acrasia?”

Acrasia eeped, “th-that’s me!”

Diane smiled, “wow, you look so different than when I last saw you at the library.”

Acrasia twirled one of her curls idly, “yeah, figured I should probably look presentable for the gala, you know?”

Diane chuckled, “presentable? You always look more than presentable, Acrasia. And definitely in a ballgown. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a dress like yours, but you wear it incredibly well!”

Acrasia blushed, “th-thank you, Diane. You look very nice as well.”

Diane shrugged, “galas aren’t really my thing, but I figured I’d look presentable too.”

Acrasia sighed in relief, “oh good, I’m not a big gala person either, I much prefer libraries and quiet gardens!”

Diane beamed, “so do I! There are much less people in nature and bookshelves. Speaking of less people, this room is quite overwhelmingly occupied. Want to continue this conversation on the balcony.”

Acrasia gasped, a giddy smile plastered on her face, “I’d love to!”

Wylan smiled, strolling back to the right side. Acrasia would finally have the romance she longed for, Wylan only wished he could say the same for himself.
