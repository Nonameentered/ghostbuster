Thank you! And if course :) Here's the next part! - 

Nydas arrived back at the Count’s manor, stopping at the door to catch his breath. He was early. Even having found his friends in the dungeon and danced with Wylan, the guards forced him into an early exit. Though, since carriages are faster than Nydas, the Count arrived at the manor shortly after.

“Care to explain yourself, Nydas?” asked the Count as he strolled into the main hall.

“It was a trap,” Nydas responded, “I should have realized it as soon as I knew they were alive. They were using them as bait.”

Veris shook his head, “that doesn’t explain why after exploring the dungeon you remained in the ballroom and galivanted with the crown prince.”

“I believed I had gotten away from the guards. Free to roam around, I went around attempting to collect information,” answered Nydas.

“Did you doubt my ability to collect such information?” inquired the Count.

Nydas shook his head, “it was a matter of efficiency and convenience, that is all.”

Count Veris sighed, “a matter in which you made a grave error. Who knows who might have seen your face. Your cover is practically blown as well as any advantage they might have had. If they know you know the location of the prisoners, they will be moved.”

“Then we’ll have to act quick.”

“And trust you to make another blunder?”

“It won’t happen again, I know more now, before I was headed in blind. I can do this, I’ve pulled heists like this a hundred times before.”

“You will not act rashly. We first must exchange what information we know. From there, and only there, we will formulate a plan. Not execute a plan, not leap into action, formulate a plan. Is that understood?”

Nydas nodded, “clearly.”

The Count sighed, “good. So you discovered the location of the prisoners. Was that all you learned?”

Nydas shook his head, “a little more than that, but not much else I’m afraid. The prisoners are located in the dungeon. I should be able to draw a map of their location, assuming they are still there by the time we put our plan into action.”

Veris nodded, “did you have a chance to speak with your prisoner friends? Did they divulge any information.”

“Not much,” responded Nydas, “Zeris was the one they were interrogating the most, but he can hardly remember the encounters he had with his captors. Whatever information they want out of him it must be extremely important to these individuals.”

The Count stroked his chin, “it isn’t adding up… there is something more at play here. Are you sure you didn’t learn anything else?”

Nydas racked his brain, “oh, they were surprised that we were working together, considering you set them up.”

Count Veris cursed, “you told them we were allies?”

Nydas winced, “ah… I see my mistake now, damn…”

The Count sighed, “well… what’s done is done. I hope they can keep their mouths shut. But that is curious they still believe I am involved. Maybe they truly know little, that means whoever is planning this is very meticulous.”

Nydas nodded, “indeed. I hope you fared better than I in regards to information.”

Veris took a sip of wine, “moderately. I learned some interesting pieces of information about that stolen artifact. I knew a little before, but only enough to know it was valuable to sell. It appears there is much more involved in the piece than mere monetary value.”

Nydas’ eyes widened, “as in?”

The Count continued, “as in it is said to hold ether.”

Nydas gasped, “are you sure?”

Count Veris shook his head, “no, but everything about that artifact is speculation beyond its material value. Though if it has caused such a fuss, I cannot help but believe there is some truth to that speculation.”

“A fair assumption,” responded Nydas, “but what does that mean?”

The Count stared into his wine, swirling the glass slowly, “it could mean all manner of things, all speculation, however. Objects infused with ether are incredibly rare, and just as powerful. Legends tell of ether infused weapons winning battles against impossible odds, of ether infused armor making soldiers unkillable, of trinkets that bring luck, power, or even madness. Any one of those abilities in the hands of the power hungry vultures present within the castle walls is a dangerous prospect. One which I do not care to see realized.”

Nydas cursed, “damn, if I only had my party with me. Zeris knows much more about ether than I. Any and all of them know more than me, for that matter.”

“Hmm…” Veris hummed in thought, taking another sip of his wine.

Nydas raised an eyebrow, “what is it, Veris?”

The Count shrugged, “perhaps nothing. I am just curious, Zeris is a mage, correct? One that works in ether? Do you think he might have detected such a presence in the artifact? Could that be why Zeris in particular is being interrogated?”

Nydas nodded, “Zeris is indeed an ether mage. If that’s true, why didn’t he tell us about it?”

Count Veris refilled his wine, “you were planning on selling it, I presume it mattered little. Perhaps you can ask him when next you visit the dungeons.”

“Perhaps,” said Nydas, “are there any prevailing theories on what the artifact does?”

“The runic symbols on the glyph are related to the concept of power and control,” Veris explained, “though what that entails, I cannot say.”

Nydas scratched his head, “we could try looking into these runic symbols, see if they lead anywhere.”

“Perhaps. Or if the artifact exchanged other hands. Those in possession of it could have a pattern with how it benefited them,” the Count added.

“An excellent idea!” exclaimed Nydas, “I’m lucky to have your aid, Veris.”

Count Veris smiled, “and I yours, Nydas.”

Nydas bowed to the Count, “then the respect is mutual. Inform me if you obtain any more information on this matter. After running from the guard all evening I am quite tired and must retire for the night. Good morrow, Veris.”

Veris raised is glass, “good morrow, Nydas.”

Nydas raced upstairs to one of the guest rooms and fell onto the bed, exhausted. Though his body was tired his mind was still wide awake with thoughts of Wylan. They lingered and danced in his head, the anticipation building within him, waiting for the next time they met.
