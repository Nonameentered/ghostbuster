I’ve always thought I was a fairly attractive individual, but I’m not Narcissus, staring at a reflection of myself and falling in love with it, at least I thought.
  

  
One might think it boring, to be with someone who shares the exact interests as you, who knows all about you, because then it’s just an echo chamber. Someone different challenges you to try new things, reach new heights, and grow as a person. Having a duplicate of yourself is little better than being alone.
  

  
But that is not the case. There is something special about companionship. Doing the same activity alone and with others is different. There is something more full, more joyful, and more satisfying about the bond.
  

  
I tell you all this to understand how I feel. When I created a duplicate of myself to aid with my arcana, I did not expect to fall in love with them, but that is exactly what happened. I kept telling myself I wouldn’t, how foolish it seemed, that she would never care for me in return. Which, reflecting back on the situation, is ridiculous, considering she was probably having the exact same thoughts. It felt new perhaps because I was so fumbling and oblivious to my duplicate’s mutual affection.
  

  
It started out as a simple work relationship, but we share the same sense of humor so naturally, we made each other laugh. We share the same interests so naturally, we had long conversations about beloved topics, and never got bored of hearing each other’s voices. We found each other attractive, the little lip bites and eyelash bats, the melodic laughs and charming smiles. She made my heart flutter, it felt forbidden, it felt fresh, it felt new. Even though it was me, it was like nothing I had ever experienced before.
  

  
Eventually, I realized I loved her, and confessed. To my surprise, she confessed as well, and now I am happier than ever, because I have her in my life.
