“My great grandfather was a bard, but hardly a grand one. He didn’t sing great ballads of heroes that would be sung and repeated for centuries after his death, he took the less glamourous path of using his songs to raise disease awareness,” I replied.
  

  
Jeremy blinked, “This is not how I expected this story to start. But anyways, he may not be very grand in the traditional sense, but he’s still doing valuable work by raising awareness.”
  

  
I groaned, “That’s what you’d think, but if you heard his songs you’d disagree. I mean, I don’t blame him persay, it’s not easy to rhyme a word with Leukemia. Cry-a-sweeties was his rhyme for diabetes, it’s as bad as you think. His best song was terminal dancer.”
  

  
Jeremy winced, “Oh, you’re right. Well, at least he tried. Did he raise awareness?”
  

  
I shook my head, “Not really. We live in a world of magic where dragons breathe fire and bards can heal people by strumming their guitars, disease is honestly trivial.”
  

  
Jeremy sighed, “Ah, too bad. But I don’t see what any of this has to do with dragon blood.”
  

  
“I’m not finished. Because of my great grandfather’s profession, he met a lot of people in the hospital, did the rounds, tried to cheer them up. It was there that he met the love of his life.”
  

  
“A dragon?”
  

  
“No, she was just an ordinary humanoid, but she had this blood disease. She didn’t have much longer to live and was losing a lot of blood. The doctors had tried various different donors but none took. She needed something stronger. So my great grandfather set out to find her a cure. He looked far and wide, collected blood samples from all sorts of creatures. Elves, dwarves, orcs, gnomes, even goblins, but none took. He was just about to give up when he saw a dragon fly overhead. The dragon was wounded from a recent battle and had a wounded wing, crashing into a forest clearing. My grandfather raced over, ready to help the dragon in anyway he could.”
  

  
“And they….”
  

  
“No! My great grandfather was a gentleman. Once my great grandfather helped heal the dragon and once he had aided them the dragon asked him if there was anything they could do in return for his kindness, and my great grandfather asked for one thing: the dragon’s blood. The dragon agreed and a blood transfusion was made, giving my great grandfather’s love the blood she needed. And guess what? It took! She was saved, but our family line has had dragon blood in it ever since.”
  

  
“Really? Blood works like that?”
  

  
“Dragon blood does, apparently.”
  

  
“I’m not buying it.”
  

  
“Just look up my great grandfather’s songs, it will confirm my story.”
  

  
“I’ll do more than that, I’ll look into your lineage.”
  

  
“Oh don’t get me started on your lineage, your parents are a human and an elf and yet you’re part orc.”
  

  
“I… it’s a long story.”
  

  
“Thought so.”
