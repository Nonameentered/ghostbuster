I still remember what priest told me, “It produces no waste, because it does not fuel simply the body, it fuels the soul. Just as rain is from evaporated water which coalesces, spiritual energy coalesces to form manna.”
  

  
I chewed on the nourishing substance. It was refreshing, but it wasn’t enough. I wondered if there was a way to condense all the manna to me, have it rain down, and reap the spiritual nourishment by the droves.
  

  
He warned against it, but I did not listen. I achieved it in spite of the warnings, the irreverency. My spirit was stronger than any other. I could walk on water, turn it into wine, heal the sick, and even return from the dead.
  

  
Some thought I was the next coming of Christ, but the priest called me something else: The Anti-Christ.
