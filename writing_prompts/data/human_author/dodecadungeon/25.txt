Thank you! And great question! What originally got me into writing was telling stories. I have always needed a creative outlet in my life, switching from outlet to outlet but always going back to storytelling. When I realized that writing captured all the things about a creative outlet that I wanted, I dove right into it. Hmmm... well, one of the great things about writing prompts is I get to experiment a lot with style. I've discovered a love of writing internal monologues, focused only on dialogue for others, and so forth. When I initially joined this sub, I would say one great example of my style is this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/uii6cd/wp\_you\_are\_not\_like\_the\_other\_wizards\_you\_finally/i7dekzl/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/uii6cd/wp_you_are_not_like_the_other_wizards_you_finally/i7dekzl/?context=3)

I hope I linked that right. My response to the Atominomicon prompt was also a pretty good example of that style. I really like making magic systems and using them to solve problems and seeing them in action, though I've developed quite the love of writing wholesome, mushier dialogue heavy stuff as I've done more prompts, so here's one example of that. I'm not sure how to link mine specifically for this but if you look for mine in this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/us7syv/wp\_you\_are\_due\_to\_be\_executed\_for\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/us7syv/wp_you_are_due_to_be_executed_for_your/)

It's a pretty good example. My response to the blind girl and medusa is another good example of that, though there are a lot of my responses that are wholesome and dialogue heavy, especially in my romance Prompt Me. Sorry, that was a bit excessive, I hope I answered your questions!
