Patricia beamed, “happy birthday, Uma!”
  

  
Uma smiled, waiting for Patricia to pull out the arena tickets like every year, but her hands were empty.
  

  
Patricia grinned, “don’t worry, I didn’t forget, I just thought we’d try something better this time.”
  

  
Uma quirked an eyebrow, but Patricia continued, “we’re of age! We can enter the contest.”
  

  
Uma shook her head and shrunk in nervous anxiety. Patricia giggled, “oh come on! We have seen those gladiators fight hundreds of times! We practice with our garden tools, memorizing every move and even making our own! We stand a chance! Besides, your crush Quentin will be performing in the tournament, you might even get to meet him!”
  

  
Uma blushed and took a long moment to think, finally giving a nervous nod in the affirmative.
  

  
Patricia beamed, “wonderful! Come on, it’s off to the races!” She grabbed Uma by the hand and dragged her over to the arena.

“No commoners?” scowled Pactricia, “What do you mean? It doesn’t say anything about it. I checked! It’s not in the rules!”
  

  
The guard sighed, “we say no commoners, so no commoners it is.”
  

  
Patricia nodded, “fine… just give me a second to-” Patricia suddenly tackled the guard, yelling to Uma, “Uma! Now! Run! Get to the tournament before they can stop you!”
  

  
Uma gulped, pointing to Patricia, who shook her head, “I’ll be fine. Now please, you don’t have much time. Enjoy your birthday and live out your dream of finally being in the arena!”
  

  
Uma raced passed the guard, hoping the best for Patricia.

Uma gulped, it was him. Standing before her was Quentin, the legendary gladiator who Uma had admired and crushed on for the last few years. How could she possibly go up against him? She held her sword tight, staring down Quentin. She would just have to give it her all. Perhaps she would even impress Quentin.
  

  
Quentin raced toward her as the starting bell sounded, but Uma knew Quentin’s moveset and ducked under his blade, swinging hers to strike Quentin from behind. She winced as it struck, not wanting to hurt Quentin, fortunately, it was about contact, not damage.
  

  
The two locked blades, dancing around the battlefield together. She imagined they were instead in a ballroom, dancing not with blades but with each other. She smiled at Quentin, hoping to get his attention. His eyes darted around nervously, causing Uma to blush.
  

  
Uma was skilled, but Quentin was the reigning champion and was taking the lead. He knocked Uma to the ground, causing her to gaze up at Quentin, eyes wide, waiting for the final blow. Quentin moved in close, and Uma took her chance while the adrenaline was still rushing, ready to do something incredibly impulsive. It was her birthday after all, she earned a few moments like this. Before Quentin had a chance to react, she grabbed him by the armor and pulled him even close, planting a kiss on his lips.
  

  
Quentin’s face reddened, a smile forming on his face. Uma beamed, that smile was so precious, she wanted to keep it in a jar and cherish it forever. Just then the guards called out to her, causing her to wince. They knew she was the runner who snuck in, she had to leave before things got rough. Blowing Quentin a kiss goodbye, she leaped into the arena audience stands and darted away, smiling brightly.
  

  
Best birthday ever.
