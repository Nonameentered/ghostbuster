“Start slow, the tricks will come later,” Jeff said.
  

  
Grace sighed, “but the tricks look so fun!”
  

  
Jeff chuckled, “I know, I know, but the basics come first, and they can still be fun, now just-”
  

  
“I think I got it!” Grace attempted to do another trick, slipping off the board and crashing onto the cement.
  

  
Jeff gasped and rushed over to her, “Grace! Are you alright?”
  

  
Grace nodded, “I’m fine, I’ve had worse.”
  

  
Jeff winced, he knew exactly what she meant by those last three words. He squatted down next to her and wrapped his arm around her shoulder, “you’re free of that pain now. It’s only a matter of time before you find happiness.”
  

  
Grace blushed, shugging, “maybe, it’s just hard to put myself out there and be vulnerable. I don’t want to get hurt again.”
  

  
Jeff sighed, looking her in the eyes, “Grace, look at me. You are a wonderful woman with a great sense of humor, a brilliant mind, a sharp wit, and a healthy dose of charm. If anyone tries to fuck you over I will personally beat the shit out of them. Because that’s what they deserve for messing with you.”
  

  
Grace giggled, “I appreciate it, Jeff. How do you do it?”
  

  
Jeff blinked, “how do I do what?”
  

  
“Be so confident. Your last relationship wasn’t easy either. How do you get back out there,” Grace said
  

  
Jeff shrugged, “I’m not saying it’s easy, Grace. But we have to move on. I haven’t put myself out there in a while since Georgina left me, but last night I had my first date in six months!”
  

  
Grace tried to hide her disappointment, “oh… um… good for you, Jeff.”
  

  
Jeff sighed, noticing her body language, smiling reassuringly, “you’ll find someone too soon, I know you will.”
  

  
Grace took a deep breath, she liked women, or at least she thought. Why was Jeff making her feel like this? It was silly, but she felt a spark with him. She never wondered what a man’s lips tasted like, or what it felt to be held in his arms, but with Jeff, that was all she could think about.
  

  
Jeff held her close, chuckling, “you know, before I knew you were lesbian, I had quite the crush on you.”
  

  
Grace blushed, “r-really?”
  

  
Jeff smiled, “of course! You’re amazing! I must have acted so silly around you.”
  

  
Grace grinned, “no, you were actually quite cute.”
  

  
Jeff blinked, “I was?”
  

  
Grace nodded, “I just… didn’t feel that way about you at the time.”
  

  
Jeff raised an eyebrow, “at that time?”
  

  
Grace blushed further, “I mean I… I should go, I-”
  

  
Jeff grabbed her hand before she could leave, “Grace, are you alright?”
  

  
Grace sighed, “I don’t know. I… I like you, Jeff. I didn’t think I liked guys, but you… you’re special. I can’t explain it, but when I’m around you I want to be close to you and I think about you way too much and-”
  

  
Jeff cut her off, pulling her in for a kiss, blushing as he pulled away, “I lied. I never stopped thinking about you.”
  

  
Grace smiled, face bright red, then frowned, “but, your girlfriend?”
  

  
Jeff chuckled, “I didn’t get the chance to tell you, that date went terribly, she told me not to call her. I even called her Grace by accident.”
  

  
Grace’s heart fluttered, beaming, “before, I felt fear about hurting myself again with another relationship, but with you, all that fear is gone. I think I’m ready to move on, with you.”
