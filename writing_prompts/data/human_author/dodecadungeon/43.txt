“Well, he’s not an electromancer, electromancers need a source of electrical current to transport themselves into a space, that vault had no electrons running through it,” detective Balaban noted.
  

  
“What about a positromancer? There could be an anti-electron current that we didn’t account for,” postulated deputy Vern.
  

  
Balaban shook his head, “No, none I can detect. There’s no charge either, so a protomancer would have nothing to manipulate, no valences, nothing of that sort.”
  

  
Vern sighed, “Damn. What about an electromancer and a protomancer? They would inject a charge into the vault to manipulate if they worked together?”
  

  
Balaban stroked his chin, “No, there would be traces of charge that remained after they left.”
  

  
“Then what could it be?” Vern asked.
  

  
“Nothing I’ve seen before, that’s for sure.”
  

  
“Could it perhaps be one of the theoreticals?”
  

  
“There would be evidence of it though. You don’t manipulate time as a tachyomancer or gravity as a gravimancer and have it go unnoticed, this is different.”
  

  
“Then what about some type we didn’t account for, something harmless?”
  

  
“Like what, neutrinos? Wait… hold on… are you thinking what I’m thinking?”
  

  
“What? ….You don’t mean?”
  

  
“Neutrinos can pass through practically anything, so why not vaults?”
  

  
“Damn, how do we stop someone who can pass through anything?”
  

  
“There can’t be that many neutrinomancers out there, it’s only a matter of time.” Balaban smiled, Damn, I love my job.”
