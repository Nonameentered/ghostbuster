I always carry a flashlight on me.
  

  
It is incredibly handy when I am running on rooftops, not being superbly athletic, because I can create my own bridge that only I can use. All I need to do is flashlight across and stroll across the beam. I assure you, I’m perfectly sane, or as sane as one can be with the ability to solidify light.
  

  
I can’t shape it, it’s just like an on-off switch. And it can only be a source I am powerful enough to solidify, which means no sunlight. The great thing, however, is that besides being solidified, it behaves just like any other source of light. This means that when I’m being chased on rooftops like I am now, and my pursuer catches up to me, I can take out my flashlight, turn it on, solidify it, and use it like a massive blade. Weightless, which, yes, for those out there who know about force and momentum I’m hitting my opponent with almost no force at all, I can use it as a barrier between my pursuer and myself, and while I can’t hit them very hard, it might cause them to lose enough balance to fall.
  

  
Also, if I get really lucky, I can catch them mid-jump across a rooftop and turn on the light, freezing them in the solidified beam, and then revert it to normal light, all their momentum is lost and they come tumbling down. This ability is not as useful as one might think, however. Yes, I can freeze someone by flashing a light at them, but if I’m not strong enough to drag a person, I won’t be moving at all while that light is still on and my hand is on the flashlight. Sure, if I had a bunch of flashlights with me, I could afford to solidify and then leave them be, though I’m going to need to solidify something else something soon, and only being able to solidify one source at a time, I will have freed them. So making them lose their momentum mid-jump is one of my favorite getaway methods.
  

  
If I happen to be in a well-lit room with opponents, I can still only affect one light source at a time, which serves to my benefit. If I solidified an entire room of light then I would freeze myself too, but this way, I only have to be under a different light source to be safe.
  

  
So why am I being chased over rooftops? Because I stope the world’s most advanced laser. See, my abilities are proportional to the light beam, so a thin beam of light isn’t very useful to me unless it’s strong enough. Then, it’s both thin and strong, which makes it behave rather strangely. It’s malleable, making a perfect portable rope or whip.
  

  
I always carry a flashlight on me, and now, also a laser.
