“Damn, it’s as hot as hell in… no no no no!” I screamed as the world’s temperature began to rise and rise to match my statement, “I mean… it’s seventy degrees outside!”
  

  
I sighed in relief as the temperature dropped, I was going to have to work on my expressions. See, my gift is incredibly powerful, one most would envy. I can manipulate reality because what I say becomes real. Anything I say.
  

  
I’ve accidentally turned multiple people into jackasses, I’ve craved horses, seen a blue moon, and made things actually taste like shit, it’s bad. I have had to be very careful about what I say, but every once in a while I still slip up. I mostly just use my abilities for little things, because I have to be careful. If I want a road to be clear of traffic, what happens to all the cars that were there? I don’t want them gone or teleported across the globe, so I restrain from saying things with unforeseen consequences, at least I try.
  

  
Insults are generally bad, “go to hell,” “you’re an asshole,” and the f-word are things I generally avoid entirely. In fact, most cursing normally leads to unwanted scenarios. So I just use my powers to make food taste better, to make transportation less of an annoyance, get some cash, things like that.
  

  
Though there is one drastic effect that I haven’t changed, it was when I discovered my gift. It was during class and I accidentally called my teacher mom. It was incredibly embarrassing, but to my surprise, she responded, “I’m miss Francis when I’m in class, remember sweetie?” Earning laughter from the class, I suddenly looked down at my classwork to see my last name had changed to Francis.
  

  
It was a surreal experience becoming a stranger in what was formerly my own home and finding a bunch of pictures with me in it at my teacher’s home. Though I feel a tinge of regret for my former family, I never changed it back. By the time I figured out how it had already been a while and I had grown quite fond of my new home. My old parents weren’t perfect, but my teacher was an amazing mother. I would have never told my old family about my ability, but I explained it to her, and she not only understood but helped me out. I don’t always feel like I deserve this life, but I can never bring myself to change things back.
