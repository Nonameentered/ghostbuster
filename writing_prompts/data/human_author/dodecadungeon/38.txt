“It’s not enough,” I sigh.
  

  
Edmund shakes his head, “It’s because you always use a chair.”
  

  
“What does that got to do with it?” I ask.
  

  
Edmund pats my chair, “You don’t really trust me.”
  

  
“Those two phrases aren’t mutually inclusive.”
  

  
“In this case, they are. You can’t fall backward on your own, you lean back on your chair, and knowing you have terrible balance, you’ll fall backward and I’ll catch you. It happens every single time.”
  

  
“That shouldn’t make a difference.”
  

  
“It wouldn’t if you trusted me. I have caught you every time, why don’t you trust me?”
  

  
“I… I’m sorry, I didn’t realize…”
  

  
“I’m not looking for apologies, I know you know why, I just need you to realize it.”
  

  
“My trust has been betrayed before, but that shouldn't affect-”
  

  
Edmund cut me off, “But it does. So, are you going to continue to not trust me?”
  

  
I wince, “Don’t put it like that.”
  

  
“I’ll put it anyway I like,” Edmund responded. “You know we can’t do this without your full trust, and we need to do this soon. So come on, put your past behind you. I’m not Thomas, I won’t betray you.”
  

  
I sigh, “I keep telling myself that… I want to believe it…”
  

  
“Then believe it!” Edmund yelled, holding out his hands, “Fall, prove to yourself that you can trust again!”
  

  
I took a deep breath, standing from the chair and putting my back to him, leaning backward, and falling. As he caught me, we both began to glow, it was working.
