Youth and foolishness were the cause of many my decisions. What can I say? I thought that being with an eldritch entity might be hot and heavy, and… it is, but it’s also very strange. We have to see Naomi’s relatives over the holidays, they’re a strange bunch, but I’ve begun to grow fond of them, especially Naomi’s little cousins.
  

  
The food they eat at the eldritch household… it’s an acquired taste. I wasn’t trying to embarrass Naomi, I’m just not very good at not being sick from slimy food. I also don’t know eldritch etiquette, which is a whole different set of problems.
  

  
She was the one who proposed, I wasn’t expecting such a serious relationship, but if I wanted her, I had to play by her rules. I feel bad about ever seeming reluctant, she is wonderful and tries really hard to navigate my customs, just as I struggle with hers. When we first married, I don’t think I loved her. But really getting to know her, now I can say with confidence, that I do. Thank goodness I fell for that ass, and got to know the wonderful eldritch entity that has it.
