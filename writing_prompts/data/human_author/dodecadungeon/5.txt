“I wish for an audience with Satan,” uttered Orion, getting on his knees before Beelzebub.

The Lord of Flies cackled, the shroud of pests surrounding them murmured and buzzed constantly. A sound that was nearly tortuous to Orion’s perfect ears, “You? What business would an angel have with Satan, the King of the Hells?”

Orion shook his head, “That alone is my business. You know that angels have no desire to visit the hells, it is not an easy journey or a pleasant one, yet still I have come. I bear no weapons, only words. Please, past my request onto Satan.”

“I will do that, but nothing more. It is his choice whether or not to hear your plea,” with that the Lord of Flies disappeared, leaving Orion with nothing to do but wait.

“I wish for an audience with God,” spoke Balor.

“Devil, you are not welcome in the Heavens. You have all been banished as a result of your disobedience before the Fall. What reason have I to let you remain?” the angelic Michael asked.

“You look but you do not see, look at me,” Balor replied.

Michael’s piercing celestial eyes took a moment to analyze Balor before nodding, “I will pass your request onto God.”

Balor nodded, anticipation building as he waited. He got this far, he would not leave without offering his plea.

“You took a dangerous gamble, angel,” the voice was smooth and fluid, perhaps the most beautiful Orion had ever heard. Orion knew immediately that they were confronted with him, the King of Hells. It was the same voice that convinced much of his angel brethren to join him in his betrayal against God. It was not the harsh voice of a creature of Hell, it was the golden choir of one of Heaven.

“Yet here I am,” Orion replied.

“How did you know that I would not send you back to wence you came, or worse?” The last s syllable lingered, like a snake’s slither. Orion knew with certainty this was the being who had cause humanity’s Fall.

“I have heard the stories, you were once an angel who fell. Look upon me and see how I lack wings. I am your kin,” Orion announced.

Satan smirked, “I can smell the sin on you, angel. But not just any sin… your crime is not the impulsive lust, the yawning greed, the self indulgent gluttony, the stubborn sloth, the consuming envy, or the self righteous pride… no… yours is wrath. Not just any wrath… the wrath of others,” Stan slithered around Orion, analyzing him and flickering his tongue to smell the sin.

“Wrath is not just one thing, it was not out of impulse. I do not belong here. You know the intentions of my actions.”

Satan howled with laughter, “Have you learned nothing, fallen one? Do you think I have ever been given another chance? I want nothing more than to rejoin my brethren in Heaven, yet it is an unachievable goal. If there is any being known for his uncooling wrath it is God himself. He does not forget those who sleight him. Not after eons of waiting. You have no hope, wrathful fallen.”

Orion shook his head, “I have not come to you to return me to Heaven, I am not that foolish. I have come to you to make me a devil.”

Satan’s cat-like eyes widened, “A devil? Now you have intrigued me, fallen one.”

Orion smirked, “I can see you are the only one of Hell who has kept his angelic form. Despite the aura of fear you wrap around yourself. Your voice is still as smooth as silk, and the darkness you remain in hide in is not to unveil some creature of horror, it is to hide your fallen wings. Now step into the light and prove me wrong.”

Satan stepped forward. He was indeed an angel. His blonde curls tumbled down his shoulders like golden clouds rolling over a white hill. His eyes were not the fiery orange of Hell’s fire as they first appeared to be, but the glimmering gold of celestial blood. And he was beautiful. Even having seen all the beauty of Heaven, Orion thought perhaps that Satan surpassed even their beauty. His only flaw was two scars where his wings once were.
