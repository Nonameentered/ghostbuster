“Don’t make me debate on this again, Geriffis, it’s like the difference between a handgun and a rifle, it depends on the circumstance,” Aerefiel replied.
  

  
Geriffis sighed, “Come on! You never let me argue with you!”
  

  
Aerefiel shook his head, “When you have a good platform to stand on, I will debate with you.”
  

  
Geriffis scoffed, “You’re just afraid to lose.”
  

  
“You really want to play it that way? Fine, take a side, let’s do this,”
  

  
“Wand.”
  

  
“Alright then I’m staff. A staff is like a rifle. It has more range. A good wizard can eliminate his target before they even approach, able to end a battle before it begins.”
  

  
“But a wand can be concealed, a staff telegraphs your weapon. You have no advantage if you’re jumped.”
  

  
“And do you think anyone would jump a wizard with a staff?”
  

  
“Yes, staves aren’t optimal and short ranges.”
  

  
“Not as an arcane focus, sure, but as a weapon, they work grand.”
  

  
“So only if you have martial training they’re better, that’s conditional. You can’t base an argument on that.”
  


“And how exactly is a wand better?”
  

  
“Think about your own comparison with rifles verses handguns. Most people carry handguns because they require less skill, they’re better in a broader range of scenarios, and they can be concealed.”
  

  
“So if a wizard lacks skill, choose a wand, if they don’t, take a rifle. Assassins use rifles, thieves use handguns. We’re wizards, are we to settle for mediocre?”
  

  
“You can’t carry multiple staves without difficulty. If you’re disarmed or your weapon breaks, you are left vulnerable.”
  

  
“But it can’t be used against you, fewer wizards are skilled with staves. Is I disarm your wand, I have a new weapon to use against you.”
  

  
“But I can also have a backup wand. You’re not making the grand argument you think you are.”
  

  
“Power. Staves channel arcane energy better.”
  

  
“Still, that ain’t going to do much in close combat.”
  

  
“Really? I can unleash a thunderstrike from the sky, you can only give me a shock. You can whisper a phrase to influence someone’s mind but I can boom my voice and make a whole legion bow to me knees. Power is not something to take lightly.”
  

  
“Show me then,” Geriffis drew his wand and smirked, his opponent did the same with his staff. Their wizard’s duel would settle this once and for all.
