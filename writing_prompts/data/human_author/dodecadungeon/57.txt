“The war abroad, with Bethanla? I don’t believe I am the one to explain such matters with you, my prince.”

Wylan shook his head, “I trust your expertise, Rene. This situation is complex, and so far you have been very adept at making complex things seem simple.”

Rene sighed, “That is because I leave out far too many details, Your Highness.”

“What details have you left out in prior briefings?” the prince inquired.

“Nothing you were prepared for,” Rene answered, “For example, when we discussed the social status divide, I could have mentioned that one of the reasons for that upset is the conflict with Bethanla.”

Wylan raised his eyebrow, “Truly?”

Rene nodded, “Though they may not be the ones fighting in the battles, whose soil do you think it is fought on? Certainly not noble homesteads, but rather peasant fields. Do you see now how that might cause upset?”

“I do. You call it a conflict, what makes that different from a war?”

“The kingdom calls it a war, I do not. There is nothing noble in a conflict, a war has a cause to justify it.”

“No just cause? Surely you must be mistaken. If there wasn’t one, why would my father begin such a war in the first place?”

“Your father is not the only one who makes decisions within the castle. Those involved in military affairs are very powerful. Not to mention that they are run only by nobles, meaning that they have no reason to think of the peasants in their conflict.”

“Does my father know there is no just cause?” Wylan asked, “Could he by chance attempt to end it? Perhaps he simply hasn’t been told about the damage to peasant land? If so, we could change that.”

Rene sighed, “Your father is much too ill at present, and his condition has worsened. While he is this ill, the noble court has ruled him too ill to rule.”

Wylan gasped, “They can’t do that! They can’t simply take away my father’s power. And if so, wouldn’t that power go to me?”

Rene shook his head, “The rules state clearly that you only rule if the King is dead, which, at present, he is not.”

Wylan cursed, “Dammit! But I still don’t understand, if there is no just cause to the war, and it kills soldiers who are nobles, why would the noble court start this war? It seems a loss for all parties involved.”

“That is where you are wrong, I’m afraid. When I mentioned leaving out the details, these are the kind of things I mean. If you were to go to another within this castle, I’m sure they would disagree with me that there is no just cause. Though, considering my background, I have a bit of a difference perspective.”

“Then tell me, what am I missing?”

“I am meant to be your advisor, not an influencer. I have not been impartial, and that will only worsen if I continue to explain my perspective on the situation.”

“I don’t care. I need to know what’s going on.”

Rene sighed, “I cannot tell you the full extent of the details, but I can tell you where to look. Follow the money, Wylan.”

Wylan blinked, “Follow the money? What does that mean?”

Rene shrugged, “I cannot say much more, only that the castle has quite the sum of wealth. Where does it all go? It is the prince’s job to know such things, something I hope you do a better job at keeping track of than your father.”

Wylan nodded, “I will do my best to keep track of the royal funds, sir.”

Rene smiled, “Good, and thank you, Your Highness”

Wylan raised an eyebrow, “For what?”

Rene grinned, “For letting me advise.”

Wylan chuckled, “It’s about time I let you help.”

Rene laughed, “It would appear so, good luck, Wylan.”

Wylan nodded and headed down the hall. Follow the money, what did Rene mean? Wylan pondered Rene’s advice in his head as he walked, heading toward the royal treasury. He assumed he’d have access to the place, for he was the crown prince after all. He chuckled to himself, he really should have a better understanding of what authority the prince had. The first time he learned about his authorities, the ability to hold endless galas was the only thing he needed to hear, but not anymore.

He walked up to the secretary outside the facility, giving them an amiable smile and slight bow, “Good morning to you. I was wondering if it would be possible to get a list of royal ledgers tracking the funds spent by this treasury.”

The secretary frowned, “That is quite the tall order. What did you say your name was again?”

Wylan chuckled, “Do you not recognize me? I’m the crown prince!”

The secretary gulped, “Oh my! I’m terribly sorry, it’s been a while since I last saw what the prince looks like. I don’t attend many galas and you don’t often make appearances at the royal treasury.”

Wylan chuckled, though was internally saddened. Was that really the reputation he had earned? Of a partying, irresponsible prince? He sighed, he supposed it was true, but it didn’t make it hurt any less. Perhaps there was still time to change that, however. “Ah, fair enough. So, would it be possible to see those ledgers?”

The secretary flipped through their papers, humming to themselves, “It would be possible, how far back do you want to see?”

Wylan thought to himself. He couldn’t outright say the start of the war, that would be suspect. He tried to remember when the war started. It was a few years ago, perhaps? He decided five years would be wise, just in case. He smiled, “Going back to five years prior, please.”

The secretary gasped, eyes wide, “That is quite the tall order, Your Highness. It will take some time to gather.”

Wylan frowned, he should have expected that five years would be a lot. Though his spendings in five years wouldn’t have made an incredibly long list, would it? He nodded, “That will be fine, thank you.”

The secretary nodded back, “You will be notified when they are ready. Your Highness.”

Wylan smiled, “I’ll be looking forward to their arrival.” He bowed and headed out, turns out he wasn’t half bad at being an investigator, even without Acrasia’s help.
