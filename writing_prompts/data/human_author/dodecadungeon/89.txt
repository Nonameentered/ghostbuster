Rakanmain54: A Xayah main! You’re like a unicorn!
  

  
SwainIsHot: That’s a nice way of putting it lol. A Rakan main! It’s nice to see one of those too.
  

  
Rakanmain54: Too bad our team is totally going to win!
  

  
SwainIsHot: I wouldn’t be so confident if I were you, you lost your last match.
  

  
Rakanmain54: You keep track of our team?
  

  
SwainIsHot: Of course, we’re in the same bracket, you’re not half bad.
  

  
Rakanmain54: You’re great! If only our teams had both a Xayah and Rakan, the synergy would be incredible.
  

  
SwainIsHot: Yeah, too bad the only Rakan player I know is you.
  

  
Rakanmain54: I’m considering transferring teams next year, have any spots open?
  

  
SwainIsHot: There might just be, I’ll put in a good word for you!
  

  
Rakanmain54: I can’t wait to meet you, I have a feeling we’ll make a great team!
  

  
SwainIsHot: Oh don’t make me blush! But I agree, I can’t wait either.
