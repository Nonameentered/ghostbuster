“Look, babe, you deserve some time to relax, the benefits are immeasurable,” Jason said.
  

  
Frederica chuckled, “sleeping is not a science, Jason, nor is it a hobby.”
  

  
Jason rolled his eyes, “you just say that because you haven’t explored it like I have, come on, give it a chance!”
  

  
Frederica shook her head, “I’m a busy person, I’m not compromising time in my day to do nothing.”
  

  
Jason sighed, “you are putting this in a very skewed perspective.”
  

  
Frederica chuckled, “no, it’s just the truth. I’m going to the gym, you should come. I haven’t had a partner to work out with in ages.”
  

  
Jason smiled, “see, I’m not really into exerting myself.”
  

  
Frederica giggled, “you’re lucky you’re cute you lazy dork.”
  

  
Jason grinned, “so am I.”
  

  
Frederica scratched her head, “why do you even want me to sleep with you anyway? I mean.. Um.. you know what I mean, actual sleep.”
  

  
Jason laughed, “I doubt that’ll be the last of that joke. Well, I want you to relax with me because I think an angel like you deserves it, plus, laying down together is a perfect opportunity for cuddles.”
  

  
Frederica smiled, “I take that back, you’re not just cute, you’re very cute. I never thought about it like that.”
  

  
Jason grinned, “that’s alright, sleeping does sound like a silly use of time at first. And might I ask you the same? Why do you want me to work out with you?”
  

  
Frederica smirked, “I see you admiring my abs, Jason. You want them too, you just don’t have the willpower to work for them. Let me help you. And we’re a couple, I enjoy spending time with you and sharing my interests with you, and this means a lot to me. Also..” she blushed, “you make me smile and laugh, and I could really use that in the gym when I just need a little extra motivation.”
  

  
Jason blushed, “I definitely wouldn’t mind abs. Th-thanks, babe. We make an odd pair, but I’m glad you took a chance on this lazy cutie.”
  

  
Frederica giggled, “I am too. Now get your gym clothes, we’re headed out!”
  

  
Jason smiled, “only if afterward we take some time to rest!”
  

  
Frederica smiled, “of course! We’ll just have to work extra hard to tire ourselves out.”
  

  
Jason groaned, “the things I do for love.”
