Why is she nervous?
  

  
I asked myself that question every day, wondering why the gorgeous woman in the back of the room tried to pretend like she didn’t exist.
  

  
Night school wasn’t the best crowd for successful individuals. You had a fair share of those poor folks who never got a proper education because their home life was messier than those houses on the Hoarders show. Some had to go back to school to get some credentials for work, some abandoned whatever career they had and tried to get a different one late in the game. I always wondered what her story was.
  

  
She liked turtleneck dresses, or sometimes she would wear scarves and chokers. She probably had something she wanted to hide on her neck, but I couldn’t fathom what it was. She was too young to have gotten that hole in her neck like some lifetime smokers have, I didn’t see any ring on her finger, so probably not an abusive husband, abusive boyfriend perhaps? Or maybe it was just a birthmark, scar, or rash. Still, I wish I knew. Not for my own curiosity, but for her own safety. If it was a scar, I would try to ease the pain of the past that led her to keep covering it up after all this time, if it was a bruise, I would show whoever gave it to her some manners. It was strange, while I never said a word to her, I felt as if I would do anything for her. Anything for her smile, anything to see the faint glint in her eye when she got excited in class, anything to hear her voice, which she so rarely used.
  

  
I wanted to go up to her, to finally learn her story, but something stopped me each time. She was hard to catch. The moment nightschool ended she would disappear from the classroom like a phantom, headed back to whatever unsatisfying life she had. And I knew it was unsatisfying because her eyes had the same hunger that mine have, hungry for something more, hoping that life was more to offer than what we were currently getting from it.
  

  
The dress didn’t hide her statuesque figure. She was like a mythical goddess, so tall and strong, so graceful and beautiful. I imagined why she had such a powerful physique. Perhaps she was a manual laborer, doing hard labor and building muscles, attending night school to learn another trade to do something else with her life, something that could truly satisfy her, provide her with an escape.
  

  
This morning I told myself that I would finally go up and talk to her. She occupied so much of my thoughts, I would forever regret it if I didn’t at least try to talk to this woman. I put on my best clothes, got a haircut to clean up my look, practiced what I would say in the mirror, put on my best scent, and headed out to night school half an hour early, hoping to catch her before she entered and finally talk to her.
  

  
I waited the entire time, doing nothing but looking around for her. She never came.
  

  
The entire class I stared at the door, hoping she would stride into the room the sneaky way she does, trying to keep the least amount of eyes on her as possible. She never came.
  

  
I waited outside after class, looking for her desperately, as foolish as it was. She never came.
  

  
Only a few days later I learned she died in a car accident. Her life is still a mystery to me. I sometimes lie away and wonder if I had gotten to know her, would I have been able to save her?
  

  
I imagine what that alternate world might have been like. Perhaps she and I would have carpooled to nightschool that day, I could have let her know a car was incoming, taking the wheel and serving out of the way, saving us both. I would have gotten to know her, learn the secret behind her scarves, her nervous stature, her strength. I would have gotten to see that secret smile, witness that little glimmer, and hear that beautiful voice.
  

  
And she would be alive.
