I'm happy to hear that! I'm glad you're enjoying this story! Thank you so much for all your kind words! Here's the next part! - 

“His Majesty will see you now.”

Wylan nodded to the guard, entering the throne room. It felt strange, being in such a grand room. As a child he was in awe of the throne, the majesty of the King’s position, and the noble enterprise of the crown. Now, however, all he saw were shackles. A throne of chains and a crown of confinement, beckoning him into their clutches, never to be free again.

He rarely entered this room anymore, and these days he saw less and less of his father. He was either busy, ailing, or abroad. Wylan barely recognized the man that stood before him. He was not the fiery red-haired orator and general who once stirred an entire army into a victory against impossible odds, he was a tired grey-haired old man who sat in his chair more like a scholar than a man of action. All of that fervor and zeal had dwindled to a simmer, replaced by an aura of placid calm.

His father nodded to Wylan, beckoning him forward, “ah, my son. It is good to see you. What brings you to my chambers at this hour.”

“It is Rene, father,” answered Wylan.

The King raised an eyebrow, “Rene? Is he insufficient in his duties?”

Wylan shook his head, “more like endlessly bothersome. As the next in line I must think for myself, but Rene is controlling my every move.”

His Majesty scratched his beard, “curious. Explain to me in what way Rene is acting this way? I have not had the time to observe him more closely.”

Wylan nodded, “of course. Rene views certain duties beneath him. I urged him to draft a letter and he refused to carry it out.”

The King chuckled, “Wylan, did you ever consider that Rene is not a simple messenger, but rather your advisor?”

Wylan shook his head, “No. Rene is not my advisor. Benedict will be my advisor when I ascend.”

“For how long? Both Bennedict and I are aging. You have a long life ahead of your, Benedict requires a successor.”

“Must it be Rene? He holds no respect for me or the position.”

“Son, I am not ignorant of your misdeeds. Your galas, your frivolity. You shirk duties and step on authority.”

“You were the same when you were my age.”

“I grew up, Wylan. It is time for you to do the same.”

Wylan gritted his teeth, “and Rene is not the man for that job.”

The King sighed, “is he not? Or do you not want him to be?”

Wylan paused, “I… Rene is antagonistic to me. I will get little done if my so-called advisor and I cannot get along.”

The King smiled, “then make an effort to. If that fails, make him your competitor. Prove his low opinion of you wrong. I believe in you, son. You will make an excellent King one day, but you have to put in the effort to fill that role.”

Wylan shook his head, “that’s not me, father. I cannot carry the same burdens on my shoulder as you.”

Wylan’s father leaned forward, “Wylan, you cannot deny this future forever. You fear the lack of freedom of royalty, but you have blinded yourself to the benefits of the position. Being able to enact real change is a blessing. Most people have grand ambitions for making the world a better place, but lack the resources to carry it out. You do not.”

His Highness threw up his hands, “then have one of those ambitious dreamers inherit the throne, not me!”

The King’s face grew stern, “Wylan! Stop acting like a pechulant child. You have a destiny to rise to. I don’t have much time left in my rule. You must make me proud.”

Wylan raised an eyebrow, “not much time? But you said-”

“The world is changing, Wylan,” the King interrupted, “there are many who have a unified vision of the future. One that excludes me.”

“Wha- father? Are you in danger?” asked Wylan, fear showing in his eyes.

The King turned his gaze downward, “go, Wylan. And listen to Rene. You must not make the same mistakes I did.”

Wylan’s heart pounded in his chest, “father? Father! Answer me!”

The King gave a glance to the guards and then nodded toward Wylan, the two guards leaping into action and restraining Wylan. Wylan struggled against their grasp, but to no avail. The guards dragged him out of the throne room, hurling him into the hall and locking the massive entry door behind them.

Wylan ran up to the door and banged against it, screaming and cursing. Though his strength began to sap, leaving his patting weakly against the door before curling up against it, defeated. There was so little left to bring him joy in this castle, only thoughts of the masked man brought about by reading Acrasia’s romance draft brought him repose. The looming future of the throne was fast approaching, and he was everything but ready.
