I have another one ready already lol, I'm getting more curious of where my story is going as I get deeper in. Thanks for the interest and I hope you enjoy part 4! - 

“What’s wrong, Nydas?” Selvin asked.

“I don’t like this, I think we’re being set up,” responded Nydas.

“What makes you think that?” questioned Selvin.

“Count Veris isn’t normally early. He made sure to set up guards, maybe even traps. Time can give someone with his resources a lot of advantages,” answered Nydas.

“The Count has done nothing but aid us this entire time. He has respect for people like us and hatred for the nobility. What would possibly make him consider setting us up?” Selvin inquired.

Nydas shrugged, “I’m just telling you what I see. I don’t think this is a good idea. We’d be going in blind and vulnerable.”

Selvin opened his mouth to retort but Reese put a hand on his shoulder, quieting him. Resse smiled, walking over to Nydas, “Nye, it’s okay to be nervous. We stole from royalty, this is a big haul, one that puts a target on our backs. But we can trust the Count, that we all know for certain. Let’s get this over with, the sooner we offload this artifact, the sooner we can get out of this city and go somewhere safe.”

Nydas winced at the thought of leaving the city, of leaving that mysterious prince, “even if we trust the Count, this isn’t part of his M.O. He could have a knife to his throat or have been blackmailed into setting us up. I can name quite a few individuals who would want us caught or dead.”

Reese shook her head, “we talked with our contacts. Most of the people who would want to set us up are far away from the crown city. We have no reason to believe that we’re being set up.”

“But it pays to be cautious.”

“Fine, what do you propose?”

“We postpone the dealings until we can find a safe place we both agree on.”

Selvin shook his head, “this is ridiculous! We could ruin the deal. The longer we wait the longer the city guard will have to try and find us. We need to do this now.”

Reese nodded, “Selvin’s right. If you have any other precautions we can take, we’ll gladly put those in place, otherwise, we’re reading in now.”

Nydas sighed, “fine. All of you head in, but let me hang back and keep an eye on the guards and surroundings. I’m of no use as a negotiator anyway.”

Selvin shrugged, “seems acceptable to me.”

Reese turned to Nydas, “just be careful, alright?”

Nydas nodded, “I always am.”

He watched as the rest of the party headed in to confront Count Veris, lingering behind and finding a ledge to perch himself upon, scanning the streets below. Truth was that there was no reason to fear that this deal might go wrong. But the minute the deal was done, his group planned to leave the city and hide away somewhere safe, somewhere away from the prince.

Nydas knew it was silly to think that he could accomplish anything with the prince by staying in the city, but still, something within him told him he had to try. The voices disappeared when he was around him, he felt free, he felt like himself. Now they had returned, their pain eased only by action and thoughts of the prince. He had to see him again, he had to stay in the city, if only to try to meet him once more.

It was a selfish desire, putting his party at risk to find the prince once more, and he cared for his group too much to leave them. So he stalled. Hoping that it would give him enough time to find a way to reunite with the prince.

Though Nydas’ musings were soon interrupted by a crash and a scream, coming from within the hideout, the meeting place of his party and the Count. Nydas gasped in shock, leaping down from his perch and clinging to the shadows as he dashed toward the hideout, following the sounds of chaos and action.

But it was too late. It was a set up, and Nydas hadn’t been there to stop it. His head wasn’t in the right place. Instead of thinking of his friends, he daydreamed about a prince he had met once. He had to get his party back, he couldn’t lose any more allies. Not again.
