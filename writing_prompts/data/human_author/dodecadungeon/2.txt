“I’ve looked back through the Senate voting records. I’m still getting a hang of reading in Galactic Standard, so it was slow work, but I think it was worth it. Look at these,” Captain Lancaster said, pointing to the voting charts. Who votes the same as the human colony every single time?”
  

  
Lt. Rochester blinked, “The Athelieds, but it can’t be, they’ve been so hospitable. They even helped us learn to read Galactic Standard, just as they did for the humans. You don’t really think they’re pulling the strings do you?”
  

  
Captain Lancaster nodded, “I do. It may just seem like kindness at first, but there’s no mistaking something is off here. The colony said the Athelieds have been helping them ever since their inception. In fact, comparing the values and government between the colony and Athelied society, they’re almost identical.”
  

  
“So what are you saying?” asked Lt. Rochester.
  

  
“I’m saying that we never found out who abducted the humans in the first place. And I’m willing to hedge my bets that it was the Athelieds.”
  

  
“And how do you go about proving this theory? There is nothing about abduction in the colony, the humans there told us so.”
  

  
“Nothing they can read. Didn’t you notice they were all speaking and writing in Galactic Standard? Some still speak in their native languages, but they write in Galactic Standard. Remember when the Athelieds were first helping us learn Galactic Standard? They taught us how to speak it, and then since Galactic Standard script is just the sound wave equivalent, we could just directly translate to writing from there. They don’t understand characters that represent words or sounds, let alone punctuation. I’m willing to bet neither human nor Athelied has read those accounts since the colonies establishment.”
  

  
“Do such accounts still exist?”
  

  
“The Founding Musuem. I’ll head there and see what I find. See if you can get a meeting with the Senate while I do so. The moment this breaks we’re going to need a hearing. This can’t continue any longer.”
  

  
Lt. Rochester nodded, “Understood.”

Captain Lancaster strolled back into their shared quarters and placed his stack of journals on the table, “Rochester, you have got to see this. I was right! But it’s worse than we thought. Apparently the Athelieds had some way of swaying the humans to their will, to convince them to go along with everything. That’s how they pulled this off. Rochester?”
  

  
Rochester stepped out of the darkness, a bright smile on his face, “It’s alright, Lancaster. The Athelieds will take care of everything… everything.”
  

  
Lancaster’s eyes widened, “No, not you too, Rochester. Dammit!”
  

  
Rochester leaped for Lancaster, attempted to restrain him. He spun out of the way and clocked his partner in the face, wincing, “I’m sorry old friend, I’ll fix this… I’ll fix this.” He raced out of the room, though as he rushed through the dimly lit halls he say tall, carpaced creatures striding toward him: the Athelieds.
