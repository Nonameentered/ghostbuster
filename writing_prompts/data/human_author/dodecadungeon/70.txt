Thank you for reading as always! Here's the next part! - 

“So their employer is definitely on the inside. I know their agenda has something to do with wanting a new regime, one that cares not of tradition nor nobility, but rather prioritizes skill and ability over bloodline. Beyond that, I know little,” Nydas explained.

Count Veris nodded, “thank you, Nydas. It couldn’t have been easy, infiltrating the guard like that.”

Nydas shrugged, “could have been worse. The question now is about your next move. What do we do?”

Veris stroked his chin, “you’re asking the right questions. We’ll have to get on the inside if we want to learn more. Even if the crown guard did know more than what you divulged, I doubt it’s much. The people in power are the ones with the real information.”

“I concur. The prince is holding another gala tomorrow night, if we can find a way in perhaps we have a chance. But it won’t be easy after the stunt my group pulled. They must know we entered through the gala, they most likely would have tightened security. We’ll have to think of another way in…”

The Count smiled, “oh, no worries. I have an invitation.”

Nydas rolled his eyes, “of course you do.” He sighed, “but it’s not a masquerade. I can’t show my face, especially considering that I’m wanted by the entire crown guard.”

Veris smirked, “that won’t be a problem either. You can simply go as one of my bodyguards. Wearing a helmet is not suspicious behavior for a guard. While I’m at the gala, you’ll have free roam of the castle. All the security will be focused on the gala. It will be the perfect opportunity for espionage.”

“Veris, you sneaky genius!” exclaimed Nydas. “That’s perfect.” Nydas’ enthusiasm faded a little. He had hoped to enter the gala and encounter the prince again, but he knew that the Count’s plan was the best way.

The Count frowned, “something wrong?”

Nydas sighed, “nothing. Nothing at all.” He paused, thinking, “actually… one of the crown guards was named Diane. She seemed to be the captain of the others. Does that name ring any bells at all?”

Veris nodded, “she is indeed the captain of the guard. I don’t know many specifics, but she has applied to be a part of the royal military force multiple times and was refused each and every time, yet she continues sending her application. It is unlikely that a guard, let alone a commoner, can find a home in the military.”

Nydas grinned, “excellent! Veris, would it be possible to try and dig up the records of any guard who has applied to the military? Preferably commoners who have been denied access to military ranks?”

“I can do that, but why?” asked the Count.

“Some of the guards discussed their frustration with being barred from the military. I wouldn’t be surprised if this team was assembled by someone who played into these guards’ desire to rise up the ranks, promising to eliminate noble elitism to gain the support of these excluded, skilled commoners,” answered Nydas.

Count Veris smiled, “I like your thinking. I will see what I can do.”

“Thank you, Veris. Now, you’ll be the only one of us in the gala tomorrow night, so I need you to gather as much information you can on strife within the castle. Rumors of some pro-commoner faction rising up. Anything you can find on any guard among Diane’s regiment, make a note of it,” explained Nydas.

“Understood, and what will you be doing?” asked the Count.

Nydas smirked, “I’m a rogue. I’m going to do what I do best, break into places. I believe my friends are held somewhere within the castle. I just have to find out where.”

“The castle is a big place, make sure you’re back to the carriage on time,” warned Veris.

Nydas nodded, “I will. Oh, and the guards said that their employer was one of them. I’m not sure what that means, but look for any correlations between the guards and the ballgoers, perhaps we’ll get lucky.”

Veris grinned, “good idea. I’ll see what I learn.”

“Great,” Nydas scratched his chin, “I just hope I look good in a guard uniform.”
