Life here isn’t a right, it’s a privilege.
  

  
Electricity is our lifeblood. It fuels our bodies and gives us strength. The more electricity we have, the stronger we are, the more we can store, and the longer we live. Those without it wheeze with weakness, struggling to survive.
  

  
Flickers, or those who are electricity-poor, resort to anything to get a little charge. The issue is that they are weak, so they can rarely win through crime, asking someone to give you electricity or die is an empty threat when you can barely hold a weapon let alone stand. Some resort to siphoning off energy at power plants, the security is tight, and the punishments strict for siphoning, but still, they’re desperate, hungry, and dying.
  

  
Others hold up lightning rods to the sky during a storm, praying they get struck by lightning. Praying they are chosen, empowered. Lightning strikes can change someone’s life in an instant, going from weak and poor to rich and strong. And once you’re rich, you only get richer. Empowered by lightning, those with energy, called The Charged, feel it is their right to have energy, to be powerful.
  

  
The Charged belittle those below them, forcing them to give up their electricity, and they are powerless to stop them. But The Charged are few, and the Flickers are many. We may be scattered, fighting each other for scraps, forming gangs, and killing one another to survive, but it doesn’t have to be that way.
  

  
A movement has begun, one that sees through the folly of our ways, of our life, and imagines something better. One that urges the Flickers to unite and overpower The Charged once and for all. Once we overthrow those in power, we can make a new system. We just have to hold out hope. Lightning is rare, but once in a while, it will strike. Just like us.
