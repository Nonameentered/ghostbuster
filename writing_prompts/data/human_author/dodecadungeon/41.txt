“I drove to work today.”
  

  
I grinned and snapped my fingers and the man who just spoke those words was suddenly in a golf uniform. I’ve always been one for wordplay. Normally it would just cause those around me to groan in annoyance, but now, I had the last laugh. There are so many meanings that can be evoked by a single sentence based off the context, who is saying it, and how it’s said. But without that, what happens? Well, I control the answer to that.
  

  
My power isn’t all that useful in most situations. It can’t be anything I say, and I have to hear what is said. I like talking, and this power encourages me instead to listen. Sometimes I try to do things to evoke specific responses from others. Like at my school we had this really filthy laboratory that I hated working in, so one time I brought a labrador dog there just to evoke the response, “This lab is so cute!” to get the laboratory to look better. I know, it was a terrible wordplay, not my finest, but it got the job done.
  

  
Well, at least I thought my power wasn’t all that useful. See, I was minding my own business, going to the bank. Yes, an actual bank, I know most people just use Venmo now or whatever but I like to have physical money, as much as that may surprise some. But that’s not the point. During my trip, there was a break-in by robbers, actual thieves, like in the movies when they tell all the people in the bank to get down and shepherd everyone to one place. Like that.
  

  
Anyway, one of the robbers said, “Hand over all your cash!” That’s not going to do, of course, so I give him a blank stare. “Hand over all of your money.” He said, more slowly this time.
  

  
I answer, “huh?” and with a frustrated expression, he responds again, this time louder and slower.
  

  
“Hand over all your currency,” he probably thought he was being smart, covering all the bases, but, he’s one of those people who adds an unnecessary t sound saying “current-cy” and was struck by a healthy dose of electron volts.
  

  
I know, once again, that the punchline for this story was a terrible joke. But it saved the day, didn’t it? In the end, while I essentially became a hero for a bad pun, I was a hero nonetheless. And isn’t that what matters?
