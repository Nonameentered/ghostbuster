They're a great duo :) Here's the next part! - 

Rene was punctual as always for their meeting. Fortunately, for the second time today, Wylan was not late.

“So, I see you’ve chosen to be cooperative,” said Rene.

Wylan suppressed a groan, this conversation may not be as bearable as he thought. Still, he had to try, “I suppose that’s one way of putting it. I was curious as to the current political problems of our nation.”

Rene blinked, “that is no simple thing to explain.”

Wylan nodded, “I am aware, that is why I requested an expert. You.”

Rene smirked, “that’s a bold statement, but I will try to live up to it. Though the political climate is complex. I will start with as simple a summarization as I can give.”

“I appreciate the simplification,” responded Wylan.

Rene smiled, “I’m sure you do. Now, first, the political climate within the nation. As you know, there are different degrees of status within the kingdom. The royals at the top, they are the leaders. The nobles are next, the warriors. And lastly, the commoners, which include everyone else.”

“That much I understand. Though there are exceptions, are they not?” inquired Wylan.

Rene raised an eyebrow, “what do you mean?”

Wylan shrugged, “well, like you. You’re not of noble birth, yet you are a political figure, a noble and royal occupation.”

Rene nodded, “a good observation. Sometimes ability supercedes status.”

Wylan scratched his chin, “and who determines that?”

“Those in power, mostly, which means it is rare for them to choose a commoner, as the nobles and royals often view them as unworthy,” explained Rene.

“Do you dislike me?” asked Wylan.

Rene blinked, “what?”

Wylan repeated the question, “do you dislike me? I can hear the disdain in your voice. You feel that you are unfairly viewed and treated by nobles and royals, is that right?”

Rene shrugged, “in an ideal world, I would prefer better treatment, yes. But I am lucky to have the position I have. My own thoughts on the matter should not affect my duties. I am here to inform you the political state of the nation, that is all.”

“But you do find me troublesome,” noted Wylan.

Rene sighed, “well of course I do, but it has nothing to do with your royal blood. As I said, you will inherit the throne, and you are far from ready at present. I would not have only failed in my job, but also my country, if I can not prepare you for the crown.”

Wylan turned his eyes downcast, “I apologize for my behavior, it was foolish. I was afraid of the crown, but I know that won’t change anything.”

Rene shook his head, “there is no need to apoligize, but that means a lot nonetheless. I know this is a difficult time for you, which is why I appreciate your attempts to make an effort. Oh, and I drafted the letter for you to the tutor, would you like me to send it?”

Wylan smiled, “I appreciate the gesture, but no. I think I’d like to write my own apology, if that’s alright.”

Rene grinned, “that is more than alright, your Highness.”

Wylan nodded, “excellent, now, where were we?”

“The political state of our nation,” Rene continued, “there has been a poor harvest season this year. The harvest is produced by the commoners, so, the nobles are upset at the commoners for their poor harvest. The commoners, however, are being taxed and punished for the low harvest, which in turn puts them in a dire situation that gives them less resources for a successful harvest, which leads to a crisis. We need more funds to buy our produce from abroad, funds which the taxes provide, though it could have negative consequences long term, understand?”

Wylan scratched his head, “somewhat. The taxes could also create a further divide between commoners and nobility, correct?”

Rene smirked, “indeed. Now, a question. If you were in the throne, what would your solution be to fix this?”

Wylan hummed in thought, “perhaps tax both the nobility and commonfolk? That would give us funds for produce, but without too much burden on either the group.”

“Not terrible, but then you are potentially earning the ire of both the nobility and the commonfolk,” explained Rene.

Wylan shrugged, “that’s fine.”

Rene raised an eyebrow, “how so?”

Wylan smiled, “the problem is the divide between the commonfolk and nobility, correct? Then if we unify them with a common issue and problem, taxes and the royals, then they will turn their attention away from each other.”

Rene smiled, “ah, clever. I am pleasantly surprised, your Highness. I did not expect that you were willing to make such sacrrifices.”

Wylan grinned, “I was bound to earn their ire sooner or late, why not do something productive while I’m at it.”

Rene chuckled, “a fair point. Shall I continue explaining?”

Wylan nodded, “I’d like that very much.”
