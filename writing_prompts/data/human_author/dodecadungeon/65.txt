Your interest in the story has encouraged me to keep writing it, thank you, and I'm glad this story helped. Here's the next part - 

Wylan couldn’t believe it took him even a moment to recognize the thief. All the features matched. Dazzling amber eyes, hair like the midnight sky, skin like a bronze statue, a face like the moon, almost always partially obscured but when the light exposes it, it couldn’t be more lumiscent. His smile was like a virus, if it was present, he would surely catch it and find himself smiling too.

Nothing felt real as the pair danced, to have found him again was more than luck. Perhaps it was destiny, or even love. Wylan shook the thought away, he was getting ahead of himself. His dancing partner was still a thief, it was possible he was toying with his heart once again. But part of him didn’t care. As long as he could be with Nydas, he was happy. He only wished the moment could last forever. Carrying out an eternal dance with the charming thief, enjoying eternal bliss forevermore.

Time, however, stops for no one. Wylan knew the dance would end, and he would eventually have to part with Nydas once more. He racked his brain for a way to reunite with Nydas. Perhaps another gala? It was a possibility, they could continue meeting at balls, dancing with one another each time, finding bliss in each other’s arms. Though Wylan wanted more. Nydas was a skilled thief after all, perhaps he could make use of his expertise.

Their hearts seemed to beat in unison as they spun and slid across the dance floor, gazes locked and breath quick as they smiled at each other. This felt more like some simple con or charm, this felt real. It had to be, Wylan desperately wanted to believe Nydas cared for him. He had given him his name after all, at least, he believed Nydas was the thief’s name. He hoped it was.

Wylan wasn’t sure how long the pair danced. Unsure if seconds, minutes, or hours had passed. All he knew was that when the music stopped, he was beaming and breathless, eyes wide and face red. There was a shout, Wylan turning to see crown guards heading right toward them.

Nydas turned to Wylan, sighing, “they’re after me, I have to go.” There was a sadness in his voice at their parting, a feeling Wylan felt as well.

Wylan grasped Nydas’ hand, gazing at him, “wait… meet me at the Lief’s Inn. Tomorrow. Noon. Room 245. The door will be locked but…”

Nydas smirked, “locks won’t be a problem for me. I’ll see you then, dear Wylan. Until that time, farewell.”

Wylan’s heart fluttered, turning to watch Nydas leave as he dashed away from the guards. His movements were so quick and graceful, like a dancer. And boy, could Nydas dance. Wylan’s heart was still racing from their waltz, his cheeks still flushed, and his smile still present.

He had to tell Acrasia about this, that Nydas had returned! That Nydas would meet him again. That he was almost sure Nydas felt the same was as him! Wylan looked around for his sister, smiling as he saw her still with Diane on the balcony. As he approached the two, he heard them finishing their conversation.

Acrasia giggled, “I really like that part. I can’t believe you love Triss’ Sunrise, that’s one of my favorite books!”

“Then you have exquisite taste! I expected nothing less from a book lover of your caliber.” Diane smiled, then sighed, “it appears the guards are after someone, I should join them. I am the captain of the guard, after all.”

Acrasia nodded, “so you are. I’m really glad I found out about your book smuggling. Meeting you has given me someone I can actually talk about books with. I don’t normally like galas, but talking to you makes me no longer feel out of place.”

Diane smiled, placing her hand on Acrasia’s, “I’m glad too. Would you like to meet up again sometime? We could have a picnic in the garden. Does two days time work for you, if you’d like to meet up, that is?”

Acrasia gasped, beaming, “I’d love to! I’ll mark the date on my calender. I’ll be looking forward to seeing you again.”

Diane grinned, “as will I.” She took another moment to hold onto Acrasia’s hand before letting go, racing away to join the other crown guard.

Wylan smirked, striding over to the smiling and blushed red Acrasia, “so, how did it go?”

Acrasia eeped, “how long have you been standing there?”

Wylan chuckled, “long enough.”

Acrasia glared at Wylan, “you sneaky, nosy, two-faced, enabling, scheming, conniving, no-good-” she cut herself off, running up to Wylan and hugging him tight, speaking softly, “thank you…”

Wylan laughed, holding her close, “hey, what are siblings for?”

“For teasing and belittling and-” Acrasia cut off.

Wylan cut in, “and supporting and being there for each other and lending an ear and being lucky to even have a sibling.”

Acrasia smiled, “oh shut up. You’re going to regret being my lifeline. I’m meeting her in two days and I have no idea what I’m going to wear! You know I have no understanding of fashion, though I did have a lot of fun with this ballgown.”

Wylan grinned, “I was worried for a second, but after seeing your ballgown… you wear it well. I’ll help you, of course, because I love fashion, but in the end it’s your decision. She liked your outfit today, I’m sure she’ll like whatever you decide to wear.”

Acrasia sighed, “I sure hope so… I don’t want to mess this up.”

Wylan shook his head, “not a chance. She is a high ranking guard who could be talking with anyone at this gala, yet she spent the entire evening talking to you. And not in a crowded space, she took you out to a private balcony! And that hand touch at the end, sister, she likes you, she may not admit it to herself yet, but you’ve got more than a chance.”

Acrasia eeped, “you really think so?”

Wylan nodded, “I know so.”

Acrasia smiled, “thanks, brother. And don’t think I haven’t notice that stupid grin on your face, you meet up with the masked dancer again, didn’t you!”

Wylan blushed, “I did… I’ll tell you all about it, but not here. He was just chased out of the ballroom. The guards are probably still searching for him.”

Acrasia gasped, “what?”

“Not now,” Wylan responded, “I’ll answer I’ll your questions soon, I promise.”

“Alright,” Acrasia replied, “I just hope you didn’t do anything too stupid.”

Wylan grinned, “I can’t guarantee that. Now let’s split up, we still have some information to gather. The night isn’t over yet!”
