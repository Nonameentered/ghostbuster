Trevelda had two faces.
  

  
One was beautiful, but forever behind a mask. The other was scarred, but revealed. The beautiful face was the face of a commoner, and the scarred was of a noble. And today, Trevalda had to choose which face she wanted to keep.
  

  
What was beauty and youth without wealth or influence? What was wealth and influence with shame and isolation? It was a beauty she never was able to show others, always beneath the mask. What was the point? The only solace she had as a commoner was that she beautiful, something only she knew.
  

  
Once she took off the mask, her face was scarred once more. The only time it would stay beautiful is if another asked her to take off the mask, but no one ever did. She was a commoner, no one cared for her. At least if she was scarred, she would have power and wealth.
  

  
She looked in the mirror, hoping that her choice was the right one. The scarred option seemed the better one, as much as it made her despair. She still held out hope that one day someone would ask her to remove her mask, but that day never came, why should she assume it would come now?
  

  
Trevelda glance over at Sir Remire. He was handsome and strong, courageous and kind. She often thought about making him perform tasks for her or tell him what a wonderful night he was. But she was scarred and feared, so instead, she watched from a distance. Sighing with longing as she wished to be one of the ladies he rescued. For few needed as much rescuing as her.
  

  
Though today Sir Remire was doing nothing gallant, he was drawing beautiful paintings. Trevelda always thought this odd. He had no reason to focus on this pursuit, he was not an artisan, and he would never be recognized for his work, yet he continued to do it. Something only he enjoyed.
  

  
She put on her mask and snuck out of the castle, returning to the hillside where her peasant dwelling was. She figured if she was going to give up this life, she might as well try to enjoy it for one last day, relishing her beauty even though it was only hers to enjoy.
  

  
As she looked in the reflection, seeing only her mask, she gasped. She realized why Sir Remire painted art that would never be seen by anyone else. In her scarred form, her wealth and influence were for others. It was a display of grandeur. Those around her would forever know her power. It was something that could not be denied. Yet with her mask her gift was subtle, it was a beauty special to her.
  

  
She chose beauty.
  

  
The very next day, as if being rewarded for her choice, Sir Remire rescued her, just a commoner, and asked her to remove her mask. The last of the masquerade mask fell off her face into the wind, showing a beautiful face where once were scars. With that, she breathed in the fresh air and set off with the knight for a new start in life.
