“I think Velicell’s power’s come from their suit,” Mike theorized, sitting on the couch with David and watching Dawn of Gravitas, a movie about a gravity superhero.
  

  
David gulped, “what makes you say that?”
  

  
Mike smiled, “remember that one time in New York when their suit got damaged, they could still shoot lazers but they couldn’t fly, their suit must have been damaged.”
  

  
David hummed in thought, “or maybe they needed to push off the ground hard to fly, and their legs were too injured? Or they didn't have the reserves left in their body or something else got injured that prevented it?”
  

  
Mike shrugged, “perhaps. Wouldn’t that be great though, if a suit like that did exist? We always used to say how much we wanted to be superheroes, with a suit like that we actually could!”
  

  
David sighed, “yeah, I suppose we could.”
  

  
Mike blinked, “something wrong, David?”
  

  
David shook his head, “nothing, just, no use dreaming, I suppose.”
  

  
Mike grinned, “but there is! This suit could be real!”
  

  
David nodded. “Maybe, but even if it is, it’s way above our paygrade.”
  

  
Mike smiled, “with the money we’ll make as superheroes we’ll earn it back in no time!”
  

  
David winced, “I heard superheroes don’t actually make that much.”
  

  
Mike shrugged, “depends if they’re sponsored or not. Come on, isn’t this worth looking into?”
  

  
David panicked, knowing Mike was onto something. But Mike was too cute to misdirect, or… he could take this opportunity to do something he always wanted to do. David smiled and placed his hand on Mike’s, “or… we can live in the present, and enjoy what we have.”
  

  
Mike’s cheeks heated, gulping, “and wh-what’s that?”
  

  
David beamed and pecked him on the cheek, “each other.”
  

  
Mike eeped, “D-David!”
  

  
David blushed and retreated, “sorry, sorry, sorry!”
  

  
Mike giggled, “no, don’t apologize you adorable fool! You missed!”
  

  
David blushed harder, “oh… r-right.” He grinned, kissing Mike on the lips. Telling Mike the truth could wait.
