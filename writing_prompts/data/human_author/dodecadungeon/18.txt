“It’s not too late, Kameck.”
  

  
Kameck shook his head, “No, it’s been decided. The being accepted.”
  

  
“But this is our daughter, not a power play. Look at her, have you ever seen our daughter so lifeless and resigned?” Rashida asked.
  

  
“I remember a similar expression on a day just like this, do you remember?” Kameck brought up.
  

  
Rashida nodded, “And that’s exactly why I bring this up, we don’t have to put another through this.”
  

  
“Look where they are now, I wouldn’t have taken that day back, would you?”
  

  
“But that wasn’t the right way…”
  

  
“Would it had happened otherwise? I think not.”
  

  
Rashida sighed, “She’ll hate us.”
  

  
Kameck shrugged, “All children hate their parents at this age.”
  

  
“Don’t you feel even an ounce of regret?” Rashida yelled, eyes narrowing.
  

  
“Do you need me to recount that day for you?” Kameck inquired.
  

  
Rashida’s expression softened, “Kameck, what worked that day might not work for us.”
  

  
“Then I’ll recount it for you. I was a young man at that time,” Kameck began, “with no plan to settle down and upset by my parent’s restrictions and refusal to agknowledge what I wished to do with my life. Instead, they married me off to a goddess.”
  

  
“Kameck, I know the story,” Rashida interjected.
  

  
He continued, “I was a pain the first few months, doing everything I could to drive you crazy to get an annulment. But you kept to it. I’m not sure why you did, but I found I could no longer be so inconsiderate to someone so kind. I tried to make it up to you, be the husband you deserved, and we began to learn about each other. That blossomed into real love for the both of us. Now I have my own family, and my daughter is a demigod, she gets privileges that I never had, and I couldn’t be happier to be able to give her those gifts. I want to give her the same happiness I was given with you, my love. I want her to have what I have and more.”
  

  
Rashida wiped her eyes, “Kameck, your intentions are noble, and your story beautiful, but my love, what if she does not want what you have? What if she wants a different life? We got lucky, Kameck. You must know that.”
  

  
“But what if I’m right?” asked Kameck, “She could be as happy as we are, isn’t that worth something?”
  

  
Rashida sniffed, “Kameck… I always hated our marriage.”
  

  
He froze, “I…”
  

  
She embraced him, “I don’t hate you, I love you deeply dear, but the marriage, it wasn’t fair to you. Those first months I could see the anguish you were experiencing, you would let no one in to help you deal with it, because the world had betrayed you. It left scars, ones I spent our time together trying to heal. But worse of all is not those first months or the lack of agency you had, but watching you age. I will love you even when you’re old and infirmed, but it will bring me no small amount of pain. Even now, seeing your body betray you, I wish I could provide you godhood, but the gift is not mine to give. And to make it worse, when you die, I must go on. Continue eternity without you.”
  

  
Kameck’s eyes dampened, “Rashida, you’ll forget me in time, you’ll have many more lifetimes to live. And our daughter will live far beyond my years.”
  

  
“But she is not immortal, my love. She is the last fragment of you I will have left, and if I make her unhappy, I could not live to see her eyes, which look so much like her father’s, shed tears. I cannot subject anyone else to what a marriage between an immortal and mortal will wrought, loneliness for one, and death for the other.”
  

  
“I would never have taken these years back, Rashida. You are my greatest happiness.”
  

  
“And you mine, but I know in my heart that the space you will leave will be too much for anyone else to fill. Time does not heal wounds this deep, it only carves deeper caverns. I will forever lament not being able to stop the hourglass from spilling, to stop its dust from claiming you.”
  

  
Kameck took a deep breath, “Let’s call off the marriage, then. I have an apology to make.”
  

  
Rashida smiled and held his hand, “No, we do. I will be by your side through as much of your life as I can before I can no longer.”
  

  
Kameck squeezed her hand tight, “Thank you, Rashida. Even when I’m gone, I will never stop loving you. If ever you need a reminder, look up at the stars and imagine their twinkle is me singing my love for you.”
  

  
Rashida never stopped looking up at the stars.
