The gala should be coming up in just a few parts! Here's the next part! - 

The library was a section of the the castle which Wylan rarely explored. He tried to look inconspicuous and blend in, but to little avail. Everyone here was so… nondescript. Muted colors, no make up, no extravagance, just a bunch of bookworms and their books.

He sighed in relief as Acrasia arrived, for he could finally stop feeling foolish by pretending to be a scholar. He beckoned her down one of the back aisles, Acrasia trying to start conversation as they went but Wylan shushed her each time until they arrived at the quiet corner. Wylan nodded in satisfaction at their surroundings, turning to Acrasia, “alright, we should be safe here.”

Acrasia glanced around, eyes shifting with paranoia, “Wylan, what’s with all this cloak and dagger business? Are we being watched?”

Wylan shrugged, “I wish I knew. All I know is that father told me that the future is coming, and that he’s not in it. He wants me to prepare quicker for my ascension of the throne. This may just be paranoid delusion, but it seems like father fears for his life. When I tried to press him on the subject he had his guards escort me out of the throne room.”

Acrasia gasped, “Wylan, this isn’t some sick prank, is it? You’re being serious with all this? Because if you are… oh gosh… I don’t even know where to begin.”

Wylan sighed, staring at her, “look into my eyes, sister. Am I lying?”

Acrasia looked into his eyes and shook her head, “no, you’re telling the truth… hells. What do we do?”

Wylan placed his hand on his sister’s shoulder, “first, you need to calm down. Nothing bad has happened yet. We have the head start because father snuck this information to me. Whoever is plotting something doesn’t know how much we know. I don’t know if they’re even listening, but I took us here just to be safe.”

Acrasia nodded, “I understand. Sorry… I just…”

“I know this is a lot to take in, there’s nothing to be sorry for. There was probably a better way for me to tell you this, I just didn’t have the time.”

“I know, I know. I just wish he told you more. I don’t want to be suspicious about everyone in the castle. These are people we grew up with, people who helped take care of us and protect us as well as father.”

“It puts us in a difficult position, there’s no doubt about that. Though do we have a choice? This is father we’re talking about, maybe the entire royal line. We have to get to the bottom of this, no matter what ties we might break.”

“I… I agree. I just wish there was another way.”

“I do too, and I’m sorry,” Wylan said.

Acrasia sighed, “well, you’re right. There’s no use complaining. We have to do something about this. I just hope we don’t get killed doing it.”

Wylan smiled, “just think of it this way, if our lives are on ticking clocks, what do you have to lose by asking out Diane?”

Acrasia blushed, “Wylan! How can you say such a thing at a time like this!”

Wylan shrugged, “we’ll have to talk to everyone to get the information we need to help father. It’s a good excuse to mingle with a certain captain of the guard.”

Acrasia rolled her eyes, “one minute you’re giving me a panic attack with this whole conspiracy you’ve uncovered and the next you’re my wingman. I shouldn’t have expected anything different from my brother.”

Wylan smirked, “no you shouldn’t. But I’m serious, we deserve some happiness during all of this.”

Acrasia sighed, “you’re right. But what if I mess up? What if she doesn’t feel the same?”

Wylan smiled, “doesn’t matter. We’ll most likely be dead soon anyway.”

Acrasia groaned, “you can’t turn cynicism into optimism, that’s cheating.”

Wylan chuckled, “maybe, or maybe it’s genius.”

Acrasia giggled, “doubtful. But that goes both ways. If I’m confessing to Diane, you’ll have to do the same to the masked dancer.”

Wylan nodded, “I’d have it no other way. In fact, we’ll both have an opportunity tomorrow.”

Acrasia’s eyes widened, “tomorrow? But that’s so soon!”

Wylan grinned, “what better opportunity than my next gala!”

Acrasia blinked, “you really think it’s a good idea to put on a gala amidst all this?”

“Of course!” Wylan exclaimed, “what better opportunity to mingle with all of the castle’s most powerful individuals?”

Acrasia sighed, “you’re right. Though that won’t leave us much time for courtship.”

Wylan snorted, “don’t think you’re getting out of this, sister. We’ll have plenty time of mingling, I assure you.”

Acrasia groaned, “do I have to come? You know how I feel about galas.”

Wylan nodded, “yes, you have to. It’s not as bad as you think. I’ll help you through it. It’ll be great, you’ll be great. Just think of it as one of those scenes from your romance novels.”

Acrasia frowned, “those novels are for me to experience scenarios like that from a safe distance.”

Wylan smiled, “what’s the fun in that? I’ll walk you through it every step of the way. Just trust me on this.”

Acrasia rolled her eyes, “fine. But I get to choose the outfit.”

Wylan winced, “I don’t like this.”

Acrasia smirked, “you wanted this. I’m choosing my outfit. If you want me at the gala, that’s non-negociable.”

Wylan groaned, “fine… just, make it presentable, alright.”

Acrasia chuckled, “no promises.”

Wylan sighed, “well, I suppose that’s the best I can expect.”

Acrasia nodded, “indeed it is. Now, what can we do in the meantime?”

Wylan smiled, “I took us to a library, didn’t I? We should split up and get as much research done as possible. Perhaps we’ll find something that will help us uncover this conspiracy. It’s a long shot but it’s worth a try.”

Acrasia grinned, “you brought along the right person for this task. I’ll dig up something in no time!”

Wylan and Acrasia split up, going to comb through shelves upon shelves of books in search of any knowledge to aid them. Every now and again his thoughts would drift once more back to the masked ballgoer, hoping that he would encounter the man of mystery at the ball tomorrow night and dance with them once more.
