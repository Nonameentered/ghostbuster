Most scream demons use their gift as intended: to cause screams.
  

  
They relish in the terror and chaos, performing unspeakable acts and growing more powerful as a result. I have studied fear for years, helping various patients overcome it. In doing so I learned the perfect methods to bring about screams.
  

  
The way I walk, what I wear, what scents I emanate, the sounds I make, the area around me, I choose what is most suited to cause fear merely by existing. I do not need to inflict pain to cause my victims to scream, all I need for them is to know Iâ€™m there.
  

  
I must keep up the facade that I am dangerous with perfectly crafted threats, occasionally chasing victims down alleys, brandishing a blade in front of them, or merely glancing deep into their eyes.
  

  
Unlike other scream demons, I never harm. I only require screams to grant myself the strength to stop the others. I can hear screams from miles away, able to draw myself to where I scream demon is and leech off the screams they evoke, growing more powerful. They see me first as their ally, in that moment I strike.
  

  
At first, it is the victims who fear me and the scream demons who do not. By the time I battle my scream demon opponents, it is the victims who thank me and the scream demons who fear me.
