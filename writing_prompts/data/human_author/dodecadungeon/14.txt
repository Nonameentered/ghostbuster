Darryl sighed, placing a flower at Jeremy’s grave, turning as he heard a voice behind him, “How did you know him?”
  

  
He turned around to see a well-dressed man smoking a cigar, Darryl responded, “I was his partner, we had only been dating a few months…”
  

  
The man nodded, “I see, a shame. Care for a cigar?”
  

  
Darryl shook his head, “I shouldn’t. I have too many bad habits already.”
  

  
“I respect your willpower,” the man took a puff from his cigar, “Shame, to die so young. He deserves a better funeral for this. Not that I blame the family, they didn’t have much money for that sort of thing.”
  

  
“The money isn’t the issue,” Darryl mumbled.
  

  
The man raised an eyebrow, “Oh? Then what is?”
  

  
Darryl gestured to the procession, “Look around you, barely anyone showed up.”
  

  
The man followed Darryl’s hand, “Ah… and I have a feeling you know why that is?”
  

  
He nodded, “Yep, it’s because of me.”
  

  
“I wouldn’t be too harsh on yourself, I know when you care for someone you make their loss your burden, but he’d want you to live your own life.”
  

  
“Not like this. I was… one of the people you typically avoid. One of those fanatics who believes in living off the grid, zero carbon footprint, paranoid, head full of conspiracies, you probably know the type.”
  

  
“Somewhat, but you’re not what expected when I think about those sorts of people. You seem… more composed.”
  

  
“Now I am… death does a lot to change one’s view of the world. You see, while most people ignored me, Charles, dear Charles, he looked beyond all that and saw a good person inside. He was so giving, so pure… so naive. I tried to get him into my lifestyle… he wasn’t ready to leave it all behind, but he did it for me. There was almost no trace of his existence by the time he died… that’s why this funeral is so empty. He could have been back at his software job, surrounded by friends and coworkers, a good income, and parents who are proud of him, but no… he’s gone and barely anyone knows what a wonderful person he was. All because of me, it’s not fair… it’s not fair at all…” Darryl’s eyes welled with tears, beginning to sob.
  

  
“Ah, so you aren’t just saying that, you truly are responsible for the funeral’s low turnout and the fact that no one will care about dear Charles enough to find out how he met his demise.”
  

  
Darryl blinked in confusion, turning to the man, “How could you say such a thing.”
  

  
The man cackled, “Oh, what fools grief makes us. Do you want to know how he died?”
  

  
Darryl raised an eyebrow, “How would you know?”
  

  
The man smirked, “Because I killed him, and no one stayed at this funeral long enough to see the grand finale. You’ll have an even smaller attendance than Charles, will anyone show up? Perhaps Charles, if he were alive, but now you’ll have to be content with me.” The man pulled out a gun, aiming it at Darryl. His eyes went wide, trying to scramble away, but it was too late, he heard the shot and felt the pain before everything went black.
