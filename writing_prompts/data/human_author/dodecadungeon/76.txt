Thank you so much for all the kind words! I appreciate it a lot! Here's the next part:

Nydas clutched the runner by the shirt, glaring at him with furious eyes, “where the hell is the rest of my party?”

The reedy spy gulped, squirming against Nydas’ grasp, “let me go you roguish swine!”

Nydas cackled, letting his dagger gleam in the moonlight, “I’ll let you go, I’ll grab you be the throat and let your body go with a clean cut across the neck.”

The scrawny figure’s eyes widened, “you’re bluffing.”

Nydas smirked, “it’s not by mistake I’m the only one not captured. I’m the member of my party who’s survived the longest. I do what it takes to survive; anything.”

The runner shivered, still struggling, “you’re mad!”

Nydas grinned, the man wasn’t far off from the truth, the voices in his head were practically screaming. If he wasn’t mad already, it was only a matter of time, “perhaps. But do you really want to find out how mad I can be?”

The captive sighed, ceasing his struggling, “it won’t matter, you won’t get to them in time.”

Nydas pressed his dagger against the scrawny spy’s side, “then you better talk quickly.”

The reedy man gritted his teeth, “hell, looks like I’m screwed either way. The crown guards took your party. I don’t know who hired them, but either their orders come from within the palace, or someone wants them to think they do.”

Nydas raised an eyebrow, “but why?”

The captive shrugged, “I’m not paid to ask questions. You had escaped, it was my job to find you, that’s all.”

Nydas quirked his lip, “was it a crown guard who gave you the orders?”

The man nodded, “I normally don’t take jobs from crown guards, but my friend had worked with them on the set up. He was part of Count Veris’ crew and knew those guards didn’t do anything to him despite his misdeeds. They just need skilled people, skills that I could provide.”

Nydas cursed under his breath, “damn, so Veris is part of this?”

The spy tilted their head, “I don’t know the specifics, but he was part of the set up, wasn’t he? Seems like he was part of it to me.”

Nydas shook his head, “it just doesn’t add up. What changed? Why would Count Veris turn on us now?”

The scrawny figure shrugged, “I can’t help you there. I told you all I know.”

Nydas sighed, “damn it all.” He released his grip on the spy, who instantly began to sprint away. Nydas threw his dagger at the figure’s neck, grazing it. The injuries wouldn’t be severe, but it would damage his vocal chords enough to keep him from talking for a few weeks. He should probably have also broke his wrists, but for now, he just had to hope that the man was illiterate. He couldn’t let the spy’s superiors know how much he knew.

This wasn’t good. If it was truly the crown guard it meant someone on the inside had set this up. He just had to pray that the prince wasn’t caught up in all this. It was a foolish hope, he most likely was, but something against all reason inside of Nydas told him the prince had nothing to do with it. But he got the same feeling about the Count as well, even though he claimed otherwise to his party as an excuse, and he was proved wrong on that account.

Nydas cursed, things weren’t looking good. He would have to start with the Count. As much as he didn’t want to confront him about this, it was too dangerous to start with the crown guards, he would most likely expose himself and how much he knew about this whole conspiracy.

Regardless, it was his friends’ lives on the line, and he was the only one who could help them. He had to put aside his worries and discomforts for now, and help them. Keeping down the voices and sinking feeling that he had led more of his party to their deaths. He would save them. That was a promise.
