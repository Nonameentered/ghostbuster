Nydas hated wearing masks.
  

  
Anyone who had Nydas’ roguishly good looks would never want to hide their beauty from the world. No, he wore masks out of necessity, and to prove he didn’t need his looks to be charming.
  

  
Nydas’ motivations, by many standards, are incredibly simple. All he desires is to have fun. Some might see it as foolish carelessness, carnal obsession, or ignorant denial, but Nydas knew the truth. Being motivated by excitement and action is the only way to experience no remorse in Nydas’ line of work.
  

  
He had been with his adventuring party for five years now, and they had gone through three leaders, four healers, two casters, but had never changed rogues. After five years, Nydas was the only member of the original party that remained.
  

  
As the years passed, Nydas found himself growing more reckless, more excitement-driven. The others whispered that he was searching for an early grave. Maybe he was. Or perhaps the pain of losing his friends was simply too much to bear if the world grew silent from lack of action. Those voices in his head, the screams of his comrades ringing in his ears, could only be overwhelmed by the shouts of castle guards and the roar of flame; until last night.
  

  
The crown prince was handsome, really, really handsome. Royal genes perhaps, but still, not all royals are cute. He was. That’s nothing new, lots of pretty people came and went in Nydas’ life. But this was different.
  

  
He asked him to dance out of hopes even with a mask, his charms would be enough to lure the prince. To his pleasure and surprise, the prince accepted, the two beginning their waltz. Nydas couldn’t explain it, but as he danced with the prince, the voices disappeared.
  

  
Nydas had never regretted stealing, especially from the rich. It had been a necessity, a way of life. But last night, the regret was almost nauseating. He lay awake in bed wondering if he had as much of an effect on the prince as he had on him. It was unlikely, it was a foolish desire. But he wondered regardless. Hoping the prince would return and quiet his voices once more.
