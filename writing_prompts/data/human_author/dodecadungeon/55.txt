Hehe, I like where your head is :) Here's the next part! - 

“You said you wanted my help with your wardrobe,” Wylan said.

Acrasia shrugged, “I wasn’t expecting creative differences, besides, you said it would have to be my decision in the end.”

Wylan sighed, “there’s a lot at stake here!”

Acrasia smiled, “then good thing I’m picking out the clothing, I know how I want to look around Diane.”

Wylan groaned, “I’m worried about this. You’re wearing a scholar’s robes! That’s the opposite of flattering!”

Acrasia smirked, “maybe to you, but what do you think of these modifications? It’s a bit more dress-like now. Besides, the bright colors are very floral-y, perfect for a garden date! Don’t you think?”

Wylan rolled his eyes, “I don’t know why I even try.”

Acrasia chuckled, “oh come on, have some faith in me!”

Wylan shook his head, “I try, but it can be so hard sometimes.”

Acrasia sighed, “well, then at least wish me luck.”

Wylan nodded, “fine, good luck.”

Acrasia beamed, “thanks!” She skipped out to the gardens, ready to meet Diane.

Wylan waited a few seconds before pursuing, finding a nearby spot in the gardens to listen from. He wasn’t happy about eavesdropping, but he wanted to make sure everything went according to plan. There was a lot at stake with what Diane knew, and he wanted to make sure Acrasia extracted it.

Acrasia waved to Diane, who smiled and waved back. The two approached each other, still smiling. 

Diane grinned, “Acrasia! I’m so glad you came!”

Acrasia’s cheeks were tinged pink, “I’m glad you invited me!”

Diane took a moment to gaze at Acrasia, “wow, nice outfit!”

Acrasia beamed, “you really like it?”

Diane nodded, “of course! It’s so colorful and creative! Wait, are those made from scholar’s robes?”

Acrasia blushed, “yeah… a bit silly, isn’t it?”

Diane shook her head, “no, I think it’s great! You wear it well, much better than any scholar I’ve seen.”

Acrasia chuckled, “well, scholar’s aren’t known for their taste in fashion, but I’d like to prove the exception.”

Diane smiled, “you already have. Shall we sit down?”

Acrasia nodded and took a seat on the grass with Diane, “what a lovely display you have for a picnic!”

Diane’s cheeks went rosy, “Thanks! Just wait until you taste it!”

“I can’t wait! Literally!” Acrasia giggled and immediately took a bite, “wow! You were right, it’s wonderful.”

Diane laughed, “are you always this lively?”

Acrasia shook her head, “only around pres- um.. pleasant company.”

Diane grinned, “I’m glad you find me pleasant.”

“Oh, much more than pleasant!” Acrasia admitted, “every moment with you has been a delight!”

Diane fiddled with her hair, “I’m um… glad you find me so delightful. A lot of people don’t, I have to be strict as the captain of the guard, you know.”

Acrasia sighed, “I’m sorry to hear that, I wasn’t aware so many of the crown guard were ignorant fools.”

Diane gasped, “Acrasia!”

Acrasia giggled, “I’m sorry, I know those are your fellow guards, but you’re great! Anyone who doesn’t see that is a damn fool.”

Diane smiled, “thanks, Acrasia, that means a lot.”

Acrasia nodded, “anytime, Diane. Though I mean every word of that. You deserve more. I heard that you got turned down by the military division. They don’t know what they’re missing, and they don’t deserve you either.”

Diane blushed, “it’s really not necessary to console me, I’m fine. And you heard about that? I’m a bit embarrassed about it.”

Acrasia placed her hand on Diane’s, “don’t be. I am much more embarrassing than you ever could be. You’ve heard the rumors about me, haven’t you?”

Diane shrugged, “they’re just stupid whispers, I never believed them. You were always so sweet to me.”

Acrasia turned her eyes downcast, “y-you’re too kind.”

Diane clasped Acrasia’s hand in hers, “no such thing. And not true, you’re much more caring than I.”

Acrasia gazed into her eyes, “I disagree…”

Diane inched herself closer to Acrasia, “you know, sometimes, I feel like I don’t belong in this castle, but with you, that feeling fades away.”

Acrasia gasped, “r-really? I feel that exact same way, I mean it!”

Diane beamed, “yeah, and I’m kinda glad the military turned me down, because instead, I met you!”

Acrasia blushed, “I um… wow…”

Diane’s expression softened, “as the captain of the guard, if anything ever happens in this castle, know I’ll never let you get hurt.”

Acrasia smiled, “but that won’t happen.”

Diane frowned, “yeah… most likely, but it never hurts to be cautious.”

Acrasia blinked, “Diane? You’re worrying me, what are you saying.”

Diane shook her head, “n-nothing, forget I said anything.”

Acrasia looked into Diane’s eyes, “Diane… please…”

Diane sighed, “I… I just have reason to believe there might be threats, in the castle, it’s stupid. It’s probably just rumor, but I’d be careful.”

Acrasia’s breath began to quicken, “I um.. are you serious? Will my family be okay?”

Diane gulped, “I don’t know. I told you it’s probably just a rumor, I just, I worry about you, I want you to be safe.”

Acrasia began to hyperventillate, “Diane, answer me, is there anyone else I need to worry about?”

Diane squeezed her eyes shut, “your father’s disease is getting worse by the day, you should spend as much time with him as you can, and your brother, before he gets too busy as King. I… I’m sorry, I ruined everything.”

Diane began to stand, Acrasia trying to grab her as she did so. Diane flung Acrasia’s hand away, tears welling in her eyes. The captain of the guard muttered ‘sorry’ under her breath as she raced away, leaving Acrasia behind, sulking.

Wylan ran up to her, “Acrasia! Acrasia!”

Acrasia didn’t answer, sprinting away from her brother. Wylan sighed, “dear Acrasia… I’m so sorry…”
