Frick, I'm sorry to hear that, that always sucks to go through, I hope the break helped. Here's the next part - 

Perhaps the Count was right, but that didn’t stop Nydas from going through with his plan. The truth was, as much progress as he was making the Wylan, he needed his crew. All the questions pointed to them as the answer, and the longer he delayed, the less likely they were to be alive.

However, this time Nydas had an advantage that he didn’t have before. He didn’t have to sneak.

Instead, he merely strolled into the castle, dressed as a guard. He was asked his name, he responded Sydan, the inquisitor responded, saying that he was cleared to enter. And so he did, easy as that.

Nydas smiled to himself, having a prince ally, and hopefully soon to be more than just that, had incredible benefits. He entered through the front gate, which felt wrong. He passed through the main hall, which was filled with people and guards. He felt exposed, as if he should be caught already, but no one paid him any mind. Except one.

It was a face Nydas recognized, none other than Count Veris. The thief cursed inwardly, if Veris figured out Nydas was planning to help his crew, he would not be happy. He hoped that the Count hadn’t recognized him, turning his head and continuing onward, but he could feel their brow raise. Veris had spotted him.

At the next turn he was intercepted by the Count and pulled into a side room, “what in the hells are you doing here?”

“I could ask you the same,” replied Nydas.

Veris sighed, “you asked me to get you a floor plan of the castle, didn’t you? Well, I’m doing that.”

Nydas winced, “ah, I was getting a bit impatient, so I decided to try to obtain a floor plan myself by sneaking in.”

The Count groaned, “and you didn’t think to clear it with me first?”

Nydas shook his head, “why would I need to?”

“So situations like this don’t happen!”

“Ah, fair point.”

“And you swear that is all you are doing here?”

“What do you mean?”

“You know exactly what I mean, I know you’re eager to attempt the suicide mission of freeing your friends on your own.”

“I won’t lie, the opportunity crossed my mind, but it’s no good without a map. So I thought I’d gather that first. Test out this disguise plan while I’m at it.”

“Not the worst idea, but I’ll take care of the plan. You should head back before you’re caught, understood?”

Nydas winced, “well… I am supposed to clock in a shift, part of my way in.”

The Count sighed, “of course… you always have to make things complicated.”

“Hey, it’s a good plan,” Nydas defended.

Veris groaned, “what’s done is done. Finish your shift, and head out of here. And I’ll be on the premises so I’ll know if you try anything stupid, is that clear?”

Nydas nodded, “crystal.”

The Count opened the door, heading back out of the room, Nydas exiting shortly after and heading down to the dungeon.

Nydas couldn’t efficiently navigate the dungeon since he had to follow patron patterns, but after a time, he did sweep quiet a large portion of the underground. He checked the original spot his friends were located, which was empty. After combing through most of the dungeon, the hours grew later, and he considered calling it over. Fortunately, soon afterward, his luck finally changed.

It was at a level below the dungeon, which Nydas didn’t know existed. Perhaps that floor plan would have been useful. He didn’t need to venture very far in to find them. Waiting for the guard shift to change, he approached the group, removing his helmet and sighing in relief, “thank goodness I found you again, they sure know how to hide you.”

Reese beamed, “Nydas! You’re back! Good heavens, I was beginning to think the guards had gotten to you.”

Nydas smiled, “it’ll take more than that to take me down.”

Selvin chuckled, “I hate to admit it, but it’s good to see you again, Nydas.”

Nydas nodded, “likewise, Selvin. Where’s Zeris?”

Reese sighed, “he’s being interrogated again…”

Nydas blinked, “again? Dammit! Do you know where we can find him?”

Reese scratched her head, “I’m not sure, but even when we were on the first floor of the dungeon, they always took him up. He was disoriented so he didn’t know where specifically, but I saw carpet fabric on his shoes more than once. He was definitely taken above, the carpet was gold, though I don’t know if that helps.”

“Well, it’s something at least,” Nydas replied.

Reese looked to Nydas, “are you here to break us out?”

Nydas glanced upward, and Reese nodded, “you need to get Zeris first…”

The thief nodded, “once I rescue you, everyone will be alerted to our presence. I need to find Zeris. Though perhaps…”

Nydas began working at the lock, opening it with a satisfying click, “don’t leave yet, I need to find Zeris first. When I give the signal, and trust me, you’ll know it, sprint out. Take the left corridor all the way to the hole in the wall, that leads you to the sewage system. It’s not pleasant, but you’ll be able to avoid the guards that way.”

Reese smiled, “thank you, Nydas.”

Nydas grinned, “of course, good luck to you both.”

They nodded to him, and Nydas in return, before he raced back to the first floor of the dungeon, following patrol patterns as he made his way back up through the castle, searching for a room with golden carpet.
