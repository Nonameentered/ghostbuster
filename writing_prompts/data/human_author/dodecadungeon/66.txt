I'm glad they could provide some degree of solace, here is the next part for when you're ready - 

Nydas decided to wear a servant uniform he found in the cellar to disguise himself from his pursuers. There were too many people at the gala for the guards to easily find him, especially not if he changed clothes and kept his head down.

There were other options available to escape capture, a good thief always has multiple contingencies, but this one would allow him to get into the ball and search for the handsome prince. So, without another thought, he chose the servant plan.

The gala was lavish and grand, majestic without being ostentacious. It was the ball of daydreams and more. Each noble present dressed in beautiful and ornate gowns and suits, chatting and dancing, their voices and glasses filling the air with music. And oh, the music! There was an entire orchestra present at the event, creating wondrous music for the entire procession to dance to. Nydas even had to stop himself from waying to the music has he refilled champagne glasses and tended to his other duties as a servant. 

He recognized the prince instantly. His fiery red hair was distinct and unmistakable gorgeous. His emerald eyes sparkled in the chandelier light, his tall tone frame was statesque, the kind of figure that inspired sculptors to immortalize such a physique in clay or stone. His smile, damn, that smile. Nydas nearly dropped his draw of wine glasses upon seeing it. That perfect grin was pure and infectious, within its presence Nydas couldn’t help but smile too.

The prince’s skin was like snow in spring. Sparkling and pale as it began to melt, it complimented the wild roses of his hair and the green lilies that were his eyes. Freckles blessed his face. It appeared as though some celestial being had showered the bridge of his nose with kisses, forever marked as a being loved by the gods.

Nydas wished he had planned their next encounter better. He couldn’t stop thinking about the prince and yet, now in his presence once more, he had no idea what to say. The prince hadn’t seen him without a mask. Would he even recognize him? Would he even accept him upon realizing that he wasn’t a noble? Or worse, did he already know the masked figure was the artifact thief?

The prince was currently talking to a man who looked as though he did not belong at the gala. He wore modest clothing, which was slightly disheveled, most likely having to do something with his frantic and worried speech. Nydas moved closer to listen, hearing the prince refer to the man as “Rene,” and Rene referring to the prince as “Wylan.” Nydas sighed and repeated the name in his head; Wylan, such a lovely name.

“Are you sure?” asked the prince.

Rene nodded, “yes. He was last seen fleeing through the dungeons. I am not sure if he has already performed some foul crime or if he is still on the prowl. I hope the he is wise enough to flee the castle, but if not, I have the guards on the lookout for anyone who matches his description.”

“Thank you, Rene,” responded Wylan, “I think we’ll leave it at that for now. If the situation becomes more of an issue, we can tell the other guests. But for now, let us assume the thief has fled and have the guards keep a lookout.”

“Yes, your highness,” bowed Rene, “I will do so, and alert you if anything changes. Though I only have so much authority on my own. If I had general privileges I could assign the guards orders without having to check in with you first. The process would be much more efficient, as well as having the added benefit of leaving you unbothered.”

The prince stroked his chin, “perhaps. There is something I need the guards to potentially look into, though I have scarcely little information on the subject at present.”

“I will speak with you later then, sire,” said Rene. “Your Highness, if I might ask, is there something wrong?”

Wylan shook his head, “nothing, I just have a lot on my mind. Though during our next meeting I would like to discuss politics in more detail, if your time permits it.”

Rene raised an eyebrow, “politics, sir?”

The prince nodded, “yes. You have shown me that I am at present, a poor heir. If I am to become King, I will need to brush up on such matters as politics. I can think of no man to provide such wisdom than yourself.”

Rene chuckled, “are you sure you are not ill, sire?”

Wylan smiled, “not at all. I am finally beginning to see clearly, I believe. Thank you for your time, Rene. I will look forward to our next encounter.”

“As will I,” Rene said, bowing and strolling away.

Nydas took a deep breath, now was his chance. He moved up to the prince, putting on the most handsome grin he could fabricate, and outstretched his tray toward the prince, “would you like a glass of wine, your Highness?”

Wylan shook his head, “no thank you, I have had too much spirits as it is.” The prince put up his hand in dismissal before pausing, “that voice… have we met?”

Nydas nodded, “we have, your Highness.”

“I thought so…” he took a moment to analyze Nydas’ face, eyes widening, “is it really you? The masked thief?”

Nydas sighed and turned his head downward, “I have not come to steal, I apologize for causing you distress-”

Wylan chuckled, “it’s in the past. I have too many artifacts to count as it is. All I ask is a dance, if you’ll have me once more.”

Nydas beamed, eyes wide with excitement, “yes! I would like nothing more than that, your Highness.”

The prince smirked, holding out his hand, “please, call me Wylan.”

Nydas grinned, taking the prince’s hand, “a lovely name. Wylan it is, then.”

Wylan blushed faintly, “I’m glad you think so. What about you? I do not believe I learned your name, though given your current circumstances I understand if you wish to-”

“Nydas,” he answered, cutting Wylan off, “my name is Nydas.”

Wylan smiled, leading Nydas onto the dance floor, “it suits you. It’s dramatic and mysterious, dangerous even.”

Nydas chuckled, “do you like danger?”

Wylan winked, “oh, I love it.”

The two began to dance, gliding across the dance floor. Nydas tried to keep his head down. What would people think? Someone in servant garb dancing with the prince? And if they recognized him as a criminal, his whole plan was ruined. But he could not help but look up into the tall prince’s beautiful emerald eyes, getting lost in them as they swayed back and forth.

He smiled brightly, and no matter how much he tried to keep it under control, his smile persisted. Nydas threw away all his cares and let himself get swept away in the dance. The voices in the back of his mind faded away. He was at peace once more, and he had found that peace in the eyes of an enchanting prince.
