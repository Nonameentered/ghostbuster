Thank you! I still have room to improve but I'm glad I'm moving in the right direction! Here's the next part! - 

Wylan grinned, bursting into Acrasia’s room, “okay, so I’ve looked through the royal employment lists, and I can only find one Diane. The captain of the guard! Acrasia, what? You have to tell me more!”

Acrasia looked up from her book, glaring at Wylan, “Wylan! I told you to drop it!”

Wylan shrugged, “you gave me her name, I thought maybe-”

“You thought wrong! Besides, you don’t know if that’s the right Diane. You only looked among the castle, they could be somewhere else,” Acrasia interrupted.

Wylan smirked, “I doubt it. Based off your fictional version of her, you know her fairly well. And this manuscript has been in the works for a while, which means she’s been lingering in your mind for some time now. You must’ve seen her multiple times to warrant such deep infatuation. She is definitely within this castle.”

Acrasia rolled her eyes, “so you read a few romance novels and now you’re an expert, is that it?”

Wylan smiled, “I learned from the best.”

Acrasia sighed, “you’re insufferable, and that’s saying something because I’ve written some very unlikeable characters.”

Wylan chuckled, “you certainly have. Though I wouldn’t be surprised if one of them was based off of me.”

Acrasia giggled, “you stole my own insult from me!”

Wylan grinned, “what can I say? I know you well, sister.”

“It appears you do,” Acrasia conceded. “So yes, fine, she’s the captain of the crown guard. Now will you drop it?”

Wylan shook his head, “nope. That only brings more questions to my mind.”

Acrasia groaned, “I… I’ll answer some of them… but you have to tell me about your little crush in return.”

Wylan paused in thought, then nodded, “you drive a hard bargain, but I accept.”

Acrasia smirked, “looks like we have a deal, brother. But since you just asked me a question, it’s my turn. What’s the name of your object of affection?”

Wylan winced, “I um… I don’t know.”

Acrasia blinked, “what do you mean you don’t know?”

Wylan sighed, “I never learned it. It was at my masquerade ball.”

“Ah, the masquerade ball romance, this sounds like something out of a romance story. Are you sure you aren’t messing with me?” Acrasia asked.

Wylan looked directly at his sister, “look at my eyes, does it look like I’m lying?”

Acrasia looked back, taking a moment to analyze them before shaking her head, “no, you’re not lying.”

“That’s what I thought.”

“Since you technically didn’t answer my question-”

“No! I gave you the best answer I know how. Now it’s my turn to ask. How well do you and Diane know each other?”

“Well, she reads! I see her often at the royal library, she comes to the library under the pretext of getting strategy books and such, but secretly sneaks out fictional tales like mysteries and thrillers!”

“And so you talk to her whenever you encounter her at the library?” asked Wylan.

Acrasia nodded, “yes, I found out about her book smuggling and keep it a secret for her. And on that note, please don’t tell anyone.”

“My lips are sealed when it comes to Diane,” answered Wylan.

“Good, because if not, well… I’m going to make the fountain incident seem like nothing,” threatened Acrasia.

Wylan’s eyes widened, “that’s some threat. I’m not even sure if that’s possible.”

Acrasia smirked, “oh it is, and you don’t want to find out just how bad things can get.”

“I’ll be sure to keep my word on my silence then,” Wylan responded. “So do you talk about books and such?”

Acrasia shook her head, “you already asked a question, now it’s my turn. What’s so alluring about this masked ballgoer who’s name you don’t even know?”

Wylan stroked his chin in thought, “well… my galas are a search for an escape, but they no longer seemed that way. As burdens grew heavier, I began to find less solace, knowing what fate awaited me the next day. With them, however, it just all went away. I can’t explain it, they just… they make me feel giddy.”

Acrasia smiled, “I know that feeling. It’s wonderful, isn’t it?”

Wylan beamed and nodded, “it really is! I can’t stop thinking about them.” He sighed, smiling dimming, “but also… it hurts sometimes, when they’re apart from me. I long for them, and worry that they don’t feel the same way.”

Acrasia nodded solemnly, “I understand that sentiment well. So will you continue to hold galas if they no longer make you happy?”

“I have to, if it gives me a chance to see the masked dancer once more, it will have been worth it,” responded Wylan.

“I see.” Acrasia leaned closer, analyzing Wylan, “but its not the galas that sadden you, that shouldn’t be any different from normal. And when you speak of this person, the emotion in your voice is different too. There is something else troubling you, isn’t there?”

Wylan blinked, “I don’t understand.”

Acrasia shook her head, “don’t lie to me, brother. I have already told you my secrets, its your turn.”

Wylan sighed, “fine… it’s about father. I think something is wrong. But I can’t tell you here. Meet me at sundown in the library.”

Acrasia’s expression softened, “Wylan, what’s wrong? Is father okay, are you okay? You’re frightening me.”

Wylan moved toward the door, “library. Sundown.” He sighed, closing the door behind him. He hated making Acrasia wait like that, but he didn’t know who could be listening. This was the best way.
