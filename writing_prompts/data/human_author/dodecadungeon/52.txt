Conflicts are building, but there's still time for them to set things right. Here's the next part! - 

Acrasia always admired the wrong people.

She used to admire Greta Daelsong. Greta was a beautiful songstress who used to perform in the castle on special occasions. Acrasia was absolutely taken by her, she was so charming and graceful. Her smile so easy and flirty, Greta knew she was gorgeous and talented and wasn’t afraid to be proud of it.

At times Acrasia wanted to be her. To have that confidence and grace. To be able to walk into a room without anxiety or self-consciousness. To know that people will love you for who you are, and if they don’t, well, who gives a gold piece anyway?

Acrasia fell hard for Greta, and her affections did not go unnoticed by the talented songstress. She said sweet words to Acrasia, told her she was beautiful, made her feel desired. But soon Acrasia learned they were just words, nothing more. Greta had many lovers, all groveling at her feet. Acrasia saw what power could do to a person, it inflated their ego. She saw how beauty made people vain, how talent made one entitled. She cried herself to sleep that night.

She admired Anastasia Wells, a scholar of great renown. Acrasia read all her books, each one more fascinating than the last. Anastasia had spat in the face of limits. The arcane community claimed that ether could not be fabricated, yet Anastasia had created a synthetic ether that was much cheaper and more readily available that the original source. She wrote countless academic tomes diving into new possibilities of the arcane yet unexplored. She was a pioneer, bravely venturing where no one had gone prior.

Acrasia wished she had that confidence. To stare down the rules and people telling her no and to turn your back on them, going through with her plans regardless. To prove everyone wrong and become beloved for it. At least she thought.

Anastasia, just like Greta, proved to be an impossible illusion. The synthetic ether had disastrous side effects that wrecked havoc upon its users. Anastasia knew this from the beginning, and hid it with false science that was made credible only through the ethos she had falsely developed. Once she had enough power, she started stealing credit from lesser arcanists as well, claiming their work as her own.

And finally, Acrasia admired her brother, Wylan. Unlike Greta, he was not corrupted by power. He fought against it, was his own person despite expectations others had of him. He had looks, but never manipulated. Sure, he indulged, but that’s all it as, a mutual escape. He never broke hearts like Greta or lied like Anastasia. Wylan was honest and always himself, through and through.

Though just like her other heroes, Wylan was not without his own flaws. Acrasia realized that Wylan was lying. Not to others, but himself. He was running from responsibility, from the crown. He became distant with his family, and left Acrasia in the darkness. Still, she waited, but he never heard her cries for help. Acrasia was all alone.

So she turned to books. In books, reality need not apply. In fiction, beauties like Greta were not manipulative, but were sources of inspiration. They did not love out of a desire for more, but because they saw something special in those they cared about, and helped it blossom, just as Acrasia wished Greta could have done for her.

In her books, scholars like Anastasia held knowledge and truth in the highest order. They were always striving to better themselves and the world, pushing boundaries and making sure no one distorted the truth, rather than becoming a part of the deception.

And princes, princes were caring. They could be flawed at times, but in the way that a laugh was flawed. It might be squeaky or sound more like a snort, but in ways that could be endearing. The flaws were the truth of the prince, and he accepted them with unabashed confidence. He knew when his sister was hurting, he took advantage of his position without being corrupted by power. Wylan had almost become that idea. Acrasia had hope for him, but her faith was shattered once more.

Acrasia sighed, looking at the tokens of those she had put her faith in. The wilting flower from Greta, who had told her she had plucked the prettiest flower in the garden, just as Acrasia was the prettiest girl in the kingdom. She had given the same flower to six others. The flower survived only on her tears.

The vial of synthetic ether she had obtained from Anastasia. The vial signed by the arcanist herself. She couldn’t bare discarding it, only to keep it as a remainder to be careful of who she admired.

Finally, the cape she had gotten from Wylan. They more matching capes when Wylan first took Acrasia to one of his galas. Acrasia thought that the prince would stick with her for the ball, but he abandoned her the instant they arrived. Acrasia was so happy to finally visit one of the prince’s galas, with him to help her not be anxious. But the cape was made of false promises.

Next to the vial of synthetic ether was a tome of basic incantations. Acrasia had purchased it with the vial. At the time she believed she might become a mage, discarding royal expectations for her and embracing a life of scholarship and magic. Though her illusions were soon shattered when the truth of Anastasia was revealed.

Acrasia opened the tome, smiling weakly as she flipped through the pages. She recalled practicing the incantations nightly, for one had to master them before they could even begin to start using ether. It had been so long, but the memories flooded back to her as if she had last practiced yesterday. She forgot how meditative the practice could be. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and muttered the arcane syllables.

Calm flooded over her instantly, focusing on only the words. She repeated them over and over, letting them sink in to her mind. Hold themselves tight to her memory, evoking those long forgotten nights of study and meditation. As she spoke the phrases, she smiled. It felt good to smile for herself, and for no one else.

Acrasia always believed there was magic in the world, and each time she thought she found it, she discovered the ugly truth behind the wonder. The corruption behind the feigned honesty, the greed behind false charity, the grotesque truth behind the beautiful facade, and the cracks in promises that would never be kept.

Though Acrasia could put that wonder in her own hands. If no one else could show her true magic, true honesty, true beauty, or true kindness, she would have to find it on her own. Exploring through tomes and writing her own truths, putting in words how the world should be. And now, shaping it with magic.
