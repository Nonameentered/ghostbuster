“This has got to be the least glamorous way to travel. You know, when I signed up to become a plummer, traveling through any pipe instantaneously felt like a big plus. I wish they had told me it smells like shit. Also, you can’t even travel that far, I mean yeah, sure, pipes are pretty long, but they aren’t indefinite. I’d be lucky if I pipe ran the distance of a house let alone a city. The oil pipelines are the only real travel pipes and afterward you come out slick in oil, it took me two whole days to wash the stuff out.”
  

  
Hank rolled his eyes, “Are you done complaining?”
  

  
I shrugged, “I never am, but for now, I think I got it out of my system.”
  

  
Hank nodded, “Good, because we have bigger things to worry about. Something’s been breaking the pipes. I suspect sabotage. The plummers are a vital aspect of our country, whether it be for delivery, transport, or infrastructure, things would fall apart without us. The other countries haven’t adopted the plumbing system yet, they don’t know our technique.”
  

  
I waited impatiently as Hank gave his speech. He always did this, rambling on about dire threats. Maybe it was a threat, but perhaps their intentions weren’t that lofty. Sure, plummers are important enough, but it's not like I have to sleep with one eye open at night, “They’re close.”
  

  
Hank raised an eyebrow, “What makes you say that?”
  

  
“You couldn’t feel it? The transport over here was definitely choppy. Whatever did this has been breaking up the pipeline all along this section, they have a pattern, they’ll keep breaking up the pipe down this sewer. They’re close.”
  

  
That was one thing about being a plummer for too long. Yeah, sure, Hank couldn’t smell that horrible stench from the pipes and he even avoided most of the oil in pipelines, but those techniques and familiarity sacrificed a closer relationship with the pipes. I could feel when they were damaged, when they were too hot or too cold. It wasn’t a great feeling, but here, it finally came in useful.
  

  
“Found it!” Yelled Hank.
  

  
I rushed down the hall, ready to kick some skulls when I saw a fish. It was just a fish, breaking up the rusted, weathered pipes by slamming into them. Traveling through pipes is great, but it's far from glamorous.
