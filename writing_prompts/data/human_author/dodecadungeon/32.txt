My mother once told me that once I started talking I could keep on going forever. Well, she wasn’t that far off from the truth.
  

  
My gift only works while I’m talking. It’s a good thing I can keep on talking too, because running out of words to say while flying means… you’re no longer flying.
  

  
Sure, I could simply not use my gift, but what’s the fun in that? Besides, it’s great for getting to places efficiently, helping the occasionally damaged aircraft, or simply enjoying the view. Where once I was found to be an annoyance for my chattermouth, I am now the source of envy.
  

  
I occasionally sound like an insane person by rambling on, but who doesn’t at times? I can fly because I can talk on and on and on, but since my flight is rather short today, I’ll keep things brief.
