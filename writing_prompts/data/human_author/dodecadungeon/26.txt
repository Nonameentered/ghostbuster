Lol. I'm glad you like it! Here's the next part! - 

Acrasia wasn’t in her room, but an open journal was. Within it, Wylan saw the name Yevon. Wylan sighed, he had almost forgotten about that lead.

What Count Veris had mentioned earlier while arguing with Rene had proven correct. Yevon was a solider of great renown, skilled in tactics and close with the King. He was his chief tactical advisor in a war many years prior. Though, in that war, there was a noble cause to back it. The enemy territory had attacked first, during a festival celebrating the harmony between nations, no less. The war was quick, not even lasting a year, for their goal was not to punish the nation, but only the particular wrongdoers who orchestrated the plot. With incredible tactics which led to a succession of clear victories, the rival nation had no choice but to turn over the plotters to the King to be punished.

After that, peace between the two nations had been restored. Yevon worked together with Bennedict to continue advising the King in a time of prosperity, but with Yevon being a military advisor, he had few duties to perform during peacetime, which is why the King decided it would be best for Yevon to instruct the prince while Bennedict continued to advise the King. Though, what Acrasia had noted was that Yevon was killed only a short time before the war with Bethanla had begun.

Wylan scratched his head, it didn’t make any sense. With Yevon as the head of the military, the current conflict with Bethanla would likely never have begun. Rene hated the war with a vehement passion. Why then, would he kill Yevon, who would have stopped it? Perhaps it was a necessary evil to rise to power, and also create a conflict that would lead the commoners to riot, but something still felt off.

He continued reading through Acrasia’s notes, the illness symptoms seemed to match the King’s almost exactly. Furthermore, Benedict came down with an illness as well, with symptoms exactly matching the King’s. The illness eventually led to death, which was explained by Rene’s desire to unseat the nobles in charge of the military at present, but it acted incrediby slowly, perhaps a flaw in the illness that was difficult to avoid. But with this power to give people illness, who could be next?

Wylan sighed, closing the journal. The illness… his father was comatose because of it. He may have missed his last chance to speak with him, but the least he could do was pay his respects and say his final words to him, hoping that his father might hear them, as silly as it sounded.

The King’s chambers were dismal without his magnificent presence enveloping it. He still had a presence, just a dwindling one, like the fading light of embers as they cool. Wylan took a deep breath. He couldn’t believe that his father was so close to his end. He hoped there was some antidote, some way he could bring his father back. But with every answer he found two more questions emerged.

Wylan leaned close to his father’s bedside, eyes wet from emotion, “Father… I’m sorry. I tried to do as you said. To heed your warning and figure out the conspiracy before you succumbed to the illness, but I couldn’t do it. Maybe if I had done things differently, if only I hadn’t pushed away Acrasia. She could fix this. She’s so smart, father. I know that we didn’t always see her, so focused on the future or running away from it, but perhaps the greatest gift you gave me was not the royal bloodline, the lavish castle chambers, the authority of a prince, nor the crown that I will inherit, but a sister.

“I know I didn’t always show it, but I was grateful to have you as my father. I was scared, I was frightened of the responsibility. Because you have been such a great king, how could I ever hope to live up to that? But now I know I don’t have to. I don’t have to be in your shadow, but I can rule in my own way. That’s why you didn’t assign Bennedict to teach me. He would have taught me to rule like you did, but that doesn’t work for me. I needed something different. I see that now.

“Now finally taking the time to learn my responsibilities, putting in the effort to strive to learn what the duties of the crown truly are, I have come to admire you even more deeply. I would not be prepared for this moment without you. Thank you, father. Thank you for all you’ve taught me, whether I knew it or not, thank you.”

“You’ve grown, Wylan. Your father would be proud.”

Wylan’s blood boiled, that was Rene’s voice. He turned to him eyes furious, “It doesn’t make since, first Yevon, then the King, now Bennedict, they’re all succumbing to the same illness. All the noble and just people within this castle are dying or dead.”

“Not you, Wylan,” Rene replied.

Wylan shook his head, “I’m not noble or just. And if I am, I’ll be gone soon. And you’ll still be here.”

Rene blinked, “Wylan, I understand you’re in distress, but-”

Wylan cut him off, “Quiet! This isn’t your time to speak. How could this happen? Rene, you spoke of a revolt being inevitable. This is the price paid for such violence. Good people die, good people who could have made that change peacefully!”

Rene sighed, “It’s just an illness, Wylan. It’s a tragedy, but it’s not regicide.”

Wylan grit his teeth, “It’s no coincidence, Rene, we both know that. Make your next steps very carefully, and may the King serve as a reminder.”

Rene moved to place his hand on the prince’s shoulder, “Wylan, please, take a deep breath.”

Wylan swatted Rene’s hand away, “I will not! But what I don’t understand is why explain it all to me. Why tell me about what is to come. It is not a future I will be apart of, so why not keep me in the darkness, did you really think you could sway me?”

Rene shook his head, “My goal was never to sway you, I wanted you to make your own judgements.”

Wylan slammed his fist against the headboard of the King’s bed, “Lies!”

Rene looked downward, “Believe as you wish, but I have no reason to lie to you.”

“And why is that?”

“The King offered me a noble title when I took this job, but I declined. I did not come here to advance my station, I came here because I wanted to help guide the next prince. I hold your father in high regard. I have no reason to be kind to you because I am not looking to scratch backs or rub shoulders, which may have annoyed you at times, but I only did it for your own good. Your father would be proud of the man you have become, I am proud of who you have became. And though I cannot take credit for your growth, I am fortunate to have been alongside you as you’ve learned what it means to be worthy of the crown.”

“Is your cause that pure? That you would end the King’s life after all of that?”

Rene gasped, “End the King’s life? Wylan, are you implying I have something to do with the King’s illness.”

Wylan sighed, he was revealing too much. Acrasia and Nydas would have stopped him before he yelled at Rene. But he didn’t care. Nydas had gone off to get himself killed and Acrasia hated him. His father was dead and soon Bennedict would be gone too. Rene’s betrayal was the last straw. “Yes, that is exactly what I am implying.”

“What reason would I have to kill the King?”

“More than enough reasons. You gave Yevon the same illness so you could steal the advisor position from under his feet. You chose only angry commoners who wished to be something more as your elite crown guard and claimed to be one of them becaus you were a commoner. You got them to perform a set up and steal back the Scepter of Ruling. Once the King was dead, I would ascend to power, and my ear would be yours, made further susceptible to influence with the scepter. I would be your puppet king as you ushered in an era where the commoners ruled and nobles begged for scraps beneath their feet.”

Rene stood in shock as Wylan spoke, taking a moment after the prince finished to digest his words, “I… I don’t know what to say. You claim I am part of some deep conspiracy, but I have not the scepter in my position or the crown guard in my command. Something you made sure to prevent me from having.”

Wylan glared at Rene, “Stop it with the lies, all the signs point to you!”

Rene put his hands up, “I swear to you that I’m being truthful. If you want I can show you my quarters, prove to you there is no scepter.”

Wylan shook his head, “That won’t do, you could be hiding them somewhere else in the castle.”

“Then do a full sweep of the castle, search for the scepter.”

“No, not with your guards.”

“They aren’t mine, then choose your own guards, it matters not. If the scepter really is as dangerous as you say, it needs to be in the right hands.”

“But you already know we’re doing a sweep, you’ll have a head start to put in a place that won’t be found.”

“I’ll remain right here, there is no one I can contact.”

“What is your plan here?”

“I wish to find out the truth as much as you. I stated before that I have no reason to lie to you, Wylan. Look into my eyes and tell me what you see.”

“You don’t deserve that courtesy.”

“Look, please.”

Wylan sighed, turning to look into Rene’s eyes, “You don’t appear to be lying, or perhaps you’re just obscuring the truth.”

“Then watch for any changes,” Rene responded, “I did not take the scepter, the crown guard are not under my authority, I did not give Yevon, the King, or Bennedict any illness nor did anyone under my employ, and I do not want to overthrow the regime or manipulate you. I am loyal to the crown. To your father. To you.”

Wylan shook his head, “I see no lies, but I am not convinced.”

“Then do the sweep,” Rene suggested, “interrogate the guards. Use your authority, you’re the prince. Act like one, dammit!”

Wylan raised a brow, “All this and yet you still advise me?”

Rene nodded, “I made a promise to your father, and I intend to keep it.”

Wylan sighed, “Full sweep it is. I’ll get a messenger to carry the word out. But you’re staying right here, with me. Understood?”

Rene smiled, “Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.”
