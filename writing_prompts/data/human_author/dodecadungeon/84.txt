“Oh my gosh, is that the elephant shirt?” Aino asked with a gasp.
  

  
Helena blushed, “my brother told you about the elephant shirt?”
  

  
Aino giggled, “yeah, sorry, should I not have mentioned it?”
  

  
Helena sighed, “I should have expected nothing less from my brother. It’s embarrassing but it holds value to me.”
  

  
Aino shook her head, “no, I think it’s cute. The paint from the elephant’s nose forms little trunk kisses on your shirt, it’s adorable!”
  

  
“You’re just being nice.”
  

  
“No! I mean, I am nice, at least I like to think so, but I’m being genuine!”
  

  
“Did my brother put you up to this?”
  

  
“Up to what?”
  

  
“He always pulls pranks like this, telling you about the elephant shirt just to see what reaction it gets from me.”
  

  
“No, I came here because I wanted to.”
  

  
“You really need a bass guitar player? I’m not very good.”
  

  
“Your brother said you’d be modest, but you’ve been practicing for ten years, you must be pretty good!”
  

  
“Self-taught, so I’m not very disciplined.”
  

  
“Still, skill is skill. Your brother said people cheered when you played your riff during the Wizard of Oz play.”
  

  
Helena blushed, “he told you about that too? I shouldn’t be surprised. It was an accident. I was messing around with it backstage and I didn’t realize it was connected to the amp.”
  

  
“But it was right during the entrance to the Emerald City, that’s dramatic! Not to mention incredible timing,” Aino pointed out.
  

  
Helena shrugged, “got lucky, I guess. The theater teacher was really mad about it though.”
  

  
Aino smirked, “screw them! You did something awesome and you deserve to feel good about that!”
  

  
Helena sighed, “it’s just luck, that’s all. They had a right to be mad.”
  

  
Aino frowned, then grinned, “well, maybe I can decide for myself. Would you mind playing something for me on your guitar?”
  

  
Helena paused in thought, “I… I don’t know.”
  

  
Aino smiled softly, “I won’t say a word during the performance. I’ll be a perfect audience.”
  

  
Helena nodded, “alright, I’ll play for you. But be nice, okay?”
  

  
Aino beamed, “of course! Anything for you, Helena.”
  

  
Helena blushed faintly before grabbing her guitar and beginning to play.
  

  
Helena’s brother observed the pair from a distance, chuckling to himself. They were going to make such a cute couple.
