“Give me a harder one, he stole someone else’s identity. It’s deception at the price of another. So the punishment is honesty at the detriment of him.”
  

  
Verdius blinked, “How do you enforce honesty?”
  

  
Gavel shrugged, “You’re the goddess of justice, just curse him to only speak the truth for a year.”
  

  
“Interesting…” Verdius sighed, “I can’t keep doing this.”
  

  
Gavel shook his head, “You can. You want to help these people the best you can and give them the right justice. If consultation is what allows you to achieve that, then there is nothing wrong with that.”
  

  
“If I could make decisions, that was one thing, but all of your verdicts have been better than mine. I’m the goddess of justice, I should know the answers, but I don’t.”
  

  
“You sound like you don’t want the position… Verdius… you’re a deity. One that can do real good. Aren’t those two things enough to make you want to keep it? You’re doing just fine, trust me.”
  

  
“I don’t. I don’t want it. I am not the person for this position. I’m sorry Gavel, I tried.”
  

  
“But if not you, who else?”
  

  
“You!”
  

  
“But I’m not a god!”
  

  
“You can be.”
  

  
“You’re suggesting… no, you know I can’t do that.”
  

  
“Why not?”
  

  
“I am just a mortal, I can’t compete with others trying to obtain godhood.”
  

  
“You don’t have to.”
  

  
“What do you mean? Of course I do, you may be a paragon of justice, but I’m not. I can… bend the rules a little.”
  

  
“Verdius, are you sure about this?”
  

  
“Yes. I know I can’t keep doing this, and I know that you would be perfect for the position. This would allow us to both get what we want.”
  

  
“But my entire ascension will be built on false justice.”
  

  
“Who’s justice? It is an injustice that you weren’t the one to get my position in the first place, please… consider it.”
  

  
Verdius wasn’t sure if Gavel would show up, but sure enough, he did. The Goddess looked at him, his tattered, bloody and heaving form. She rose from her throne and smiled. "Congratulations. You've won."
