Post-apocalyptic is a terrible misnomer. In your mind, you might think of desolate wastelands and radioactive nightmares, but we are currently living in a post-apocalyptic world. The fact that there can be a post-apocalypse is optimistic, it means we can survive and persist even after disaster, which we have.

I wish I could call him something other than the old man, but that is what he was. I knew not how old he was, but he claimed to have lived through the last apocalypse.

I didn’t believe him at first, until I had no choice.
  

  
Meghan had entered stage four, her cancer was terminal, and there was nothing the doctors could do. The old man offered me a solution. He told me he was able to save Angie, who had experienced the same symptoms as Meghan.
  

  
He took me beneath the earth, and among ruins, there was an obelisk which he claimed had the power to save her. I knew not the risk, but if there was a chance to help Meghan, I had to try.
  

  
I never got to thank the old man for saving Meghan. He died before the process was finished. He had lived more lifetimes than he could count, and I knew he found peace in rest, reunited with Angie in the beyond.
  

  
Meghan and I went to the old man’s house after, to sort through his things and let the world know who he truly was. After what he had done for Meghan, I couldn’t let him be forgotten.
