“That’s not going to hit me, he threw it over there it’s- gah!” Charlie gasped, the knife impaled in his side.
  

  
Symon blinked, then ripped the knife out of Charlie’s side, “What… no, it can’t be…”
  

  
Charlie raised an eyebrow, “What is it, Symon?”
  

  
“This is tuplamatter,” Symon explained, “created from spiritual energy, it doesn’t follow the rules of our world.”
  

  
“So that’s why it hit me despite being thrown from the wrong angle?”
  

  
“Dodge right.”
  

  
“What?”
  

  
“He’s throwing another one.”
  

  
“But it’s not going to hit me.”
  

  
“What did we learn last time? Hurry, dodge!”
  

  
Charlie nodded and sidestepped, missing the attack by a fraction of an inch, “Thanks, so, as you were saying?”
  

  
Symon nodded, “Ah, yes. The trajectory, gravity, all of those things function differently there.”
  

  
“How many of those tulip knives can he make?”
  

  
“It’s tulpa, not tulip, and as long as he’s spiritually focused, he should be able to keep conjuring them. They are temporary which means he can keep reusing the tuplamatter from earlier and knives aren’t difficult to make.”
  

  
“So how do we break him from his spiritual concentration? Hit him really damn hard?”
  

  
“Not put so simply, but essentially, yes. Hit him really damn hard.”
