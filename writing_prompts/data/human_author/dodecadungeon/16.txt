Most prom queens peak in high school. Tracy Hayek however, just kept on peaking. She went to a college of design where she became one of the lead fashion designers in the runway community, while also modeling while at it. She had it all, money, looks, a future. Life handed everything to her on a silver plate, and she was picky with what she took from it, she had a figure to maintain, after all.
  

  
Though there was one thing that always bothered Tracy. As famous as she got, as much wealth and connections she accumulated, she was always acutely aware of criticism of her status. That it wasn’t earned. She had the Hayek name which meant wealth, status, and beauty. She had the looks to model and the friends to rise up in the design community, the looks to catch the perfect husband, and the money to live a very very comfortable life.
  

  
Sometimes she would lie awake in bed and wonder what her life might have been like if she had never been born into a wealthy family, without their status and money. Would she still be Tracy Hayek? Model and design guru? Most people said she wouldn’t, but she believed she could. So she left everything to her husband and abandoned everything accept the spare change left in her purse and set out to build a new empire from scratch, adopting a new name so she wouldn’t have the Hayek connections, dying her hair and wearing clothes that the old Tracy would never be caught dead in.
  

  
Soon, she was caught dead in them.
  

  
Tracy only lasted a month on her own, she was killed in a mugging accident, and it wasn’t until DNA analysis was used that people realized that this dirty, rag-wearing, sickly woman was in fact the former fashion star, Tracy Hayek.
