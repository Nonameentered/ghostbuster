Part 3! -

Balor was an outcast. He was not welcomed in the Heavens above nor the Hells below. So he walked the land of the mortals.
  

  
He had not stepped foot on the in-between in ages. The Hells were his home, they were where he found home, kinship, and love, he had no reason to leave. Now, back in the land of mortals, things were so different.
  

  
While the Hells and Heaven remained the same, the land of mortals changed. This would have never happened if Eve had not Fallen. Eden would have remained a Heaven in its own right, a world so perfect there would be no need for change, just like the realm of angels. Yet, because they Fell, they were no longer static, they would change. The Hells and Heavens had the same values and views they held eons ago, yet those of mortals changed, improved even. They no longer roamed like feral creatures, but had laws and structure. Laws that changed when they were wrong, leaders that rise and fell. If God was a mortal, he would have been pushed out of his throne long ago.
  

  
And as Balor took in the mortal world, he did not just see, he heard. Not just conversation and critters. Not just chanting and singing. He heard prayers.
  

  
Before he was purified, the thought of hearing a prayer was unfathomable. Being at the mercy of mortals rather than the mortals being at his was… refreshing. Just like with his beloved, he was ready to do what was needed to make her life better. These mortals had prayers that needed resolve. Ones Balor would answer.

When Satan died, he reverted to his true form. Beautiful even in death, Satan’s body was presented to the devilsas proof that their former lord had never truly accepted the Hells as his home, and his weakness had been his demise.
  

  
This new devilish form Orion wore had no past, so he created his own. Rumors spread of the devil who had defeated the Lord of the Hells, and anyone who opposed him would be killed at his own hand. The secret of devil vulnerability remained with Orion, dying with anyone who learned of it.
  

  
Orion knew it would not be enough. The Hells were lesser to Heaven. As long as he wore his demon form he could not challenge the angels above. He need one who was beyond devil or angel. He needed the purified one.

With each prayer Balor answered, he grew a feather. He already walked the line between devil and angel, but the devilish qualities that remained began to fade the more he performed good deeds. He never needed God to aid him in becoming an angel, he could achieve the form of Heaven on his own.
  

  
By the time he finally heard word from beyond the land of mortals, he had already blossomed a pair of celestial wings. When Balor heard that the King of the Hells was coming to greet him, he expected to see Satan, but instead he was greeted by someone new.
  

  
He called himself Orion. Balor thought it strange that this devil held a celestial name, but in a way, so did Satan. Balor bowed to Orion, “King of the Hells, what brings you to the land of the mortals?”
  

  
Orion raised his hand, “Stand, purified one. Though I must ask, why did you bow to me? You are no longer one of the Hells.”
  

  
Balor shook his head, “No matter what form I may take, my home is always in the Hells. Besides, the Heavens do not welcome me.”
  

  
The King of the Hells cackled, “What fools those angels are. To think they would cast aside the only purified devil in history. No matter. You need not be an outcast any longer. I offer you sanctuary in the Hells.”
  

  
The purified devil’s eyes widened, “Truly? The Hells would welcome me even now? Even I hardly recognize what I have become.”
  

  
Orion raised an eyebrow, “I don’t understand, you did not always look like this?”
  

  
“No,” Balor replied, “I became more angelic as I answered prayers.”
  

  
“Prayers?” Orion laughed, “To think, some angels fall for answering prayers, and yet you, a purified devil, rise for the chance to answer them.”
  

  
“Yes. I do not understand why devils are not able to answer prayers. If only they would have the gift I have. Perhaps the world would be a better place.”
  

  
“A better place? You call the Hells your home yet you yearn for a better world? Your time in the mortal world has corrupted you.”
  

  
“Satan wouldn’t have thought that. He was an angel once, in a way, his banishment was a prayer unanswered, instead God cast him out, just as he did to me. What happened to Satan, did he step down?”
  

  
“He is dead.”
  

  
“Dead? How? No devil has ever met their end.”
  

  
“Believe it or deny it, Satan has passed. Now take your rightful place in Hell and answer your prayer to return home.”
  

  
“First, tell me why you welcome me now. If you do not share my vision, what has changed?”
  

  
“You are an outcast from Heaven, all outcasts are welcome in the Hells.”
  

  
“Yet you claimed to not have known me prior. Do not lie to me, Orion. If that is truly your name.”
  

  
Orion sighed, “Do not make this more difficult than it needs to be. You are bereft of your home, I am offering you a chance to return. Take it.”
  

  
Balor shook his head, “No, not until you are truthful to me, why do you want me, King of Hells?”
  

  
“I need you as my weapon, for I am to declare war on Heaven. We can have our vengeance together. Those rejected by the angelic realm will have their reckoning. I am offering you a chance at real change, what you spoke of. Will you take it?”
  

  
“Change? No immortal, devil or angel, has spoken of change since Satan. What are you?”
  

  
Orion smirked, “Something new.”
