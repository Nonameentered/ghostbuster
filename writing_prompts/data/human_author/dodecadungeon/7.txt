I'm sorry to hear about your mental health, I hope the break helped. And awww, thanks for the kind words! Here's the next part!

When a book has little to say on the surface, one has to learn how to read between the lines. Fortunately, Acrasia had a lot of practice in that regard.
  

  
Runic magic was different from arcane magic. Arcane magic was free. There was a harmony between ether and caster, both working together to create something beautiful with magic. Runic magic was much more constrained, the rules of the magic had already been inscribed. While arcane magic listened to the caster, for runic magic, the caster had to listen to the runes. They had to decipher their meaning, to decode their truths. Both required work, with ether magic the incantations had to be practiced over and over, while with runic magic, the work was in uncovering the runes’ meaning. This made runic magic difficult to write about because understanding the runic language did not mean understanding the runes. More effort had to be put into comprehending particular runic inscriptions.
  

  
The basics came first, however, which lay in understanding the runic language. It was different from a spoken language or even most written language because the runes did not follow normal grammatical patterns. Every rune was a command or a hypothetical. If a condition was met, the rune would trigger, and the commands would sequentially activate following the hypothetical being realized.
  

  
Fortunately, Acrasia was a quick learner, quickly figuring out the runic language. Learning was like a game to her, it was a puzzle in itself. She visualized and understood words in ways others could not. Some needed to hear spoken explanations to truly comprehend, and others needed visuals for learning, but Acrasia only needed words to understand.
  

  
Every single rune told a story, it started with the condition to activate in the center, growing and expanding to some more complex shape and form as it grew outward. Acrasia practiced drawing the runes as practice, attempting to understand them. She traced them with care, exploring the patterns and branches.
  

  
She wanted to tell Diane, she wanted to tell Diane everything. She felt so free with her, able could express all her thoughts without worrying about how she would be perceived. Though within her was a lingering fear. A fear that Diane was just another Greta, a powerful woman who took advantage of those below her.
  

  
Acrasia wanted it to be different, she believed Wylan when he told her it would be, but Wylan couldn’t be trusted either. Though perhaps Wylan is right, Diane is working with the enemy, after all. Perhaps she was just manipulating Acrasia. She shook her head and sighed. Hoping that Diane and Acrasia could really have something special together, just like in her romance novels.
  

  
Though Acrasia questioned now if that was what she wanted. Even in romance novels, relationships aren’t perfect. They take work, the world wasn’t perfect. There was wonder in the world, Acrasia still believed that, but it wasn’t free of strife. Even magic had its dark side. Even novels have conflict. Though that’s no reason not to try anyway, to take a chance on someone. Even knowing that, it was still so hard to take that leap.
  

  
Acrasia analyzed her book on legendary items, looking at the sketch of the Scepter of Ruling. There were runic symbols present on it, she only hoped that the sketch depicted them correctly. She searched through her tomes on runes to find ones that matched the ones on the ether-infused artifact, noting any ones that matched.
  

  
She meticulously searched for every pattern present on the runes. They weren’t exact of course, each rune was unique based on its function, but enough that she could begin to decipher them.
  

  
The condition to activate the scepter was of course ether, but it required a specific incantation which Acrasia began to uncover. The amount of ether was extremely precise as well. She hoped that her deciphering and calculations were correct, for an error could ruin her entire research.
  

  
Knowing the condition wasn’t knowledge she hoped she needed. She never planned on using the scepter, but it was crucial to figuring out the rest of the runic structures. The runes were quite beautiful, the way their patterns, which had a degree of logic and functionality to them, were also a work of art as a marriage between science and beauty that many rarely saw. Acrasia thought knowledge was often beautiful, but this was proof that it could be, present in the form of magnificent runes.
  

  
After the ether and incantation activated the starting condition, another condition has to be met. The Scepter of Ruling must be directed at its target and another incantation spoken. The wielder must speak the target’s true name, followed by a basic command of what they want the target to do. This command is the first degree of control.
  

  
Once the condition is met, the target is faced with a mental barrage by the wielder, if the wielder is victorious, the target must perform the command. They are not fully controlled yet, however. They still have autonomy in how they perform the command, and once the command is finished, they have autonomy once more.
  

  
While this is the weakest form of control, it requires the least amount of the scepter’s power. Using these commands, the wielder can control multiple targets and even command them all at the same time. 
  

  
The second degree of control is puppeteering. The target’s body is almost completely under the control of the wielder. Though the wielder can only control one target at a time this way. When puppeteered but not current commanded by the wielder, they enter a dormant state where it is easier for the target to attempt to break free.
  

  
The final degree of control is possession. To perform a possession, the wielder must have complete dominance over the target. They are completely at the mercy of the controller, though the controller’s body is in a dormant state while possessed. The wielder can only have one target in this state at a time and control no others, but the target cannot resist in this form. The wielder's power is absolute.
  

  
Acrasia gasped upon reading the final clause of the scepter’s runes. She hugged herself and shivered. What horror would befall the castle, the kingdom for that matter, should occur if the employer discovered how to use the runes? Acrasia sighed, she needed to understand these runes more, perhaps there was a way to counteract them with runes of her own, something, anything to stop the Scepter of Ruling’s wielder from taking over the castle and the throne.
