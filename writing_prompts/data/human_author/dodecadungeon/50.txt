All good, glad your wifi is working again! And thanks! That might be my favorite interaction between them so far. Here's the next part! - 

Wylan found the papers in his room. Though to say that would be an understatement. The amount of papers which now occupied his room was much more than he expected. It turns out, five years of financial records was a lot of paperwork.

The first thing he did was backtrack to the start of the conflict, which, considering it was only a few years back, he had much more paper than he needed. He began skimming the papers before the war declaration, and then checked the papers which followed its start, making note of any changes.

It wasn’t easy, the records were organized in a way confusing to Wylan, though after taking some time to understand the system of organization, he began to make sense of it. Most went unchanged. The staff were still paid the same amount, the amount of money spent on feasts and festivals also remained the same, and predictably, however, the weapon’s budget increased.

Along with the weapon’s budget increase there were also increases spent buying supplies such as rations for soldiers, as well as mounts and vehicles. There were of course tax increases which went along with these changes, though as time went on, the budget for weapons, supplies, and vehicles drastically increased, as well as the taxes.

Wylan sighed, no wonder the commoners were so upset at the prospect of more taxes, they were practically being drained dry. All of the taxes disporportionally affected the commonfolk, which seemed unfair, considering this was a war started by and fought by nobles, with the commonfolk uninvolved.

The prince wondered what had changed in order to warrant such a drastic increase in budgets for the war. He knew that conflicts tended to escalate over time, but this seemed unnatural. He would have to look more into the war in order to discover what caused the increase.

He had other priorites, though with Diane busy once again, and a lot of steam to blow off, Wylan turned his attention elsewhere. Toward the potential employer: Rene.

Wylan found Rene incredibly easily. Hells, he even had his agenda for the day. He expected it to be a decoy or outdated, but it was accurate. Rene was exactly where he said he’d be. Wylan wasn’t sure whether to be surprised or impressed.

“The situation with Bethanla is getting out of hand. The amount of resources going into that conflict is absurd. It is not a popular war either. The commonfolk develop more disdain for the skirmished by the day,” Rene explained to a subordinate.

Wylan watched, tucked away from view, as Rene spoke. There was clearly a kinship with the commonfolk that Rene felt. He hated to villainize that after the situation with Diane. A noble cause brings about sacrifices that are difficult to make. They allow good people to have justifications for bad things. If only they could see the consequences of their actions, then perhaps they could be persuaded, but he did not know how Rene thought. Could this be motivated by righteousness, or is the whole commonfolk act a way to manipulate people to his side?

Though Wylan found his last tutoring session with Rene confusing following that addendum. Rene had been extremely open with Wylan. Wylan normally held no love for Rene. He was pushy, poorly dressed, and an annoyance. But over the past few days, he has informed him very well on the affairs of the state and beyond. When Rene explained the conflict abroad, he told him things that no other nobles would. Though it did still line up with his commoner agenda, why would he let the prince in on it? Perhaps Rene believed he could gain the prince’s trust, though considering their previous hatred for each other, this seemed like an unexpected change in plans. Wylan sighed, he supposed he would just have to wait and find out Rene’s plans.

The man Rene was speaking to was one Wylan did not recognize. He was bearded, with many grey hairs showing in both his beard and head. He had beady eyes and a ruddy compexion, an athletic build despite his age, and was extremely well-dressed, emphasized further by Rene’s usual disheveled appearance.

The man spoke in response to Rene, “The commonfolk benefit from this war as well. Our enemies would destroy much more than fields if it weren’t for the military. Bethanla continues to hurl funds into this war, their armies steadily increasing. We must continue armament to meet these demands.”

Rene sighed, “Count Veris, you know that is not entirely true. Have the battles increased in scale? Or merely the resources spent on the war? If you could even call it a war. It is a conflict in the vilest sense. There is noble cause behind it. No one has even gained an inch of land since the conflict has started. It has been entirely fruitless.”

The man called Count Veris sneered, “Your words are meaningless, not that would could possibly understand the war, commoner.”

The word was spat with venom, causing Rene to grit his teeth, “My blood has nothing to do with my ability.”

Veris laughed, “You’re wrong once more. Nobles are trained in war and strategy, we understand the importance of battle. Commoners don’t. Your predecessor, Yevon, understood the value of battle. How unfortunate that we are stuck with you instead.”

“Yevon was a good man, one who passed to soon. But we must make due with our current arrangement. I have yielded to you in compromise, yet you refuse to extend the same courtesy to me.”

“You must compromise to get what you want, Rene. I do not. That is the difference between you and I.”

“There are much more differences than just that, Veris. Sooner or later the conflict will be revealed for what it truly is. The commoners cannot take much more of the nobles’ lies, the truth always wins in the end.”

“What truth? History is written by the victors, and as a warrior, I intend to win.”

“May history prove you wrong.”

The Count scoffed and trodded away, Rene cursing and slamming his fist on the conference table. He sighed, taking a moment to regain his composure, “What did you want to talk to me about, Wylan?”

Wylan blinked in surprise, but did not move.

Rene sighed, “I know you’re there, Your Highness. It is alright, while I would rather you have not seen that confrontation. You have, and perhaps it will serve your political education well.”

Wylan stepped out of the shadows, “For how long did you know I was listening?”

Rene smirked, “Long enough. I am not new to spies. As you have seen, the noble court and I… do not get along very well.”

Wylan nodded, “I can see that. Do you really believe what you said? That the truth will emerge?”

Rene nodded in return, “I do. There already more than whispers of unrest, soon they will be shouts.”

“Do you believe what will follow is right?” Wylan asked.

Rene shook his head, “That isn’t for me to decide, Wylan. It will happen regardless.”

“Nothing is for certain, perhaps we can handle this another way,” responded Wylan.

Rene smiled, “Ah, Wylan. Your idealism is refreshing. I’d like to believe you speak true, though only time will tell.”

“I would like to believe that too. Say, Rene, do you know if our soldiers plunder enemy lands during the conflict?” Wylan inquired.

Rene raised an eyebrow, “No, they do not. As I said earlier, not an inch of land has been claimed by either side. The skirmishes have avoided cities as well, most battles taking place in fields.”

Wylan blinked, “That is surprising. I heard we have some artifacts from Bethanla, I presumed they were claimed through plunder.”

Rene shook his head, “They were not.”

“Then did we buy them from Bethanla? That seems unlikely during wartime, and such valuable items with already a bloated budget, we could not afford to make such rash financial decisions.”

“Very astute, young prince.”

“So, do you know how we obtained them?”

“I would not ask questions you do not want to know the answer to.”

“But, this could be important, we should alert the King.”

Rene sighed, “The King is comatose, Wylan. His condition worsens by the hour.”

Wylan gasped, “No… why wasn’t I informed?”

Rene shook his head, “I planned in informing you as soon as I saw you, I just wasn’t expecting to see you so soon, let alone sneak up on me.”

Wylan turned his eyes downcast, “I apologize, Rene.”

Rene made a dismissive gesture, “It is passed. Did you follow the money?”

Wylan nodded, “I did. The war budget continues to increase, but something tells me the conflict is not increasing at the same rate.”

Rene nodded in return, “You are correct in that assumption.”

Wylan sighed, “And we can’t inform the King about this, considering his condition… the nobles have total control.”

Rene put his hand on Wylan’s shoulder, “Do not despair just yet, Wylan.”

Wylan nodded before exiting the conference room, wincing. Every word Rene spoke was right, yet the looming threat he mentioned all but confirmed Wylan’s suspicions. But Rene was not easy to sneak up on, or even worried about being spied on. Wylan would have to plan his next steps carefully.
