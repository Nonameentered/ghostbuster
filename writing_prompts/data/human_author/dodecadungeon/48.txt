They burn their corpses to prevent them from returning to haunt them. They wear holy symbols to keep the evil spirits at bay. They waste no morsel of their prized hunts, leaving nothing left to return with a vengeful soul. But things with skeletons aren’t the only corpses that I can call to my side.
  

  
The mayor who has put up such harsh decrees against my practices hides in his ivory house, feasting each night with his family and believing himself safe behind the walls. Though his folly does not come from the food he ate, nor his grandmother’s bones that rest beneath his home, but in the form of his child’s toy: a carved wooden duck.
  

  
The boy looks at his toy with wonder as it comes to life. What is wood but a corpse of a tree, after all? The boy’s other toys begin to come to life, they hop off his shelves and join a hoard of wooden effigies all marching towards to mayor’s study, the wooden duck leading the charge. The mayor’s eyes widen as they crawl up his legs. He tries to swat them away to no avail, they trip him to the ground and pull him across the floor. The toys hopped atop him and kept him restrained. He screams and fails, but all his servants are locked in their rooms, the wooden corpses they call doors keeping them locked in their room. The entire house then lurches, he should not have made it out of ivory, of the corpses of elephants. 
  

  
I smile, waltzing up to the front door of the house as it opens for me. Time to show the mayor who really controls this town.
