“You’re so jittery!” giggled Thomas.
  

  
Remus blushed, “I just… I’m not used to all this.”
  

  
Thomas laughed, “affection?”
  

  
Remus shrugged, “the hugs and stuff, but yeah, I guess.”
  

  
Thomas sighed, stroking Remus’ cheek gently, “I’m sorry, Remus. I hope I can help change that.”
  

  
Remus shivered slightly as Thomas touched his cheek, but did not recoil, “I think that maybe you can. I no longer shriek when touched, so that’s a plus.”
  

  
Thomas chuckled, “and I’m glad, because I love hugging you.”
  

  
Remus giggled, “you really do love hugs, it’s adorable.”
  

  
Thomas beamed, “thank you for taking a chance on this hugging fool.”
  

  
Remus smiled, “best decision I ever made.”
