That’s what we were told about our powers. Insects are the masters of symbiosis, we too have embraced a symbiotic relationship in return to both reap the benefits of this alliance. We assumed ourselves to be the beneficiaries of this relationship, our physiology slowly changing as our minds learn the language of our chosen insect. We believed it was our mind prying into theirs, mining the insects for their abilities to empower ourselves. We were wrong, it was not us who could create the telepathic link, but them.

Not us, we were the puppets. Do you know why ants and bees are willing to sacrifice their lives for the queen? The queen is the only one that needs to reproduce, so to carry on to the next generation, the queen is the most important. Now, what does that mean with telepathy? The queen is the only mind that matters. A single organism with access to thousands of mindless thralls at its command. We are now added to those numbers.

But they did not call to me. Those chosen by the ants and bees, the formcimancers and anthophilimancers, are an ever-growing army, amassing more soldiers as time draws on. I heard the call of a different insect, the spider.

They will call to you.

As an arachnomancer I weave my web, plotting underneath. While the empire of hills and hives expands ever further above the surface, below I plot. For I know the weakness of their army, I don’t need to face millions of soldiers, I only need to kill the queen.
