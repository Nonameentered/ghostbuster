George was always clumsy.
  

  
His dad blamed George and his clumsiness for his mother’s death. George took so long to fumble with the camera at the Grand Canyon that his mother fell backward. His father from then on would constantly call out George’s clumsiness, scolding it.
  

  
George spent years working on his hand-eye coordination, trying to improve his balance and reduce his clumsiness. He reached a point where he was even called careful by his classmates. Though one day, a criminal broke into their home, his father raced out of the home and called the police. George tried to follow, but he was too nervous about alerting their presence with his clumsiness and failing his father, slowing down. He didn’t make it out, the criminal ended his life that day.
