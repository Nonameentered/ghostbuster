Yeah, struggling between duty and affection is never easy :(  Here's the next part! - 

“I didn’t know you were trained in the blade,” Nydas said.

The Count smirked, taking a swing at a training dummy, “I am a noble, am I not? We are all either politicians or warriors. Despite my position now, in my prime I was quite the formidable fighter, I’ll have you know.”

Nydas grinned, “well, this is all new to me.”

The Count shrugged, “we all have our own paths. I found that paying others to obtain treasure or do jobs for me was a much better and more lucrative investment. Not only that, but it allowed other warriors to rise up. I always look out for formidable heroes, they remind me of me in my younger days.”

Nydas blinked, “is that what you saw in my friends.”

The Count chuckled, “something like that, your friends certainly are an interesting group. What’s wrong with your shoulder?”

“I don’t know what you mean,” Nydas lied.

Veris sighed, “Nydas, don’t think I haven’t noticed that you’ve been wincing every time you move it. You’re good at hiding pain. But I was a soldier, I know very well when someone is hiding an injury.”

Nydas smirked, “well, I wish I would have learned that earlier, then I could have considered it when hiding the injury.”

Count Veris laughed, “come on, Nydas, don’t be foolish. How did you get that injury?”

Nydas shrugged, “I fell while leaping on rooftops, that’s all.”

The Count grinned, “I’m also a noble, which means I know when someone is lying.”

Nydas frowned, “I was attacked by crown guards. I shook them before I made it back to the manor, but it worries me. They were ready for me this time.”

Count Veris stroked his chin, “that is troubling… remain vigilant. You should be going out less. For your own safety and mine. If we’re caught, we’ll be little use to your capturing friends. Is that understood.”

Nydas nodded, “I understand. Have you uncovered anything more since our last meeting, Veris?”

“I have,” Veris replied, “I looked into the runic symbols, they seem to point to the same abilities as the scepter, though it cannot be activated.”

Nydas blinked, “why not?”

“Because they require an ether infusion, and knowledge of the runes. These texts on the runes were extremely hard to come by, I doubt the employer has them in their possession, wouldn’t you say?” Count Veris asked.

Nydas shook his head, “I wouldn’t be too sure. They have Zeris. If they’re interrogating him perhaps they want to use him to infuse the scepter.”

The Count stroked his chin, “perhaps. I also have a list of names of the crown guard. Perhaps it will serve useful.”

The Count handed over a sheet of paper which Nydas grabbed eagerly, “Veris, this is excellent! Great work!”

Count Veris nodded, “just doing my part. And what about you, Nydas?”

“I discovered quite a bit it seems,” Nydas replied, “have you heard about the King’s illness? The one he’s had for a few weeks now?”

“I have,” answered Veris.

“Well,” Nydas continued, “it seems the King’s illness is worse than expected. There are rumors that the illness is not natural.”

Veris raised an eyebrow, “you believe it is an attempt to kill the King?”

Nydas shrugged, “I’m not sure, but it is unusual.”

The Count sighed, “curious… I will do my own research on the matter. If this is true, this plot is much deeper than we imagined.”

Nydas nodded, “indeed. And more about just my friends, though we need to aid them soon. If we could get Zeris to remember, we could confirm or deny all our theories so far. I only hope they haven’t been moved yet.”

Count Veris shook his head, “we aren’t ready yet. We’ll be walking into a trap, just like you said. I can get the floor plan of the castle, I just need time.”

Nydas winced, “we may not have that time. The King is dying!”

“I know, I know…” Veris affirmed, “but we can’t act rashly, please.”

“No promises,” Nydas replied.

The Count groaned, “Nydas, don’t be a fool.”

Nydas smiled, “I can’t change my nature, Veris.”

Count Veris chuckled, “dammit, Nydas, you’re lucky you have charm.”

Nydas smirked, “I certainly am.”

The Count paused, “how did you learn all this?”

Nydas gulped, “the um…  a rumor gatherer.”

Veris raised an eyebrow, “truly? I wasn’t aware rumors had such substance.”

Nydas shrugged, “they often don’t, but it at least gives me a direction to start searching in. This time I got lucky.”

Count Veris nodded, “it would seem so, good work.”

“The guards haven’t traced me back to this place, have they?” asked Nydas.

The Count shook his head, “not even a knock at the door. You’re safe here.”

Nydas sighed, “thank goodness, thank you again, Veris.”

Veris grinned, “what are patrons for? Now, what is your next step?”

Nydas shrugged, “not sure, that floorplan sure would be nice.”

Count Veris rolled his eyes, “patience, I’m working on it.”

Nydas nodded, “until then. Good morrow, Veris.”

The Count nodded in return, “good morrow, Nydas.”

Nydas headed up to his room, hoping that Wylan had his false name in the system for his plan to work.
