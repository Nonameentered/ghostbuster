God did not show himself to Balor. He was in the clouds above, only a sliver of light piercing them. Balor knew that it was for the best. Even the sliver was blinding. So glorious that his devilish body shirked at the sight of it. “I am the first purified devil,” spoke Balor, “I was not certain if the angels would recognize something that they had not seen, but I was certain that you would.”

“You mistake him,” Michael said, hovering beside Balor.

Balor winced, he wished for God not to speak through Michael, but to speak with the Lord directly. Though the mere rumbles of God’s voice were nearly too much for him, so this would have to do, “I don’t understand.”

Michael shook his head, “Of course you do not, devil. This was not God’s device. He did not create a way to purify devils. He did not know it was even possible. All I know is the stench of sin is still on you.”

Balor gasped, he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. If God had not created a way to restore devils, how could it happen? Was what happened in the Hells not God’s will? “I don’t understand… what does this mean?”

“It means that we have yet to set the proper precedent regarding those who are purified,” Michael replied.

Balor took a deep breath, “Then let me present my testimony and explain to you how I became purified.”

“What does this prove?” Satan spat, though even in spite he retained his glory.

Orion clasped his hands together, “Have you heard of the devil Balor? He recently became purified as a result of good deeds. I have been fallen for much too long, and upon hearing that devils can rise, perhaps there is redemption for me yet.”

Satan chuckled, the sound of choir bells ringing, but malice somehow still pierced through, “But you aren’t a devil, and you smell of sin.”

“That is why I want you to make me a devil,” Orion explained, “I wish to return to the Heavens. I wish to be purified, but the only way I can do this is to become a devil.”

Satan raised an eyebrow, “You’d give up your angel form for the chance at redemption? Why tell me this?”

“Because this is my offer, I give you this knowledge for not just I, but you as well to return to Heaven as redeemed devils.”

Satan looked down at his angelic form, “And give up my beauty… you offer a difficult choice. First tell me why you have fallen.”

“You know why, wrath of others. As an angel I can grant wishes. But I did not believe granting requests of faith and love was enough. Those who experienced true suffering are those who have been wronged, and I let them exact vengeance. The wishes were malicious, and each one I granted lost me a feather. I still believe my justice is the right one, and without Heaven’s light I cannot continue my cleanse.”

Satan nodded, “Then my secret stays between us?”

“I’ll be our of your domain before you know it,” Orion replied.

“My intention was never to be purified. I did what I did out of love. I gave my life in service for another, and put her needs above my own. But she resides in the Hells, and I do no longer. I must return,” Balor concluded.

Michael took a moment to wait for God’s response before turning to Balor, “So we can bring you back to the Hells as if this never happened?”

Balor blinked, “What? No, I wish to be an angel, that way I can grant wishes to her, and then to my brethren, and fall once more.”

Michael titled his perfect head, “Why do you wish to make this more difficult.”

Balor shook his head, “Not more difficult, but I did not come to God to bypass law. Devils can be redeemed because they used to be angels, it is a chance to restore themselves. If it is a chance for me to provide wishes and do more good for those who love like my beloved, that is the path I wish to take. Besides, people must know that devils can be redeemed, that morality is not static. For mortals too, that it isn’t just about Adam and Eve’s Fall, that they can rise again, rise above sin.”

Michael glared at Balor, “But God does not wish for this knowledge to spread. For more devils to redeem themselves.”

Balor took a step back, “I don’t understand, why? Isn’t this what he wants? Redemption?”

Michael shook his head, “No, you devils are an infestation, you belong in the Hells. Your betrayal will always be a sin. This purification was not God’s mercy, it was a mistake. Now return to the pits of flame whence you came, accept our deal.”

Balor’s orange eyes narrowed, “No, I will not accept it.”

Michael cackled, Fool! Do you not wish to see your beloved again?“

Balor grit his fanged teeth, “I do, but not like this. It is wrong.”

“What do you know of right and wrong, you’re a devil.”

“A purified devil.”

Orion took smug satisfaction in watching Satan’s beauty fade. Orion never cared much for his own looks, he didn’t need them to take justice into his own hands. Orion smirked, “Do you know why you lost against the other angels when you first betrayed them Satan, and there has been no war since.”

Satan had no reply, he was screeching in pain as he changed. Orion continued, “Because angels understand each other, they know how to kill one another. No angel ever would, of course, not now. But it has been eons since angels and devils warred, they forgot how to defeat each other, growing to different. But kin knows kin, angel can defeat angel. And devil can defeat devil. As a fallen I could do little without my wishes, but now… now that we are of devil-kin…” Orion took his new clawed hands and pierced Satan’s devilish flesh, “Now, the title of King of Hells belongs to me.”

"But you were an angel..." Satan croaked with his last dying breath.

"So were you."
