My body aches and decays. My bones rearrange and snap, forcing me to pop them back into place with a limp hand. Vultures try to snap their hungry beaks at my carrion flesh, worms protrude from my skin, my wounds never closing, always in pain. All of it is nothing compared to the pain in my soul.
  

  
I cannot be hurt anymore after the death Ophelion gave me. Slaughtering me before I had my chance at glory, he is all I have thought about these past hundred years. Ophelion, however, is immortal. If he does not remember who I am, I will make him remember with steel. My sword demands justice, but I demand vengeance.
  

  
I make my way through Ophelion’s fortress, stumbling through his haunted halls. His traps and minions try to stop me, but nothing can. I have one goal, to kill him, and nothing can stand in my way. I will fulfill my task, no matter the pain, no matter the tribulations, no matter the suffering.
  

  
Finally, I reach him, he turns to me, jaw dropping. I smile, “so, you do remember me after all. Or is that a look of horror for making it all the way through your precious defenses?”
  

  
Ophelion sighs, “I do remember you. You were a bright young soul, I did not relish killing you. Everyone I have murdered haunts me in my nightmares. Those days of murder are past me, but I do not blame you if you wish to kill me.”
  

  
I spit, “what? I come here after a hundred years demanding vengeance, demanding blood, demanding a fight, and yet you grovel? This is not the moment I wished for!”
  

  
Ophelion shakes his head, “I am sorry, but I will not fight you.”
  

  
I grit my teeth, “do you truly feel remorse?”
  

  
Ophelion nods, “look into my eyes and tell me if I am telling the truth.”
  

  
I move close, staring into his eyes. They’re beautiful. A fiery orange flame which has dimmed to an ember. I wish I could make those eyes roar with passion again. Without thinking, I pull him in for a kiss. He kisses back, holding me close.
  

  
I don’t know what I expected, or what will happen. But I will give Ophelion his passion back, and when it returns, I will kill him… probably.
