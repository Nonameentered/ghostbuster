Glad you're enjoying it! Here's the next part:

“Prince Wylan!” shouted Rene, racing after him.

Wylan sighed, turning around to face him, “what is it now, Rene?”

Rene caught up to him, bowing in respect, “sorry to disturb you, your Highness, but you skipped your meeting for your strategy this morning.”

Wylan rubbed his temples, “ah… sorry, I forgot about that one. Draft a letter to the tutor in apology for my poor memory.”

Rene shook his head, “I cannot, sir.”

Wylan blinked, “why not?”

“Any letter written by a member of the royal family must be signed in his name,” explained Rene.

Wylan shrugged, “I don’t see the problem. I will merely sign it once you write it.”

Rene sighed, “you aren’t understanding. The signiture is a written contract, proof that it was written in your hand. For me to write it would be a breach of trust for those under your employ. I cannot in good faith do so.”

“Then get the royal scribe to write it,” insisted Wylan.

Rene shook his head, “I cannot in good faith order anyone to do so either. You had extra time today because you did not spent time being tutored. As per your schedule, you should have time yourself to draft such a letter. It would be good practice as the future heir to take part in such formal duties”

“The King does not write apology letters to tutors, Rene.”

“That is because King never missed a meeting or session, your Highness.”

“Good to know the King is perfect, an easy example to follow,” mocked Wylan.

“The King puts in effort befitting his station. Never missing a meeting does not take perfection. It takes prioritizing what is important in his station and showing respect to those who take time to aid him. You would do well to learn from his example,” explained Rene.

“You are not the King’s advisor, Rene. You are my aid. It is not your place to say such things about me.”

“I was chosen by the King to help you become his successor, and I will do so despite your defiance. I am not your enemy, Wylan.”

“You are not my ally, either. You are an obstacle.”

“Only because you view me as such.”

“And if I continue to do so?”

“I will get the heir the King wants one way or another.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

“It means that I suggest you draft that letter of apology with your tutor and schedule another meeting with them.”

“Are you serious?”

“Yes, your Highness. And the sooner you get serious about this too, the easier things will be for the both of us.”

Wylan sighed as Rene walked away. He used to have his father’s advisor, Benedict, help with these matters. Since his health has started failing, however, he could no longer aid both Wylan and his father, who during troubled times and aging years, needed all the advising he could get. Since then, Rene has taken over. He had not been with the family for generations like Benedict had, in fact, he wasn’t even part of the noble circle, but rather a former financial consultant who managed to make his way into the royal court.

The prince’s thoughts wandered once more to the masked partygoer who made him feel so alive. He had to get back to reading his sister’s manuscript and learn the ways of romance. Next time he encountered him, he would be ready.
