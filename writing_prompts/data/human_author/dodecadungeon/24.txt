Ron clasps his hands together in prayer, muttering softly. He prays for safe passage to the promised land. A place where his family can be safe and secure. But heaven does not answer.
  

  
The ashes of Ron’s grandfather tip over, causing the black sand to spill across the floor in front of him, like reluctant water whose destiny is to flow, yet it resists. A breeze blows into the chamber, causing the ashes to gather in the air, swirling around. They swirl higher and faster as more and more of them join in the whirlwind of his grandfather's remains, as the dark dust begins to settle, a figure walks out of the ashes. While heaven did not answer, hell did.
  

  
Ron did not know what he expected would happen when he prayed, but it was not this. Despite it all, he knew that this figure was no angel, it was Death. A ten-foot-tall corpse gazes at Ron with dead, glazed eyes, their mouth sewn shut, skin green with disease and bloat, scars riddling their skin, and their disheveled hair in tufts. Yet this monstrosity is not death, but a small skeletal figure at its feet, held up by strings. Ron cannot tell if they bear the skeleton of a child or an elderly figure, but however, this corpse became bones that were not natural from the marks and distortions on the calcium husk.
  

  
Sound emerges from the sewn lips of the corpse, being forced out by the small skeleton, “R…Ronnnalld…” The sound like a forced breath, a dying breath, yet the dying never ceases, the corpse in an eternal state of suffering. Still, even with the unnerving sound of the corpse, Ron knew that he would much prefer listening to a dying breath than hearing the skeleton’s true voice. The voice of Death.
  

  
Ron kneels to the figure, but it is not out of reverence, but shame. He shivers, feeling the weight of guilt for his action. Cursing himself for having to stoop this low. Though either way he is a doomed man, “I wish for safe passage.”
  

  
The small skeleton has no eyes, but its gaze seems to burn into Ron’s soul. Visions of pain and death flash in his mind, turning away from the skull. Ron knows Death was not meant to be in the presence of mortals, their minds grew weak in the face of it. The corpse points at Ron’s bookshelf with a shaky hand, making a sound of muffled pain, as if Death forced it to perform that action.
  

  
Ron follows Death’s hand and reached the bookshelf. The book Death is pointing to is The Picture of Dorian Gray. Ron raises an eyebrow, “I don’t understand.”
  

  
“D…Deallll….”
  

  
“Yes, for safe passage.”
  

  
“...youuuu.. arree.. the.. p…pict… picturreee…”
  

  
Another image flashes in Ron’s mind. He began to understand. Ron would take the burden of his family’s suffering. They would be safe, getting safe passage, which he would suffer from the pain they would have had. Ron nods to the corpse, “I accept the deal.”

Daryl met Ron in prison. Ron was a man in pain, what that pain was, Daryl at first did not know. He heard Ron screaming each night, a haunted look in his eyes. Ron was just a young man, but he looked much older than his years, stress and suffering having taken their toll. His skin was nearly corpse-like from lack of sun or nurturing, his voice sounded as if he had indulged in cigarettes, yet Daryl knew he did not smoke. Ron slept each night yet there were still deep bags under his eyes.
  

  
Ron wanted nothing to do with any of the other prisoners, content to suffer alone and in silence. Daryl, however, could not take no for an answer. He needed to know why Ron was suffering and help him ease his pain. Over time, Daryl began to wear Ron down, and Ron allowed Daryl to spend time with him. Ron would laugh on occasion at Daryl’s jokes, even though he knew Ron found joy in them, he tried to hide it. It was as if Ron felt guilty for feeling joy. Whatever had caused Ron to feel this way, Daryl couldn’t fathom. The thought alone made him shiver with terror.
  

  
Eventually, as Daryl opened up, he got Ron to open up as well. He got Ron to laugh more freely at his jokes, to speak his mind, and to know it was okay to have a shoulder to lean on. He learned that Ron was an immigrant who gave up nearly everything to make it here, but what had he given up?
  

  
After five years, Ron and Daryl were finally free to leave prison, now on parole. Ron planned to leave Daryl and go his separate ways, but before he left, Daryl had to know what Ron had suffered through. Ron finally gave in and told him everything. After Ron finished telling his story, Ron looked down at his shadow, which seemed warped and in pain, saying, “So that is why I bear this burden alone. Every life I value will feel no suffering, but my suffering continues to increase. I’ve tried so hard to bear all of their burdens, but I have touched too many lives, and with it, so much more suffering. I began speaking to you because I thought I could handle the burden you brought, Daryl, but I was wrong. Death will punish me for this.”
  

  
Not long after they parted ways, Daryl heard the news of Ron’s death, shot by police for some minor action. His family may have had safe passage, they may have been welcomed into the promised land with open arms, but Ron was not. And now, with his death, his family would no longer be safe, and it was all Daryl’s fault. Daryl held a knife in his hand, contemplating what to do next. He deserved to suffer as Ron did, and perhaps he could ease Ron’s suffering, just as he had in life. Either way, Ron was proof that Death always wins. On Ron’s corpse there was only one possession: a bloodied book, bearing a title that read: The Picture of Dorian Gray
