Sure thing! I'm having a lot of fun writing these, here's part 3:

“Acrasia, do you still have those um… stories of the heart that you used to so adamantly read?”

Acrasia rolled her eyes, “they’re called romance novels, Wylan. You’re the prince, you can get anyone you want just by batting eyes at them. You live the true romance novel, brother. So why the sudden interest?”

Wylan shrugged, “I could say the same for you.”

Acrasia shook her head, “you dress in finery and meet hundreds of elligible singles every night during your extravagant galas. I wear old garments that look like something our great aunt would wear and spend all day admiring the gardens in solitude or reading zealously in darkness. Romance novels are my escape from a suitorless life.”

Wylan sighed, “it doesn’t have to be a suitorless life.”

“I’ve been to one of your galas before, Wylan. I fit in like a lizard in a turtle shell. I may look like everyone else, but I know I don’t belong.”

“And why’s that?”

“Do I really need to answer that, brother? I hid in the bushes during father’s coronation because there were too many people. I don’t belong in the spotlight. I belong in some tower, endlessly weaving away on some celestial loom.”

Wylan smiled, “you paint quite the picture with your words, sister.”

Acrasia smirked, “well, when you read enough good literature it rubs off on you. Though what you’re looking for, either teenage heartteases or smut, is not good literature.”

Wylan shrugged, “sometimes inspiration is found in the most cliche and base version of a thing. Regardless, you should put pen to paper, you might come up with something better than that aforementioned teenage hearttease.”

Acrasia grinned, “who says I haven’t already?”

Wylan sighed, “I haven’t been a very good brother have I? I should have known already if you were writing something if I truly cared.”

Acrasia placed her hand on Wylan’s, “I understand your reasoning. Father has been keeping you busy to prepare you for inheriting the crown, and you relieve that stress with your galas. That leaves little time for me.”

Wylan shook his head, “still, I need to make more of an effort. You can hold me to that.”

Acrasia chuckled, “you know I will. But don’t think you’re off the hook, your Highness. Why do you want to read my romance novels?”

Wylan blushed, “I um… want to learn how to be a better lover.”

Acrasia giggled, “I’ve heard no complaints about your skills as a romancer thus far. What happened? Did you break the wrong heart?”

“No, nothing like that. I just… I wonder what it would be to care for someone more deeply than during some one night stand.”

“You really haven’t had a serious relationship before?”

“Not really. I know I’m probably going to be forced into some arranged marriage when I inherit the throne. It would be pointless to fall for anyone.”

“So what’s changed?”

“I’m not sure… it just, it’s not enough anymore. The parties were the only thing that got my mind off the impending responsibility that lay before me, and how I treat my partners, its just therapy for me. That isn’t fair.”

Acrasia grinned, “I think you know what’s changed.”

Wylan raised an eyebrow, “what do you mean?”

Acrasia chuckled, “you’ve already found the person you want to have a serious relationship with.”

Wylan blushed, “I um… what makes you say… it’s well… I wouldn’t go as far to claim…”

Acrasia giggled, “just stop before you embarrass yourself anymore, brother. You’re already red as a tomato.”

Wylan winced, “it would appear I am. Just… do you have the books or not?”

Acrasia nodded, “I do… but you can only take some of them, alright?”

Wylan laughed, “why, do you still have a sentimentality for them?”

Acrasia shook her head, “no, it’s for… research.”

Wylan smirked, “wait a minute… are you writing a romance novel?”

Acrasia reddened, “I um…”

Wylan cackled, “I knew it! Now you have to let me see it!”

Acrasia’s blush deepened, “don’t do this to me, Wylan!”

Wylan smiled, “I want to be a better brother, and that’s appreciating the things you do, like writing. And that can start by me reading your book. It’s probably much better than any of that teenage heartteases you’re so against.”

Acrasia sighed, “well… I have been in need of a proofreader. But this is between the two of us, alright?”

Wylan nodded, “I swear. Word of this will not leave my lips.”

Acrasia glared and handed the draft over, “it better not.”

Wylan took the document, smiling, “I promise. Thank you, Acrasia.”

Acrasia made a dismissive gesture and turned back to her book, “no problem, you spoiled pretty boy.”

Wylan chuckled and raced back to his room. Laying back on his massive bed where he brought many a lover, he opened Acrasia’s draft and began to read.
