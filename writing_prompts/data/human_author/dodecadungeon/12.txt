Wes Marrowood knew people.
  

  
Not just that he had a lot of connections, which he did, but he understood people too. And that was why he preferred the company of animals.
  

  
It was a gift and a curse, seeing everyone’s true dark intentions. Their lies, their evil, it was all laid bare before Wes, and it made the world hard to live in sometimes. This skill did, however, make him incredible at cards.
  

  
He could tell if someone was bluffing, if they had a good hand if they were cheating, he knew it all. It was easy money, if he was going to have to endure time with other people, he figured he could at least make good money out of it. He had a big enough home, a mansion, as it was called, to keep all of his many animals. 
  

  
He didn’t call them pets, because they weren’t domesticated. He wasn’t their owner, they could come and go as they pleased. He didn’t know if they had evil intentions because he couldn’t read them. He liked to think that they were good at heart, and treated them as such. He loved his animals, he rescued and protected them, keeping them safe from a cruel world. It was an unusual life, but far from a lonely one.
  

  
One time, however, Wes took a chance on a person.
  

  
Love does silly things to people, and even something as lofty as love sometimes reaches down to strike the deep den of Wes Marrowood. He saw her rescuing a stray and thought he had found someone like him. He teamed up with her, rescuing animals from the cruel world. He thought she was taking them to a shelter, her home, or somewhere safe, how wrong he was.
  

  
One time, he decided to find where she took her animals, to check on all of the animals they rescued together and relive those fond memories, and discovered the dark truth. Those animals were sold to all matter of dark places. Sent to battle one another while the audience places bets on who will be the victor, smuggled illegally across borders, eaten, not a single animal she had rescued lived a good life.
  

  
He confronted her, still telling himself the lie about the one he loved. He was found dead the next day, and the illegal animal deals remained protected, greed had triumphed once more. Though that day, in Wes’ old manor, the sounds of dozens of animals wailed out into the night, morning the loss of the one who cared for them.
