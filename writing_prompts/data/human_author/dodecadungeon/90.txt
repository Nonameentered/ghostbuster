“I can’t keep this up forever, you have to pay your debts at some point, dearest,” said Felicia.
  

  
Varus sighed, “I know… I just, I would loathe going to jail and being away from you.”
  

  
Felicia put on a smile, wrapping her arms around Varus, “we’ll figure this out together, alright? But we do have to figure it out eventually. I can’t cover for you for much longer.”
  

  
Varus nodded, “I know, I know. Or do we have to?”
  

  
Felicia raised an eyebrow, “what are you cooking up in that scheming mind of yours?”
  

  
Varus pecked her cheek, “what if we ran away together? Away from a place where I’m a criminal and lived in a new land together?”
  

  
Felicia blinked, “you’d give up your noble lifestyle?”
  

  
Varus smiled, “I realize now that all my greed was because I was missing something in my life, a hole I could not fill. You are that missing piece. With it, I don’t need anything else.”
  

  
Felicia’s heart fluttered, “Varus… I don’t know what to say… wait, I know, yes! A million times yes! If that is how you feel I will travel the ends of the earth with you.”
  

  
Varus beamed, “thank you for being a good enough investigator to find me.”
  

  
Felicia grinned, “and thank you for choosing me over everything else.”
  

  
Varus smiled, “easiest decision I ever made.”
