“So you’re the goddess of love?” Richard asked, “Prove it.”
  

  
Alyria smiled, “Your skepticism is cute, but I assure you I know the truth to everyone’s heart. You keep your closed like a fortress because you’re scared. Your heart was broken by the woman you loved. How tragic. Her name was… Patricia. Am I correct?”
  

  
Richard blinked, “you must have just asked my friends, that’s all. I still don’t believe you.”
  

  
Alyria giggled, “silly human. Fine.” She began to hum, summoning faeries to her side to sing a melody.
  

  
Richard gasped, “I um… did you drug me? What am I seeing?”
  

  
Alyria beamed, “faeries, of course! There are no toxins in your system, I assure you. I am merely the queen of the faeries!”
  

  
Richard groaned, “this is… it can’t be true, can it?”
  

  
Alyria grinned, “I can take you to my domain if you’d like. It is very beautiful, you’ll fit right in.”
  

  
Richard blushed, “why me?”
  

  
Alyria smiled, “because you need love after your pain. I can help you love again.”
  

  
Richard sighed, “nothing can help me with that.”
  

  
Alyria offered her hand to him, “please, at least let me try.”
  

  
Richard glanced down at the hand, taking a moment before grabbing hold of it, “I hope you’re right, Alyria.”
  

  
Alyria smiled, “I hope I am too.”
