“This is a terrible idea,” Heathcliff stated.
  

  
I shook my head, “It’s a great idea. If we frame the hero and make the public turn against him, he’ll be free of their shackles.”
  

  
Heathcliff sighed, “But isn’t being a criminal it’s own shackle?”
  

  
“In what way?” I asked, “We can do whatever we want, not restrained by the law. And it’s not like anyone is strong enough to catch us, or hold us if they do.”
  

  
“But the stigma.”
  

  
“That’s what secret identities are for.”
  

  
“Some people want to be loved.”
  

  
“Not that kind of love, the public’s love is toxic. It’s all give and no take with that hero. He’ll never be happy as long as he keeps trying to please them.”
  

  
“And how do you know this?”
  

  
“I actually use my secret identity as I should, to live a normal life. Make relationships, find out which ones are toxic, learn to love in healthy ways, all that stuff.”
  

  
“But what if they get too close? Start getting suspicious?”
  

  
“That might be an issue for others, but I can erase their memory.”
  

  
“But you’re still living a lie,” Heathcliff pointed out.
  

  
I sighed, “My secret identity and my supervillain self are both me, just different versions, neither is untrue. I just behave differently when I use powers, have minions, and have an agenda. When I have no connections and endless ambition.”
  

  
“But not everyone can erase memories,” Heathcliff countered.
  

  
I shrugged, “I can lend him my power if he needs to get a social life. I can even use it on myself to forget his secret identity if I learn it by helping him.”
  

  
“Like he’ll trust you to do that,” Heathcliff scoffed.
  

  
“Don’t knock this just yet, it could be the start of something great. A supervillain bond for the ages.”
  

  
“You’re delusional.”
  

  
“I don’t pay you to question me. Now come on, let’s go frame a hero.”
