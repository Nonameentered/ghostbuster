That mean so much! Thank you so much for your support and kindness! Here's the next part! - 

“You like someone, don’t you?” exclaimed Wylan enthusiastically.

Acrasia pressed her finger to her lips, “Shhh! Do you always have to be so damn loud?”

Wylan smiled, “with information like this, of course!”

Acrasia rolled her eyes, “you’re insufferable!”

Wylan smirked, “yes, but I’m adorable enough to get away with it.”

Acrasia sighed, “you don’t even know if they information is true, you bastard.”

“Hey! No need to start hurling insults.”

“Sorry I don’t meet your high noble standards of etiquette.”

“Whatever. But I know affection when I see it, the way you write, it changes when you talk about Christine. Every sentence with her is written over and over meticulously until you get the words right, I can tell by the eraser shavings. I can almost picture you making little happy sighs as you list all her incredible features. All the other characters are flawed, and yet she has none, even though I know she does, you just don’t see any of them as flaws.”

“Maybe it’s just written by an unreliable narrator.”

“It’s inconsistent in that case, and from reading this I know you’re a better writer than that.”

“Damn you! Appealing to my ego, cheap move.”

“You know it’s true! This Christine has a real world equivalent, I know it.”

“How do you know what I’m feeling? You said it yourself everyone you’ve ever been with has just been a sleeping partner.”

“Until now, you were wise enough to figure out that I was asking about the romance novels because I have found a special crush, that something’s changed.”

“So you admit it!” exclaimed Acrasia.

Wylan rolled his eyes, “yes, we’re past this, Acrasia.”

Acrasia smiled, “still, it’s a victory for me. It’s the small things in life that I really relish. Like proving you wrong.”

Wylan chuckled, “never change, sister.”

Acrasia smirked, “you on the other hand can change as much as you like. Any change has to be better than what I currently call a brother.”

Wylan giggled, “I should have seen that coming.”

Acrasia winked, “yes, you should have.”

Wylan shook his head, “enough of your antics, I’m right and you know it.”

Acrasia grinned, “right about what?”

Wylan sighed, “don’t make me spell it out for you again, Christine is based off a real person that you care deeply for.”

“So what if she is?” Acrasia asked.

Wylan gasped, “so what? You’re asking me that? Acrasia, this is everything! You’ve never been in a relationship in your whole life and now you’ve got a thing for this Christine person. You have a chance to show her how you feel and finally find someone to care for who cares for you in return!”

“Who’s to say she even likes me in return?” Acrasia questioned

Wylan smiled, “you’re the crown princess. Who wouldn’t want to be with you?”

Acrasia rolled her eyes, “would you stop thinking like an escort for one moment and think like someone in my romance novels? I’m not looking for someone so shallow. I want someone who sees me for me, not as some royal cashgrab.”

Wylan nodded, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to imply-”

Acrasia threw up her hand dismissively, “save the apology, royal arse. I trusted you with my manuscript and you use it to pick apart at me. I told you this was about trust, a trust which you’re breaking.”

Wylan turned his gaze downward, “I’m sorry sister, I just wanted to help.”

Acrasia sighed, “look, just… consider my feelings first next time, alright?”

“Of course, I promise,” Wylan responded.

Acrasia rolled her eyes, “stop giving me that look.”

Wylan blinked, “what look?”

Acrasia smiled, “you know the one. When you wanted to make me guilty about leaving you out of my reckless activities.”

Wylan grinned, “so you figured out I had a special look?”

Acrasia chuckled, “of course, it was very obvious. If only it didn’t continue to work.”

Wylan smirked, “who’s fault is that?”

Acrasia giggled, “oh shut up! Fine, her name is Diane.”

Wylan beamed, “Oh, the Christine girl? That’s a pretty name! What’s she like?”

Acrasia sighed, “that’s all I’m telling you, now get out of here.”

Wylan nodded, “with haste, dear sister.”
