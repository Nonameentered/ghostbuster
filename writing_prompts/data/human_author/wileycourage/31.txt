I appreciate everyone talking about this in depth.  Thank you for your points too.

These aren't monkey paw wishes exactly.  Sid is a child, and I didn't reveal how he worded what he wanted for reasons, in the first two chapters at least.  It very well could be that he isn't doing this right and/or is naive.  Also, he hasn't tested the limits of this thing, and I don't know where they are exactly yet.  Sid hasn't tried enough.  He's focused on getting his family back together.  Kind of a sweet kid like that.

Not that other interpretations are not valid.  They are.  I like a sort of ambiguity in things like these.  It feels like it fits the theme, and honestly it's so great to see people talking about something I've written.

Thank you for reading and commenting, and I'm glad you liked it!
