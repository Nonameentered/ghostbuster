*I want to be happy.  I want to be HAPPY.  I WANT TO BE . . . I want us to be happy*.

Every time Sid tried to write the word "happy" in his journal his pen would not work.  No pen would work.  The journal, like everything, had its limits.  It could not grant the young boy's wish.

He would have to be more specific, as he had been before, he knew.

*I want my parents back.  I want Mom to not have cancer. and I want them not to fight.*  Sid settled on the words but hesitantly.

Sid heard his parents talking softly downstairs and went to join them.  When he saw them they changed solemn expressions for faint smiles.

"Son," his father stated plainly, "your mother and I have something to tell you."

"Are you pregnant, Mom?"

"What

"What?  No, honey." Anne responded.  "Your father and I are getting a divorce.  It's for the best.  We both still love you and would never do anything get between you and us.  It's just . . . your father and I won't be together anymore."

"Your mother and I are in agreement, for once."  A tinge of bitterness stained Robert's stentorian voice.

"But why?  I just want us to be happy.  Why can't we be happy?"

"We will be happy.  We will.  It will just take time.  We'll all adjust and we'll all get together and everything and we'll get along better.  Won't we?"  Robert nodded and moved towards his son, extending his arms out.

"No!" Sid ran up the stairs and into his room, slamming the door shut.

"Let him simmer, Anne," Robert suggested softly.

"I know.  It hurts to see him hurt.  You know that."  Anne looked to her husband.  "Will you keep your promise?"

"This will be better for both of us.  Yes, I will hold up my end of the bargain.  What about you?"

"Of course, I'll always love you, but I'm so happy we're in agreement on this.  Hopefully Sid will understand."

"Hopefully."

Leaning against his twin bed and its thick blue and red comforter, Sid again struck out his words without a second thought.  The muffled speaking from beneath him ceased with a suddenness that should have been eerie.

He tapped his pen against the white page repeatedly.

*I want my parents back and Mom not to have cancer and I want them to stay married and in love, and I want Alice to be three years old again*.

The house remained silent.

"Sid! Sid!  Come here Siddie!  Pretty, pretty please?"  His mother sounded happy to Sid and he could smell cookies baking.

He rushed downstairs to find his mother and father together in the kitchen.  Alice was in her high chair licking up the remainders of her dinner.

"It's about time.  What were you up to, sillyhead, writing in your little book again?"

"Yes, Mom."

"Well that's great!  I'm so happy to see you so interested in something!  Now, wash up and sit down for dinner.  We made lasagna."

"Yum!"  Sid ran to the sink.  When he tried to put the journal down next to the sink, he couldn't.  The book wouldn't leave him.  Thinking quickly he pinched it against his chest with his chin and washed his hands.

His mother watched her little one and shrugged.  Robert turned from the counter with three plates with thick slices of pasta, meat, and cheese.  The table having been set the family sat down to eat.  Sid placed the journal in his lap and breathed a sigh when it allowed itself to rest there.

But Alice interrupted with a squeal.  Sid looked up as his heartrate climbed and climbed.  Alice burped, and he nearly jumped out of his chair, standing halfway up with the book stuck to his thighs.  He realized it might look strange to have a book stuck to him and sat down in a hurry.

"What is up with you today, dear?" his mother asked with a look of concern.

"Nothing!  It was just loud."

"Sid, there's something your mother and I want to talk to you about . . ." Robert started again.  He stole a glance to Anne, meeting her eyes and smiling almost too widely.
