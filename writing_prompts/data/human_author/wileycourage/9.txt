Hello!

I liked your sweet and touching story!

For crit:

The descriptions felt a bit loose at times.

>Something about that library made me feel at peace.

I understand that you might be hiding the ultimate realization that the time with the grandfather made the library time special, but

>Sometimes, he would come in and peruse the adult section, but most of the time, he simply sat in the car.

So, it's really time alone among the books under the watchful eye of the grandpa, from what I can see.  

That it felt like home was a bit odd considering:

>The library was my favorite escape.

I think it might feel like something other than home, like a home away from home.

You do end it with,

>giving me the independence and support to do the one thing I loved most in the world.

which matches the introspective and self-reflective anecdotes from the narrator.

>At the time, I didn't realize they were questioning if was bluffing on the number, I, childishly, thought they were amazed at my reading skills.

I wouldn't set off "childishly" with commas here.  It's not an aside but directly modifying "thought".

The narrator's voice feels childlike still, which could be nostalgia, but there's something else there.  Maybe it's that the grandpa is more a background character even with the dialogue, the narrator is the center of attention on all of it.

>Curled up in a built-in nook in the back, I would travel across worlds, solve mysteries, and discover love. I would march out happily, though no one could tell, the books towering above my grin as I carefully walked down the steps to the parking lot.

I like this a lot, and it shows growth for the narrator, and I mean it's a cute image of course!  I'd like more focus on these things or that growth through books.

Overall, I'd recommend focusing in more on an aspect or two.  You cover a lot of ground and some elements suffer for it, I think.  The grandpa could use more characterization here, considering his importance to the narrator.

"I recall" is present tense where the rest is first person past.

I'm left with questions about this.  The descriptions are there, the nostalgia is palpable, but I wonder more about things like where's the grandfather now?  Why is the narrator returning here?  What purpose are the recollections serving in the narrative?

All said, well done on the story and thanks for the pleasant read!  I loved your descriptions and that setting.
