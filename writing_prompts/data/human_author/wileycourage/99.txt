"This isn't cheap, you know."  Ajax muttered to another functionary trying to nickel and dime his expansive expense reports.  "Travel, lodging, food, medical care, blessings, incantations, enchantments all cost tons of money, and remember you pulled me from a doldrum existence as a peasant farmer boy.  I'm not flush or anything close."

"Right here, look at this."  The minister pointed at one line item out of so many on the stack of paper in front of him.  "Mead.  10000 credits. 7/7/2782  We don't reimburse purchases of alcohol."

"That's a valid expense.  I needed the liquid courage when fighting the monstrosities you pit me against.  Imagine facing the nearly unimaginable horrors without something to dull the fear, just a bit."

"You drank barrels of the stuff."

"Well, yes, I'm huge now.  Takes more than a little to get me going nowadays.  I need the energy."

"Mhm."  The bean counter wasn't buying it.

"Maybe next time I just don't do anything.  Such a sad thing what could happen to such a nice town."

"We have you under contract.  The terms are all spelled out.  Look."  The rail thin man covered in a billowing tarp of a robe extended a narrow finger to prick at words on a page.

"'Expenses do not include purchases of alcohol or other mind-altering substances.'  Yes, I can read, but I didn't know then exactly what this all entailed.  It's unfair."

"Not my problem.  I'm here to enforce the rules."

"Even old George Cherry Washington provided expense reports to the Colonial Government, you know.  There's precedent for what I'm doing."

"How the hell do you know that?"  The minister raised an eyebrow.

"You sent me to clear out the ancient library the other day, remember?  It took me all of five seconds, the rest of the weeks I spent reading."

"We celebrate your mighty victory with an annual holiday, and it didn't take weeks to complete?"  Ajax wondered if he might have gone too far this time.  The curtain was always important.  Appearances had to be maintained over all else.

"Nope.  Anyway, George didn't operate for free.  The guy sent whole lists of things seemingly unrelated to war and was compensated.  I don't plan to be a sucker here."

"Ancient history at this point.  Nothing has been the same since the Great Regression."

"Sure, but you still need heroes to take the brunt of what others cannot stomach.  Sorry the cost of what you've purchased makes your stomach churn."

"I'm not paying for your parties.  That's that.  You can appeal per the terms of your agreement with the State, but then it will take back what I'm providing you now if you lose.  Be warned."

"What's the point of being a hero if I can't have state-sanctioned and paid for fun?"
