By sunrise what would have been the Vampire Apocalypse sputtered out.  The undead creatures weren't much more than zombies.  Most stayed outside and burned alive.  The ones who didn't were little more than a nuisance, feeding on rats in the sewers.

There are competing theories on the persistent survival of these creatures.  Some say the dumb beings have adapted, but others assume there's something in the people before they turn that makes certain vampires particularly suited for certain lifestyles.  

Nevertheless, it is enough of a concern that the Government issued warnings, codes to use.  They still look enough like us and behave human enough to put a damper on the nightlife if we didn't have some code to tell us apart from the beasts.

As you can imagine, then, it came as a surprise that the being using the approved human-knock was in fact, a vampire.  The stupid thing was snarling at me.  Everyone knows they can't enter unless invited in and I wasn't about to do that.  Still, it was curious that one could knock, what else could it accomplish, I wondered.

"How did you learn to knock?"  I've learned sometimes the direct approach works.  No one has heard one of these things speak before, but it never hurts to try.  Well, usually.

It looked at my face as I spoke and turned its head as though trying to understand.  Was this finally a display of higher cognitive function?  I pondered the possibilities of such a discovery, turning it over in my head.  Perhaps they could be trained.

Then again, it was such studies that got us here in the first place.  Immortality, it turns out, is a fickle thing.  But we are here, and so are they.  There must be something that can be done with the situation.  It's such a waste of life.

Now, the problem of Vampires is nowhere near existential.  Every so often a human manages to get cornered and eaten, but the real damage is done when they're hit by cars.  These things were human at one point, though.  That has to mean something.  They shouldn't be ignored as they are.

Right, the vampire was still standing there watching me think.  It was drooling.  "So what do you want?" I said not knowing how much it could understand if anything.

It looked sad and pathetically at me, turning its head down submissively but still watching my face.  Holy shit, I thought, it was kind of cute.

"Do you want to come in?"  

It nodded!  It understood me!  My mouth hung open and my eyes widened.  I still wasn't going to ever let it in, that'd just be foolish, but there were other possibilities.  I peered into the hallway around the vamp.  It was empty.

I grabbed up my government-issued wooden stake and showed it to the thing at my door.  "You see this?  You step sideways and I'm stabbing you.  Got it?"  It didn't nod again but pulled back slightly.  I thought it might have signaled it was aware of the threat I posed to it.

To my absolute shock, the vamp followed me into the basement and let me chain it up in an old bomb shelter.

I had a pet vamp.  I hoped my roommates wouldn't find out.
