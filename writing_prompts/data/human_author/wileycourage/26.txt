Excellent job!  I loved the two part structure, the repetition and the mirroring.  Great work!

For crit:

>More than anything, she was losing count of how many times she had written, and how many times she had left to write.

You can drop the comma before "and" it being a compound of two object phrases for the preposition "of".  Otherwise it reads as an aside or something.  Super technical line edit.

>But it wasn't her fault!

Oddly, I'd put a comma after "But" here.  It's like a "however" which I'd separate.  TO be clear, this is one fine without in my book but I was on the subject of commas already.

>No amount of protests could fix it.

"amount of protests" could be "number of protests" or "amount of protesting".  "Of protests" seems like it's saying how many, when "amount" calls for how much of something there is.  I hope this makes sense.

>all because she didn't say what Mom wanted to hear.

No it isn't.  She said the right things!  Cindy is innocent!  Nothing she could have said would have mattered unless she somehow knew the card was sent to Dad!  This is some reader feedback and praise that you have me rooting for Cindy because you wrote her and the rank injustice of it all so well.

Whew that ending.  The mother is extremely severe in her approach, but at least she's fair about it?  What's the point in having Cindy not notice?  Wouldn't that be important or interesting for her to know that about her mother?  I'm curious.

All together, well, well done!  You captured the feelings here and wrote a tight story.  It flowed so well and again, you accomplished a lot with the two-part structure.  Great work!
