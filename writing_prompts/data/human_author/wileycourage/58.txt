“Summer fun, summer sun.  Gnarly and tubular delights.  Frolic and explore.  Welcome to the perfect tropical paradise!”

The billboard’s paint was flaking, like the peeling skin off sunburns.  It was once bright and cheery, reds and oranges and yellow contrasted by avocado greens and a haze of blues, but by then that was all faded.  It might have been humid here once, but those times were like a dream.

My old memories were nevertheless hard to vanquish.  I hoped to thwart them by journeying from the land of concrete and cacophonous disorder to an oasis, such as it was.

The drive to the beach was longer, stretching past the old beachfront ice cream shack.  White lettering on its front placard said “Scrumptious Treats” once upon a time, but was modified by dripping spray paint to say, “scram.”

Their cold sweet treat would be frozen watermelon.  I could only do so much.

At least there was enough left to show my children, let them wear swimsuits, smell the fragrant sunscreen, flounder before they would bloom into strong swimmers among the waves, to quench their thirst with limeade at a picnic lunch.

To share my experiences, to tell them who I was, to offer them a slight glimmer of spontaneity.  All so they may stargaze, to reach and see not what the universe may offer them, but what they may offer the universe.

Or maybe just so they wouldn’t be couch potatoes. Ultimate frisbee would never die so long as I lived.

We parked where I once swam, and walked further in, to where the water was.  A little light blue pond encased by earth and salt baked white where there was a lake before.

I was called a radical, an eccentric.  I was right, vindicated.  It wasn’t a prize.  It wasn’t them that vexed me even though they had the nerve to act flabbergasted.

In my day we had little parasols, this visit we had to bring an enormous beach umbrella, segmented in rainbow triangles.  Any less than it and the thick paste all over my little ones and we would have sizzled.

Fewer people dared than before, when the beach was dotted up and down with people with their ubiquitous folding chairs, but I knew how important it was to show mine exactly what needed saving.

Some things were better off dying.  Oiled men and women sashaying along the beach like burnt peacocks.  We called them “ridicky”.  I was glad that died.

Some things were worth keeping alive, worth remembering, worth passing on.  My father had tried to teach me to sail and fish.  I kept his tackle box despite not having those skills.  It had its uses, as I had inherited his fastidious nature.

I too would die.  When, I didn’t know, but at least I gave them this.  I wondered what my children would keep of mine.  

As long as they knew me and I knew them, I didn’t care.

Note:  I think I got all the words and made something sensible.  That was the goal here.
