I should have been more specific on the organs.  Heart and liver would certainly be on the menu as long as they passed an eye test.  However, the stomach and intestines would not be safe to eat without extra preparation which is unavailable to the protag.  The protag has some skill and know-how even if the situation is desperate.  As to why those organs are not the most edible, you'd have to think of what impurities would remain in the digestive track.

I think I can make that cleaner, heh.  Thanks for the feedback!
