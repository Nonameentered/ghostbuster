First, I have to explain something to you.  Right at the beginning of the would-be apocalypse, some people thought the vampires’ appearance portended something greater, something more sinister was on the horizon.  That something turned out to be an economic recession after the vamp-goods bubble burst, but I digress.

This is the long way to say that the basement of my apartment at the time had a shelter of sorts to be used in the event vampires rise up, or werewolves, or whatever else.  It had never been used.

It was secure, had ventilation, furnishings, basic supplies, including the government’s issued medical supply cache.  Breaking into it was a serious felony, but what I knew most things were by then.

Better yet, no one came down here, but me.  I knew to be furtive in my comings and goings, but in the city everyone keeps to themselves already.  I preferred it that way.

And about the chain.  I didn’t have any chains.  It was a rope, black paracord, I found down there.  I wanted you to think I was safer than I actually was.  Sorry about that.  I wasn’t all that safe, a woven nylon band was all that kept the vamp back.  I had hope too, but that can be cheap.

For a while, I just stared at it, him.  It sat on a cot I set out.  Never having been so close to one before, I wanted to see everything for myself.  His fangs.  I wanted to see his fangs.

I kind of snarled at him at first to see what he would do.  Raising my lips and showing my tiny canines hoping something in the beast would cause it to mimic me.

It didn’t work.  It recoiled and nearly whimpered.  It was pathetic.

I had forgotten how to be polite.  This creature was once human, after all.  How did I know how much of his “soul” was retained and what had been let through the veil between life and death?  Veil is too nice.  It’s more a sieve, but I still thought beautiful things at times then.

“Sir, could you please show me your teeth?” I pointed at my mouth to assist.

His response was better.  Inquisitive almost, if its jerky movements and reflexive growling and spitting didn’t get in the way.  At least it stayed seated.  I almost thought it knew that’s what I preferred.  Or sitting is an instinctual human activity.  I hazarded it was likely the latter.

It still didn’t behave.  I don’t know what sparkle in his eye seduced me into doing what I did next, but I reached out and went to pull his upper lip back.

And the living dead thing, pale and cold, let me do it.  He must have “said” yes by way of one of the grunts or growls.

The damned creature’s passivity was winning me over to its side.  I felt a sort of compulsion of affection towards it the more I studied it, the more we interacted.

At some point it refused further collaboration and hugged its knees, whimpering.  Well snarling softly, which I interpreted as a sort of crying.  My pet was hungry.

Its food and water being what they were, I grabbed a bag of blood stored in the sealed cache, definitely another felony or three, and poured a cup.

It actually slurped as it began pouring the red liquid down its throat.

“Slow!” I barked.  Blood was running down the corners of his mouth to his chin and the floor.  He complied immediately and even set the cup down in front of me on the floor.

“More,” it said plain and clear without words.  I indulged its hunger with another cup full from the bag.

I wanted more too, more information about my subject.  I needed more time alone with it, but when would others start to wonder.  My reclusive nature would only cloak me for so long.  There was a nonzero chance of being caught and thrown in a cell and soon, I knew.  

Why did I have to be so weird?  After a couple days of our routine, I began thinking it was kind of adorable.
