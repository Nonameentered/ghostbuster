The Throne of Tomorrow has always existed and it always hasn't existed at the same time.  Tomorrow is always a day away, we'd say.

As each Today grew older, we could see more and more of the throne, but at the stroke of midnight it disappeared into the fog to again emerge as a phantom only the next day.

The towering complex of blank grey stone that housed the throne made me feel even smaller than I was.

"Oi!  Look at the mighty attendant at his post.  Always too late, never on time."  A brutish looking man with a barrel chest belted the words out at me.  "Chase the dream, little brother."  I wasn't his brother in any sense.

I always wanted to be a soldier, but I never imagined I'd spend day in and out guarding the post of the most important artifact of our fair city-state.  Both the most important and least important, I had learned.  

The future was inapproachable, clouded, uncertain.  I clawed for it with my bare hands, but the wispy smoke eluded my grasp and crept around my fingers, climbing ever upward before disappearing.  It was there, though, if only I could hold onto it.

I clanged my ceremonial gauntlet against my round metal shield.  The traditional warning of one at my post.  My action was met with even more cackling from the gang accompanying the large one.

They knew as well as I did that my attempted threat was but the roar of a paper tiger.  My gold armor plate consumed me.  It was too large and was fitted to me as best as the smith could manage, but I was still a small guy in a big cuirass.

The brute approached me.  I gripped my sheathed dagger in anticipation of the draw and shouts they expected from me, but he stopped before passing that threshold.  Proving himself to me, he beat his barrel chest emitting a hollow sound.  He stood tall and glared down at me.

He didn't know that if I ever did draw on him, it meant I would fight him to the death.  Ours was a noble society, after all.

Though he was roughly ten meters from me, I could smell the spirits on his breath.

"The throne is a myth.  It means nothing.  We built this city with sweat and blood, not with hopes and dreams," the brute seethed out.

I had no authority to speak.  I was but a speck on the lowest rank of our great Hierarchy.  All I could do is watch and wait.

"Answer me for once!"  I don't remember ever seeing this particular asshole before this night.  Like I said, though, I couldn't do as he commanded.  My orders came from elsewhere.

His lip curled.  He took off his shirt, displaying a variety of scars, fleshy pink keloids risen above what little undamaged space remained.

This was to be my one moment, the combat I spent night after night imagining.  I gripped my knife hard.  I knew I had to wait until he crossed that line.

And he did.  Suddenly, as all his body language had warned me.

I drew.

But he was quicker than I had estimated for a man of his size.  He was upon me before I could slash or thrust as I had in innumerable scenarios played out in my head.

The dullard pushed me back instead of tackling me to the ground.  The fool.  The blade is what he should have been concerned about.  It was poisoned.  Again, he wouldn't have ever have known.  We kept many secrets from each other.

But then he was upon me again.  He placed his palms on my chest plate and launched me backwards even further this time.

But then he froze.  A terrible grimace of rage and pain on his face.  Everything froze.  I was standing on the stairs leading to the throne.  I was shocked they were solid at all, that I could even see them.  

I heard it beckon to me.  I was compelled to approach it.

I walked slowly up the stairs.  No one had come this close to Tomorrow.  No one knew what it would bring.

"Child of today."  A delicate voice came from further within the small palace within the tower.  "Approach."  I was told nothing of what to do in this situation.  It was unfathomable.

I entered the main atrium, its high arched ceilings far above my head, but reaching down menacingly towards me like stalactites forming on the roof of a cavern.

The throne sat in the center of the large room.  Concrete rectangular slabs in the form of what had to be the most uncomfortable chair in existence, but it was a throne in name only.  No Human was meant to hold it.

"I offer you a choice," the voice said.  "To live in tomorrow."

"To know the future?  To understand what is to come?"  Only priests had spoken of such things, but I found myself intoning the words they imprinted upon me in my youth.  "Why me?" I queried.

"I have watched you all this time.  You guarded me faithfully, dear soldier.  You must be the greatest among your people to have earned such an honor."

"Not exactly.  Nevertheless, what do I have to do?"

"There is one thing.  You will never be able to return here again.  You must forsake all connection to the present.  You must join us forever."

My eyes must have widened, but I definitely sweated profusely from my forehead at the prospect.  I didn't have much, but I still had a mother and father and siblings and friends.  Few friends, but friends still.  The few minutes I stood before the gigantic throne felt like eternity.

"I've made my choice," I informed the Throne.
