The old white stone home extended up four stories.  Crammed into a row of similar rectangles, Olivia's home only stood out because of it's bright red door.

Gwendolyn tapped the heavy metal ring extending out of a lion's mouth against the large door's wooden surface, signaling her and Emily's arrival at Olivia's home.

A creak and a thump came from inside.  The door cracked open, but nothing and no one arrived to greet the women.

"Hello?" Emily called out.  There was no response.

"Where are the bloody servants?" Gwen said to no one.  "I'll risk the breach of propriety to find out what exactly is going on here.  Come hither, Em."  Gwen pushed the door open slowly, and beckoned Emily to step forward and over the threshold with her.

The pair entered a huge lacquered-wood-paneled foyer.  "I can't see anything, Gwen.  Can we go now?  There's no one here."

"There are candles over there."  Gwen pointed to a single lit candle in the expansive entryway.  It was sitting in front of an ornately framed mirror on a small colonial style table against the wall.  The women lit candles of their own from the flame.

"Olivia!  Olivia!" Gwen called as she walked up the stairs and towards her friend's drawing room, the only place Gwen expected her to be at this hour.

"These candelabras, in the sconces on the wall.  They should be lit.  What's going on here?" Emily asked as they proceeded down the hall at the top.

Up to the next level, down the hall, to the double doors at the end, the women walked.  The doors were open, a light flickered inside.  Peeking inside, the women gasped in unison as they saw what had become of their friend.
