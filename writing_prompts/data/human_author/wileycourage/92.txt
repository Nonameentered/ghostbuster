Deception from the moment of conception.

Play with perception.

Turn tricks, take licks.

Enter with force, in all due course.

Go unto that gate; show them your hate.

Trojan Horse to brother Cain; that fire will never wain.

Common to all folk, an oaken yoke.

Plow the field, scars will heal.

Through the breach to hear such screech.

There lies our future, many many a suture.

One must live, as though at the point of a shiv.

Turn tricks, take licks.

Play with perception.

Deception from the moment of conception.
