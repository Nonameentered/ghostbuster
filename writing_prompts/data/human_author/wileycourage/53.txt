Hi kat!  Impressive that you fit them all in in so few words.  Well done on the hilarious story.

I mean, the characters are going to sound a bit weird when you force a list of words into their mouths like that.  I think there's two ways to go about that, one lean into it like with the SAT and Stamford comments.  Point it out.  Two, try to disguise them as much as possible.

I think you're in the lean-in category, considering the wonderful:

>Pavlovian paparazzi pivoted posthaste, seeming to sense a bigger story.

I'm a sucker for alliteration like this in a silly story.  Also, "Pavlovian".  Just great.

Back to the topic, I think there's room to ramp up the silly, if you so chose.  It's a fine line as going too far and it loses the effect and the funny characters you created.  But I see room still, for what that's worth.

On dialogue.  It's wonderful and I don't need the tags, but then I'm like that.  I'm not sure whether it's any easier to fit the words in this way because you still have the problems with making it sound at least minimally natural for these characters to say these things.  In other words, awesome job.  I saw the characters cleanly and you played them off each other smoothly.

>“Look at you and your ubiquitous usage of SAT words. You might get into Stamford yet, Dan.”  
>  
>A large splash of limeade on Steve’s sunburned face followed.

I don't think you need to break the splashing of limeade off into its own paragraph here.  I think the effect is better served if they were together.  Minor point, but you make it hard to find things to point out!

You use "pivoted" for the paparazzi twice in relatively quick succession.  I do that a lot too.

Yep, the primary point is Dan's dialogue still feels slightly stilted.  A flash cards joke from Steve or something else might help.  A callback to the SAT studying maybe.  Something like that.

Overall, it was hilarious and flowed well and the back and forth between the characters was so smooth.  Thanks for the story kat.
