The young Prince had grown bored of wandering the local town’s streets like a pauper.  He turned instead inward to the heretofore forbidden areas of his family’s palatial estate.  In the thirteenth drawing room the Prince had cataloged, his once excited pace had slowed to a crawl.  He plopped on a red chaise longue and fell asleep.  
  
 
  
But We needed him awake.  We rang the mantle clock’s chime so hard it splintered its painted wood veneer.  Our mark shot up and looked quizzically toward the pristine fireplace.  We held an iron poker aloft, stirring the logs and causing smoke and ash to spit and sputter.
  
 
  
The lad stared still.  Was he dense?
  
 
  
We dashed our fingers into the smoke and wrote out “MIRROR” on the polar bear rug between the large sofas to make ourselves clear.
  
 
  
Finally the Prince obeyed and went to the mirror on the wall.  Approaching it, We caused his reflection to press on its side, hoping the simple one would mimic himself.  
  
 
  
He did!  He reached out and the panel pushed open.
  
 
  
Down the narrow corridor behind the wall, down the staircase spiraling below, the boy found himself in his family’s catacombs.
  
 
  
Two small sarcophaguses were tucked in a corner of the maze-like tomb, and We needed the boy to see on what foundation his house was built.
  
 
  
Our corpses, his cousins' corpses, heaved away the stone blocks holding them in their coffins.  We grabbed up our knives and props to show the boy the spirit of his father.
  
 
  
We would never have killed our kin!  We put on a play to tell him our story!
  
 
  
The macabre display complete, the boy knew what his father was, a liar, a murderer, and a cheat.  Now it was on him to avenge us however he chose fit.
