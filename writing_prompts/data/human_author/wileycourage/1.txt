The sharks circled.

There were four of us at first.  Two were left.  Me and him.  Bait.

I envied the two.  They were at the mercy of only the currents now, while we waited for teeth.  Being consumed or death by sunlight, exposure, fatigue, shock.  I bet on the sharks that got the two.  They had been nasty enough to do it slowly.  

I can still hear the sounds of their thrashing and screaming.

How had faded to the background, pure survival was the only instinct that mattered here.  Distress disappeared once I had resolved not to die, once I had finished panicking.  What was: a boat, a storm, a raft, rocks, reefs, saltwater - always plenty of saltwater - none of it mattered.  For now we sit on a piece of the raft, taking turns with our feet dangling in the water while the other rests in safety.

Locked in this way, this person once my friend was useful.  This person I don’t know.  Being in death’s clutches changed us both.  I’m sure he thinks the same of me.  But for now our debris allows us to kick the maneaters away where the others had flailed and given up their flesh to famelicose fangs.

Our debris had allowed us to kick them away for now, but they circle still.

My friend has the gall to look at me for more time resting on the makeshift raft.  I decided to let it happen. I knew I could survive.

His name was Eddy before all this.

Don’t part with your illusions if you have any by this point.  They are sweet and wholesome, but I’m not dying here.  I’m going to live and I’ll tell the tale my way.  He was never my friend, not really.

I shoved him in when the sharks came close, cutting him with a piece of metal I had secreted away after slicing the other I didn’t know.  His companion died trying to rescue him.  They bought me and my pal time.  Now he was buying me more.  The sharks frenzied and feasted as I fled.

There were four of us at first, and I would live to tell the tale, come hell or more salt water.
