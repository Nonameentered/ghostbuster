Hey Ginger!

Creepy story!  You did well moving the plot along and capturing the action as the narrator approaches the house and makes the discovery.

For crit:

There are many "I" statements from the narrator.  I unlatch, shiver, ring, thought, whirl, inhale, squint.  That's just in the first three relatively short paragraphs.  There's not much time to contemplate the scenery or mood when I'm being pulled along with the actions of the narrator.  The descriptions are great, but leaving a bit more to the imagination and allowing the scene to develop on its own might help.

Like with the patio.  There's lots of kinds of patios.  I could have used a hint at what to imagine, considering what the narrator finds.

What's with the crows and why do they like Ms. Jenkins so much?  As they are they are background, but they play a pivotal role in the narrative.  I can't tell as a reader what's going on with them other than that they drove the narrator to the backyard seemingly because they wanted him to find Ms. Jenkins.

Weaving them into the narrative more tightly and developing the crows as a sort of character in their own right might help.  You have it at the end with the narrator speaking to them, but it seems to come from nowhere.

The pacing is a bit quick for my tastes.  Those "I" statements don't leave much room for anything but action.

>A crow lands on her shoulder. I gasp and wave at it, but the bird stands its ground, staring sideways at me. In the patioâ€™s light, its feathers are iridescent, its round eyes infinitely dark.

Love this sentence and description!

Well done on the story and thanks for the read.
