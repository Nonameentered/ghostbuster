Liv could only nod affirmatively.

"Very well.  There are rules you must follow, maxims you must abide.  First, we are no gods, only mortals.  Second, all life is sacred.  Third, Flubbers do not count as life.  These will guide your employment.  Follow them and keep our secret, and all will be well."

Liv furrowed her brow and gulped before speaking.  "Why should I believe you?  You're a petty burglar.  I should call the proper authorities and have you answer to them!"

"A stubborn one.  Lucky me," the interloper muttered.  "Look."  He produced a tablet from beneath his long coat and handed it over to Dr. Ordie.

"What's this now?"  Her question didn't stop her from grabbing the illuminated slab and perusing its display.  "I don't understand."

"Another like you, another like me.  Both failed.  Tens of thousands died."

"That.  That can't be true.  We'd surely know if so many died in Pennsylvania in 1979.  We'd have to know."

"MK Ultra was an unmitigated success, Oliviana.  Mind control.  The only thing they couldn't cure was the radiation.  So, you should know about the supposed meltdown of Three Mile Island, right?"

"Of course."

"In a town in Pennsylvania, Black Bear City, a scientist just like you made your discovery.  Brought a flubber into this world.  It propagated quickly, children were playing with it in the streets.  They didn't know they were doomed."

"What in the ever-living fuck?  We nuked a goddamn U.S. city because of fucking flubber?"

"Would you have had the whole world slimed over?"

"There must have been another way!"

"There wasn't.  And there isn't.  That's why the Protocol exists.  Your first test is your creation.  Light it up, Liv."

"I . . . I . . .  Fine."  She lit a torch and sizzled the green goo until it was scorched and hardened and dead.
