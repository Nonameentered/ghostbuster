Where the sunlight had been, there was an eerie blue glow washing over Hinata.

Asami meowed and hissed, the hair on her nape standing tall; her tail, fluffed aggressively, danced back and forth.

Knowing the cat had senses beyond his own, the man gripped his quarterstaff in anticipation of danger, sliding his right foot back and looking towards the tapestry.

Moving figures beyond the cloth made the light dance around the sunken courtyard surrounded by stones forming steps into the larger temple complex.

Perfectly still, Hinata fought to control his breathing, his heart beating hard in his chest could not be so contained.  He watched and listened.

He heard strange sounds, the sounds of a blacksmith.  Metal clanging against metal.

A blade struck through the ancient tapestry, catching and reflecting the blue light across the young warrior’s face before slicing cleanly down and through the woven fabric.

Three towering men with glowing eyes lumbered through the gap and down into the pit that would be Hinata’s arena.  Their eyes scanning back and forth

Their movements were rigid and unnatural but quick.  Silhouetted by the light, he could not see them clearly, but he could see each arm ended in what appeared to be short swords.  The fighter remained motionless even in the face of the monstrosities and especially when afraid, as he was taught.

Asami, not trained in battle, took flight up the flagstones to safety.  The three turned their eyes on the black cat in unison and began moving forward and away from Hinata, seemingly unaware of him.

Still he watched and waited, noticing the dull metal coating the invaders.  Only when the moment was right would he strike.  If not for his own safety, then for his clan’s, if not for them, for his cat.
