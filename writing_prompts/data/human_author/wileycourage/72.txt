Funny story, ryter.  Great job.  I loved the jokes and mobster pair of fairies the best for sure.  They are hilarious.

For crit:

I think "capiece" is "capisce".  There are other variations but capiece isn't one of them.

Sabrina's decision to "declare her love" felt a little wooden when everything else flowed so well.  It only stood out because everything else had stakes.  Maybe I wanted a reminder of Sabrina's nervousness or feelings about approaching her crush?  

You started out with her lacking the courage to talk to Brian, but I didn't see enough in what the fairy mobsters did that would change her mind.  Or maybe she doesn't want him to get hurt.  I think just a little bit more connecting tissue there would be great and would help the ending land even better.

Then with the "believe in yourself" bit.  I didn't really buy that, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to.  It didn't sound like she didn't believe in herself before, just that she was shy and nervous.  It was more that her just asking him out was better than the alternatives presented.

The pixie dust and the smuggling operation were detailed out so well.

I can't praise you enough on how the dialogue flowed through so well to the end.

Not to be overly into the details, but the wish was for Brian to fall in love with Sabrina, not for Sabrina to have the courage to declare her feelings.  I was confused at how quickly Sabrina let it go and looked the other way.

>Angry, she stomped around to the otherside of the fire.

You're kind of showing and telling in this line.  I can infer the anger or frustration from the stomping without the angry bit up front.  And "otherside" should be "other side".

I tried looking for grammatical mistakes, but couldn't find any, so great job on that!

I really enjoyed reading through this.  Good job!
