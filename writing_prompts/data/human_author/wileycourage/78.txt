Well played! The poem fit the prompt very well, especially how you executed it. It flowed well and told a tight narrative. Some of the rhymes are questionable, which I only say cause you asked and pointed it out as a potential issue. "King" and "thing". "Mush" and "crush". "Stink" and "sink". The first two might not rhyme. The last is a bit repetitive. 

Those don't take away at all that this was wonderful and unexpected and just flowed so so well. The cadence and language contrasted the darker narrative. Well done!
