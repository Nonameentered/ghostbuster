He was in a black pit of nothingness.  He continued to fall but did manage to stop spinning miraculously.  If he weren’t such an experienced diver he might have grown sick from the experience, but Ricky knew how to fly.

Within seconds, or maybe hours, Ricky felt a hot sensation in his back.  Pain.  It welled from within.  He couldn’t see it, but a bulge had formed on his back, by his right shoulder blade.

Luckily for the young man, he passed out before the event.

A white-feathered wing burst from his back.  The massive wound closed quickly around it.  The wing wrapped around Ricky and stretched upwards, or perhaps downward.

He dreamed of the platform he leapt from, the pernicious heights for those not experienced in diving.  It was as though he had fallen from Grace.  Grace was his girlfriend’s name too.  He wondered whether he would ever see her again.

When Ricky awoke, he had landed.  He was still nowhere, but at least he had hit rock bottom.

A growl threatened from the darkness.  “Interloper,” a deep gravelly voice said slowly.

“Who . . . who’s there?” Ricky managed to let out over a quaver.

“I am Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies,” it answered before snorting like a boar.

“Hell.  Are you telling me I’m dead and have gone to hell?”

The Beast answered with a chortle.  “It doesn’t yet exist, master.”

“Master?  Where am I?”  Ricky moved his hand quickly and slapped himself in the face desperately.  It stung and hurt and made him close his eyes instinctively, but when he opened them again, he was still nowhere.
