Hey Stick!

Notes as I read:

Why didn't Moses know that Donnie was drunk as a skunk?  On beer that's hard to hide, especially on a boat.  

How did Claire get the beers out without Donnie "beer me bro" noticing?

That ending!  Cool stuff.  It ended kind of abruptly, but I think that's what you were going for.  It fits with the fishing trip ending like that.

Crit:

Cool story!  The characterization of Donnie and Claire was great!  Moses read a bit flat in contrast to those two.  He's more reactive while the other two are more in their element.  Still it's fun and leaves me a little unsettled for whatever reason.  Definitely the ending doing that.

Going from drunk to sober doesn't happen all quickly like described.  It's more the "buzz" wearing off.  I'm thinking of Donnie as the "one beer is too many, two beers aren't enough" type.  Anyway, "more sober" works better I think.

Is there a link between the invasive species and Donnie's drinking too many?  I want there to be some purpose to such an interesting ending.

My gut says ship names are italicized, but I think in the way you're describing the words, the quotation marks are fine.

The iceberg reference confused me.  It's a summer day, I was imagining warm.

Ok, finally found something in the grammar, which was difficult.

>Moses reeled in more line and to his surprise, the fish leaped out of the water and flopped on deck.

That's a compound sentence which would require a comma before "and".  E.g. "Moses reeled, and the fish leaped."

The communication between Claire and Moses is so well done.  They could read each others as couples do.  Great work there!

The language and your prose makes me feel like this is Moses's point of view.  I'm not picturing Donnie coming up with "coquettish" for example, when "hot" is right there on the low branch.  There might be a way to make that clearer, if that's what you were going for.

It's really the contrast I like the best.  And then the pointlessness of fishing when the fish did it for them.  Well done!
