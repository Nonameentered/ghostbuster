Thanks for the crit.  And again, you're too kind.

I like playing with dropping and re-adding words like "to".  Thanks for noting it didn't work there.  I need the feedback because I'm experimenting sometimes and am trying to learn, so thank you for the help as I see what works and what doesn't.

I was thinking of JFK there.

I'm not sure exactly if we can alter words.  As you noted I really tried not to, but some places I just couldn't without making it weird, or well weirder.

This was so much fun.  I'm glad you tried to cram them all in too.  I'll make sure to give yours a read.  

I probably got about 30 of them in my first pass and had to go back and stuff the other 15 in.  The story was purely pantsed.  I'm not sure I could have done it any other way.

How'd you go about it?
