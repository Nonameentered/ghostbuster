Thanks for the feedback!  Right on on the time.  I think I had something else happening before that.  Thirty seconds is better and makes more sense.  Fixed the quotation part too, good catch.

I try my best not to use em dashes.  I'm not entirely sure why.  I think you're right, but I also think the ellipse might fit too, as it would sound as though he trailed off when interrupted by someone else shouting, or that's my rationalization for the moment.

Great feedback.  I'm glad you enjoyed the story!
