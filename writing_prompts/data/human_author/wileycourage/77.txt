*Excerpt of cross examination of Ms. Garcia by Mr. Jurgesen, prosecutor, Mr. Greystone for the defense:*

"Thank you, ma'am.  Could you tell me where you were the night of December 18, 2023?"

"At home. Address is \[REDACTED\]."

\[REMAINING DEMOGRAPHIC AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO O.C. 1290(A)(2)(b)(i)-(iii)\]

"And what happened next?"

"I woke up to a sound from downstairs.  Someone was at a window scratching at the glass, or something -- I didn't know yet."

"I didn't ask before; does . . . did anyone live at your home with you?"

"Yes, my wife, Julia, and our dog are normally home, but they went away that night.  There was a conference.  She wasn't there.  She never saw the house again."

"Thank you.  So you were alone that night?"

"Yes. I was alone."

"Thank you.  Ms. Garcia, what happened that night?"

"I was upstairs sleeping.  I woke up to a sound at my window.  It sounded like something hard scratching on glass.  It could have been the door.  I . . . I don't know."

"Yes, please continue Ms. Garcia."

"I started towards the stairs.  I was at the top.  It was dark.  I didn't want to turn the lights on.  I could tell someone was there.  I couldn't see his face."

*Witness paused for thirty seconds.*

"What happened next, ma'am?"

"He . . . he broke in, and I ran back to my bedroom, to my phone.  I called 9-1-1.  They told me to hide, so I did.  I could hear him making tons of noise downstairs.  Like he was throwing my furniture around, smashing things.  I was so scared he was going to come upstairs.  I didn't know what he was going to do, what he wanted to do.

I heard him at the door again, a loud smash as it bashed against my beautiful home.  Our home.  I was too scared to move.  Too scared to do anything.  By the time I heard the sirens and saw the lights it was too late."

"What did the intruder do downstairs, ma'am?"

"He stacked the furniture in a pile, he broke my things, he stacked them, I don't know what he was looking for, but it was something."

"Did you try to escape?"

*Witness nods*

"Is that a 'yes'?"

"Yes."

"You already testified you struck the Defendant in the face during direct examination, isn't that right?"

"Yes."

"And he was incapacitated thereafter?"

"Yes."

"What happened then?"

"THAT BITCH LIT ME ON FIRE!"

"Order!  There will be no such outbursts, Mr. Alvarez.  If it happens again, you will be excluded."

"You stacked your broken furniture on him, poured gasoline on it all, didn't you?"

"I don't remember.  I don't remember.  All I could think about was bonfires we used to build at home to burn rubbish.  He was trash.  He is trash."

"Yet you're claiming it was self-defense, isn't that . . ."

"LOOK AT ME!  LOOK AT ME!  DID I DESERVE TO HAVE MY SKIN MELTED OFF?"

"Order!  Bailiff, remove Mr. Alvarez, sequester the jurors.  Counselors, approach."

Edits: lots of tweaks based on wonderful feedback which I adore.  If anyone else reads after the edits, did I hit the genres well enough?  What about the "bonfire" theme?  Thanks for all the help!
