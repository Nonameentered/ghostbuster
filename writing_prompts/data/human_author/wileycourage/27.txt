Hey Geese!

So, I deal in things close to this and it is hard for me to turn that part of my brain off.  I'll try to just say that there are little things that could improve accuracy.  Or else, remove the case from Connecticut and then the law and practices can be as you please.  Ok, with that said hopefully I can provide some feedback.  This isn't negative at all, more an admission that I can't separate things out cleanly in my head here.  I know in something funny you can't go all-in on accuracy.  I'd be happy to share more technical things, but only if you want.

Overall, the focus on the theft when the horseman is up to more serious crime was well done.  Perhaps you could place even more emphasis on the pumpkin and theft (even more) with it being a court of gourds?  Play the contrast hard, in other words to bring out the absurdity.

Decapitating counsel pays off well with the setup of declining representation earlier!  The service issue is stranger, but I promised not to do that.

"bans" can we change that to "enjoins"?  Then a little line between 99 years and Signed reading "IT IS SO ORDERED."?  I'm sorry.

Perhaps fact 3. could be broken out into two sections.  The reader doesn't necessarily know what the Pumpkin is for yet, and the Court wouldn't necessarily.  Besides, spelling it out that he placed the pumpkin on his head is funny, and it would show the theft is more important by putting it first, kind of.

The theme being punishment, I would have liked more extended discussion of the sentencing.  Maybe probation or other conditions?  The even on Halloween is fun, but I think you have room to expand on this if you wanted.  You'd hit the theme and I know there's silly potential in what you have this Court telling a force of nature or monster what it expects of it.

Great job on the fictional court filing or judgment.  I liked the jokes you had, but think there's room for even more absurdity.  Still, I appreciated your approach here.  Thanks for writing!
