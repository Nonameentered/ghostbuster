Reinia's gulp was audible and the quick pale of her face was visible as the realization fell on her.  "But, we're just two officers . . . we don't have suits, real armor, jetpacks, much of anything . . ."

"Buck up, LT, we have these."  The Commander reached and opened an overhead container and handed her companion a matte green, magazine-fed firearm.

"These.  These are what?  Guns?  Not even fucking phasers?  What about missiles?  Do we get any of those?  We're gonna need more than . . .  Sir--"

"*Lieutenant!*"

"--Yessir!"

"We make do with what we have and seize the opportunities that present themselves.  Do you know what we do otherwise?"

*"Yessir!"*

"And that is?"

"Survive, sir."

"That's right.  We survive.  And if we don't, we pray these purple people eaters choke on us."  The Commander reached out and touched Reina's arm.  All Reinia could do was look back into her superior's eyes.

"I understand, sir."

"Good.  Computer.  Estimate time to landfall."

"T-minus 10 Standardized Time Units."

"Take the helmets, vests, ammo, and guns.  When we hit the planet, we get away from the crash site as quickly as possible, into the jungle."
