Hi u/Dacacia, congrats!

I was happy to notice that I remember your second story in the list up there.  Your style and the flow of your stories really stand out for me.  Thanks for answering the questions here too!

1. Do you have any one story that stands out as just being fun to write?
2. What are you working on writing now?
3. If you could give one piece of advice to yourself starting on your writing adventure, what would it be?

Thanks and congratulations again!

Edit, someone asked how long you've been writing.  I'll ask something else (I had that as #2).
