<3/3>

It felt like an eternity as I watched the dot slowly move closer and closer to the center of the concentric circles on my panel.

"Estimated time to close: 30 seconds."  I called out.  "Fifteen seconds," I cried.  "10, 9, 8, 7 . . ."

The solar beast disappeared from my radar and sensors at the count of three.

"SENSORS!  WHERE DID IT GO!?"  The captain shouted as loud as he could.

"It's gone, Sir!" I replied.

"Perform a visual scan!"

The last resort was the naked eye.  Through the viewscreen, all we could see was the flaming yellow and brown surface of the vicious creature.

"Brace!" The Captain ordered.  "Helm, evasive maneuver X on my mark . . . MARK!"

The ship pirouetted gracefully avoiding the beast and letting it pass beneath the ship.  We reoriented to face the Earth.  We were in one piece, but the beast had breached our defensive line.  Billions of lives hung on our next moves.

"Fire at will."  I was in awe of the Captain's tenacity under such pressure.

Everyone on the bridge watched as our blasters sang out with their characteristic whine.

"Captain!  Captain!"  The Lieutenant Commander couldn't complete his sentence before blasts of fire rocked the ship.  I hadn't seen the flares as we soared over the beast.  It was one of my few jobs and I had failed.

"Decks four through eight breached, Captain.  Life support is failing."

The Captain did not hesitate.  "Close with it and overload the Core.  Abandon ship."

I made it to the life capsules in time to watch our ship with our Captain explode.  We had "won", but I feared the war to come.  I feared being found out as the coward I am, undeserving of the red badge bestowed on me, undeserving of the Captain I failed.
