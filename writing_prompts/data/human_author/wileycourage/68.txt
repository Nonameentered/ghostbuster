Fun take on the classic story.  I liked the elements of the original that made it through, how speedy this was while still capturing the genres, and of course the darkness contrasted with the siblings' affection.

For crit:

I did the same thing rainbow in.  For whatever reason firewood and being "out here" led me to believe they were in some sort of forest clearing.  I didn't know they were looting a house, and um the other thing, until later.  Just a hint of setting would tighten the narrative up I think.

Then on the paranoia.  There's an opportunity to show that, with some sort of statement of fear from either of the siblings.  "You saw the way he looked at you."  or something like that.  I loved where you went with the characters here, I think I want more of that fear and psychological effect that you presented.

I can't really say anything firm because as presented, it's so well done.  I love snappy stories like this that flow through to a solid conclusion so quickly.

Well done!
