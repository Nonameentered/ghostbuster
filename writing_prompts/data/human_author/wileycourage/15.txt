Hey seven,

Funny story you have here.  The way you described the setting in such detail really made the sillier elements pop.  Like the thumbs up from the squire, the cheese prophecy and just the general tone of Phillip.

For crit:

I'm having to look very closely to find anything awry.  Well done!

>The hag slammed the book and rose

I think you dropped a "closed" after "book".

Looking at the story more broadly, the scene is great, but leaving the ending open like that makes it feel less like a complete story and more like a chapter in something longer.

There's something missing to make it more complete.  Some more development of Prince Phillip's mission.  Maybe focusing in more on the fact that he's really down on his luck and looking for anything to help, such that the ending of having a purpose, any purpose closes the plot and helps the story stand alone.  It could even be more developed between the squire and Phillip, then the crone not caring would contrast.

As far as the augury, you played with the idea well.  If we're using cheese to tell the future, does it really matter what it says?  Also if you're willing to trust cheese to tell you what to do, what does that say about Phillip?  Making him a pushover and having him acquiesce to the hag was a good decision and fits well into the story.

I love the vocab, the flow, the tone, the laughs, everything.  Well done and thanks for the giggles!
