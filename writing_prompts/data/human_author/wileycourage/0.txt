Naomi’s image froze on the screen as Tim watched the spinning circle indicating the camera was processing the picture.  

“Look Nay!”

She ran to him and smushed her face against his. “Dang!  I look good!”

“Right?  It’s so sharp and clean.  Let’s take some more!”  The friends spent the rest of their day at the mall, snapping photographs of everything and everyone at the mall.  Patterned tiles, greenery, the skylights, the book store, pet store, jewelry store, toy store, department stores, boutiques, playgrounds, the car set to be raffled, everything.  Almost all their friends were there too, it was a different time.

By now Tim could only look back fondly and remember what once was.  He still knew were Naomi was, where most of them were, but they all had their own lives.  Tim did too, before the separation, the divorce, the regulated visits and trips with his children.

He came across the camera when moving his things.  Everything was there with it, even the box.  He had acquired the habit from his father.

Scrolling through the images brought more sadness than joy.  He was happy.  He thought the future held endless possibility.  Now he knew it did not.  His life led him here.  Alone and going through boxes of his possessions packed in tears and unpacked the same way.

Tim’s mind wandered to what could have been when he reached the final image, the first he took with Naomi at the mall.  Her smile was always infectious.  He couldn’t help but grin seeing her so happy and excited.

He wiped the tears from his face and Naomi was no longer smiling.  She looked concerned.

“Nay?” he brought himself to whisper.
