In those days, we drove out of the mountains on dirt roads barely wide enough for one car.  Your grandfather was an oil man, and we had escaped the Appalachians down into Ohio, but not too far.  The Ohio River would always be our home.

No one remembered when it started, but I do.  Who cared if it was true or not?  I did.

Your Pop liked big cars, big engines, and driving fast.  You know that.  He was letting his 1968 Impala roar down the bumpy roads.  It scared me at first, but by then we had been married nearly ten years.  I knew what to expect from him.

I’m more scared now than I was then.  My husband was drunk, driving well over the speed limit, at night, and along potholed and barely maintained roads with steep cliffs and dropoffs threatening to eat us.  Go ahead and judge us as you will be judged by your own. 

Octagenerians have so few fucks to give.  I hope you learn that one day, dear.

I’ve always stayed away from drink myself.  A glass of wine, champagne is all I need.  I made Don a family man in addition to an oil man.  Social gatherings were one part of my duties.  Look smart, converse, escape was my motto of the time, and I had escaped this time with little more than a headache beaten into my skull by inane discussion.

And make sure your Pop left with a mug of coffee sitting on top of the cup holders.

Sober-eyed, I kept watch on the road for possible impediments.  It was almost always a white-tailed deer, and more than one.  I wouldn’t even bother calling out raccoon sightings.  We must have smacked a half dozen both there and back.  The mass of steel was no worse for wear even if Don would have to pick out hairs and blood from the grill.

“Don!” I cried out when I saw it.  He only asked me what was the matter by his particular grunt.  You learn a lot about a man over ten years, dear.

Quickly wiping the sweat on my palms against my patterned dress, I raised my finger and pointed well down the winding road.

A pair of red eyes stared straight through us.  Blurry-eyed Don was slow to react, but I could see his vision was fixed on the creature.  He couldn’t look away.  I cried out and tugged at his navy blue sport coat, but he wouldn’t respond.

I was frantic by this point.  I could barely trust the man to keep the car on the road when he was paying attention.  I envisioned us careening over the edge of a cliff to be found weeks or months later.

We were getting closer and closer.  Don at least had slowed the car to a more reasonable speed.

I could see the human-like creature standing perfectly still, even in near total darkness but for the dim headlights its profile was visible.  Two enormous wings extended at least ten feet over its body and far outward from its slender frame and small head.

Don still wasn’t speaking, was still letting the Impala drift slower and slower as we approached.  He was like a fish secured on a hook, lazily allowing himself to be reeled in.

I felt a deep dread swell inside of me when I fixed my gaze into its eyes.  Horrors I instinctively knew were yet to come flashed before my vision.  I could not move.  Just like your grandfather.

Rivers burned, mountains were laid low, clouds of thick dust blocked out the Sun, a mass of humanity crawled prone to a central temple none of them would allow themselves to see.  Like a thresher the temple consumed them.  I saw it all.  We were all doomed to a fate worse than death, our suffering would be eternal.  I knew it.  I knew it.  I saw it.

I managed a blink and it was over.  All of it.  Don couldn’t remember a thing, thought I was crazy, told me to stop taking my medications.

Except that the next morning, June 22, 1969, the Cuyahoga River caught fire and burned.  I saw it all happen.  The creature showed me.  The Mothman showed me.  I’m not the only one who knows.  We’ve been strip mining in West Virginia now for ages, cutting the tops off mountains.  Your grandfather was there for it all, the oil, the coal and the exploitation of our natural resources.

You need to be prepared dear.  Keep watch for the Mothman.  Heed its warnings.  Retell the story.  Never forget.
