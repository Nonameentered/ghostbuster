Thanks for the feedback Ginger.  It's so great to see the effect I was going for landed!

I think I struggled with the realistic bit of the "realistic fiction" part.  I tried to have the prosecutor sound a little stilted.  Then with the formatting choice, it was difficult to convey information about all the participants while staying within the transcript.  Your crits really will help tighten it up, so thank you for them!

The other struggle was trying to hit the theme as hard as I could because I didn't want to ignore "bonfire".  I could stretch the meaning of it, but I also wanted a literal fire in there, but knew I couldn't get there without some setup because of my silly idea to do this as a transcript.

Thank you so much for this.  I'm going to try more crime drama stories, so hopefully I can take your points for the next ones too.
