"As you wish."  The genie had quickly regained composure.  Sid, the kid, thought he saw the slightest smirk on its otherwise emotionless face.

Finished with the lamp, he tossed it in the bin in the kitchen and began phase two of his plan.

Blue ink poured out onto the first page.  "I want my mother back."  Sid wrote, looking up and around in anticipation of something magical.

A minute passed and nothing had happened.

Another minute.  Nothing.

It felt to Sid like eternity.

Then the front door opened and someone walked inside.  "Hullllllooooo!"  Sid knew he had succeeded.

"Mom!"  Before Sid could run to her, the journal leapt from the island in the kitchen to his hand.  Nothing would delay him, though.  He dashed quickly to the foyer of his parents' large home, turning the corner to see his mother, healthy and smiling.  "Mom!  You aren't sick!"  Sid almost tackled the tall thin woman as he wrapped his arms around her.

"Whatever do you mean, Siddie?  I've been on a long trip.  I'm back now.  I'm back.  It's so good to see you too!"

"I love you so much.  I thought I'd never see you again."  Sid couldn't hold back his tears and wept into his mother's blouse openly.

His father, hearing the commotion, came down from his work-from-home office upstairs in his fuzzy slippers.  "Anne?  It can't be."

"Robert," was all she said.  Still hugging Sid she looked up and narrowed her eyes.

"We're together again, Dad!"

"It can't be.  Sid get away from that right now!"

"Dad?"  Sid disobeyed and kept tight to Anne.

"You don't understand, Sid, you don't understand."

"Murderer."  Anne stared down the widower.

"It was you or her, you or her.  I couldn't.  You were already so sick.  What would you have had me do?" Robert said.  "Don't you want to see your daughter?"

"No.  I was never meant to.  I gave my life for her.  The sacrifice can't be taken back."

"What's going on Mommy?"  Sid said over sniffling and wiping his tears with his free hand.

"I know who your father really is, dear.  Come with me."

"Where?  This is our home!"

Robert interjected.  "Get away from that monster, Sid!"  His parents began fighting like they always did.  Shouting, cursing, insulting, demeaning without a care for Sid or anyone else.

Unattended, Sid sat on the floor and began to write in his journal again.

He closed his eyes and opened them again.  A minute later he heard a key scratching at the lock of the front door.
