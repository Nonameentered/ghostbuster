"What if I told you our shadows are sentient and capable of more than merely providing a darkened outline?  Would you believe me?

Wherever there is light, there are shadows.  Those shadows protect us from what lies beyond them.  They aren't shadows only.  They are our guardian angels, in a way.

Think about it.  Think about the horrible things that lurk in the dark corners of this world.  They persist because our shadows need the light.  We need the light.

The Sun protects during the day.  Fire by night."  The red-hooded priestess raised her head showing piercing red and orange eyes.  "I, for one, dwell in the darkness."

"That's a myth, a child's story to keep them inside.  I refuse to believe you, witch."

"Like our angels we lurk behind, we blend into the background of the world.  We tell no one our purpose.  No one the truth.  Except you, Olga, dear."

"Why me?"

"Sister. Do you not recognize me?"

"Sister?  I had an older sister once.  You can't be her . . . can you?"

"You were so young when I left."

"Margaret!"  The younger woman embraced her long lost kin who only stiffened in response.

"I'm not here for you, exactly, sister.  I'm here for him."  Margaret's hand erupted in flame.  Her sister's shadow grew and grew until it encompassed the wall and ceiling of the small room.  "My lord," the priestess said solemnly.

Olga stood stunned as the huge shadow stepped forward and took the form of a charcoal angel, wings extended upward and through the rafters.  "Who is that?" she managed to get out over her quivers.

"Say nothing!" Margaret seethed, "It is an Angel of Death you have been blessed with, dear sister.

"*I am the Malak al-Maut.  You may refer to me as 'Azrael',*" the shadow-being bellowed,  "*a blessing for some, doom for others.*"  The angel beat its wings but moved no air.  Softening his voice it said, "with that out of the way, I am yours, vessel."

"We must hurry.  Nightfall approaches."  Margaret spoke only to the shadow being.
