“Scramble the fighters.”
  
 
  
“Sir?”  I had never heard the command uttered.  It had been centuries since the War.  “Which ones?”
  
 
  
“All of them.”  The Lieutenant motions to The Big Red Button.  I flip up its transparent casing and slam my palm down on it hard.
  
 
  
The blue white lighting running through the ship turns red.  “Battlestations, Battlestations.”  A dispassionate voice repeats as the glowing panels pulse.  
  
 
  
Why did this have to happen on the night shift?  It’s all I can think.
  
 
  
I hear a flurry of footfalls as the crew hurries into position.  Years of drills, years of training, we all prepared for this moment, but would they hesitate like I had?
  
 
  
Thunk.  Thunk.  Thunk.  Hiss.  Woosh.  Airlocks.  The fighters are launching.
  
 
  
I turn on the long range scanners after turning off the signal tone.  “Sir!  We have a problem.  There’s hundreds of them.  What do we do?”
  
 
  
“Sensor 1 to Captain.”
  
 
  
“Captain Drake.  Go ahead.”
  
 
  
“Multiple targets approaching in a column.”
  
 
  
“Captain to all hands.  Prepare yourselves.  You are ready for this moment.  I believe in all of you.  We run the gauntlet.  Ready yourselves to charge.  Alert the fleet.  We must keep the Enemy at bay, come what may.”
  
 
  
The entire ship rumbled as the engines of the large mothership roared to life.  I stare dumbfounded at my CO.
  
 
  
“Get to it, ensign.”
  
 
  
I look down at the panel and begin marking target priorities for the Weapons and Wing Commanders.  I don’t think I’ll survive the night.
  
 
  
“Once into the breach.  For the Vanguard.”  The Captain put on bugles to signal our headlong advance into our adversary’s teeth.
