Cool take on the theme!  It's weird that I can say that I loved the execution of the public execution story.  Well done!

For crit:

I like first person present, and your decision to go there with the horrific scene.  It allows you to present the feelings of the narrator and her present sense impressions of everything.

There were times, though, that I thought you mixed the narrator's internal feelings and what she could see and hear and sense.  I hope that makes sense.  For example, in the second paragraph:

>My nose runs as I cry. Her long hair’s been sheared off, and there are dark scabs where her fingernails used to be. I remember those fingers sliding down the pages of books when she taught me to read French. They’d brush my brow on stormy nights.

The first sentence is all about the narrator, then the rest is about what she sees and remembers about the condemned's fingers.  I think maybe breaking the first sentence off as its own paragraph would help emphasize the emotion.  It's definitely subjective, though.  All I think is giving the emotions and actions of the narrator room to breath might help the flow of the story and give you opportunity to highlight better what first person present offers.

>Its flames reach upward and grasp the hem of her dress.

The description of the stake and stacks of wood confused me a bit.  She's up on a platform, of some sort or raised up, right?  Maybe not, but you have wooden bundles wreathing around her feet.  It's the center piece of the whole story, so I think a little more description there could help.

>I feel something inside me

I love every single thing you did from here to the end.  It flowed so well, and the description of the little twig was beautiful and having the fireballs claw and bite.  Excellent ending!  I love it!

Whew, that ending was so fun.

Anyway, if I had to say anything, I'd say the setup could be a little tighter a little more deliberate and slow before you set the world on fire and so well.

Great job!
