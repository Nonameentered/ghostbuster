Hey Fye,

I got an eerie feeling reading this.  I'm not sure exactly what the protagonist was up to or why.  Without that backstory or more hints at this, I read it as a scene plucked out of something larger.

It's set well, it flows through to the end quickly, and it definitely leaves me wanting more.

The quotes though, if I may, seem a bit forced.  They stand out, in other words from the rest. Either the rest of the narrative needs to match some elements of the quotes or this guy's thoughts need some work to help them mesh into his character more naturally.

I'd suggest looking at the second to last paragraph as a potential opener (after the required first line).  You'd have the protag thinking of himself as a camera not recording while being recorded.  Having those concepts smashed nearer to each other seems like fun to me.  The rest would flow to show why he's somewhere doing something naughty and what he's doing that he would be caught.

>Simply put, Jordane felt left behind here. As if he were lost. He was homesick for everywhere but here.

I'm not sure why "as if he were lost" is standing as its own sentence here.  Also being left behind and being lost don't exactly line up.

I really need more detail on what Jordane is up to and why.  I keep coming back to that on re-reads.

You did really well with the spy/espionage angle.

Oh shoot, it's a part three.  I'm sorry I didn't notice that.  That does mean I'm gonna get to see more Fye Spy stories, so I'm stoked.  I'm not going to delete my reading notes from above, but it makes more sense now that I know it's a serial.  Good words.
