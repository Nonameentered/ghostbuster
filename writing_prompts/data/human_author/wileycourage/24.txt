I had forgotten to breath. Each turn of yellowed page brought ever more excitement. Forbidden secrets found in a university archive in the Midwest of all places!
  
 
  
There are things we were not meant to understand, but I mean to experience everything I can, even the heretofore unknowable.
  
 
  
But these things! Locked until I found the cipher, the key!
  
 
  
I peered up and down the lonely basement hall. Old-fashioned stacks of records, boxes, books lined up neatly under the glow of white florescent lights set to trigger one by one on movement. The rhythmic clicking added a flair to the solitary march on bare grey floor.
  
 
  
I had tried to match my steps to the lights. Sometimes, I succeeded. It was enjoyable.
  
 
  
Still alone. So often alone. Left to my own devices. To find my way, I lost myself in stories. Any book, really. It did not matter. Old books, new books, blue books, red books, so-called classics and the pulpiest fiction. I chose my own adventure.
  
 
  
They fed my brain until even they couldn't sustain me any longer. A search had to begin, it was the only way.

A plain black book, simply but expertly bound, soft to the touch was my Persephone to snatch away from the light and consume like all the others.
  
 
  
Imagine being killed repeatedly. Suffocated over and over and over. That is what's in this book, that is what it did to me.  To so, so many others.  I could feel them all.  We were shocked to life only to be killed again and again.  It was a violation of the order of nature.  Some horror must be experienced to be believed.
  
 
  
I still haven't breathed.
  
 
  
"Can I help you, sir? We're closing up in fifteen minutes now." The damned librarians never minded their own business.
  
 
  
"No. Thank you."
  
 
  
"Sir. You're sweating. You don't look well. Are you sure I can't help."
  
 
  
"This book. I must have it."
  
 
  
"Sir! You can't take that book! It's policy!"
  
 
  
I didn't want to. I let the air out, but I didn't need to breathe anymore. 
  

  
The rot, the death, the terrible shit I had read, spilled out of me like vomit. Concentrated, black and viscous it poured over the librarian's face entering his eyes and ears and mouth. It dissolved the poor man like acid and went right back in me the way it came.  

I couldnâ€™t tell if the tears were from the strain the vomitous monster put on my body as I gagged it out or regret at what I had done and what I would do again.
  

  
I took the book and left.  We're compelled to share what we know until the last.
  

  
That's what I'm doing now.  You're welcome.
