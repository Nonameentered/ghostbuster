We snuck into the pumpkin patch at night, meaning to make our way into the corn maze.  We were up to no good, her and I.  We were free.

She was the apple of my eye then.

Whispers.  We heard whispers at first coming from the pumpkins left on the vine, unpicked.  A snapshot of life without humans interfering by picking the fruit.  The prize gourd in the center stood at least six feet tall; it looked unreal, fake, but it wasn't plastic.  The rotund orange mass whispered to us to come nearer.

Approaching it cautiously she was the first to reach out and touch it.

"It's warm!" she exclaimed.

The pumpkin's ridged surface smoothed and became gelatinous, sucking her arm in at first up to the elbow.

"XXXXX!" she cried.  I grabbed her around the waist and pulled as hard as I could.  She screamed as I dislocated her shoulder in my attempt to rescue her.

The whispering became clearer.  The thing needed her, wanted her, it explained.  It pulled her up to her shoulder and the side of her face stuck to it.

"Help me!"  She barely gurgled out.  There was nothing I could do.

"Let her go!" I tried to command the thing, but it was more a pathetic plea.

It finally sucked her completely inside and closed up.  I banged against it again and again, my thuds echoing through the hollow space inside.

I could still hear her screams.  I matched her wail with my own until I couldn't her her anymore.

The whole pumpkin shuddered at exactly that moment, and again the ridges disappeared, again the surface was permeable, but I wouldn't dare to reach out.  The pumpkin bulged out a tumor that burst seeds and pulp and her onto the ground.

Except she wasn't her anymore.  Her skin was different, her hair red instead of blonde.  She smiled at me as she munched on the flesh.

"Weren't we supposed to go to the corn maze?  Come on!"  I led her in, left her there, and never saw her again.  She was lost to me.
