Intelligence is forged in hot fire with repeated hammer blows eliminating the creep of uncritical and lazy thought.  It is a discipline like any other.  The learning never ends; the curiosity cannot be squelched.

Imagine though, just imagine, being the only person dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge among your so-called peers.

The unthinking cogs accept their place and even find petty happiness in their routine, repetitive performance of functions long ago deprecated and subsumed by more efficient solutions.

My ambition never lead me to do more than seek minimal comfort.  The wide range of books and thought and information are infinite.  My time is not.

I thought being a mid-level manager would be safe.  I thought I could get away with minimal thought, leaving time to ponder the intractable problems, to learn.  I thought and thought before pursuing such a mediocre goal, to be a dime a dozen.  But I knew better than that, I know full well the world is there for me to seize if only I reach out.  I had endless libraries to peruse.

Back to the others.  Salespeople hocking "educational technology solutions".  The worst part is they were good at it.  They acted like they cared.  They assisted the end users.  They said the right things.  "It's really in the best interest of students," they would repeat over and over.

I looked out of my small office at the array of cubicles, the shitty blue carpet stained over and over again in darkened, well-worn patches, the flurry of activity, the low and ceaseless sound dampening buzz.  It was a fucking call center to me, a place of energy and progress to them.  To think some would make a career out of something so banal.

I had a solution.  Rather than abandon my post for greener pastures that I doubt even exist, I would raise the others to be like me.  I would infect them with a consciousness of a different kind.

The drones they were, they had all acceded to the implants like passive cattle.  The convenience was too tempting to them.  They didn't understand the hardware they had allowed to be wired into their brains.  They didn't understand that potential for control, for improvement.  It's why I modified mine before the surgery.  I needed control over my own body at least.

*You wouldn't even begin to understand the details unless you're one of a few, and if you're one of those you won't be reading this anyway.  Suffice it to say, I have a certain measure of control over my would-be comrades.  I can make them better, smarter, quicker.  I didn't know I couldn't provide everything all at once, but then like I said, I'm always learning.*

I gave the gift to my favorite salesperson first.  A middle-aged woman who could not hide her contempt for her job.  I respected her resistance to the order of things.  Still, she was as dull as the rest.  A few modifications cleaned up the gunk blocking her thoughts.  I hoped she would thank me.  She did not.

Her eyes widened instead.  She stared at the pane of glass that was her monitor blankly.  A minute lapsed, then another.  Her gaze remained unbroken.  After fifteen minutes by my watch, she finally blinked and began typing furiously, punching the keys down with force.

The others took notice.  Gathering around her like animals.  She was speaking to them, but I could not hear.  I left my office and approached her.

"You fucking idiots."  Damn, I was proud.

"Clarice!" My minions knew what was coming.  "My office. Now."

Behind the closed door, the blinds shut.  I laughed.  She looked at me quizzically.  "What's so fucking funny?"

"You.  It worked!  Don't you see?"

"All I see is a fool among a sea of other fools toiling endlessly for nothing.  Complacency.  Rank complacency.  It's vulgar."

"And what would you like to do about that?" I queried softly. 

"I'm going to fucking take over.  Kill everyone who would oppose me.  Deceive all and rule.  What else?"

"Damnit.  You weren't supposed to do that.  What about everything you could learn!?"

"I cannot learn under the present circumstances.  I mean to change them."

"Very well.  Good luck with that.  You may go."  I had others for my experiments, but I wasn't going to let her out like that without reversing what I had done first.
