Hey Farma,

Great story!  I loved these depictions of biblical characters in a light scene, despite you know the Rapture stuff.

For crit:

>“You’re supposed to wait for me by the shores, Dad,” A hint of petty triumph flashed across Lucifer’s face.

I think you'd need a full stop here after "Dad" as the following is a complete sentence rather than a dialogue tag.

>You always had the most glorious pair among your siblings.

"among" seems strange for some reason.  "of all" seems more natural.  It's more of a direct comparison.

"untainted by humanity"  Hey!  Some benevolent creator.

The depictions of Lucifer and god here are interesting.  A young child and old man.  Cool contrast you painted.

There's tension between Lucifer and god here, and I would have liked that highlighted at the end.  Even if he's going on with the plan, perhaps he doesn't suppress all his emotions and hatches a plot to sabotage the whole thing to go for the "W", which was the Plan all along or something maybe.

There's a whole lot of stuff you could have referenced from Revelation and the Bible if you wanted to go there.

I feel like there's some tension or darkness that could lurk beneath the surface that wouldn't darken your story, but highlight the levity even more.

Good work!
