*It had to be the dodgy mushrooms*, Thor thought.
  
 
  
Reality seemed to agree with him.  His skin turned pale blue in patches at first before covering his entire distorted body.  Large, black, and ridged horns sprouted painfully from his head.  He winced, shutting his eyes instinctively.
  
 
  
When he opened them a moment later, the blizzard biting at him had passed.  Warm sunlight beat down upon him instead.  
  
 
  
The herder found himself in a valley of rolling hills, speckled with shoes and hats and trees and streams and pebbles.  They must have been boulders to the inhabitants.
  
 
  
By then the original shoe’s tenants had alerted their fellows, and a steadily growing crowd of tiny people gathered in the dense forests around Thor’s now clawed and bare feet.
  
 
  
Afraid to move and injure the little people, the gentle goats-man knelt slowly and tried speaking out to the crowd.
  
 
  
“Hello?  Can you understand me?  I don’t want to hurt you, but I do need to move,” he pleaded.
  
 
  
They did not.  He watched as the little people recoiled and covered their ears.  Their looks of terror distressed the giant.  Daring not to speak further, and afraid of what he had done already, Thor cried.
  
 
  
Where the little droplets of water fell, the ground froze.
  
 
  
A screech distracted Thor-turned-monster from his misery.  A little creature, a woman with her face painted in red stripes rode a mouse ahead of a marching troop of helmeted men and women armed with axes and spears.
  
 
  
*Yrsa did tell me to watch what I ate.  I should have listened better.  I hope I'll see her again.*
