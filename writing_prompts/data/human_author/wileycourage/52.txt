Hi android!  Great job getting all the words in, I know that's tough.  And from the onset, I was wondering how in the vampire you were gonna fit them all.

I got major Frankenstein's monster vibes from this.  The alien watching humans live and all of that.  It was a smart way to go about getting the words in.

On that, the top is very Aurora heavy while the bottom is very human heavy, if that makes sense.  Going with the monster theme, I'd have rather have had Aurora's viewpoint interspersed with what she is seeing to give me more of a direct connection between the viewer and who is being viewed.  Like how Aurora is feeling about the light summer fun and her own choices or otherness or really anything else you'd want to highlight.

>Aurora’s diet was radical: she drank pig’s blood.

I'm nearly certain the colon should be a semicolon.

>When it functionally worked her maker was flabbergasted.

Here there needs to be a comma after "worked".

>Survival was enough to vindicate her for the decision.

I don't understand "vindicate her for the decision".  I think "vindicate her decision" sounds more natural without changing what that means, though I might be missing something.

>The violence of killing people to survive was a centuries old haze to her. Unable to control her thirst, it had been unfortunate that her former species was ubiquitous. Now, she appreciated their pervasiveness.
  


This paragraph was just great.

>The large waves were occasionally tubular, making for perfect surfing, but rough times for anyone brave enough to set sail. Oof, and for the new surfer who just had a gnarly wipeout in shallow water.

This felt really odd.  All the other narration seemed to mirror Aurora's viewpoint, so this paragraph felt jarring with the "Oof" and other language.

Everything is here though.  You don't really have a slice of life I don't think.  I see more alienation and other themes present for that.  Again, Frankenstein's monster.  It's very well done, and I think it just needs some balance on edits to shine even better.

Thanks for writing, it was an enjoyable read!
