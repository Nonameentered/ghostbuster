Silver scales glistened in the moonlight.  It had been weeks since I had eaten meat.  This trout would mean just a little more survival, a little more time.

If only it were fresh enough.

The cool air would hamper the growth of bacteria, but a dead fish washed up on the shore can host much more than rot.

A gentle sniff then a full whiff of the fish told me nothing was greatly amiss.  It stank for certain, but only in the way fish ordinarily smell.

Slippery and cold to the touch I pinned it against a clean smooth rock with my left hand and deftly began to clean my meal.  The edge of my knife audibly scraped against bone, as I cut long strips of pink meat from the carcass.

Some parts needed set aside: the digestive tract, stomach and intestines.  While I meant to eat everything despite its condition, some parts were best left as bait.

I moved slowly back to my makeshift camp, pieced together with various materials scavenged from around the little section of lake I had tethered myself to.

The hearth housing my fire was the center of my existence, and the little metal pot my most prized possession.

Fish stew it would be for dinner.  And fish meat it would be until there was no more to eat.

I quickly dumped the head, heart, and liver into boiling water.  I wanted as much as the fish could give me, broth and all.  Nutrients, precious nutrients, seeped into the water as the fish cooked.

My hunger had such depths that I gleefully sucked the eyeballs out of the fish head and squished them between my teeth, swallowing them down happily.

So desperate for sustenance, I could not relate to you what fish flesh tastes like at all.  There was no taste, only appreciation for the gift that nature had given.

More time to survive, to be rescued.  If only they would find me.  If only it did not kill me first.
