Thanks for this, Ryter.  I've been working on the whole no signposting thing because I have a strange fascination with it.  I don't know if I can ever make it completely clear, so I'm going for as little confusion as possible or somewhere near there.  Thanks for the help as I'll inevitably try and try again to make this work.

I agree.  Even that slight difference in the judge's commands will help.  There's a ton of nuance to this whole thing.  Especially since that's the point where my "reveal" or "turn" is, I should be careful to draw the lines as cleanly as I can.

Thanks again.  I need feedback like yours as I continue to beat my head against this "no signposting" wall I'm fascinated with.
