“No.  I know what you are and I want the magic cake!”  The man slapped his palm down on the counter hard, but the baker could see a hundred dollar bill jutting out between his fingers.

“Sir, if you persist I promise you . . . you’ll be asked to leave!”  Rowena’s bakery wasn’t in the best part of town, you see.  Besides the cat door and pass-through windows, she was protected by thick bulletproof glass.  Still, she was in the business of selling sweets and even rude customers pay.  Sometimes they even tip.

“Do you know the terms?  The witch’s smile turned from inviting to malicious and mischievous.”

“Terms?”

“Speak of me or this place and you’ll find out.  Drink up.”  She shoved a clear vial of green liquid under the glass.

“Rowena Scott, you are under arrest for unlicensed spelling and cursing.”  The man produced a badge and held it to the window.

“You fool.”  She hit a bell behind the counter and Felix, her cat, stalked slowly around the officer.
