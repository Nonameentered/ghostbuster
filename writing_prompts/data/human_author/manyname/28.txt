Officer Jones had a mixed view of the best PI in the county. The man was quirky, and particular. You never knew when he was fucking with you, and when he was serious. He was standoffish and awkward.  Officer Jones remembered the first time he worked with the PI; he had made the uniformed man do "I'm a little teapot" before he had realized it, just to *"make sure you'll do as I ask without too much question."*

That said, he got *results*; there was a reason HQ hired him. Dozens on dozens of cases on the Police's docket were solved basically single-handedly by this man. Even on that first case, the PI ended up sparing him from a gristly death; telling the officer to make some rediculous moves while walking through a patch of forest, only to note the strewn mines and boobietraps he had avoided at the end. The PI was amazing, no doubt.

Still, amazing or not, Officer Jones couldn't help but to think the man insane as the PI crawled around the room, muttering and whispering to himself. He stopped, here and there, intently investigating a doorknob, then a wardrobe, then a toy box. He couldn't help himself once the PI got a hold of a teddy bear, once again whispering intently, as though a conversation was happening.

"Sorry to interrupt, but I gotta know how interrogating a *teddy bear* is going to help this case."

The PI paused for a moment, seemingly on a new train of thought. "Would you really like to know, Officer Jones?"

Jones sighed. "Sorry, I know you got your own wa--"

"I can talk to inanimate objects."

Jones paused for a moment, processing what what was just said. "Excuse me?"

"I can talk to inanimate objects. Or, rather, what you perceive as inanimate. Objects are actually quite lively, to those with the ear for it. And they have such stories to tell; these items we live with every day. Especially today, in the electronic age, where we all carry cellular phones. The *stories* they can tell."

Jones was silent for a moment. "Are...are you fucking with me?" He paused, before quickly adding, "I don't mean that in a bad way, I just really can't tell, with you. You're...always serious about everything."

There was a long pause, before a low chuckle came from the PI. "Sure, Officer Jones. We'll stick with that." He got up, not looking at Jones, but continued speaking to him. "Truth is, it helps me think in that way to decipher the truth. Make all the connections. How each object was used during the crime. What it would have seen. Kind of like Sherlock Holmes, if it helps." 

The PI then tenderly picked up the teddy bear, presenting him to Officer Jones. "Come along, Officer Jones. Or *lead witness* has told me where our little girl may have ran off to."

Officer Jones chuckled. "Alright, alright. Lead the way, Detective."

The PI hated lying, but it satisfied Officer Jones.
