This was a... predicament, to be sure. I had been walking through the Wilded Woods, foraging for mushrooms and other foodstuffs to fill my meager basket. I had not been paying attention, and the noose around my foot caught and send me heels-over-head, where I hang now. 

The trap, and the goblin whom arrived after it snapped, did not bring me fear. We, of the Woodstown, had our arrangements with the wild tribes who made their homes in the forest. To the fae and druids, we promised to only take what we needed. To the orcs, a promise of sufficient hunting area for both. To the goblins, a promise to both sides to not intervene or irritate the other. If anything, it brought annoyance. Part of our agreement was that if we broke our parts, whether by unintentional reasons of good faith, or by necessity, we would pay it back in a form or fashion. Some...*unscrupulous* types like to take advantage, just to receive some kind of payment.

Though, I'd never heard *marriage* demanded as a payment.

"What?"

The goblin woman, decorated in warpaints, points her staff at me, poking my chest.

"I catch! You husband now!"

I swing for some moments, before I find words. "...what in the name of the Gods, no."

The goblin woman immediately sniffles, as tears and a sadness washes over her. Goblin sadness, as it turns out, tends to drive towards anger, as she shouts, "Why not?!"

I am suddenly overcome by some regret. While my answers still stands, I didn't have to put it so harshly. Also, I am still in her trap, and if I scare her away, Gods know how long it will take for someone to find me. I quickly retort with an answer.

"Because that's not how it works, for humans. Is that how it works for goblins?"

She sniffles again, wiping away some tears, and sadly mutters, "No."

I begin to feel lightheaded, and my foot begins to feel like pins and needles. "How about you let me down, and we'll talk about it."

"Husband no run away?"

I sigh, and say through gritted teeth, "No, I won't run away."

Her mood immediately lightens, as she cuts the rope with a flint knife, dropping me on my head. I sit up, rubbing my head. Once the pain and dizziness clears up, I look to my... capturer. In truth, of the few goblins I've seen, she is quite cute, even by human standards. A face clear of warts, and marks. Thin, but wide ears. A head of wild, but flowing, black hair. Slightly crooked teeth, but certainly better than even some of my fellow humans. Some...*voluptuous* proportions, for her size. Certainly, she would have her choice of who she wished to marry, in her tribe.

"So why marriage? And, for that matter, to a *human*?"

The goblin woman's face falls, and her ears droop. "Because Ivless ugly. No beautiful warts on face, too fat. No goblin want be husband." She sniffles again, and wipes tears away. "But hoomans give things, when captured. Maybe hoomans be husband?"

I think carefully, on my answer. Of course, I hadn't considered that what once race found appealing, another would find appalling. And I could understand being the ugly one of your "tribe", I wasn't exactly a looker myself. There was a reason I lived at the edge of the woods, even if everyone in town was to kind to talk about why. Certainly, I'm not going to outright *marry* this Ivless, I could at least strike a balance, something to placate her.

"Well, Ivless, I'm not going to marry you, as we've just met, and that not how humans usually marry. We usually court, first. Get to know one each other, our interests and dislikes, our emotions and feelings. We usually let time solidify and temper our love. So, I will not *marry* you, but I will begin courtship with you. Go on a date, and see where it takes us. Okay?"

The goblin thinks for a moment. "No husband...yet?"

"Technically, yes. Not husband."

"Boyfriend?"

"Again, technically, yes--"

I am unable to finish my sentence, as she tackles me with a hug, exclaiming in joy. "BOYFRIEND!"

I sigh, though there is a smile on my lips I cannot hide. She is earnest, at least.
