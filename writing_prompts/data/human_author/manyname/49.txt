People often put me akin to that ol' comic book hero, *Spider-Man*. Mostly from that catchphrase, *your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!*

But I'm no Spider-Man. Spider-Man went to *space*. Spider-Man was an *Avenger*.

Sorry, that came out way worse than it was in my head. I'm not bitter about it, honest. I don't have the guts for that kind of stuff; combat, violence, beating the snot out of people. I just like...*helping*, you know? In all the other ways that don't involve violence. Helping old ladies across the street, helping kids with homework, giving a little to those down on their luck.

I don't want to be dishonest, here, I *have* had my eyes on the spotlight before. When I was young, dumb, and full of...well, you know the saying. It's every kid's dream, to be a superhero. To save the world, to be a worldwide superstar. I had a real shot, too, even made it into the Varsity Supers. Y'know, kind of like the Teen Titans from the comics, the stepping stone before you get to join the Justice League. I'm glad I did, too, don't get me wrong. Showed me that I don't *really* want to be a part of the League of Supers. Too much of a "good-ol'-boy" program for my tastes. Too much arrogance, and not enough humility, in my opinion.

To be fair, they do *save the world*. Like, routinely. So I suppose some arrogance is warranted. Still, too much politics for me. Even thought about going vigilante; but, again, no guts for violence. Also, then I'm *against* the law, brazenly, which isn't really my style.

Plus, being "on the ground" like I am really fits with my powers. See, I have the power to change probability. "Anything is Possible" was my working motto in the Varsity days. Yeah, I know, sounds God-like; but it's not as powerful as you're thinking. I don't get to control *how* the probability change occurs. Additionally, the larger the change, or the impact *of* the change, the more energy it takes. Basically, the further off the bell curve it is. So, yes, while I *can* change the probability of a Earth-shattering meteor hitting us from eighty percent to literally zero, there's no guarantee its passing won't cause issues, and I'll be comatose for a full year.

But the percentage an old lady's arthritis won't flare up *just* as she's crossing? The percentage that a kid will understand *just* the math problem they're working on? The probability a bank error gives someone struggling *just* enough to pay rent? Easy stuff, for my abilities; I can *literally* do it all day. Plus, I like being a hero that people can imitate. I mean, yes, my powers can *force* probability to change at an unprecedented rate. But the things I do? That changes probability, too. Giving that old lady a helping hand helps her get to where he arthritis medicine is, tutoring a child can get them to understand foundations, buying groceries for the struggling couple can help them set aside some of their own funds, et cetra. Everything I *do* can be imitated, and even if the change is small, *it's still change.* And better yet, if everyone does a little bit, a *little* becomes *a lot.*

No, I like what I do, where I'm at. Just a guy helping people, who just so happens to have powers.

...

...how was that, kid? Good enough for your school project? Oh, your friend needs a hero to talk to as well? Well, you tell them that maybe their luck will change...
