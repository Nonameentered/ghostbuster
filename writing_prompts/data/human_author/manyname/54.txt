In my world, knowledge is, truly, transferable. Upon our deaths, our knowledge collects and forms a bead of thought; a literal manifestation of one's skills. By ingesting this bead, one may gain the skills of the deceased. It is custom, in my homeland, that the father should pass down his knowledge to his eldest child; a mother the second eldest. Children without children of their own pass it along to their youngest siblings. A sharing beyond death; an insurance of familial bond and knowledge.

Of course, as is with all humanity, there is a distinct greed amongst us. We covet, and lust; sin, and sunder. It is not uncommon for people such as these to take the matter of gathering their knowledge into their own hands; by violence and murder. The law is very clear on how murderers are to be handled: tried, and, before the Royal courts, if found guilty, hung. Threats of death only loom so far; the courts are so far away, the Royals do not understand, and the guards can only patrol so far. But the threat? The threat is here *now*. So, many choose a different route, gathering in their gangs and clans for protection.

I have no such clan. And my only knowledge, which I have forged myself, is survival.

So when the Cleavers and Thirsty Daggers began fueling their feud in the streets, I knew I must act. I would not join the feud; I do not have the capacity for murder, and enemies are not what I want. But corpses carry the things they had in life; gold, weapons, things to sell. This had been intention, at first; but as I approached the first of the slain, doing my best to stay hidden as I did so, I saw the bead form. In retrospect, I do not know what possessed me to think of consuming the bead. It was not mine to consume, nor did I know what kind of knowledge I would gain. But I plucked it, like a bloody berry, wiped it as clean as a could, and swallowed.

I saw, through my mind's eye, the knowledge spread before me. How to trim silver skin from flesh, bleed a corpse dry; the various cuts of the body and how to sell them. The knowledge of a Butcher. 

It felt as though I had sat there for a year, but the clashing of steel and smell of iron not brought me back, a mere moment later. I considered running, of bailing; one marble of knowledge missing would be pinned on someone else, and I could look for a master to apprentice under. Forge a new life for myself. But a greed of my own formed; I *needed* to know more. Learn more. *Consume* more knowledge.

After making sure the two gangs were busying themselves with each other, I moved onto the next corpse. Then the next, and so on.

I gained the knowledge of the Hunter; in bow and arrow, and where best to strike the beasts of the forests. Of how to skin game, and of trap craft. The knowledge of the Sneak; of silence and its art, of disillusion and distraction. Of the Thief; pickpocketing and lock breaking. Of the Lover; and the arts thereof, and implements for it. Of the Murderer; of fear and violence. 

So on, and so on.

I must have gained the knowledge of a dozen people, with another two in my pockets, before I fled. The numbers were running thin, and I must not be caught in the act. I fled, not only those streets, but of the city, the township, and the country. I fled as far as I could go, away from the place that made me, away from blood and murder. To a new place, where I could be a new man. Where I could put my knowledge to the test, where I could learn more without the blood of others soaking into my hands. A new name, to hide the sins of the old.

I am Jack O'Fall, at your service.
