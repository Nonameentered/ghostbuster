"Why don't you stand still and **DIE**?!"

I swing my greataxe again, arcing it before me. The Cleaver of Men, an unstoppable force of violence. Millions murdered by its blade; a genocide of a hundred generations of Man. And yet, this *insolent* **insect** rolls out of the way, and as I ready another strike, *taunts* me. A grand cleave down, another roll. A full circled swing, a roll out of range. 

Taunt. 

Taunt. 

Taunt.

This mere *mortal* makes a mockery of me, silent all the while. There is no honor, no defence. Merely rolling, and occasionally, the *audacity* to lay measured unarmed blows against me. A death by a thousand cuts would be more honorable, as I would not become *filthy* through the touch of Man.

Long have I lost trying to appeal to honorable combat. This mortal has no weapon, no armor, no *morals*. Only a loincloth, a bucket on its head, and sheer *disrespect*. I make note to expedite the End, once I am done. No Man shall live due to this disrespect. I will slay all that breathes and lives, I will torch every home, break every brick, salt every field.

The mortal lays hands upon me once again.

I attempt to torch the mortal in a gout of encircled flames; once again, a roll out of range. I am, against my better judgement, becoming desperate. This *fool* is winning. I have yet to lay a single mark upon it, but a single strike is all it will take. I open up my defenses, so that I may strike with haste and greater strength. The mortal notes these weaknesses, and exploits them; but one *singular* **strike** is all I need. Soon. I will not be bested.

Attack; roll.

Attack; roll.

Attack; roll.

Alas, I *am* bested. My physical from can take no more. I can feel myself fading, back to the Outer Planes. 

"I will gather my strength, and return, some day. I will destroy all who share your blood, mortal. I will entrench this world in fire and salt; I will choke the rivers in the blood of Man. None shall escape my vengeance."

The mortal finally speaks, in my last moments.

"GG ez git gud."
