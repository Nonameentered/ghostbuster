A small, scrawny lad, I had been, when I had applied for Kingsley's Academy of Prestige and Knighthood. The recruiters laughed when I made my approach, laughed when I set the properly filled paperwork before them, and attempted to laugh me out of the room. Their laughs stopped when I kindly reminded them of the King's most recent decree, wherein *anyone* may apply for Knighthood, and no one may deny them of that right.

One of the recruiters grew red in the face at my reminder, spiting out. "You would *dare* demand Knighthood?"

I smiled, and shook my head. "No, sir. I expect nothing. I only demand that which the King's law has guaranteed; and that is the fair chance at Knighthood, sir."

A small and scrawny lad I had been, but a boy of wits, I was. The recruiter remained red in the face, while the others nodded in agreement, reluctant and otherwise, to my words.

"Very well, then, lad." One of the reluctant ones spoke, looking to my paperwork. He, and the others, looked over it for a minute, before whispering amongst themselves. Finally, they looked to me, to ask of me things about myself.

"Firstly, you are very short and underweight for your age. While not demerits upon your application, I see it fair to warn you that you at a major disadvantage to your peers."

I nod. "Aye, sir, I understand. No different than any other day, sir."

A few cocked their eyebrows at my remark, but continued.

"Secondly, you are required to provide for your own gear; your armor, your clothes, your weapon."

"Aye, sir, I understand. I will be able to meet the minimum requirements for the school, sir."

"Hm. Lastly, speaking on your weapon, you have filled in 'Thoughts & Prayers'. I presume this to be a name for your weapon of choice. Might you present it to us?"

I nod, "Of course, sir." I take a moment to produce strips of linens from my pack, and wrap them around my hands in a supportive and protective manner. On my right hand, the linens sport notions of thought and reminders; and on the left, prayers and blessings of the Gods. I present my fists to the recruiters. "These here are my weapons, sir; Thought and Prayers."

Immediately, there is protest and conversation. I stand, collected and calm, as they observe and argue. I even see the red-faced one smile, as if he has found his reason to deny me. 

Unfortunately for him, I have wit on my side.

"Sirs, if I may interrupt a moment, to explain?"

The recruiters quiet down to a murmur, before they nod. "Very well, explain."

"Syr Elizabeth Rose, sirs." There is a look of confusion amongst their faces. Why would I bring up the greatest knight in the land? What would that have to do with me? 

I continue. "Syr Elizabeth Rose, sirs, was very close to my height and weight when she applied for Knighthood. Further, while she had been of higher status, she had only the minimum requirements for  Knighthood, as she had no support from her family in her dream of becoming a knight."

The recruiters chew on the thought for a moment, but the angry red-faced one speaks up. "And what of your lack of a weapon?"

"The Battle of White-Rose Hill, sir." Again, confusion, so I continue. "In the Battle of White-Rose Hill, Syr Rose fought for a long, grueling twelve hours on foot; after only four of which her weapon, the renowned Starpiercer, broke. While she utilized other weapons scavenged amongst the battlefield that day, it is also confirmed that there are at least a dozen enemies that were brought to their end by her bare hands."

"I will not pretend nor presume, sirs, that I am or will be as strong or heroic as Syr Rose. It would be very possible, with all these odds stacked against me, that I might fail. However, to deny me of a chance to try is to mark against Syr Rose's legacy."


The recruiters once again murmur amongst themselves, before turning back to me, stamping my application.

"Well spoken, Recruit. We only have a single question more; and one of curiosity, rather than requirement. Why do you name your...'weapons', as they are?"

I smile. 

"Simple, sirs. Being on the streets, cold, starving, and dying; there are many people who would give me their thoughts and prayers. And nothing would change. But when I took action; when I *did* things with my own two hands, things would change. I took this understanding: thoughts and prayers mean *nothing* unless there is action behind it."
