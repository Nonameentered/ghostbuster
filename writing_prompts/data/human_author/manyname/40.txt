"Fight me!"

The towering behemoth of a man, clad in scuffed armor, turned towards the voice calling behind him. It was a younger man, clad in relatively new armor. This young one, while merely beginning his life as an adult, still showed a physical prowess, and a chance of being a worthy opponent. There was also, though, a fire within his eyes. Vengeance, or revenge, or simple hatred; it was difficult to tell. Nonetheless, the behemoth turned away with a simple retort.

**"No."**

The young man was taken aback, before drawing his sword and an amulet. He thrust the amulet into the air, and declared, "By the will of Acetious, God of Justice and Honor, you *will* repent for your sins in a duel of honor!"

The behemoth stopped again, this time fully turning around to face the young man. He saw the holy symbol, and saw as the young man eyed his. The behemoth growled in frustration, before once again answering,

**"No."**

The young man's frustration grew at his opponent's refusal. "You would refute tradition?"

**"I am not from these lands, so it is not my tradition to uphold. No."**

Now the young man seethed, and seemed to search for anything that could convince the behemoth to violence. Just before the behemoth could turn away again, it seemed in his face that he found it.

"You would refute your God, paladin of Valaphor?"

The behemoth paused, seemingly giving the question thought.

**"And how do you suppose that?"**

"Valaphor is the dem...*God* of Violence and Wrath, are they not?" A smirk, now, was upon the young man's face, thinking he had looped his opponent into battle. "I am offering you exactly that: violence. Would that not be against your god's wishes?"

The behemoth growled in frustration again, shaking his head.

**"Valaphor is the god of Violence and Wrath, yes. Judging from your words, though, you know not of the Pantheon nor the conjunction between us."**

The young man went to interrupt, but was halted by the behemoth's hand.

**"There are cults who, like you, have forgotten and misunderstood. Who have marred Valaphor's name. Killing and commiting acts of violence for the sake of violence; commit wrath for wrath's sake. But the sibling of Acetious would not be so simple."**

The young man's face contorted, seeming to understand the insinuation put before him, but refused to believe.

**"Acetious is the god of Justice and Honor. Valaphor, their sibling, is the tool of Their judgement. Whether you wish it or not, we are conjoined in the same fight, on the same side, and are brothers in arms for it."**

The man, shaken, still retorted, quoting the scripture of the gods. "But the Holy Texts say, 'Acetious will champion over Evil, and remove the need for the violent'!"

**"'And we, the instruments and weapons of Their will, will feast in rest eternally, our task complete.'"

"And what of the innocent you have slain here? What of the farmer you butchered?"

**"He was not innocent. And you would have never had the evidence necessary to find him guilty, without me."**

"Then why not give over that evidence to the courts? To have him put to trial?"

**"For the very reason you asked me to duel you in honor."**

The man stood, first confused, then shocked, as a revelation came across him. Valaphor, as it was, was seen more akin to a devil than a god; no court of Man would ever see the large man as trustworthy. He shook his head, still unshakable in his belief. 

"It still doesn't make it *right*."

**"Then join me."**

The younger looked to the larger, who held out a gauntleted hand.

**"I am an instrument, with little temperance nor care for honor. You are one of temperance and Honor, without an instrument. Together, we can fulfill our destinies as the Gods intended."**

The younger thought for some time, before answering.

"Paladin of Valaphor, I know not if what you say is true. It goes against everything I've been taught. But I'm willing, at least, to travel with you, even if only to temper your acts of violence."

The large man laughed, and though his face was hidden, his smile could be heard in his voice.

**"Very well, Brother."**
