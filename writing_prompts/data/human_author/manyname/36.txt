No one knew why it had happened, nor how, only that it *did*. It happened suddenly, without warning.

Billionaires were outlawed.

Not outlawed by the rules and laws of man; while many a common man and occasionally a politician would suggest such a manner, the general oligarchy of the world prevented it from becoming real. No; through magic, or Gods, or some other unexplainable way, billionaires became outlawed against the laws of *reality*.

For every red cent above $999,999,999.99 for every person's net worth, they lost it; forcibly, immediately, unknowably transfered into liquid assets and put to another use, towards a benefit to the common public. Schools and libraries, roads and rails, research and non-profit sciences.

When it had happened, that one day, at the strike of high noon, chaos immediately erupted. The low percent who held so much wealth complained and whined to their governmental protectors, who promised to do what they could. Some of them, too, lost a lot of money as well, after all. The leader of the bunch, while not the richest, was the most famous. Jeff Bezos, who kept quite a bit of his non-liquid assets, and 99 cents of United States coinage, found himself with a new a new asset: a ting plastic "gold" trophy with the remark, "JEFF BEZOS - I WON CAPATALISM".

No matter what the proir billionaires would do, however, they could not right the ship as they saw fit. They tried algorithms and AI, which only aligned to the new reality, and made it more efficient. They tried off-shore holdings, and crypto, and real estate; but, as *net* worth was the only consideration, these too immediately liquidated above every red cent. They tried scams, "donating" to charities of their own creation; but this, too, liquidated into real charities that benefited real people who needed real help.

As the proir billionaires fought and bickered, slamming against the walls of their new reality, the common people began to see change. True change, true help. And when that change was squandered away, by government officials or private individuals, the people resisted. They demanded change, to see the new influx of money utilized correctly. To see their future secured, and preserved for their children.

Of course, things were not all smooth sailing. *Close to* a billion dollars is still a lot of money, and buys a lot of influence. And with a hard cap to the amount one could make, there was a rush of the rich to reach it, all others be damned. There was still poverty, and crime. There was still scandal, and squander. There was still greed, and envy. A sudden change of reality did not suddenly change humanity.

No, the sudden shift in reality; whether by magic, or wishes, or Gods, instead pushed humanity. Some succumbed to baser desires, but many others were emboldened to push for their and others' futures. People were more willing to do what must be done to preserve the Earth, to preserve their freedoms, to secure the liberties of Men. To demand the changes required. 

It was uncertain, as it always was, which way humanity would go. Gay space communism? Communal equals in the world? Neo-capitalist hell? Nuclear hellfire? All that *was* certain was, now, more than it had ever been before, *all* humans had a vote in that future.
