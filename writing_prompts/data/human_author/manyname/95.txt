Seven times, 
Seven rings,
Seven chimes 
for the Starlit King.

Ring it once,
To beckon your call,
For a Stranger is no Friend
And a Friend 
No Stranger at all.

At the second chime,
Dispose of your mind,
For there is no sense
To the stairs you must climb.

On the third, 
Rid of your eyes,
Lest you see the things
Between the Starlit skies.

For the sound of the fourth,
Be free of your ears,
For the sounds of the Others
Are unpleasant Here.

The fifth, oh the fifth,
Begone of your touch,
Unless you enjoy the sensation
Of rot and of mush.

Six, six, six,
Remove of your heart,
For each man here
Your friend he is not.

And for the last,
Banish your soul,
Or it will be your wager
To the Things Down Below.

Then climb the last step,
And bow to the Throne.
One last thing to offer;
Your flesh and your bones.

Then bring upon Him
Your deepest wish,
That He shall grant
Then later tarnish.

Piles of gold!
Molten and hot
Immortal body!
Of withering rot

Jewels, and baubles!
The envy of All.
Bravery, and Pride!
Ego and gall.

He sits upon
The Darkest Throne,
Gazed upon
By the Unknown.

No words will exit,
No mouth will smile,
No man can temper
Not with violence nor wiles.

But your wishes granted,
A cost more than paid,
Then a final bow given; 
At His feet you must lay.

And when you leave,
Do not turn back,
For the Unknown
Stares right back.

Yet Time will die,
And all will fade,
And when it does
He comes in aid.

For The End
Is no end at all,
But the beginning
Of a new Age to fall.
