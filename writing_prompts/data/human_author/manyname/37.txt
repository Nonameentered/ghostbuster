The Royal Court stood silent, judging the lowly peasant bowing before the King. The boy, escorted on each side by the Royal Guard, looked up from his bow as the King beckoned.

"I am told, boy, that you have come to wake the Princess? That you wish to kiss her, and that you believe that you are the one to wake her?"

The boy's stature stayed low, but his voice was strong in conviction. "Yes, m'lord."

The King leaned forward, a scowl upon his face. "Do you forget your rank here, *peasant*?"

"Of course not, m'lord." For being surrounded by royalty, his voice did not waver, nor did his bravery. "That is why I am here to request m'lord's permission; as I am but a lowly, dirty peasant, and she is a Princess of the Royal Court. But I am aware of the Princess's condition, and of how many Princes have failed you, m'lord."

The King sat back, but still wore his scowl. "And you think that *you* would be the true love of the *Princess*? Lowly property of the Crown?"

"Perhaps, m'lord. Perhaps not me, exactly, m'lord, but I am the first to come to you with the suggestion that the 'true love' may not be a Royal, m'lord."

There came a great gasping from the Court, as the King went red in the face. "You would *dare* suggest such a thing? Do you wish to hang, *boy*?"

The boy shook his head. "No, m'lord, I do not wish to hang; but I believe that you, m'lord, misunderstand how magic and curses work. We, the lowly common folk, have heard of tales and iteracted of witches and of druids and of wizards, m'lord. I am uncertain if you, m'lord, not any of the Court--m'lords, m'ladies--have such tales nor experiences."

The King sank lower in his chair, still red and angry, but managed a single strained word: "Explain."

"Well, m'lord, curses are a magic used to *punish*. I don't know who or what magic user would curse you, m'lord, nor your daughter; but wouldn't such a person find that having a *commoner* kiss the Princess a fitting punishment?"

The Courts fell into a disarray of chaos and shouting, while the King leaned back in thought. Finally, he looked to the peasant boy, raising a hand for the silence of the Courts.

"While I dislike your tone, *boy*, you have brought forth an interesting point. I will listen to your idea, and allow you to prove it's worth. Wake my daughter, and I shall reward you handsomely. Should you fail, however, you shall hang."

The boy nodded, without a second thought, and began to instead outline a rather smart plan, revealing this peasant boy to be smarter than expected. He asked for a bath and a change of clean clothes, so that he would not soil the Princess, nor her chambers, with his filth. Likewise, he requested that there be a bucket of water and two clean rags near the bedside, filled with the cleanest water, that had been brought to a boil and cooled, and removed of all impurities. This water, he said, would be used to clean his face and lips, and, with the second rag, the Princess, so that he would not soil her.

The plan made, and reluctantly agreed to, the time came for the peasant boy to kiss the Royal Princess. Set up, as requested, the boy made his way to the bucket, taking in a deep breath and releasing it, seemingly reading himself. 

He then took the bucket, dousing the Princess in the cold water.

The guards went for their swords, but their hands were stayed by the yelp of the Princess. The Princess took some time to recover, before recognizing the peasant, who was giggling at this point.

"*Johnathan!*" She half-angrily pointed at him. "Of course it would be *you* to do something like this!"

"Of course, I had to wake you up *somehow*."

The Princess then registered that she was in her room. Moreover, that there were *guards* in her room, as the knelt to the Princess. "What happened?"

"Sleeping curse. I think your father made a druid angry. Or maybe a witch, I'm not sure."

"How long have I slept?"

"A few months, now. Became a real-life fairy tale, *m'lady*."

"Oh, hush you. What am I to tell father?"

"The truth, probably. Maybe he'll be open to it."

One of the guards, still knelt, looked to the boy. There was still a distortion of disgust on his face, but there was a conflicting recognition in his eyes. "Boy--" he paused, then tempered his tone. "*Son*, how did you know that would work?"

"Truthfully? I didn't. But what I did know is that the Princess does not *have* a true love, nor will she, as she will never have a romantic interest. Truly, a bitter curse indeed, then, to have 'true love's first kiss' awaken her then." He chuckled. "Then again, magic is usually not so cruel, and even when it is, is filled with loopholes."

The Princess sighed, then shooed the trio out of the room. "Guards, go tell my father that I am awake, now. And *you*, Jonathan, will wait outside for me to change, so you can catch me up on everything that has happened."

They did as they were told, with the guards making haste to the King, and Jonathan stepping outside the door with a smile on his face. 

He was glad to have his friend back.
