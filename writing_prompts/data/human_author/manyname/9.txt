I'll be honest, I actually didn't know that. 

Though that little tidbit, I think, doesn't detract from the main idea; if anything, it helps secure it. The *image* of punk becoming the norm, without really understanding what punk *is*. Thereby, making two grandma's out in a commune the most punk thing in that world.

Or at least, so I hope.

Thanks for praise and the knowledge!
