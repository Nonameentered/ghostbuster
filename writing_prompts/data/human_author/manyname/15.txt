Holy *shit*, did this gain some attention. I thought I was going to get a dozen comments, maybe two dozen, *at most*.

I'mma *try* to do as many of these as I can, but I got a few qualifiers here: 

(A) I promise nothing. If I give up after doing like 20 of these, sorry, but I am only one person. If I don't take your prompt; again, sorry, but it is what it is.

(B) I got work, y'all. So I promise nothing on a timeline.

Thank you all for the prompts!
