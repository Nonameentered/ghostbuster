My father taught me an important lesson, when I was young. I remember it vividly; out on the road, to travel to another city. Nothing but our wagon, the campfire, and his guitar. A clear moonlight sky with more stars I could count. Strumming the old instrument, he told me:

*"So long as you understand the basics, and you've got a good imagination, there's nothing you can't do."*

My father was such a kind man. He often teased and joked, and told me that I had "the memory of a doorknob", but unlike others, he didn't try and 'fix' me. He only tried to help, to teach me how to live in this world. You see, it is true that my technical memory is terrible. I tend to get lost, letters and numbers scramble in my brain, and I have trouble remembering names. But, what I do have is a great *emotional* memory. I don't remember facts very well, but I can always remember *experiences*.

And that, you see, is the key to my Magic. I don't remember, well, *any* of the lessons very well, but by practicing with friends and with tutors, by making *experiences*, I learned something. Magic is all about emotion. Or, at least, components are. I'll explain.

Spells that give flight, or make illusion and trickery, are usually *joyous* spells. The movements are light and airy, playful and whimsical; their sounds of the arcane utterances being like sounds of praise, or with a low chuckle of a joke. I think of my father when casting; I remember times by the campfire, listen to his songs, playing games as a child.

Spells that bolster, bless, and heal are usually *fearful* spells. This is...harder to describe. Not "fear" as in, "afraid", but more like, "I am afraid of losing something, and I will not let it be lost". The movements are more like a prayer, or asking for a grand favor; their sounds very much the same. I think of my father, when casting; of him fending off wolves and raiders, of tending his wounds and sickness.

Spells of fire, or lightning, or in general weaken or damage an opponent are usually *angry* spells. Their movement is sharp, and punctuated, like an attack of its own; and you more shout or yell the words, than say them. I think of my father, when casting; of him being struck down, of our things being stolen, of him apologizing.

Spells that control others, or deflect and reject Magic, are *sad* spells. The movements are slow and melancholic; the words muttered and sobbed. I think of my father, when casting; I think of his body in my arms, of his last breath, of the loneliness after his passing.

I think of my father, often. 

Of course, these are only generalized, as each spell asks of something different. A spell of enchantment, meant to overwhelm and charm a target with lust and love, requires a feeling of the same; a crush, a look, a stolen kiss.

I brandish this knowledge to you, Headmaster, for two reasons. One; to explain my unorthodox means of casting, why my spells are so different, and to ask that you allow me to pass on the merits of my results, rather than my inability to memorize. Two; that, once I have graduated, you allow me to stay as a member of the staff. Not so much a teacher, of my own right; I would still require much more years of training for that, and would not be so bold to assume I would fit the role. But, rather, as a councilor of sorts, for children who were like me. Ones who hold great potential, but need a helping hand in understanding their own ways of casting. Who cannot memorize facts and scrolls, but can cast the same or better through alternative means.

Please, Headmaster, allow me to do this.

It is what my father would have wanted.
