Mr. Doe was having the most peculiar morning. He was awoken by an unnerving sound, of electricity and multiple voices. As he went to investigate, a  face, not seen in a full year; legally, presumed dead. Two words jolt shock and confusion through him.

"Hey, Dad."

His son. His boy. Alive, and well...or at least, alive and whole. His son is different; stronger, armored, older, scarred. A certain look in his eye that Mr. Doe recognizes too well. His son has seen combat, has seen people die. His son has been shown the horrors of war. His son, returned; changed.

"Son?"

"Yeah, Dad, it's me." His son, scratches the back of his head, as he always did when he didn't know what to say. "I'm, uh, back, for a bit. I suppose, um, I need to explain where I've been, and who these people are."

His son motions to a woman, holding his hand. Princess Rosamond Aanor Orella, now Queen Reagent Rosamond Aanor Doe; his wife. She certainly looked the part; beautiful, graceful, and clothed in regal garments. The knight, whom Mr. Doe now saw was not human, but a minotaur of legend; Syr Warrax the Unstoppable. This monster, too, looked it's part; armored in heavy plate, emblazoned with a crest, a sword at its side. Queen curtseyed and knight bowed; Mr. Doe could only nod his head in recognition.

"How, uh, how about we talk this over some coffee, Dad."

Coffee brewed, cream and sugared, and they sat at the small kitchen table. His son relayed his tale; how he was magically ripped away from this world, into another. A world where fantasy was true; of magic, and monsters, and heroes. Of creatures of lore and legend. Of evil kings and kingdoms, of prophecy of end times. He was summoned, he said, to fight the Great Evil; to stop the end times from coming. He was trained in warfare, trained in magic, prepared for the coming war. And he fought, he led, watched friend and foe alike fall. A terrible cost, but a war won. A love formed. A responsibility entrusted. His son was King Consort, of this land. Truthfully, it would be Queen who was the highest power in the land. But he, as Consort, held a grand responsibility to the lands and its people. 

It was this reason, his son said, that he had to go back. To right wrongs, to compensate and to grieve, to rebuild and regrow. 

Mr. Doe sat in silence, in shock, as his son explained his tale; gave examples of his newfounded abilities. It was insane, and impossible to believe. A dream, it must be. But, dream or not, he could not let his son go again without his piece.

After the long silence, Mr. Doe got up, walked to where his son was sitting, and embraced him. As he did, he nearly collapsed into his son as scent and familiarity wore away shock, and emotions took over. He sobbed into his son's shoulder, apologizing for the night his son ran away, for the argument they had; apologizing for his involvement in war, for his son to wear the same shadow of combat in his heart. Mr. Doe had been strong enough to pretend he was okay, over the years, but he was never able to grieve. And now, seeing his son alive, his baby boy, his joy in life, *alive*, he could not pretend. He could not be strong.

His son, too, joined in his embrace, in his sobs. His son, too, had been holding strong, pretending he was alright. But he could not, not while his father was collapsed in his arms, sobbing. He could not, as his father apologized and grieved.

The two men sobbed together for some time, until tears ran dry, and only thankfulness remained. Thankful to be together again, father and son.

Mr. Doe was the first to recover into his senses; wiping away dry tears, he then embraced the Queen Regent; his newly discovered daughter-in-law. He welcomed her into the family, and jokingly chastised his son for not inviting him to the wedding. He extended his arm to the minotaur, the knight, and thanked him for keeping his son safe all this time. The knight recognized the warrior in the oddly dressed human, and clasped the forearm, careful not to squeeze too tight.

They spoke for some more time, before his son finally asked one last thing of his father: "Dad, would you like to come back with us?" 

The father and the daughter-in-law looked in suprise, while the knight smirked. His son, impulsive as ever, made the split-second call to extend an invitation. It was uncertain, what he would be there, what he could do. But he would be comfortable, at least. And he would be with family. He wouldn't be alone.

Mr. Doe thought for some time, before excusing himself. After some more time had passed, he returned, with a go-bag on his back, and a box of memories in his arms. He smiled, then quipped;

"Well, what're we standing around *here* for? Let's go!"

Son and knight gave an understanding laugh, while daughter sighed and spoke in foreign tongue. From the words, flowed electricity and blue fog, collecting before her and forging a portal, punching through fragile space-time. Daughter-in-law entered, then knight, then son with a parting warning about magical travel. The father, alone for a moment, looked around the small space, before following his son to his new home.
