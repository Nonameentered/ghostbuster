Zeeshez The Grand looked upon the lowly mortal, who stared at their prowess in awe. The djinn sneered to themselves; seeing the dirty clothes, the mismatched belongings, the wobbly cart filled with trash. Surely, this man only held nasty, greedy wishes in his heart. Such was his breed. Nonetheless, this rank man was his master, and was thus entitled to his three wishes.

**"You have awakened I, Zeeshez The Grand, mortal!"** The djinn towered over the man, reminding  their master of their supreme power. **"Make your wishes three!"**

The man, after some time, seemed to gather themselves. "Wow, a real life genie? You're really a genie?"

Zeeshez gave an annoyed scowl. **"It is *djinn*, mortal. And yes, I am a djinn. Now make your wishes."**

"Oh," the man nodded in apology, "I apologize, Mr. Zeeshez. I didn't mean to insult you, sir. Now, three wishes, huh? Gotta think about that..."

Zeeshez found this man's vernacular to be strange. Despite the fact that he was the master here, he was strangely civil. They marked it up to ignorance, as well as their show of power working.

"Oh, I know! I wish Ms. Parkins' bakery would real famous, and make her a lot of money! Ms. Parkins is a kind soul, and she always makes sure that the leftover bread gets handed out to us homeless folk. She even makes us soup on Sundays. I'd probably died on these streets a long time, if it weren't for her kindness."

Zeeshez found the wish interesting. He wished for wishes; not for himself, but for one of those who was kind to him. And not of immediate riches, nor immediate fame, but for one to roll into the other. They thought for a moment, before snapping their fingers, proclaiming, **"It will be done. Your next wish?"**

"I wish Jimmy would get better!" The man nodded, as if approving his own wish. "Jimmy's real kind folk, and he was in a war, see. Soldier type. Thought he was doing good by his country, and by those of the other country. But, yeah, Jimmy got blown up by an IED on patrol, took out both his legs and gave him a real bad case of the PTSD. Boy deserves at least a new pair of legs and some therapy, if not even better."

Once again, a wish for another. Someone he knew as kind, and given a bad hand in the midst of their life. A bad hand, perpetuated by a broken system. Zeeshez reasoned that the man was selfish in his own way, asking for repayments to those who were kind to him. **"It will be done. Next?"**

"Hm, a third wish..." The man thought deeply, before smiling and nodding again. "Ah, I wish that that Officer Washington got that promotion he's been wanting. He deserves it. Doesn't beat me. Treats me like a person. Sure, he'll shoo me away out of areas I'm not supposed to be, but he takes the time to talk to me. Buys me coffee, every now and then."

The djinn gave a nod, snapping once more. **"It will be done. Farewell...kind mortal."** With the final wish given, the ghostly chains disappeared; and, after a satisfied breath, so too did the djinn, off to seek vengeance on the bloodline of those who trapped him.

The next day, a Sunday, a large news story broke. Recorded by anonymous individuals, it showed a half-dozen police officers smashing tables and faces alike, from what appeared to be a improvised soup line. A middle-aged hearty woman, identified as Ms. Patricia Perkins, of Perkin' Pastries, was badly beat; whose only crime was not having a permit for her weekly soup line, and undeserving of the pain inflicted. Even more so, another officer; identified as Officer Julius Washington, beat to within an inch of his life for protecting those he could and calling out the immoral actions of the others. And though only an afterthought in the days passing, a proir Sargent James Jameson; not badly beat, but his necessary wheelchair smashed to smithereens.

For each, from their pain came fame, and from misfortune, came fortune. For Ms. Perkins, the unfair treatment of such a kind woman, only trying to do good in a dreary world, brought an uproar of of support. Donations poured in, to pay for her medical bills, and to support her Sunday soup line. And, for those who were uncertain of their direct financial support, they found certainly in giving their transactional support, buying and reporting on the best pastries in the city. By the end of the year, Ms. Perkins was able to open a second location, and solidify her giving by starting a nonprofit, and opening a proper soup kitchen and shelter. Her business found great growth over the years, and even had to change the name of her company from "Ms." to "Mrs.".

For the former Sargent, Jimmy, he likewise found a turning of luck. As it turned out, Sargent Jameson wasn't just a soldier, he was a *well decorated* soldier. While it was initially only a new wheelchair and a roof over his head, he was eventually given mental treatment pro Bono, and an advanced robotics company asked and donated a new pair of advanced prosthetics. He accepted, and used the platform as a starting point to push change; real change, for the people. It lead him into a life of politics, and quite the popular one as well. He was equivocally a moderate, straddling the political party lines, but was unafraid and often stepped on toes in the name of the common good. He made great strides in improving the mental health accessibility of the nation, increasing the budget for veterans, and aid for and humane treatment of the homeless.

For Officer Washington, he awoke to his wife and children, sobbing in thankfulness for his life, and rage for those who hurt him. He too, was both thankful and angry, but his anger did not transcend into vengefulness until he was notified that he was fired, and that his insurance would no longer be covering his expenses due to it. He went public with everything he knew, and everything he had seen. The most recent event brought an influx of money, donated in the name of his healing. But everything else *rocked* the city, the news reaching the eyes and ears of the state government for how high and heinous the crimes of the department. He hid nothing, and concerned citizens on both sides of the political aisle settled their differences, temporarily, to protect him and his family. He testified, and though it took a year and much time and stress, the accused were found guilty, and were imprisoned for their crimes. Utilizing the well-fought moment, with help from his newfound friends Jimmy and Ms. Perkins, and numerous supporters, he demanded change and implementation of limits for police, while widening the support structure to include separate crisis councilors and the like. Eventually, these changes were made, and supported; and the very man giving a voice to it was given the role of the police Chief of the City, where he served happily until his retirement.

The three found friends also found another common bond; one who was always kind, and understanding. A lowly homeless man, old and grey, unknowingly bringing them their fame and fortune, enabling them to bring so much change. No, to them, he was a kind man dealt a bad hand, with a chipper attitude the whole time. While the three would find their lives becoming exponentially busier each year, they always found or made time every year, once a year, to meet. And always at the same place.

The singular, simple grave of the singular death of the event.
