"What do you mean, 'no'?"

My doppelganger stared at me, conviction in their voice. "I will not return to the Old World. I will stay here, as you."

I give a deep inhale in, then release the breath slowly. This would be... problematic. We could not be both in this world, as me. Even if I wasn't weirded out by it, which I was, it would be too complicated. Someone would find out; and honestly, they would probably think that I was the odd one out. The shapechanger matched my image in this world perfectly; about average in every way, if a bit portly. I, the true me, even outside of the armor and arms I wore, had changed through my time. I looked older; I felt it too. Scars of battle graced my body, which had become stronger and toned through training and combat. In truth, the false me looked more akin to me than I was now.

"Okay. *Why* don't you want to return?"

The shapechanger looked confused at my questioning. Not so much to the question, itself, but rather the fact that I was questioning in the first place. "Because I am a monster, in the Old World. I am hunted for what I am. Only through the 'grace' of the Goddess was I put here. A place where I am allowed to belong, to not be hunted. I *like* it here. I will not leave."

I sigh. They were correct, of course. It was one of the many things I tried to fix in my time there. From hygiene to racism, there was a lot wrong in that world. Some of it was understandable, with the end of the world. And I did not have nearly enough time to truly fix anything. But I was at least able to plant the seeds. I can at least give them that much.

"In my time there, I was able to plant the seeds of freedom. They have only begun to set in, but you could help tend them. I have friends, who can help."

The doppelganger thinks for a minute, contemplating, before answering. "No. Even with freedom, with friends, I like it *here*." He motions to the television, the couch, my collection of retro games. "Here is filled with so much imagination, so much *fun*."

I sigh again. I understand, in a lot of ways. It is one reason I wished to come back; to family, to friends, to my games. I think, for a bit. The problem still stands; they can't be *me*. They can't be themselves, either, as shapechangers simply don't exist in my world.

That being said, they don't necessarily have to *leave*.

"I'll cut you a deal. We, obviously, can't exist here, at the same time. I must be me, and you can't be me, not forever. But I need an explanation to explain, well..." I motion to the difference between the me's. "This. Help out, and I'll let you stay. Keep a roof over your head, help you fit in. Give you a new life, a new identity." I offered a hand, before temporarily pulling back. "Of course, I'll still expect you to help pay the rent."

The shapechanger thought for a moment, before smiling and taking the hand, shaking it vigorously. "Yes! Yes, this is acceptable. I agree to your terms."

Agreement made, I shed my armor and plug in two controllers to one of the consoles. I sit down, offering the second controller to the shapechanger. "C'mon, this game is *way* more fun with two players."
