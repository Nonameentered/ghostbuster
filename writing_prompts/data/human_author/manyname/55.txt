The woman banged at the door, screaming for help. She pleaded for entrance, for safety. She knew it would only be a matter of time before she was found. Every minute, every moment, mattered; every second she was out the open was a second closer to death.

Finally, the door opened, and an old man answered. Again, she began to plead, but the man simply ushered her in before she could get a word in. "No use standin' out in th' cold, come in an' warm yeself by th' fire." The woman made haste inside, and did as suggested. The bottom floor was simple, but homey. A simple fireplace, with a modest rug and rocking chair. A wood stove of black iron, with a metal coffee maker a top. A china cabinet, with an assortment of dishes certainly not made of china. The man hobbled with a limp over the stove, pouring out two cups of coffee, grabbed two blankets, and returned; handing one of each to the woman.

"Thank you, sir."

The man wave the thanks away, as he limped to the rocking chair. "No need fer thanks," he groaned as he sat down. "Jus' doing me job, is all." He gave a sip and sigh, wrapping his blanket over his legs.

There was a silence, for a minute, with nothing but the crackling fire and creaking chair making a sound inside; the howling winds and battering rains outside muffled into a lulling sensation. The woman calmed some, between warmth of fire and drink. The coffee was even decent, for a cowboy brew. Looking to her relative saviour, she noted that the old, greying man, kind as he may have been, would be no match for her agressor.

"Sir, can you hide me? There is someone after me, and I can't let them find me. I can pay you! Just, please..."

She was interrupted by the old man, in a matter-of-fact kind of way. "No need, fer cash nor hidin'. Yer perfectly safe here, lass. Ain't no man, nor woman, nor devil, nor god that won't find ya here 'less ya wan' em to."  He packed and lit up a pipe while she digested the information.

"What...what do you mean?"

The man took a puff from the pipe before answering. "I mean what I say. Ye ain't going to be found, so long as ye stay here. An' ye can stay fer long as ye like. All I ask is ye help out 'round here, so long as ye do. These ol' bones ain't what they used to be."

"But...what if they come looking for me here..."

"They won't." Another puff, before clarifying. "Rather they *can't*. Completely hidden, this place is, to all their manner of ilk."

"Hidden?" The woman asked, in confusion. "Isn't this a lighthouse?"

The man had a chuckle; obviously, this was not the first time he's heard this question. "Aye, lass, 'tis a lighthouse. This here be no *ordinary* lighthouse, though. She be a blessed lighthouse, hidden to all eye 'cept those in great need. Those in danger an' peril. Like yerself."

The woman gave the old man an indredulous look, to which he gave no mind. Surely, she thought, this man is senile, falling to ill health of the mind from old age. "What, you mean to tell me this lighthouse is *magic*?"

"*Aye*." The old man stated, with no hesitation. He truly believed in the supposed magic of this place. Though he did give a knowing smile. "Then 'gain, I suppose ye wouldn't believe that from th' mouth of an ol' kook." He groaned as he stood up, giving a moment to stretch his back before motioning her to follow. "Come 'long, I'll show ye to a room."

Climbing the stairs to the second floor, she found a simple dining room and kitchen, with a larger wood stove with cooking implements atop it, with a small sink, cabinet, and fridge gracing near it. In the center, a large table, with a dozen or so mismatched chairs surrounding. Simple, plain, but cozy nonetheless.

Climbing up, to the third floor and beyond, was just the stairway against the outer wall and a central spire, with doors all along it. They walked for a long time, before she realized the were at the entrance to the top of the lighthouse. The timing didn't make sense for their pace; this lighthouse was tall, and the old man slow, but it felt like hours passed. Like they had climbed double the true height of the lighthouse. Maybe, she thinks, it is just anxiousness from being chased. A sense of time dilation, perhaps.

While she still wasn't convinced of the magic of this place, she was at least convinced that the old man was a kind soul. If those after her would search here, he would keep her secreted away. They came to the room, right near the top of the lighthouse. By her approximation, it couldn't have been more seven feet long or so, judging by the angle of the stairs and outer walls. But, it was a place to sleep, to rest. She had ran far, and fear exhausted her. She entered the offered room, thanked the man, and then closed door, locking it. She found a light switch, and turned it on.

The room, again simple and homey, was as large as the bottom floor had been. Simple amenities were provided; a bed, a small desk and chair, a dresser of simple clothes her size. A simple rug graced the floor, and the air chilly enough to be perfect for blanketed sleep, bit not so cold to cause a shiver. A smaller black iron stove, with kettle and low embers; a private bathroom, small, but welcome.

The woman, after some moments, gave up on trying to understand her surroundings, and found sleep more peaceful than she'd found in years instead.
