**Open Mike Night, Every Night**

*(A poetpunk attempt)*

There was once upon    
A time    
Where the law said    
Limerick and rhyme
Was not totally    
Required    
Nor need not be    
Inspired    
Nor have either meter    
Or lines.

Such times as those    
Have passed,    
And it really is    
Quite ass    
For by the threat of    
The noose
Or your head    
Coming loose    
You must count each word    
To the last.

Now we...
