Sir Pentious was nearing his wit's end, feeling the beration of Her Royal Highness. The Princess complained of her shakles, complained of the way he carried her, complained of the hardtack and provisions, complained of the lack of amenities in his humble cart. Through mantra, and reverence, these were things he could ride through. He had saved many a noble before; and all nobles complained the same. Her last remark, however, dug deep into his ego, his pride, and sparked his short fuse.

"I don't need your protection."

The scoff was what really set him seeing red. The insolence. The *nerve*. He could have died, and several times, nearly did, in his quest to rescue her.

He silently slowed the cart to a stop. Slowly disembark off of his steed. He ignored her inquisitive complaints as he moved to the rear of the cart, grabbing Her Royal Highness and yanking her out. He was careful enough not to shove her into the dirt, but pushed her some paces away, before tossing a sheathed sword in her direction.

**"Then prove it."**

He removed his blade from his side, locking the sheath. While this was a time for violence, it was no time for blood. Only a lesson, at most.

Her Royal Highness only got a confused "what" out before being forced to block the incoming blow. Then another. And another. Slow attacks, but purposeful and strong. She attempted to reason with her new agressor, but violence was the only language the Paladin spoke, now. 

She understood the picture, and after deflecting another blow, took an offensive stance. The next attack; parry, riposte. Smaller attacks, aiming for vital points, forcing the Paladin to block, opening new avenues of attack. Forced block, swing. Parry, riposte. 

Through several minutes of back-and-forth combat, tension from Sir Pentious gave way to a thin smile of surprise. **"I see that I am mistaken in your abilities. You have been trained in the blade."**

"Yes, and I am quite good at it too, thank you very much." 

Sir Pentious smiled. 

**"Very well then."**

The blows from the Paladin became more complex, adding finnese into the brute strength. It was enough to put the Princess on her toes, back on the defensive, but not enough to deter her attacks. They parleyed for several minutes more, before the smile became a laugh. **"A Royal, able to withstand the might of a Paladin! Color me impressed, Your Highness."**

The Princess couldn't help but to give a smile. "Get the picture yet? Still think I need a protector?" To accent her point, she lunged for a vital area, a weakness in the armor.

To her surprise, she hit; not due to aim, but the Paladin leaned into the attack, *allowing* it. As he did, his offhand rammed straight into her stomach, now unprotected. The Princess keeled over, coughing and dry heaving in pain, as her blade dropped. The Paladin gave a prayer in a foreign language, before smiling and offering a hand to the Princess.

**"No,"** He stated, a chuckle on his voice. 

**"What you need is experience."**
