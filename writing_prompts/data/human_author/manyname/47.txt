I am, once again, in The Room.

An enclosed hallway, with six elevator doors. Six doors that only lead to The Room. A hundred floors each, which only lead to The Room.

Time has no meaning, here, in the Room. Has it been weeks? Months? Years? I know not. I can only try each elevator, each level, and hope and pray it is not The Room.

But it is *always* The Room.

I have tried everything; making marks in the walls, notations and scraps of clothing, using defecation. But every time the door opens, it is only The Room.

I do not know what kind of God places one in a place as horrendous as this. I do not know what I have done to deserve being here. I have pleaded, and begged, and cursed. But it is only my voice, echoing.

Echoing in The Room.

But now, I am excited, and fearful, and curious, and afraid. One of the elevators, in the middle, is ringing through the floors. Someone is coming. I make my way to the opposite elevator. My hair is on end; who could this be? Another person, to share in this torment? God, come to apologize? The Devil, come to make this place worse? I step inside, holding the door open, but ready to have it close.

*Bing*

The elevator approaches, floor by floor. I stand, ready for what might come.

*Bing*

I am nervous; even if this another person, what do I say? 

*Bing*

Maybe...maybe I should just leave. Maybe it is better to *not* know what approaches...

*Bing*

No! No, I must know! Even if it's the Devil himself, it's something *different*! *Something* will have changed!

*Bing*

Yes, I will stand ready, friend or foe.

*Bing*

...why does the elevator seem slower?

*Bing* 

No matter. I have been patient this long, I can be patient again.

*Bing*

Almost...

*Ding*

The doors open, and I allow mine to slam shut. There is only a brief moment where I see the other in the elevator, and it is human reaction that saves me from  death. It is a human in form; but it is no human. It is flesh and bone, blood and head and digits, but there is no face. There is no hair. 

Only holes.

Holes, leading into nothingness, innumerable and uncountable. They are evershifting, smaller into larger, and larger into smaller. As it moves, for the quick moment of movement I see, it *doesn't*. It simply stands still, and, a blink later, it is closer. In the moment, I hear what sounds like an eternal inhale. I slam the furthest level from here, putting as much distance between it and me. 

My heart is pounding in my throat, and my stomach threatens to dump it's contents. I am afraid, but I am safe. But then, I hear that dreadful sound:

*Bing*
