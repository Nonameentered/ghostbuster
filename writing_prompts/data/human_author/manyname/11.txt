**Permafrost and Thawing Hearts**

*(A frostpunk attempt)*

Between the bundling of clothes, the howling winds, and the chattering of their teeth, the Visitor hadn't heard the calls of the guards, muffled through their own bundled mouths.

The crack of a gunshot, though, cut through the winds, gathering the Visitor's attention. He stopped, placing his mittened hands in the air. He saw as one of the guards made motions to toss something, so he tossed both pack and rifle into the snow before them. Two guards made their way to the Visitor, collecting both pack and rifle.

"Forgive us, stranger," one guard said, motioning to follow. "But we must be careful, in these times. Come melt some snow, and tell your tale."

The Visitor nodded in understanding, following the guards carefully. Once inside the first set of doors, he came to a room with more guards, laying about and chatting before a central iron stove.

"You two, search the pack. Come, stranger, sit. Why have you trekked through such conditions?"

The Visitor sat, as instructed, and told their tale as they warmed by the fire. They told that they were part of a colony, once. One of religious zealotry, where coal and oil are king. A finite resource, with a need for intense labor. Slave-like conditions; with a promise of those who work hard to achieve greater freedom, only for those bars to set higher each time. The Visitor knew that they needed to escape, to seek a new home. One not reliant on finite sources. 

They gave some short tales of their travels, of near-death experiences and tales of great towns alike. But they could never sit still; something always pushed them to continue on, to transverse the Great Snows. To always be a Visitor.

So, in the guise of searching for more places of coal and oil, they left.

The guard nodded, seemingly content with the answer. "Well, stranger, there might be a place for you here, then. As you can see, we do use our fair share of fire. But we have only a modest need. Come, let me show you something."

The Visitor's pack was given back, along with their rifle, and the two entered past the wall, walking the moderate distance from the walls to the central area, the architecture of which the Visitor recognized as something pre-Freezing. Instead of black plumes of coal, thick clouds of white steam arose from the building.

"The pre-Freezing peoples called it 'geothermal'," shouted the guard over the winds. "Only the Technicians know the true way it works, but so long as the water flows, and the machines work, and the Earth gives off Her heat, we are never left wanting in the cold!"

The Visitor smiled. Perhaps, these people's hospitality willing, they would be a Visitor no longer.
