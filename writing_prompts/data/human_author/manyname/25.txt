I am am the Lorax,   
I speak for the trees;    
But you know who I am,    
And I'm done saying please.

I gave you a chance,    
I gave you good warning,    
I taught of ecological balance,    
And vile global warming.

And did you listen? Oh no!    
Most certainly not!    
You'd rather have gold,    
And let the world rot!

I won't let it happen,    
I won't let you win.    
I give you one final warning,    
So you better listen:

My name is the Lorax,    
I speak for the trees,    
And if you fucking touch them,    
I'll break your fucking knees.
