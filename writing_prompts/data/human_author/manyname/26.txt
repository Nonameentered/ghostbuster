"I... I'm sorry, sir?"

The lecture hall was silent, with the exception of my words, and the Professor's responses. I had asked what I thought was an innocent question; instead, it seemed, I asked something akin to a stupid one.

The Professor responded, a calm rage in his voice. "Well, *obviously* you must think yourself a *genius* in that line of questioning. Or, you are a clown, looking to ask foolish questions to distract. Either way, I will not tolerate such attitude."

Still standing, now a bit embarrassed, I continue. "I don't believe myself either, sir, nor of that attitude. I simply had a question, sir, to which I desired an answer. I apologize if it was not appropriate for this lecture."

"Appropriate for my lecture?" The Professor scoffed, distain in his voice. "Such a question is not appropriate for this *school*. Every young mage knows how the Aether works, and how we draw mana from it. This school teaches you how to use that mana, to form spells and effects of magic. And this simple fact I am telling you this means you are unfit for my class, in one form or another." He then looked back to the chalkboard, giving a dismissive wave. "Remove yourself from my classroom."

I continue to stand, but now tears well at the edges of my eyes, as my face burns a bright red in embarrassment. I can feel the eyes on me, and I can hear the snickers of what would have been my fellow classmates. I am silent, trying to form words past the angry lump in my throat, but the Professor beats me to it.

"What, are you deaf and dumb? Remove yourself at once!"

I lose myself. In anger, in embarrassment, in hurt pride; I do the only thing I can do:

I sing.

I sing the anthem of my people, a proud and defiant tune. Telling the tales of not heroes, but of the common people; of our resilience and hardiness against our foes. Proud as the tune is, I cannot help but to do so angrily, singing in the tone of revolutionaries. 

As I do so, the temperature in the room rises, rising to match my heated temper. My fellow classmates begin to freak out, as the temperature raises past uncomfortable into painful. Before it can raise any higher, the Professor whips out his wand, and mutters an incantation my way, erasing my mouth.

"How did you do that?" The Professor is dumbfounded shaking his head. "Impossible. What did you do? What tricks have you used?"

He then removed his incantation, allowing me to speak. "I do not know, sir. That's why I'm here. To my knowledge, I have no tricks. I simply sing, or dance, or recite; and things happen. The feelings I have well within me, and cause miraculous things. Magic, I believe."

"*Feelings?* The are no *feelings*, in magic; you don't *emote* magic!"

"I do, sir."

There was a long silence, of him staring at me, and I staring defiantly back. I didn't spell it out for him, as he was smart enough to see that he was wrong. That I was something different, something he'd never seen before. Finally, he broke the silence, with a sigh.

"We will speak after the lecture, and I will answer your questions then. I see now that you are a...special exception."

It wasn't an apology, but it would do, for now.
