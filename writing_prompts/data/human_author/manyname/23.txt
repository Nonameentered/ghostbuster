"I don't *care* that they've hired precogs. You said you're the best, now rob that fucking bank!"

I shook my head, both in refusal and in incredulity. "*I* care that they've hired precogs! Do you know what precogs do? They look into the future! They see events *before* they unfold! We'd be walking into police custody!"

The Boss was obviously displeased, but it was hard to tell if he was pissed because I was saying 'no', or just misplacing anger at the new information we'd learned only a few days before the heist. He took a few moments to collect himself, before sighing. "I have been planning this heist for years. I'm not giving up. There has to be *something* we can do."

I give a similar sigh, seeing that Boss is at least willing to come to reason. "Technically? Yes. Feasibly? No. You *could* kill the precogs, using that as both a distraction and a workaround. But, A, the vault for the precogs is *way* more protected than the bank's normal vault, and, B, in that event, I'm out. I'm a *thief*, not a *murderer*."

There was silence at the table; while there were a few killers there, they were in silent agreeance that there should be *minimal* bloodshed. It continued to stay silent for some time, as we thought.

"What about confusion?" I looked up to Cueball, with his shaved head and muscular stature. His glasses reflected some of the low light. "I mean, precogs gotta hook up to a machine to focus their abilities, or something like that. Why not just disable that machine? I *might* be able to hack it, assuming I can get the right info."

We were in agreeance it was a better plan, though still had major issues. There was no way that there were schematics for the machines anywhere on the 'net. Getting that info would cost the fortune we were going to steal; and that was even assuming that we could find an intercept point, all within a very small window of opportunity.

Silence fell over us again, and a certain depressing mood falling over us. At least, until, Care Bear spoke up.

"Uh, I might have an idea."

There was some silence as the table looked over to the scrawny youngster, the only one of us taking this job for a wholesome reason; to help keep up with med payments for his mom. We silently urged him to speak up.

"Uh, well, we could *not* have a plan."

We looked to each other, not understanding.

"I-I mean...precogs see, like, the most probable futures. And, uh, there's usually, like, only a few in a basket. So, there's, um, only so much they can see. So, if we each have our *own* plans, solo, we can overwhelm them. They...they won't know what's real. They'll, uh, probably call it an error, maybe."

The Boss broke our silence. "That's a good *theory*, Care Bear, but how do you know that?"

Care Bear swore under his breath, before answering. "My mom is a precog. Uncontrollable, and, uh, only up to five seconds max. The...the meds help her control it. But she worked for a precog corp, in the early days of it, and she told me about some of it."

There was more silence, before Boss started laughing. 

"Well boys, you heard the man! Time use your heads for once, you gotta make your own plans this time!"
