J waited anxiously as the officer behind him walked up to the car. As soon as he did, J presented his identification and license; to his surprise, though, the officer refused to take them.

"Naw, son, I ain't looking to do paperwork today. Jus' want to make sure a stranger to these parts understands somethin' most common folk don't know about our little town of Duncanville, here."

The officer's tone was kind, if thickly accented, though it didn't do anything to tame J's anxiety. J knew how this worked, and he knew that kindness means nothing, and he may very well be facing down cuffs if he wasn't careful. "Am I being detained, officer?"

"What?" The police officer looked confused for a moment, before recognizing the nervous tone. "Oh, right. Naw, you ain't being detained, son. And naw, you ain't gotta answer any questions I got for ya. And yes, you'll be free to go, just as soon as you tell you one thing: there ain't no demon in Duncanville, even though there is."

J's mouth opened to ask something, before closing, and then opening to ask a single question. "What?"

The officer gave a knowing chuckle, before responding with a question of his own. "You jus' passin' through, or makin' your home here?"

J paused, considering how to answer, or if even to. He did consider how the man had been quite kind so far, and such information wasn't exactly bound to set him off. "Moving here, sir."

The officer shook his head with a chuckle and a smile. "Well, then, I apologize for my rudeness! I'm Sheriff Smith. Glad to be seein' folks move out our way, it's always nice to have new neighbors." 

J introduced himself, though only in the barest amount as to not be rude. While he wasn't sure of the Sheriff's intentions, he knew enough that this man certainly wasn't like the city PD.

The Sheriff seemed satisfied, or at least  understanding, and continued. "So, like I was sayin', a friendly tip for a new neighbor: there ain't no demon in Duncanville. You'll meet Bob, he's kind soul, but he is a demon. Just, he's supposin' to look like a human, y'see. And we ain't got the heart to tell him it ain't working out too well." He looked up with a smile, nodding to further up the road. "In fact, there he is now. Jus' act like he's any other man."

J looked down the road, and immediately gained a sense of fear and confusion. Jogging down the road was a humaniod, with deep red skin, and yellow reptile-like eyes. J would have supposed a bad sunburn and a distinct sense of style; that is, had it not been for the pair of curling horns and thin tail presenting itself.

**"Morning, Sheriff."**

"Ah, g'morning, Bob! Out for a morning run?"

**"Yes. I enjoy feeling the cool rush of non-burning air in my lungs."**

"Yup, I'll bet this good ol' mountain air is much better than in Arizona, that's for sure."

**"Indeed. Are you making an arrest?"**

The Sheriff laughed, shaking his head. "Naw, thought I saw a taillight out. Turns out, though, this young man's moving in to Duncanville. W're'all gonna have a brand new neighbor in town!"

Bob leaned through the passenger seat side window, awkwardly placing his whole torso through the slot to extend a hand to shake. **"Pleasure to make your acquaintance, neighbor."**

With the demon leaning in so close, J could smell a subtle hint of brimstone, and feel an unattural heat off of the hellish creature. The voice, so close, had a low growl underneath it, and J swore he heard the damning whispers of oblivion intertwined. He remained in his facilities enough to not scream, nor run; but his body was gripped by fear, and disallowed home to move nor to speak.

The Sheriff interceded before the demon could notice the fearful J. "Come now, Bob, don't scare off our new neighbor. J here is one a' them city-slickers, he ain't used to friendliness from strangers all up-close and personal-like."

**"Oh."** Bob removed himself from the car, momentarily getting his horns stuck, before squatting to look in through the window. **"My apologies, Neighbor J. I remember how it was when I first moved in. Things are very, very different here."**

J merely nodded with a false smile.

**"I will be continuing my run. Farewell for now, J; Sheriff."**

The Sheriff tipped his hat, and J nodded again. Content, the demon ran off.

Once Bob was out of earshot, the Sheriff spoke to J. "Guess you see what I mean, now. Bob means well, he just bit strange is all. On account of bein' a demon and such. I'm sure you got some questions, so how's about we mosey on o'er to Duncan's Diner? Seems like you could use a little breakfast an' coffee in ya. My treat."

J nodded in agreement, starting to wonder what the hell he had stumbled into.
