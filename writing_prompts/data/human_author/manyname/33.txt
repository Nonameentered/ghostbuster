"I can't believe it! You played us like a fiddle!"

The Emperor looked down from throne on the party, a bored stare piercing through them. The speaker, and defacto leader, in the paladin; armor scuffed but battle, and a panting breath of emotion and physical effort. Shortly behind the holy warrior, wearing scarred expressions, was their party; a musical chairs of races and classes of professions, working together to find gold and glory.

The Emperor, for a moment, thought about continuing to toy with the party, to lead them on. Pretend he had *no idea* what they were talking about. Let them explain for themselves, and he play innocent. How was he to know that the 'ruthless bandits plaguing his Empire' was a humble town of peaceful folk?

But he tired of this game. It was too *dull*. There was no intrigue. No challenge. These simple, foolish adventurers lacked the collective brainpower to even *attempt* enlivening this game.

Instead, the Emperor sighed.

**"Please. Fiddles are a delicate instrument, requiring finesse and years of training. Requiring as much thought and planning as innate and aquired skill. No; you, dear adventurers, I have played for the kazoos that you are."**

The Emperor stood from his throne, and approached the party, as they chewed on the meaning of his words. He took his steps slowly, intentionally, to give them the required time to do so. 

"You *dare* call us simpletons? We, the chosen of the Holy Order?"

The Emperor gave a low chuckle, the laugh filling the room with a taunting malice; only interrupted by the the slow click of each step.

**"If you were truly the Chosen, then you are now abandoned. The Gods will not save you here, nor will they listen to such malicious characters as yourselves."**

The steady, slow steps began to ring with a slightly different kind of click, like blades rasping against the marble floor. The Emperor continued only allowing a pause for reflection, but not enough for rebuttal.

**"You have spilled innocent blood, in the service of greed and wrath, in the name of the Gods. You have forsaken your oaths; and those amongst you who have no such oaths, you have made yourselves an enemy to Good. Aye, I did order you to clear out the bandits. But only after you had shed your blood, you had had your fill of violence, did you notice your mistake; that these people were no bandits at all. You had no deductive power, no reasoning; only violence, and greed."**

The party was in a mixture of horror and anger. Some, presumably the smartest of this group, realized either the truth of His words, or the very real danger they were in, without the protection of the Gods. The more simple were angry at these truths, and ready to fight. The Emperor doubted that they would give an entertaining struggle, but anything was better than the display previously given.

The clicks grew into thuds, as the clothes ripped and tore off the growing body; the human facade being dropped for the Emperor's true form. Scale rubbed against scale, and marble began sizzle from droplets of acidic spittle. Wings erupted, black as midnight; smothering the light and enveloping the party in shadow.

**"Now, then, I have another order for you."**

Though there was no muscle to smile, it could be heard on the Emperor's words.

**"Entertain me."**
