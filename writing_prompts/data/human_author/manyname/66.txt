My adversary is not as cunning as he thinks he is. The wine in my goblet is a brackish red, rather than the vibrant red of usual wines. It smells off, as though it is beginning to spoil. They eyes me, constantly, waiting for my sips, waiting for my death. Poison, no doubt. I make a small show of my inspection, and take a small sip.

I know not of what poison this ne'er-do-well has used; but, despite the initial off notes, it has *improved* its flavor. Robust, but not too dry. Sweet, but not sickeningly so. A hint of blackcurrant and floral notes dance in the back of my tongue. I cannot help but to take a larger sip in suprise. I think, for a moment, lingering in the flavor, before a thought enters my head. I call over the bartender.

"Yes, Syr?"

I motion to the simple goblet in my hand, and of the bottle it came from. "I regret to inform you that this bottle is beginning to spoil."

The barkeep genuinely shocked, and apologizes. "I am terriblely sorry, Syr!"

"No," I say, shaking my head. "There is no need for apologies. Accidents do happen. I mearly wished to inform you, so that you might check your stocks." I give a bit of a sigh. 

The barkeep squirmed a little; the thought of word of bad wine would certainly be bad for business. "Well, would like me to bring you another bottle, Syr? On the house, of course!"

I think for a moment, before nodding. "Yes, that would be splendid. I thank you for your understanding and for the gift."

The bartender relaxed with a sigh of relief, before heading into the back to check stock and to procure another bottle. In the meantime, I sip on my wine, a smile on my face as I do so. I scan through the crowd, until I see my adversary. I raise the glass in his direction with a wink, then finish my glass. I pour another glass, before taking bottle and glass in his direction.

He is shaken, in fear, and anger, and in confusion. By the look on his face, this was a potent poison. I should be dead, apparently. He glances around, but it would be too obvious to bolt now. I smile and approach.

"Hail, friendly stranger! I hope you do not mind me taking a seat at your table?"

Again, stuck in the bounds of semi-polite society, trapped by social conventions he half-nods his approval. He is annoyed, and fearful. Angry, but unable to unleash his temper.

This was almost as delicious as the wine.

"I couldn't help but see you glance in my direction, friend," I laugh. "I suppose you have seen something you have liked, yes?"

The adversary stammers, unsure of how to respond. Never, appearently, been put into a situation like this before. Awkward, adorable. Socially uncertain.

Delicious.

"Have no shame, friend. No *Oath of Chastity* binds me."

The adversary is once again confused, before eyes widen in recognition. I pride myself on not being too obvious, but being this close, he can tell that I am a Holy Warrior. That his poison would have never worked in the first place, not while I am blessed by my God. His sources must be bad, if they did not tell him. "Y-you're a Paladin?"

"Ooh, a smart cookie!" My voice lower in volume. "Now, normally, I would have my vengeance, in honorable combat, er cetra; but that *additive* you used was just too good, so I'll give you a chance." I hear him audibly gulp. 

Wonderous.

"Show me what it was, and get me some more, yeah?"
