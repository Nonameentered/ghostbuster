I am five minutes old. Born, crying, into the world. A lucky chance of the dice; I am born into a world privilege, where I will not go hungry. Where I will not want for anything. I will be comfortable. I will be more free than most like me, five minutes old.

I am five minutes away from death. I do not know the full latitude of time, in the moment, but I know death is near. My wealth has rotted away, both literally and figuratively. Boats and cars need people to fix them, to maintain what I cannot. Infrastructure crumbles away, irradiated and destroyed. Holdings in the electronic space have been wiped away, the devastating airblast of EMP dragging humans back to the Stone Age. Paper money and gold is worthless, in a world with no economy. The worst of all is, I am alone.

In the beginning, the loneliness bred anger; I had no support, no one to talk to, no one to help me. By the time I had found myself into acceptance, that I was alone, I had time to reflect. On my actions, both on a personal scale, and the scale of the world. It is only now, that I realize, that this is, in part, my fault.

I did not push the buttons of mutually assured destruction, but I did influence the leaders who did. I did not directly torch forests for land, but I did encourage it. I did not personally punch a whole into our atmosphere, bit I did quash those who could fix it. I did not keep people away from accelerating in society, but I did abuse them.

All in the name of *profit*.

Profit, now, is useless. Power, now, is useless. Forgiveness, now, is unattainable.

So here I lay, wading into irradiated waters. One last pleasure before I die, one last feeling of water before I am condemned to a place with none. I sing, poorly, of the songs I knew, before I am forced into a gnashing of teeth. Feel the cold shiver in my body, before I am consumed by flames eternally.

And, in the fashion I so deserve; I die like my fellow Man. Irradiated, and sick. Heaving, and unable to breathe. Poor, and ragged. 

And then, it is the end of the Age of Life.
