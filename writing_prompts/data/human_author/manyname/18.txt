**Party Never Stopped**

*(A discopunk attempt)*

Maude was at his limit. He was not jivin', he was not feeling the groove, and he most certainly, absolutely, pos-o-tively, did *not* feel funky.

Thankfully, he had cocaine.

In a beautiful, sniffing, snorting instant; all his fears washed away, his fatigue eased, and he was feeling *groovy*. He knew exactly what he was, who he was, and what he wanted; he was the party king, the king of the party, and he wanted to party! Maude couldn't believe that, once upon a time, some space cadets of Congress wanted to ban the stuff! What kind of putz wants to go war on drugs?

Maude knew exactly what to do: he needed to find himself his fab friend with the good vibes, find themselves a slammin' boogie joint, and find a foxy mama to take a ride in the shaggin' wagon.

Maude would have done just that too. Only problem was, that foxy mama worked for the Cartel, and the cartel was none too happy at the amount of weight Maude slung. Or, rather, snorted on their dime. The bad dude went from casanova to jive-talkin' real quick, but the Cartel ain't copacetic with freeloaders. Instead of sleeping with a stone fox, Maude ended up sleeping with the fishes.

Bummer.
