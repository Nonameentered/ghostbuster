A knock at the door brought the attention of the parents; mother cradling child, and father looking with protective fear. He picked up a sickle, his only protective weapon, and approaches cautiously. 

"Who goes there?"

"Only an old woman, Child. An old woman seeking help, with the promise of a gift."

The returning voice sounded like it's answer; a deep, croaking feminine voice, caked from the damage of age. Through the door, the father could hear the haggard breathing, steady but loud. As he opened the door slowly, he saw exactly as he heard; an old woman, covered in furs and rags, with a knarled cane supporting the haunched frame. He looked around to ensure that she was alone, before carefully ushering her into the shared hovel. "Inside quickly, Mhamó."

Once inside, the old woman greeted the mother with child, ensuring to keep a cautious distance from the nervous duo. Once the father ensured no tailing the old woman, he spoke to her. "We do not have much, Mhamó, but we can offer some soup. A place to stay, if you need it, though I would not stay long."

"Very kind of you, Child. But I do not come for food, or shelter. I come for a different kind of help, with a promise of a gift."

"What would you ask of us, Mhamó?"

"Your child carries the Flare." She held up a calming hand as the two stiffened up at her words. "Worry not, I am not here to whisk them away, nor do terrible things to them. Much the opposite. I wish to put blessings upon your child, at the cost of syphoning some of the Flare for my own power. In a sense, you could say I wish to be the child's *God* mother."

The old crone chuckled, as if at a pun.

"But draining the Flare would kill our child. I will not be tricked by...whatever you are, Mhamó."

The crone sighed, before whispering in a beautiful language neither mortal understood. It sounded like the babbling brooks, the croaking oaks, the low howl of the winds. As she spoke, the hovel croaked and groaned as a flower weaved it's way through the floorboards, the flower seemingly closing and coalescing into a fruit, going through the seasons in a few short seconds. The crone offered the fruit as she continued.

"What I *am*, Child, is Gaia. And I do not take you for fools, nor do I intend to take your child's life. Indeed, I wish to *extend* their life, through the syphoning of the Flare. *Syphon*, not drain. Such a temperament of the Flare will allow your child to live a much longer life, a much happier life. And I will bless them, and you as well. You will never lack in your survival needs. Your farm will be fruitful, the forests will be filled with plenty, and the waters will be clean and clear."

"And what, Gaia, do you gain from this?"

Gaia chuckled knowingly. "Power, Child. While I control much, many have abandoned me. There is a loss in faith, in me. Even though I do not *need* the faith of my Children, it hurts. And, it is my hope, with the power I syphon from the Flare, I can bring more Children back to faith."

The two looked to each other, before nodding in agreement. "We would wish to see our child live a long and fruitful life. We accept your offer, Gaia."

"Please, call me Mamó, makes me feel included. Now, introduce me to my godchild."
