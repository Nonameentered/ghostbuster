**What A Savings**

*(A Steampunk attempt)*

"Something wrong, A$$L1cker69?"

The voice sent a jolt up AL's spine, snapping him back into the real world momentarily.

"Oh, hey, IHasArms. I'm fine."

"Are you sure? I've only been seeing you online for 12 hours at a time."

AL gave a sigh. "Yeah, I'm okay. I'm just getting ready for the upcoming Sale, Gaben be praised."

"Mm, Gaben be praised. You going for a firesale?"

"Yeah, I'm almost out of Steam funds for the month, so I'm going to try and make the best of it. Gonna stay up through the whole Sale, Gaben willing."

"Got a plan?"

AL thought for a moment. "Well, I'll probably pick up Portal V first, should be a fun time, but short, so I can probably refund it in 12 hours max. Then, maybe Half-Life 2.95; that one I think will take 36 hours, if the leaks are anything to go by. There's a couple indie games that I've got my eye on, which should be a couple hours each. Then I'll wrap up with Team Fortress 3; if I hate it, I'll refund it, and if I love it, then no harm no foul. How about you, got any Sale plans?"

"Nah, just going to pick up some stuff I've had my eye on." There was silence, for a moment, before IHas spoke again. "Hey, uh, did you hear about SnakeMilk?"

"No, did he return IRL.exe?"

"Worse...he...he's flossing, now."

"What?!"

"Yeah. Guess he installed Fortnite, to try and 'convince the heathens to return to Lord Gaben', but they corrupted him."

There was a long silence, as AL fought back tears. First, he lost his best friend to the LoL scourge. Then his girlfriend from Canada swapped sides...blasted be the Corruptor, Epic Games. And now this!

"I...I think I need some time. Alone."

"Of course, I understand. Lord Gaben bless you with sales, friend."

A$$L1cker69 could only give a affirmative sound, before closing the chat. He gave a deep sigh, uncertain how to deal with the deception that had been pulled upon him. His friend was worse than dead. His friend was a *Fortnite player*.

He decided to think of him as better dead, and went through the ritual. He downloaded that favorite game of SnakeMilk, *Angelic Family of Atonement*, to play in his honor.

And, Gaben be praised! It was 75% off.
