I am a lonely creature. 

In my culture, it is only proper for a mother or father to groom their child, or for mates to groom each other. Beyond this, mating, and combat, we have no need for physical contact. It is not allowed.

Many others, on the Intergalactic Fleet ship I crew, are similar in their cultures. Most of them are not nearly strict; many allow the clasps of arms in brotherhood, or of appendages in greeting, or a touching of antennae. Still even these touches are brief, never allowed to be prolonged with exception to their special few.

The exception to this is the Humans.

I was warned, in the Cross-Cultural training I was given, that Humans are social creatures of *touch*. They, too, clasp arms and shake appendages, and touch heads like antennae. But it is nearly always prolonged. In addition, they embrace one another, regardless of familial status or matehood. Some even hold a culture of placing their mouths on one another in a 'kiss', as *greetings* to one another. 

Though I deny it, I am envious of these Humans. They, who are so open, who can touch one another in bonds of friendship. Though I will admit that I may be envious for reasons outside of culture; it may be frustration as well. My mating seasons have been... difficult, to say the least, and I no longer have mother nor father to groom me. The only physical contact I have is combat training, and when I mimic the greetings of other races, as a show of cultural friendship.

I suppose that is excuse I use, when I allow my Human counterpart to touch me. 'Cultural exchange'. She has mentioned before that my fur looks soft, and that she would love to 'pet' me. That I remind her of an Earth creature, by the name of 'cat', a creature she once cared for. My sudden acceptance, after so many times of refusal, has her confused. She confirms I am okay with it, with my only request being secrecy. Xa'tal knows the last thing I need is something like this on my records.

So now we sit, with her excited to 'pet something fluffy again', and me uncertain in my decisions. But I have made my choice. I nod in approval, and allow her to 'pet'.

By the Nines, it is intoxicating.

It is...not exactly the same as grooming, though it is similar. There is no bonding like familial grooming, nor the romance of mate grooming. It is just...pleasure, pure and unadulterated. The digits of the Human find itches I knew not I had; the light pressure, the soft pull, simply *divine*. I have no other way to describe it. I was immediately lost to myself, acting in base emotion and pleasure. I made *sounds* I did not know I could. 'Purring', I believe she called it.

Nine Divines, I beg of your forgiveness. I am certain I have made a mistake. I am addicted, to this petting. I could certainly never get enough.

But by Your Names, if this is wrong, I do not wish to be right.
