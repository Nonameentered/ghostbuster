I stare, dumbfounded, for a minute. The Queen of our "Fair Land", the Mistress of Massacre, the Madam of Mayhem, the Beautiful Bitch with the Iron Grip; asking me why people rebel to her rule. Surely, this was her idea of a joke, a reason to gloat before me, before my throat meets the blade.

I spit at her feet, a mixture of saliva and blood and mucus. "I will not indulge you in your perverse pleasures. I will die with the honor of knowing that your reign nears it's end; that the people are no longer blind to your deceptions."

The Queen moved away from the spittle, a look of disgust on her face, before looking me with a look of confusion and exhaustion. "*Please*," she begged, "Tell me *why* you rebel. Have I not been kind, been merciful, in the times before treason?"

I laugh, half in suprise, and half for effect. "Kind? *Merciful?* I never took you as the jesting type." I move as close as chains will allow, and stare at her with my good eye. "Unless, of course, your *kindness* is stealing away the grains and gold of the people, leaving them to starve and to bolster the riches of the Nobles. Unless *mercy* is raping and slaughtering villages, of salting fields. In which case, I fear to see what your *compassion* takes form as."

The Queen appears to be in shock, with a look of horror across her face. A farce, it must be, before switching scripts to gloat. Or perhaps she was soft in the head. Either way, I could not stop myself from my tirade, not in the last hours before my death.

"Do you think us fools, your *Majesty*? That we, the common people, would not question, nor figure out your illusions? That this 'war' of yours was nothing but a way to feed your greed and power, a farce to feed Nobility? No." I spit again; both for effect, and to get the blood from bleeding gums out of my mouth. " No, we may be poor, and uneducated, but we are no fools. You can burn our books, our property, our bodies; but for every book burnt, two children are taught it's lessons. For each home burnt, two more soldiers are raised. For each man burnt, a generation raises to the call. It is too late, for you, and your Royal Court. The people know, and they demand the power for the crown broken, given to the people. The vast treasury emptied of stolen wealth, and returned. A promise of protection for the people, from invaders from within."

The Queen's face distorts from horror, into denial, then into anger. Her voice is falsely calm, though wavering in emotion. "And there is no way to return to peace? What you say is true?"

"No, there will be no peace, until the last of the Nobles are slain. And what I say is true, on my pregnant wife's grave."

The Queen's anger rises, with...tears? Welling, in her eyes? She paces for some minutes, before returning. "If what you say is true, then I am a gullible fool who has been made scapegoat. I trusted in my Court, even when things did not seem...right. Perhaps complacency, perhaps pure foolishness, I know not. But if they have caused such harm to *my* people, under *my* name, it is my duty to see detractors punished and peace restored."

She then produces a keyring, finding the key to the door, opening it. She approaches me, getting within a foot of me. "I will free you, if you will allow me to fulfill this duty, and keep me alive to do so. I will break apart the powers of the Crown, dissolve the Nobility, and reinstate a government that gives powers and protections to the people. We can discuss what that will look like later. Do you accept?"

Now, I am dumbfounded by *sincerity*. I cannot think but this is a lie, or a last bid to save her own life, but their is an anger and sincerity in her voice that I have heard from all of my brothers of martyrdom. I pause for a moment, before shaking off the feeling. "If I am to believe *you*, that you are but a scapegoat to the Nobility, a puppet in their name, why would I accept that? And what makes you think I would or could keep you alive?

"Because I am, whether you like it or not, a wealth of political and governmental knowledge. Experience you would not have otherwise. Secondly, I may be a *gullible fool*, but I am not an *idiot*. If I try to turn around and dismantle the Nobility through the normal channels, they will merely raise the army and coup against me, placing another in my steady who will activately work *with* and *for* them. You, obviously, know more about this castle than any other, so I am certain that you know of secret passages and tunnels not known for hundreds of years, since their first construction."

I consider my options. While I was ready and willing to die a martyr, it didn't necessarily mean I *wished* to. That, and the Queen gave some good points; plus, even if she was lying, and was merely bidding for her life, she was putting herself in the Rebellion's hands. A trial can always be held, later.

I give an aggrevated sigh, before agreeing. "Fine. But do not expect lavish living, nor travel."

"I wouldn't have in the slightest."

"And I will be binding, gagging, and blindfolding you once we are clear of the castle walls."

"Seems smart, for security's sake."

"I can give no guarantees to how the Rebellion will react to you."

"All I ask is a fair consideration."

"You will likely be considered a prisoner, at best."

"Likely."

I give a final sigh. 

"Alright, unchain me. We will see how good your word is, your Majesty."
