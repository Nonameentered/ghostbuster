The Council had cast their votes, and it was unanimously agreed; the planet, Earth, must be investigated upon. The God of Earth had not shown their being in some time to the Council; no reports, no messengers, no harbingers of news. Whilst not strictly part of the Cosmic Law, it was customary to do so, and strange to not.

The first God to be sent, eons ago, told that the planet was nothing but a hunk of rock and magma, with no atmosphere and no way for Life. The Council, at the time, concluded to wait, and to continue the checks. The God of Earth was a New God, fresh blood in the cosmic space. Perhaps, they thought, it was taking more time than usual for the God to understand their powers.

The next God to be sent reported back better news; a Moon had been formed, and the beginnings of an atmosphere were there. Not enough for Life under the Grand Design, but it was beginning. The Council confirmed their last Judgement, and corfirmed the order to wait. Patience, after all, is a virtue.

The Next reported with grand, but concerning, news. Life; but not as the Grand Design dictated. Grand creatures of scales and teeth and maw. Uncountable creatures swimming in the blue waters. Even *more* uncountable, the creatures unseen. The Council decided on a Warning. Return to the Grand Design. Destroy anything that does not comply.

The God who issued the Warning, and returned afterwards, reported the task complete, albeit unorthodox. The God of Earth decided to comply by smashing another planetary body into Earth, to kill and choke and drive to extinction. Few on the Council voted to punish the God of Earth, but it did not stick. The Warning was complied with, there was no need for further intrusion at this time.

The next God, however, brought sobering news. Life, again, not as intended per the Grand Design. Worse still, flagrantly *against* the Grand Design. Creatures of greed and avirace, of destruction and death. Creatures who held power to change the landscape at their whims. Creatures who worked together *with only themselves* to steal away the resources of the planet for themselves, and hoard it away. The worst of all?

The God of Earth was nowhere to be found.

Instead, the God reported, were beings naming themselves Gods, most in the images of the horrible creatures. Hundreds of thousands of Deific Beings, claimed the Earth as their own. Death and Destruction and War, birthed by ways unknown and given power.

The Council fought for another eon, trying to decide on what to do. Destroy the planet? Place a permanent No-Contact Zone? Quarantine?

The Council did not come to a conclusion, as their arguments were interrupted by a strange harbinger, of clothes and metal and meat and glass. 

"Hello," It spoke, freely, in blatant blasphemy of the Grand Design, 

"I am a Human of Earth. I come in peace."
