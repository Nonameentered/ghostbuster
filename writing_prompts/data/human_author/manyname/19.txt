**Of Sand And Sun**

*(A desertpunk attempt)*

The traveler awoke, noting the sun no longer at its highest peak, and at the very start of its decent. They packed up their tent, took a long drink from their canteen, and continued on their path.

By the time the sun began to set, the traveler could see their destination in sight; an Oasis, lighting up the sands. They thanked the sun they had made it. As they stepped into the Oasis, they swore the sun had never gone down, as the neon of the Oasis blinded with fantastic color. The traveler wondered if it was true that the Oasis powered itself by stolen rays of sunshine and nicked gusts of wind.

The traveler found themselves entering a bar, modest in its size and appearance. They guessed there would be fair pricing and low chances of ruffians. As they entered, they were hailed by the bartender, who gave a nod to an empty seat.

"Setting suns and cool sands, friend. How many I help?"

The traveler sat as directed, and requested, "Water, please. Clean."

The bartender chuckled. "Do you insult me, friend? I only serve clean water here." He gave the traveler a quick look, before continuing. "Perhaps I might interest you in some ice?"

The traveler found themselves sucking in a breath. "You have *ice*?"

The bartender chuckled, obviously pleased. "Oh, yes, only the best for my customers. Assuming they can pay, of course."

"How?"

"Now, now, I can't go telling my trade secrets. Would you like some ice?"

The traveller thought for a moment, before deciding an answer. There may not be another chance for ice, so why not? "Okay. Will this be enough?"

They then produced a block from the bottom of their pack, to which the bartender's eyes widened. They took the block in their hands, confirming it's contents, then seeming to weigh something in their mind. He then sighs, taking up a knife with a smile, hacking off a small chunk. He weighs it before returning the block back, giving a warning as he does.

"I would be careful, friend. There are those out there who would kill for the salt off your back, much less a whole block."

The traveler nods, with an expression of sudden grim understanding. But the frown is turned into a look of quizzical look of interest, as a clear glass of water is brought out, with condescension forming on the glass. As the traveler picks up the glass, they gasp.

"It's cold!" They sip on the water, surprised and delighting in the feeling of cold water running down their throat. The relish in the moment, before sipping again. "It's...so much more than *hydrating*...it's..."

The bartender smiles. "It's *refreshing*, friend."
