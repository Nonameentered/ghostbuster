The months following our escape were... interesting.

The escape itself was straightforward, for the most part; the Queen had requested the guards vacate the immediate area so that she could have spoken privately with me. And her Majesty's intuition and information was not wasted on me; I did, indeed, know of the secreted tunnels and exits of the castle. An easy path to one of many hidden secrets, a path hidden within one of the cells themselves. The passages led to a secreted cove connected to the moat, flowing directly into the river. 

It was here, once the Queen was secure in the same boat I had used to infiltrate, that I kept one of my promises: I bound, gagged, and blindfolded her. To her favor, she did not complain, nor struggle; accepting her bonds willingly. Once I was certain of her inability to note her surroundings, I began to row. I led the Queen along the secret route; utilizing some of the diversionary paths in order to further obfuscate the true one. Once I felt sure in our security, I herded her to the Headquarters, hidden within the catacombs. 

A majority of our numbers heralded my arrival, with the opponent in tow, as a decisive victory; and many demanded blood, of her head, as so many had of our own. Half of them demanded *my* head when I refused, though I did do my best to keep their expectations in line. I bore the truth, and requested that she keep her life; a trial may be put upon her later. There was a disheartened, but compliant agreeance amongst the crowd. 

Then, I felt a slight nudge at my back, and a muffled request. I ungagged the Queen, who requested to speak. I thought it unwise, but she *insisted*.

"From the little I have heard, terrible things have been  in my name. It...would not be right to call you my people, as I have lost that right, regardless of my innocence in the actions taken *in* my name. I am in no position to make demands, and my requests are at your mercy; nonetheless, I ask of you: please, show me what they have done. Tell me of horrors you have seen. Show me the destruction they have wrought. Reveal the wounds, of person and land alike, to me. If I am to be a failed protector of the people, so much so that they should revolt, allow me to see and feel it with my own senses."

The Queen's speech was responded with a drone of shouts of anger. I, however, and a few within the crowd, denoted her demeanor. It was passionate, it seemed *real*. I still held skepticism, but did not vocalize it in either way.

It must have been several weeks in, when the Queen had run out of tears to cry. Our people, the men and women of the Rebellion, did do as she had requested; they told her the stories of their pain, of their memories. Of farms and homes, looted and burned to the ground. Of families and lovers torn apart. Of whole villages, slaughtered wholesale in cold blood. As a proof of the violence committed to the people, she was even brought out to one such village. The Queen did not eat nor speak for a full week, after that trip.

Mostly, I think it was a vocalization for the Rebellion, a way to shout and scream and cry at the one they saw as responsible. But I, and some others, noted the changes within the Queen. I, against my better judgement, even pitied her some. Still, it would have not prepared me for the day she joined us.

It had been another morning, when I had went to check on our prisoner of war; but she was standing against the bars, waiting. Her hair had been hastily and messily cut short, by a small piece of glass she had somehow secured. Her eyes were brimming with fury, her face full of determination. 

"Bring me some writing supplies, and I can secure you aid."

I was still skeptical, but intrigued. "How so?"

She showed her ring, the Royal Seal. "Like it or not, for the time being, I am still royalty. Which means I have connections to the other kingdoms. Some owe me favors, debts of which to be repaid. Others can be convinced; either through gold, or the wiles of womanly charm. Others, provoked for an opening."

"And you would do this, why?"

"Because it is what I *can* do, for the time being."

I spoke with the Leader, and the others of the Council; after some days of fighting, it was decided that we would utilize this avenue. Though, the Council was very strict; *all* messages would be read and approved by the Council.

Not that there was much for the Council to disagree with; the Queen, despite being self-determined as gulible, was cunning. The first letters, of calls of payments on debts, were straightforward; a simple request, with the seal of the Queen promising a forgiveness of debts for it's completion. Food, armor, weapons; secured. The next few letters, however, made me realize how dangerous the Queen could be, as a foe if not held back by favorable qualities. 

One was to a King of the North, who had long requested and pined for courtship with the Queen. The Queen utilized this quality, writing a letter of a forlorn maiden in need; taken advantage by her Noble Court, who had pulled the wool over her eyes! Oh, woe is her, forsaken by the Army, with only her brave, but *under equipped* and *undertrained* subjects to protect her! If only *someone* could help her...

Another; to the vain King of the South. The supposed enemy her armies were fighting, the War being waged against. She wrote a letter of anger, and betrayal. Betrayal, by her Court. How they tarnished the name of the good King, used his name to commit atrocities. That they tarnished his code of honor, seen in wars past. She would strike them down, if she could, but she was being usurped by the Nobles. Only her people shielded her now. That being said, with the army so focused on being an enemy to her own people, they certainly wouldn't be ready for an attack in *true* warfare...a strategic advantage, for sure.

When the letters began to pay off; for both the Rebellion and the Queen. When food arrived, we were given a reprieve from starvation, and she was given liberty to be outside of her cell; under watchful eyes, of course. When promised arms and armor arrived, we were given the true instruments of revolution, and the Queen's word was more believable. When the the Northmen came, our numbers were bolstered by men and training, and she joined our ranks as we learned the combative arts. When word of the Southmen attacks reached out ears, we were bolstered by the destruction to the army, and she was the first to give direction and tactics to the battle map.

Not all believed that this was not out of self-interest, but even here, the Queen's cunning shone through, as even her detractors heeded her words and accepted her help, if only for the time being. And thus, the Council formed a huddled plan around the battle map, ready for the final battle for our freedom, for us as the people.
