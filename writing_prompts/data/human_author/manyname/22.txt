**In Hot Water**

*(A coffeepunk attempt)*

Joe Folgers V awoke, as he usually did; groggy, cranky, with a pounding headache and a sharp pain in his chest. The smell of his auto-brewer awoke him, inciting his body to rise from his laying position, rubbing his eyes.

"Nothing a cup o' Joe won't fix," he muttered instinctively, pouring a cup of the brew.

Joe took his cup to the window, looking out to his modest view of New Cuppa. It was a particularly clear day; he supposed that he had woken up before the morning rush, so the steam wasn't fogging up the city. He could see the various barista bars, coffee shops, and cafes, down to their subtle gentrified designs. Off in the distance, only slightly obscured, he could see green fields of monocrops. Soy, if he remembered right. He would never say it aloud, least he be heard, but he preferred this view.

"Prettier than a perky cuppa brew."

After finishing his first cup, he poured a second cup, and made his way to the bathroom for his morning ritual. During his shower, he made a mental note to pick up some more scrub on his way home later than night; he was almost out. Maybe he could nab some espresso scrub, it was a lot nicer than the Chock Full O' Nuts kind. Way smaller grind, and didn't scratch his skin as much.

Once finished, he dressed himself with his uniform; black on black, with a simple green apron emplazened with his employer's symbol and name. He considered himself lucky, such a big name meant he could sneak himself a soy latte every now and then. Just so long as he didn't get caught; he didn't want to end up like his father, forced to work the Great Bean Farms on the Equator.

He worked his sixteen hour shift without complaint; how could he? He only got two blisters on his feet today! Nonetheless, he felt a heaviness in his heart, perhaps needing another cup. He didn't get the chance to take his coffee break today.

"Hey, Beano!

Joe looked up, looking to the speaker. There, a strange man stood, motioning to him to come over. Joe was almost certain this was a Bad Brew, but he caught an entirely new smell. Something strange, and exotic.

"What's brewing, Joe?"

The Bad Brew took a quick look around, before quietly asking, "Need something a little different, tonight?"

"What do you mean?"

"I mean, Beano, something other than coffee." The Bad Brew flipped around his apron, revealing a number of pockets. "I'm talking tea, Beano, I'm talking that cocoa. I'm talking real-deal mix-ins for your Joe."

Joe shook his head, in shock. He'd heard of these things, these highly illicit substances. He was better than this. He was better.

But that smell, that *intoxicating* smell. Something foreign to his senses; something just on the verge of an assult to his nose, in a pleasant way. *Something* stuck his feet to the ground, and wouldn't let him leave. He had to know what it was.

"Yeah, I know that look," the Bad Brew laughed. "What you want, Beano? I got Earl Grey, I got green tea, I got black tea, I got herbal tea; I got one-hundred-percent grade-A Ecuadorian cocoa; I got *real* cow's milk, I got spice blends to put a bit of punch in your Joe."

As the Bad Brew spoke, he presented his options; ending with a cloth bag eminating the glorious, mysterious smell. Joe nodded to it. "I want...that. Whatever it is."

The Bad Brew was taken aback, waving it. "This is some strong stuff, Beano. You sure?"

"Yes."

"Alright, alright. 100 Beans, and I'll even throw in a hundred mils of real cow's milk. Y'know, first time customer gift." They made their transaction, and the Bad Brew chuckled as they flipped their apron back around.

"Enjoy the Pumpkin Spice, Beano."
