There was silence in the ruined living room, as mother and father sat across from the nanny, of whom looked tired, beaten, and bruised; her clothes as tattered as they couches the trio sat on. 

"You fed them sweets."

The annoyed nanny responded. "Yes. I did. The children were very good, and I felt they deserved a treat." She gave a frustrated sigh. "A warning would have been nice."

"We did warn you," the mother responded, "we told you not to feed them sweets."

"Yes, but *I* thought you were just being strict!" Snapped back the nanny, patience long past gone. "Just as any other nanny might! Just as any other snooty, cold, *inordinately rich* parents might say! You *might've* mentioned that your children turn into *literal monsters*!"

"You wouldn't have believed us," responded the father.

The nanny opened her mouth to snap back, but recognized the truth in those words. At best, she would have taken the words for figurative meaning, the children "becoming monsters" in means of hyperactivity, not in reality. She sighed; while she was angry, and impatient, she would not succumb to falsehoods. 

"That...is a fair point. Still, you might have told me *something*. The children were diabetic, or allergic to many things in sweets. *Something.*"

There was silence, again. The faces on the parents showed a bit of regret, and seemed to know better than to push the issue. They, too, would succumb to falsehoods, nor would deny that they could have done better.

Finally, the silence was finally broken by the mother. "I...suppose we should give you the full truth, then."

The couple looked at each other and gave simultaneous sighs. They both gave a nod to each other, before they began to transform themselves. The mother's hair grew long, covering her face and most of her body, the long flowy locks twisting and twitching, as if alive itself. The father grew three times his size, his skin growing a blood red in it's hue, with two horns growing from his head, growing maw and claw in tandem. The nanny might've been scared, and truthfully she was; but the exhaustion of the events earlier only allowed her to state:

"Well, that certainly explains a lot."

The two monsters were surprised, looking to each other, then the nanny. "You...are not terrified?"

"I am, but I am exhausted. I have discovered monsters truly exist; what am I to do? Run? No, either you will eat me, or you are the kind people I met who just so happen to be monsters."

The two nodded, impressed. Not many mortal humans would be so calm, even if the only reason she remained calm was exhaustion. "Please, allow us to help you with your wounds. And then take some time for yourself. If you are willing, we would love to keep you as our nanny."

The nanny thought for a moment; the pay *was* good, much better than any other of the rich folks she nannied for before. And the children, outside of this discovery of being literal monsters, had been nothing but absolute angels.

"Very well. I suppose I'll make sure another nanny doesn't have to learn the hard way."
