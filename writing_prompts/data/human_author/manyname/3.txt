"I don't understand why you're so upset. Some people would literally *kill* to be resurrected."

The undead turned to the sorcerer, cursing the circle of protection surrounding it. "I was in *Heaven*, Mage. Endless paradise."

"Ah." The mage sounded a bit pitiful, realizing the source of the undead's anger. "Well, I only need you for a little bit, and then I can release your soul, so it's not *so* bad."

The remark made the undead lunge, smashing harmlessly against the glowing aether cage. It growled for some minutes, clawing at the cage, looking for some weakness. It was appearent that the undead had no intentions of playing nice.

"C'mon, it's not so bad. *Sure*, you've gotta do some labor in the land of the living, for like a month, tops. But then you get to go back. Y'know, to heaven, or whatever."

The undead stopped, suddenly, eyes staring daggers into the mage. "Do you antagonize me, Mage? Is this entertaining to you? To crush the dreams of a believer? To deny the faithful their reward?"

"Chill, man...or wo-man? Again, it's not so bad. I'll send you back, one month tops. Promise."

The undead's eyes full of daggers turned into bewilderment, before turning to depression. "You...don't know. You don't even know the consequences of your actions." The undead went limp, only noted animated by a continued depressed mutter. "I have been summoned by a fool. An imbicile. Why? What God would ever allow this to happen? Oh, Maria...never again will I see you...because of the whims of a fool."

"Okay, firstly: hurtful. Secondly, you're being really dramatic."

The undead shot upright, staring daggers once again. "I am *dramatic* because you have ripped me from heaven, from my loving family, from my brothers, from my beloved wife; and you have cursed my soul to the Seven Hells! I, faithful believer, a man of good faith, a protector of the church! You have cursed me, Mage! Cursed!"

It was the Mage's turn to look confused. "What? No, I just brought you back..."

"What is the name of the spell, Mage?"

"Uh, Maledictionem Mortis Reddidit?"

"*The Curse of Death Returned*, Mage. *The Curse*."

The Mage looked on with wide eyes, realizing the implications. "Oh." He then began skimming through his spell book, eyes wider with each spell. *"Oh."*

The two were silent for some time, until the mage slammed the book shut with a loud noise. "Okay, change of plans! I'm realizing now that I've, uh, *fucked up*. *Real bad*. So, how's about you help me fix some things, and I'll help you figure out a way out of your curse! Sound good?"

"Ripping your heart out through your ass like the heretic you are sounds good right about now."

"I'll settle for 'not killing me'."

The mage whispered some arcane words, apparently memorized, wrapping their hand in the arcane bindings of a promise made. He then offered the hand to the undead, dropping a small portion of the protective circle.

"Plus, I'm the only one who can help you right now."

The undead groaned, before taking the hand. As it did, the arcane strings wrapped and twisted over the enclasped hands, painlessly burning the words of promise into the flesh of two before disappearing.

"Very well, Mage. On my honor as a protector of the faithful, as a warrior of the Goddess of Light, I will not kill you for the horrible misdeeds you have done, and will give you a chance to right the wrongs you have made."

The two gave a final shake of hands, as the Mage turned back to their books. "Okay, now that we've settled that, let's--"

**THWACK**

The Mage found the sudden painful sweetness of unconsciousness as undead fist met living flesh.

"I won't kill you," the undead chuckled, watching the heretic fall to the ground. "But that doesn't mean I won't make your life miserable."
