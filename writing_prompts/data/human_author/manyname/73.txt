I am one of a dozen.

Children, soon to be adults, who have been secreted away. Away from prying eyes and ears, away from governmental control. Legally, we are all dead. Some subject to 'horrible accidents', some 'terrible murders'. A joke, now, as there is no greater murder than restricting the very air we breathe. Here, others who are older, but still like us, teach us. Teach us of the Old Days, of the Many Collapses, of Life and Liberty, of Pursuits of Happiness. Things our government has long since abandoned, they say.

I am one of a hundred.

I am older, now. Wiser. We have pushed for a preservation of the Preverse Texts; books of sciences, and math, of history long burned away. More knowledge for us. We also steal and create the things we see, replicate the Old Knowledge. We steal away bodies of Those Who Have Passed, blessed be their Pursuit, to practice removal. Removal of the Device, damned be its creators, for an insurance of Freedom.

I am one of a thousand.

The word of Law is vast, but the word of mouth is faster. Our numbers grow, due to beurcratic oversights. We are successful in the removal of the Device, damned be its creators, and our numbers are added by those who have truly, legally, died. They are mostly like us, angry, scared, wishing to learn the Old Knowledge, to return to the Old Days. Days long before our time. The others, unfortunately, must join Those Who Have Passed, blessed be their Pursuit.

I am one of hundreds of thousands.

A miscalculation on the sight of the Government. Too many are dying; not enough can pay for air, and even some who can kill dozens more to do so. The People, we hear, are begging, and pleading for reprieve. Higher wages, they ask. Healthcare, they ask. Removal of the Device, damned be its creators, they ask. Anything, just so they can live. All brought to naught, as the Congress is deaf, and Lady Liberty has been chained. 

I am one of a million.

Their miscalculation is our gain. Too many have died, and their precious Economy suffers. Even the Congress and Justices are pleading now, as they begin to join with Those Who Have Passed, blessed be their Pursuit. But no reprieve is given. Only Greed holds. We hold a Democratic Vote, and pray to the Founding Fathers; we pray for resolution, to return not the Old Days, but to Better Days. Return to a future the Founding Fathers would approve of.

I am one of a hundred million.

The Vote has passed, by the blessings of the Founding Fathers. There are none to stand in our way; with the latest Bill pushing the Military to pay for its own air, they have joined our ranks. It is time we stand up for Life, for Liberty, for the Pursuit of Happiness. 

Not for a few, but for all. 

Not for a select breed of people, but for all.

Not for a certain blood, nor for a certain love, nor for a certain god, but for all.

For the People, By the People, Of the People.

As the Founding Fathers intended.
