**When Everyone's Punk, No One Is**

*(A punkpunk attempt)*

"I dunno, man, I'm kind of worried about the leather market. Like, we're running out."

The shaved head teen looked to his mohawked friend, scoffing between puffs of a joint. "Nah, man, shit's secure. They're doing that research into that genetically modified leather, or whatever. Real leather, without the cow."

It was the Mohawk's turn to scoff. "Yeah, right. What do you think, Skinny?"

The two turned to their third compatriot, who sat on his skateboard, rolling it back and forth. He had his eyes closed, lost in thought. At least, until a rapping on his head brought him out of his trance.

"Earth to Skinny! Hello! C'mon, don't zonk out on us, man!"

"I'm not zonked, I'm thinking."

"Woof, it's dangerous when you think. What you thinking? Tag some barriers?"

"Nah. I was thinking...about my grandmas. I talked to them, recently." He accepted the passed joint, taking a puff before continuing. "I was talking to them about when they were young, about what they did as punks. It was...weird, I guess. I dunno." 

He took another puff, before continuing. "They invited me to the commune."

Both his friends scoffed, and laughed, before realizing that Skinny wasn't laughing with them. The bald one questioned, "Wait, are you actually thinking about it?"

Skinny didn't answer, but his silence spoke enough.

"Bro, no! We've been together for *years*! You can't break us apart now!"

Skinny held up his hands defensively. "I know, I know. I just...they had some points. And it was... enlightening? I dunno."

"What points?"

Skinny rocked for a second. "Well, punk, in their words, has 'always been about breaking away from the norms'. That's why my grandmas joined the commune, to 'break away from the bounds of capitalism '." He shook his head, with a half-smile. "Look, I'm not running away forever, right? I just...I want to see what they mean. I'll bet it's just a bunch of old geezer stuff, but it can't hurt to try. Only for like a month, tops. Plus, my old man hates my grandmas, and I hate my old man, so it's a great way to get at him."

His friend reluctantly nodded. "Alright, man. Just, before you run off, make sure you let us know, so we can let you off with a real banger, yeah?"

"Of course." He got up, slamming his foot down to leap the skateboard in his hands. "Hey, let's go ride this shit down the tallest hill we can till we break it, how 'bout it?"
