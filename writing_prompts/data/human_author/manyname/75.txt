**Greetings, mortal! Behold your wishes to me, for the price of your soul!**

I turn around in my chair, a look of apology and exasperation on my face. I look up to the towering figure of muscle and horns, who looks upon me for moment. Its face falls when it recognizes who I am.

**Oh. You again.**

"Yeah."

A sigh the fills the room with heat and brimstone, the figure pinching the bridge of it's nose. I do feel bad, a little bit. This is probably the thirtieth time this week.

**Latin homework?**

"Yeah."

Another sigh, this time interlaced with a growl of damned souls. The room temperature continues to rise some, as the beast looks down at me, no expectations in his black, soulless eyes.

**I'm guessing it's still a no on you wishing to be an expert in Latin?**

"Yeah."

A deep inhale in, before giving an exhale of smoke and flame. There is certainly aggregation on the red face, but it is cooled by a patience I can't explain or understand.

**Okay, fine. I'm just...gonna go back now.**

"Okay."

With some words that I vaguely recognize, he commands an incantation. An inversed pentagram of flame appears, scorching more lines into my carpet, of which I have given up trying to clean. The pentagon within reveals the literal Hellscape the creature is returning to, with a screaming of torment, and a gnashing of teeth. Once the beast makes its exit, I grab the fire extinguisher next to my desk, put out the flames, then return to my studies. 

Half an hour later, in the middle of my practice, I hear the warping of a gate, twisting with the screams of the damned. I can feel the presence behind me, who seems to take stock of the area, before proclaiming:

**Oh, God DAMMIT.**
