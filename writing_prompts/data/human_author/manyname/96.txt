I awaken, not in pain, as I would have imagined; but in light. *Am I dead?* I think, opening my eyes. *Is this heaven?*

If this is heaven; either the Christians were wrong, or God had a strange sense of style. The room, carved intricately of sandstone, hieroglyphics unworn from age. Stone braziers light the room in a warm glow, from which I can see a council of sorts surrounding me. 40 or so persons, with ancient jewelry and garbs; some even slightly inhuman, with heads like animals. They sit, staring, judging. Similarly, in front of me is a scale of gold, on which one side a feather sits; across from this, a large man, with the head of a jackal, stands, judging with canine eyes. Anubis, Judge of the Dead.

Despite my situation, I am calm. A mixture of the feeling of this place, suppressing emotions I would otherwise feel, and of training. No doors, no windows; no escape. No weapon, and these persons are not hostile. 

**Mortal, recite the 42 names of the Assessors of Maat.**

The voice comes from everywhere and nowhere, yet I can still tell that it is the jackal-headed one who beckons. I am spurred to speak. Snap to attention. Salute. "Corporal Daniel Smith, United States Army. I cannot execute the orders as given."

**Why?**

My voice is calm, clear. "I do not know the names of persons for which you ask. I cannot name them."

A murmur from the 42, speaking in some form of Arabic, I think. They deliberate for a moment, before seemingly coming to an agreement. A scroll of some sorts apperates before me, and l, though I know it is written in hieroglyphics, I understand the words they say.

**Renounce the 42 sins, so that we may see your heart.**

I nod, and begin to read. 

"I have not committed robbery without violence. I have not debauched the wife of any man. I have not debauched the wife of any man. I have not shut my ears to the words of truth. I have not worked witchcraft against the King. I have not carried away the khenfu cakes from the spirits of the dead. I have not snatched away the bread of the child, nor treated with contempt the god of my city. I have not slain the cattle belonging to the god."

I take the scroll, roll it up, and offer it before me. The speaking of the 42 picks up, before coming into a roar. Arguments, though I do not understand the words, break out. Eventually, a green-skinned man, looking between life and death, raises a hand, and all fall silent. He speaks to Anubis, who nods, and then speaks to me.

**Why have you not renounce the 42 sins?**

"I have renounced what is true."

**Then you are complicit of the rest?**

"I can neither confirm nor deny that statement."

More murmurs, then Anubis beckons, taking the scroll from my hands.

**Very well. Since we may only judge you on a portion of your sins, we will only judge you on an equivalent piece of your heart.**

Anubis reaches into my chest, and where I expect pain, I find a lightness instead. He pulls out a human heart, but it is dark and brackish in its blood. Barbed wire surrounds it, and its beat is slow and irregular.

**Which piece shall you choose?**

I take a moment to ponder before answering.

"The center. The core of my heart."

Anubis nods in understanding, then rips the heart in two. From it, a golden orb sits suspended, drowning the room in it's light. Anubis smiles, as if understanding, as he takes the orb, placing it on the end other end of the scale. A moment passes before the scale tips, the feather weighing heavier.

As another, some sort of scribe, write the results, an uproar starts again. This time, being thrown directly at me. Some are angry with me, I can tell, while others seem impressed. Anubis, I can tell, is wearing a smirk. 

Finally, the green one raises a hand, and all fall silent again. He speaks to Anubis, who then relays to me.

**Osiris has made his decision. You will not be fed to Ammit. You may enter the fields of Sekhet-Aaru. Well done, Corporal Daniel Smith, United States Army.**

I give another salute, before I realize I am alone. Stalks of wheat and barley surround me, my combat armor gone, replaced by white robes. My body and heart felt lighter than ever before, like the weight of the world released from me. In the distance, a simple hut, with people and laughter in the horizon.

No longer do I march, but now I walk, into eternity.
