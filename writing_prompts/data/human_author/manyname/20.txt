**Lock, Stock, and Six Dozen Barrels**

*(A gunpunk attempt)*

John Browning Moses VII stepped out of his place of  employment, stepping out to the balcony for a smoke. As he pulled out his cigarette, he looked over the city, smiling. It was a quiet night; means he could actually see the night sky. No smoke to get in the way of the view, and only a few shots ringing out from the occasional duel. He pulled out his flintlock pistol, unloading the shot. He then dry-fired, cursing as the flint cracked, spewing only a few sparks.

"Need a flint?"

John looked up with a chuckle, as his friend stepped outside. "Yeah, had a misfire. Mind lending me your piece, Klash?"

Klash smiled, lighting his cigarette first, then tossing the weapon to John. "Hard day of work?"

John nodded, before lighting his own cigarette. "Nah, I'm stamping today, so not too bad." He gave an exhale of smoke, feeling the burning ash and dilation of nicotine. "How's about you? Mill or stamp?"

Klash shook his head. "Delivery."

John gave a sharp inhale. "Yikes. Sixth round of Russian Roulette, eh?"

Klash shrugged. "Ah, it's not too bad. I was able to requisition some plates."

"Oh?" John took a drag of his cigarette, eyebrow cocked. "Boss is a tough nut to crack, how'd you manage that?"

"1911 to the back of the head, caught him while he was taking a piss." Klash laughed. "The bastard held his flesh-pistol with both hands!"

John scoffed, shaking his head. "Rookie mistake, surprised he made it to his position. Who's boss now?"

"Heckler, I think. Or maybe Koch, I forget."

"Eh, they'll probably zero in tomorrow. What you delivering?"

Klash shrugged again. "Some fancy new rifle for a Mr. Torgue. Some new player in the biz."

"Huh. Well, I probably should head back, otherwise the supervisor might pull out the big guns, and I only got level II armor."

"Yeah, yeah, I hear ya." Klash pulled the rifle from off his back, ensuring it loaded and ready for action. "Lock n' load, Jo."

John waved to his friend as his left, responding, "Lock n' load." He then took the last drag of his cigarette, put it out, reloaded his flintlock, and walked back into the shop.
