"Ladies, gentlemen," I spoke, speaking to the crowd gathered before me. The representatives of leaders of the gangs, looked cautiously to each other, all having the same thoughts. "I thank you all for coming here to neutral ground, so that I might give an answer to your bosses."

"You're all well aware that each of your prospective gangs, or mobs, or cartels, or whatever you wish to call yourselves has approached me to join. To be in your prospective war. For turf, or money, or revenge, or whatever. And you have been quite lucrative in your offers, and I am sure we could keep negotiating for a long, long time. But I'm tired of trying to keep you busy, so I'm just going to come straight forward with my deal: you leave me and my family alone, and I won't involve myself *at all* in your war."

There was a low murmur as the representatives wondered amongst themselves the conditions of my deal. I continued.

"To be clear, I won't be taking any of your money. I won't run jobs for any of you. I won't give any support to *any* of you. I won't report you, I won't involve myself in your affairs. I will, for any other purpose, be just another civilian, with the exception of your end of the bargain: you won't involve *me* or *my family* in your affairs. You won't harass us, or solicit us, or attempt to knowingly harm us."

There was a nervous unease amongst the representatives, until a single one spoke up. "And how can we be so certain you'll hold your end up?"

"For one, I haven't reported any of you, nor your bosses. I have had every opportunity to make a pretty penny reporting you all, of which I have chosen not to do specifically for this deal."

Another spoke up. "And what makes you think you can make us agree to your terms?"

"Because I will kill you all if you do not."

There was a clamoring for weapons as I continued.

"We all know your weapons are worthless on me. And you all know that I have the power to kill you all. And then your cohorts. And then your bosses. I have the power, singlehandedly, to dismantle all of your collective businesses. Through destruction and violence."

I paused, before adding:

"Please understand, I *don't* want that. I just want to live a peaceful life, where my family is safe. I don't care what you do, amongst yourselves. I dont care what your plans for this city, or country, or world is. I just want to live a happy, peaceful life."

"So, please: call your bosses. Let them know my terms. Get them to agree. Beg, and plead, if you must."
