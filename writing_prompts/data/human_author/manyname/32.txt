The screech startled me awake; and half the village, I suspected. It took a moment for my half-asleep brain to interpret, but I soon recognized that unholy scream. My familiar!

I bolted from my bed, making haste to my study, where the imp preferred to sleep. Surely, it could not have been a burglar or some other thief of the night; then it would be the screams of Men, and not of hellish yowling. It could've been those of the Mage's Guild, discovering my familiar for what he really was. Then again, I doubted they would take such extreme measures against me, even if that were the case.

I burst open the door, and quickly scan for my devil friend. I see him, in his bed; of loose pages and parchments, gathered into a sort of nest. Seeing me, his screech stops for a moment, before a howling bawl erupts.

"What is happening? Why change? No change! Bad change!"

Indeed, my impish partner has taken on a few characteristics that shock me. He is his same self, mostly; of cloven feet, and terrible maw, with small horns protruding from his head. But, floating above the horns, where there was nothing before, was now a red ring of light, glowing softly. Additionally, where there had been the wings of a bat upon his back, now lay wings more akin to a bird; black raven's wings, with white dove's feathers interspersed between the midnight black. In the soft glow, I noted another change; while maw and terrible tooth remained, the face of my familiar took on a softer, rounder tone, and the sharp teeth had straightened.

I had a hundred different questions, but I started with the most important ones.

"Are you hurt? Is there any pain?"

The imp sniffled, motioning to the mouth and wings.

"Small pain. Dull aches, now."

I knelt down to level with the imp, producing a dried leaf. "Chew on this, it will help ease the pain." He did as instructed, and I continued my questioning. "Did it hurt a lot? Is that why you yelled so loudly?"

The imp simply nodded, and continued to chew on the leaf.

I sighed, and patted the imp's head. The halo was an odd sensation; while it passed through my hand harmlessly, it did give the slightest of resistance, as though it were barely tethered to this world. Still, I did not note this aloud, and simply rubbed the base of his horns to help calm him.

We sat in relative silence for some time, before he spoke up.

"Why change?"

I thought for a few more moments, before smiling. "I'm not sure exactly, though I have a theory. You know how you, an imp, as a creature of Hell, can influence the nature of a person bound by them as a familiar?"

He nodded.

"Well, that very ritual binds you to the person, so who is not to say that the influence goes both ways?"

The imp's eyes go a bit wide at the thought. "Not possible! But...maybe?"

Unable to help myself, I teased him a bit.

"Who knows, maybe you're turning into a cherub!"

The devil gave a slight gag, not liking the thought. "No! Bad! No teasing!"

I laugh, and against his better judgement, so does he. I give him another leaf, and set him back in his nest, petting him until he falls asleep. I then yawn, and return to my own bed, smiling all the way.

The souls of the damned, it seems, are not unredeemable. They are able to be saved. I am uncertain as to how, nor how long it would take for more powerful demons, but it is not impossible.

Father can be saved.
