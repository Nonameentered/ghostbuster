I smile, weakly, and nod my understanding. I don't have a whole lot of choice in the matter, really; either I take the chance, and go to prison, or Joe here and his buddies are going to *drag* me to prison. That, and these boys underestimate me, so my chances are better than they seem.

Sure, all these men are two-hundred plus pounds of muscle, and I'm a bit scrawny, for my age. They're all seasoned fighters, and I've barely been in a scrap since childhood. But I've got cunning; while these men are no fools, they are not as clever as I. I have a chance, to win.

So we enter the ring; Joe taking to one side, and I the other. The gates are closed behind us, and the bell of battle rung. We circled each other for a moment, sizing each other up. He was looking confident in his choice. His pride swelled, as a smile formed, and he lowered his defense.

"I do pity you, some, and respect your choice of honor. For that, I'll give you the first shot."

I merely smiled back, shrugged, and said. "Okay, your funeral."

Before he could retort, I unholster.

**BANG**

The first shot staggers him back, a painful shot into the gut. Probably nonlethal, if he seeks medical attention soon. Unfortunately, he asked for *three* rounds.

**BANG**

With the second round, the crowd, who fell silent on the first, begins to riot and uproar. Some call for my head, for desecrating the honor of the ring. Others see as I do, and argue back; we never decided on what *kinds* of weapons we would fight with, and poor Joe *assumed* I'd go fisticuffs with him. Joe's boys try to pry their way to me and Joe, but are held back by the gate guards, defending the honor of the ring. Ironic.

I step forward to Joe, him taking haggard breaths and holding his stomach, keeping as much blood as he can within himself. I place the barrel against his head, taking a moment to reflect, and a moment for him to fear.

"Consider this a professional courtesy."

**BANG**

Round three finds it's way into Joe's shoulder, as I drop the weapon from his head. A caution, and a symbol. That a ne'er-do-well like me can still have morals; after all, he said he would *walk away*. Hard to do if he was dead. 

All three rounds finished, I reload and reholster, then whistle for the guards. They open the gate, letting Joe's men get to him. As well as every angry sonuvabitch, the ring of honor becoming an all-out brawl. Fisticuffs and improvised weapons; a chaos of violence. My finest work yet, if I do say so myself.

Battle won, I tip my hat to Joe, then disappear into the crowd.
