I am the Evil.

I am the fury of a hundred generations, the idol of revenge. I will raise your serfs against you, so that they may be kings; I will submit your kings into slavery. I will detroy the noble courts, and hand the scales to the slaves. All of Man shall be seen as equal under my eyes.

I am the Devil, the idol of secular thought. I will tear down your government of God, I will implement the heresy of math and science into your children. No man of God will hold positions of King, nor Judge, nor Noble. 

I am the Destroyer, the idol of eradication. I will melt down your gold, and smith a coin for each Man, so that you are all equal in value. I will nurture the wilds, so that they will grow and consume you. Women shall be set free, and taught maths and sciences, be given freedom of their bodies. Man shall love and lay with man, and woman with woman. I will destroy the traditional marriage by your God. There will be no distinction in Man; I will destroy the boundaries between man and woman. I will destroy your identities, break the boundaries of nations, and bring the world under my heel.

...why do you cheer, so?
