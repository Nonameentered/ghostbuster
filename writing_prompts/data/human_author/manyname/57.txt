Eezof the Grand shook his head before his Master, refusing the wish set before him, much to his Master's ire.

Eezof was not evil, nor was he benevolent. He granted wishes in the most straightforward and easiest ways, was all. He would not twist wishes purposefully, but would cut corners when he could. Wish for riches? Certainly, Master, here is all the gold, freshly teleported, from the Swiss National Bank. Wish for a new Ferrari? Absolutely, Master, direct from the dealer, gas and registration not included. Wish for loved ones to live again? Very well, Master, I hope you do not mind the smell of rotting flesh.

For the purposeful, and cunning, he would follow their orders as given. Those smart enough to specify *how* their wishes were to be interpreted. Cover through intricate systems, magically grant paperwork, even create items from thin air.

But only items. Things. *Non-living*. The closest Eezof would come to *living* was food, and generally preferred to just teleport the food anyway.

So when he heard his current Master's wish; "I wish for you, Eezof the Grand, to magically create for me the perfect human partner to be my other in hand of marriage", he had to refuse. His Master, of course, demanded to know why.

"Master," Eezof stated, "I will not *create life*. Such things, while not beyond my power, carry with them terrible consequences."

His Master, while not placated, was listening. "What kind of consequences?"

"To bring back life is novel, though trivial; reaching into the Afterlife for the soul to return. To *create* life, or, more accurately, to *create a soul*; such power threatens the balance of life and death. Further, a created soul has no ties, no boundaries, by life nor death. In essence, they would be immortal, and free to transverse as they please. Such a soul, created outside these bounds, would be one crafted of only magic, and would likely be even more powerful than I."

His Master fell silent, clearly thinking. A good thing, for Eezof, as it meant that his Master was understanding his words. At least, so he thought, until his Master gave a devious smile, and restated his wish:

"In that case, I wish for you, Eezof the Grand, to magically create for me the perfect *android* partner, every way human except for machine and code in place of flesh and soul, to be my other in hand of marriage."

Eezof gave a long sigh, and gave only a single comment before getting to work.

"Fuck you, Master."
