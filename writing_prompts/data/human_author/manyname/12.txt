**Faith, Trust, and a Whole Lotta Pixie Dust**

*(A faepunk attempt)*

The bones clattered as the door slowly opened, alerting the crooked crone to the entrant. "Can I help you, young man?"

The young human lad looked around nervously, closing the clattering door behind him. "Yeah, uh, I'm, uh, *looking for Granny*."

The crone gave a short, low cackle, rising from her rocking chair. Her very bones seemed to creak as she moved, approaching the lad. "You've found her, sonny. What can an old woman do for her *favorite* grandson?"

"Well, uh, Granny, I'm looking for something to help me through the woods."

The crone gave another low cackle. "Granny has a great deal of things to help you through the woods. Where are you going, and how do you want to get there?"

"I wanna fly to the Faelands."

A louder cackle. "Well, well. Sounds you would do well to talk to the dainty fairy folk." 

"I... already talked with them. They couldn't dust me enough."

"Mm, poor thing. Don't worry, Granny's got you covered."

The old crone took a small pouch from under her cloak, then opened it to reveal the sparkling powder to the lad. "Enough for you fly for a full day, I'd reckon. Don't use it all at once, sonny."

The lad grinned, palming the pouch, trading it for a small pouch of gold. The lad, content, made his way out. Once he was out of eyesight, he took a bit of the powder, snorting a bump off of his, the light golden glow growing along his body, outlining his shape. He felt lighter, as he began to levitate. 

Unfortunately, in that moment, FVPD turned a corner. The officer paused, the last click of the cloven hooves echoing in the alleyway. The two stared down, for a moment, before the satyr reached for his Apprehender, yelling, "FVPD! Drop the pouch!"

The lad, in the same moment, panicked, taking the pouch and inhaling deep from it. As the officer pulled, his Apprehender, the lad bolted, each step taking him higher up a flight of nonexistent stairs, running higher into the air.

"Fuck," the satyr swore, before pulling out his callstone. "Officer 24-7 requesting arial backup, got a duster going broom!"

Meanwhile, in the sky, the lad laughed, and inhaled the last of the pouch. He began to feel lightheaded, in the best of ways. So much so, that hel felt like his body was dragging him down. He didn't need his body, he'd fly away as a head!

On the ground, the officer noted the distinct splat of the body hitting earth. "Gaia." He sighed before speaking into his callstone again. "Officer 24-7, request change of backup. Duster went dullahan. Get me a banshee and a forensics crew."
