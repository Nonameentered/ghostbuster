I do not dream. 

I don't mean, "I don't dream often," I mean I *don't dream*. I *never have*. The very idea is foreign to me; the idea of falling to sleep, to temporarily awake in a fantastical realm, or a Hellscape, or even in remembrance of certain memories. Not in childhood, not in my teenage years, not now. I simply fall into the Little Death, and each morning, I awake.

You seem confused. Were you not aware?

Each night you die. Each night, every nap, every snooze; we die. Every single person, everywhere. We experience it. The Little Death. It is our free trial to The End; to Death eternal, wrapped in her cruel embrace. The difference is, you, and everyone else; your minds cannot handle it. The nothingness. Just ceasing to be. So you imagine, in the last moments of the Little Death, things. Dreams. Sometimes pleasant; sometimes, torturous. Mostly, boring; just *anything* to stave off the knowledge that, in the end, there is *nothing*.

I suppose, that is really the difference between you and I. To you, you've merely dreamed. To me? I have died. Hundreds of thousands of times. I do not fear the end. I do not fear Death. 

So tread carefully, friend.

Yes, you feel you are control. You have a gun, and I am unarmed. I have no training in martial arts, no training in combat. But I do not fear Death, fear the Nothingness. 

But you do.

And if I am walking into the Nothing, I'm doing my damnedest to take you with me.
