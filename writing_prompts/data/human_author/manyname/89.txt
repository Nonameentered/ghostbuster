The End.

...oh, you actually wish to hear the tale? Oh, forgive me, most people hear that part and walk away. Most do not wish to hear happy stories of Medusa, nor those ragging against the Gods.

What do I mean?

Well, to summarize a much different tale, Medusa was once a beautiful maiden. So beautiful, that Poseidon--yes, not Zeus, Poseidon--decided that He must lay with her. In a temple. To Athena. Needless to say, Athena was very unpleased, and cursed Medusa, now cursed into her current form of snakes for head and body.

Do not bother yourself on how I know these tales, just know that they are true!

Anyway, the tale you seek begins with a different woman, also unfairly punished by the Gods: Aurelia.

Yes, I *know* it is a common name, Aurelia was a common woman! She is only known, outside this tale, in a small village to the south as a woman of good craft, of excellent sewing. Nothing spectacular, but well in her craft. 

*Yes*, this is pertinent to the tale. Can you stop asking questions so that I may tell it?

Anyhow, this woman, Aurelia, sewer of a village to the south. She slighted Hades. How? By saving her father from the grips of death; by denying Hades another soul. You see, her father was befell by a great accident, and errant sythe by a slave sliced open her father's belly. The nearest doctor was in town, and would take far too long to arrive. But Aurelia, with her cunning and her skill, reasoned that she could save her father by stopping the bleeding. She ran to the house, grabbed needle and thread, and *sewed her father shut*. And you know what? *It* **worked**. She was able to save the life of her father, with needle and thread. 

Yes, *of course* he was examined by a doctor, and still had to stave off infection. But that's not important to the story. What did I say about interrupting?!

Where was I? Hades! Yes, her father, saved from the grips of Hades. As you can imagine, the God of Death was not pleased by having a mortal best him, and so cursed the woman with blindness, and stole her away from her home to the Meadow of Medusa. There, he reasoned, he would have his soul. Medusa, he postured, would do his dirty work.

And perhaps, had this been a common man, or a common citizen for that matter, that might have happened. But this was Aurelia; sweet, cunning Aurelia. Medusa, aware of a disturbance in her realm, investigated to find the woman, sobbing.

"Why have you come to my realm to mourn?" She yelled, attempting to scare away the mortal. "Begone! Lest I turn you to stone where you lay."

"Perhaps for the better," wailed Aurelia, "For I am cursed, unfairly, by Hades! Never again will I see the smiling face of my father, for He has ripped me away from my home! Never again will I see the shining sun, for He has cursed me to blindness! All for wishing to save my father's life!"

Medusa was stirred by the words she heard; remember, she, too, was once mortal, and was cursed by the the Gods for *Their* hubris. She felt her heart stir, in a way it had not in a long time. Her status shifted, as she slithered her way to the wailing woman. "I, too, was unfairly cursed. Come, follow my voice; I will take you to a place where you may drink of clean water and rest." 

Aurelia, struck by the fatigue of mourning, accepted the Gorgon's invitation. There, in the lair of Medusa, she slept and drank of clean water, and ate of stale bread and of wine. She spoke with the Gorgon, learning more of her host, and shared more of her life with the snake-haired beauty. The two became fast friends, though Medusa always requested that they never touch, nor explained her physical conditions.

Such secrecy was not to last, however. Sweet and cunning Aurelia was also curious, you see. She heard sounds of hissing and slithering in the night, and the breaths of her host mimicked the same. In one night, her curiousity was too much, and she silently made her way to Medusa, to lay hands and feel her friend. To feel the touch of another being. She knew not what to expect, bit was pleasantly surprised to find the cool touch of scales.

This, of course, awoke Medusa from her slumber, who shifted away, and sadly said, "You now know the truth. I gather you will leave, now, once shock has worn away."

"Leave?" Replied Aurelia, "Why would I leave one who has been so kind to me? Because you are cursed with features of the snake?" Aurelia shook her head in denial. "Never! You are my friend, Medusa, and no features of yours will change that."

"You do not find my body with disgust?"

"Never!" Aurelia boldly stated. "Snakes are a friend to the farmer, a vital part of the lands we live! Ever since I was a small girl I was taught this, and ever since I have found fascination in the snake!" Aurelia shook her head, and reached out to the voice of her friend. "Please, Medusa, please forgive me for touching you when you said I could not. Now I will ask. Please, Medusa, my dearest friend, would you allow me to feel you, so that I may know the face to the voice I trust most?"

Medusa, shocked by her friend's statements, complied. She allowed the warm mortal hands to feel the body she had been cursed with, to feel the still-beautiful face, to pet the nest of snakes which replaced her hair. It was in this moment that the bonds of love were forged, heated by the coals of trust, the fires of passion, striking the iron of friendship into something greater.

What? Well, yes I suppose I would have some guesses as to how they would bed, but that is not important; what *is* important is the moral, which is this: *love is stronger than any curse, any failing, and any God*.

Who am I, to know such a tale? Ah, I am but a humble servant to the strongest God of all: Aphrodite.
