As we enter the room, the Dark Foe sits in a throne of stone, carved intricately into spires of talons and horns. Though something here, too, is wrong. The helmet is correct, but he wears no other armour, merely a robe of silver silk. There is only a solitary ring, rather than the one on each finger boasted by lore. A few devices and artifacts grace his personage, but wields no black blade of doom. Perhaps the tales were wrong? Twisted by time and speaker? Perhaps purposeful propaganda?

Before we have a chance to gather our thoughts, the stone doors grind closed behind us, and again the Dark One beckons, this time for our attention.

It is only you all and I, he says, voice calm. He promises that his minions will not become involved. He questions why we have come.

Our Hero, the de facto leader of us, proclaims the truth; we seek our friend. We *will* rescue them from his vile grasp.

You will not, the Dark One retorts.

Unable to help myself, I blurt out a question of the livelihood of our friend.

Alive and well, he responds.

Several demand to know the location, to which the Dark One laughs. If we do not know already, we do not deserve to know.

More threats; more laughs. We are tired and have used much of our resources, he notes. Even in peak condition, we would have trouble defeating him anyway, he postures. He is egging us on, many of us think, but his words ring true. We *are* tired. We *have* used much of our resources. 

He stands, meandering in our direction. Calm, collected. There is no fear, nor hate, in his walk. He offers a hand, and a deal. The Hero, he says, may offer their levels. Start again from scratch. Then, he said, he will reveal the truth.

Of course, the Hero is not known for their patience. But they do have an inflated ego, and the Dark One has bruised it one too many times. They call for an attack formation, and charges. It is one we have practiced numerous times, all I ready for this day. A dozen spells are cast at once; our warriors buffed and blessed, and the battlefield filled with illusions and fog. Curses cast unto the Dark One, arrows and bullets rain through the mists. Our warriors charge forward into the mists, striking the Foe at once.

Then, a snap.

In an instant, the fog cleared, illusions disapated, blessing and curses alike lifted. In the clearing, surrounded by our fighters, stood the Dark One. The weapons made no marks as they find their target, being deflected by magic and adamantine alike.

A valiant effort, quipped the Dark One, and may have even worked against the one he uprooted. But he was different, stronger; he grasped the Hero in a shadowed hand, laying the other gently on the chest. And he took no pleasure, he said, in what he must do.

The light hand curled into a fist, grabbing something ethereal in the Hero. He ripped the hand away, revealing an orb of whispered gold. The Hero immediately withered, looking the same as they did when we first arrived. The Dark One tossed the the Hero in our direction, before repeating with the Barbarian. Then the Weapons master. Grab, rip; grab, rip. When he was done with our warriors, near a half-dozen glowing orbs surrounded him of varying hues. He took slow steps towards the rest of us. He apologized, voice seemingly sorrowful. It was the only way, he said.

The rest of us fought, using every ounce of our power to fight; but magic was merely dispelled, and might reflected. He ripped from us our power, our might, one by one. Surely, I thought, this was the end.

But, he did not kill us; instead, he went back to his throne, and sat down. He removed his helmet, and told us to flee. Leave of his presence. And before we could argue, or fight anew, he teleported us back to the beginning of the Ten Thousand Steps.

Everyone was frustrated; we lost, and worse, we were back to square one. Our levels, our power, stripped away. But I was silent and fearful for another reason. That face, marred by monstrosity, was the face of our friend. What had they done to themselves? When did this happen? Why did they fall to Darkness? But, the question that rang the loudest in my head:

*Why didn't they kill us?*

Something wasn't right, I just know it. That is why I keep this secret to myself; the others apparently unable to see past the monster that was before them. I will grow strong again. I will see my friend again.

I will save them, next time.
