"Welcome, child." A slim smile graced the face of the older gentleman, nearly hidden behind white beard and mustache. The man gave a slight bow, white-gloved hands bidding entrance past the oaken doors.

"I am no child," the adventurer said, offput by the remark and man. Such strange movements, what strange clothes. "I am almost thirty, sir."

The man smiled a bit wider. "Perhaps, but I am much, much older. Which makes you a child in my eyes." The man gave a chuckle, once again bidding entrance. "You are here for a sword, yes?"

The adventurer paused for a moment. He was unsure why he was here. In fact, he did not know *how* he got here. Where *was* he? He was looking for a sword, yes, one to defeat the invader that drenched his town in purple hellfire, who killed his friends and family. He deduced that the answers he sought, and perhaps a blade, would be just beyond the doorframe. He nodded, accepting the welcome of entrance.

As he did, he had to shield his eyes as a sudden glow of numerous lights hit him. When his eyes could mostly adjust, he was astonished at the view.

Swords.

Hundreds of millions of swords, lined up impeccably in an impossibly long room, equally as impossibly tall. Swords from all the Ages, of all sizes, of all manners of design and magic. It made his head spin, the brightness, the colors, the sheer *volume*.

"What is this place?" He questioned aloud.

The older gentleman, keeper of the room, smiled. "It is my Collection." He paused, before continuing. "Well, at least, it is one of my Collections. The Hall of Blades." He led the adventurer through the hall, pointing out a few of the wonderous weapons.

The Sword of Light, crafted in the Second Era. Simple, but brilliant. Her sister, the Sword of Darkness. Identical in every way, except for the aura of shadows. Their cousin, the Sword of Twilight, shining a dim blue and orange of Her namesake. And on, and on; the man pointed out dozens and dozens of blades, each with their own namesake, each with their own history.

The man, after some time, had a thought connect in his head, which he vocalized to the gentleman. "You asked if I was here for a sword...are you going to be giving one to me?"

The gentleman 'tsk'ed in disapproval, before clarifying. "Not give, but trade. After all, one must replace what one takes, in some form or fashion. Specifically, I would like to trade any of these blades for the one there on your hip."

The adventurer found his hand grasping the hilt of the sheathed sword. His father's sword, passed early onto him through destruction and death. But beyond that; a sword, not even greatly made. By all means, it was the deal of a lifetime; but he could not let it go in his heart. Not yet, at least.

"Show me the blade you will trade for it, sir," he finally said, conviction in his voice. "Then I will gladly accept."

The gentleman's smile was wide now, with a look of excitement and understanding. "Ah, I see now you are *indeed* no child! Tell me; what purpose of blade do you require? Which sword do you seek?"

The adventurer, still slightly offput, stated his conviction clearly. "I seek a sword, sir, for justice and revenge, of rightous fury and of vengeance. I seek a blade, sir, that will cut down a man of Magic. A Mage, of death and destruction, of purple hellfire and undeath. I seek, sir, a weapon to take down a villain much stronger than I."

The gentleman nodded, a smile still being worn, clapped twice. The walls moved swiftly, so fast that the adventurer began to feel woozy, and sick. Before any remnants of his breakfast could arise to his throat, the movement stopped, revealing and equally plain and more ancient blade. 

"The Sword of Heroes," the man explained, carefully removing it off of the wall. "Predates the First Era, with a magic ingrained since lost to mortals." He offered it to the adventurer.

Before the adventurer could even put his hand on the blade, he knew that this was the One he sought. And, for just a moment, he could hear his father's voice. He took hold of the blade, and felt the power within. A hundred, maybe a thousand or more, shadows appeared before him, spectral images of heroes long past. Each one placing a hand on the adventurer, in bonds of ethereal brotherhood.

*Hail, Hero.* Their voices said, uncountable in number. *Our power is yours. And you will be graced to pass along your power with us to the One After You.*

In the same moment, with a release of breath he did not realize he was holding, uttered a single word.

"Yes."

"Splendid!" The gentleman's voice brought the Hero out of his spectral stupor, and he realized the gentleman was holding his old blade. When had he gotten that? "Now that the trade has been made, I must say, a pleasure doing business, good sir!" The gentleman shook the uncertain Hero's hand and spun the both of them around to face the door, mere paces away, despite the miles they'd walked. "Unfortunately, this is the part where I bid you adieu, sir, as I must place this blade back. I wish you pleasant travels, and grand adventures! May your tale been magnificent and legendary!"

The Hero found himself halfway pushed out the door in a hurry, back to his camp. He turned around to see the doorframe was connected to nothing, standing in open space of the field. As the door began to close, the Hero called out. "Wait! I never got your name!"

"Nor I yours, good Hero!" Came the reply.

As soon as the door clicked shut, it disappeared, as if it had never existed at all. Looking at his new blade, however, the Hero knew it had been real.

The Collector, meanwhile, shined his new acquisition. "My, my, whoever thought that I would be so lucky to trade for the Sword of the Hero of the Seventh Era?" He chuckled happily to himself, pleased. "The others will be oh so jealous."
