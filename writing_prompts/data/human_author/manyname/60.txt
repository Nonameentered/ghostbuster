There was a *should*, and there was a *could*.

Two options, presented before me. Find the cure for cancer; or own the entirety of the McDonald's franchise, and revive the McLobster. No more information, no less. Just two buttons, labeled for their effects. I considered my options.

Curing cancer would be a wonderful thing, for the world. But it was so *vague*. A cure for *all* cancers? An eradication of a whole type of sickness? Or simply a cure for *a* cancer? Picked at random, perhaps? Granted, I'm no scientist, so maybe even curing *just one* type of cancer could help set off a chain reaction of research, leading to more cures. I remember reading stuff like that happens all the time in the science world.

Not to mention, what about money? Sure, maybe this button *magically* grants me the knowledge on how to cure cancer, all or one. But it's still gotta get produced. I'd still have to find investors and manufacturers willing to listen to what is, equivally, a jackass with a snake oil idea. Maybe I could get rich, too, but do I want to? I'd bet the company would blame everything on me; I'd be a dead man by the end of the year. That's just assuming *knowledge*, what if I do get the physical, actual cure? Then I'm dead by the end of the week, no way some rich asshole is going to let me get away with curing the very *condition he's making his riches over*.

And then... McDonald's. A household name raking in what must be billions a year. I *would* be a rich man, and, yeah, I'll look like an asshole, but it's *McDonald's*. It's a *corporation*. No matter *who* runs the damn thing, they're gonna be an asshole, and an alive one to boot. Plus, get to rake in a nice bonus with the revival of the "McLobster", whatever the hell that is. Presumably some kind of sandwich with lobster meat. Probably some kind of thing from the 70's or 80's? I dunno, never heard of it myself, but it seems like a big enough deal that it's on this ominous, unexplained button as a bonus. So I reckon it's going to be big.

But, that means I have to live in the knowledge I gave up the *cure for fucking cancer*. Presumably, no one else will, but...it's probably gonna eat away at me. Even if it's like 'the cure for breast cancer in men only', it's a *fucking cure for cancer*. Wait, shit, what if it's not just me who knows? What if this is being recorded right now? Then it wouldn't matter if I'm jackass-McGee of McFucking McDonalds; my McHead is going to McRoll off my goddamn body as soon as the news rolls the goddamn McFilm!

Okay, getting too worked up. Gotta breathe. In and out. Inhale, exhale. 

I just...gotta choose. Ain't another way out of this. Just, deep breath in, push the button.

See where we go.
