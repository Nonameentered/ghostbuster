"Aw, fuck."

The portly man scratched his beard, mentally cussing up a storm. He was looking down into the valley via a spotting scope, trying to figure out their location. 

"What'cha got, Beans?"

Another man, slightly better in shape, smoking a cigarette below the tree. He looked up to the portly man, hand grasping the rifle to his side.

"You ever hear of *Isekai*, Two-Speed?"

"Eesa-what? What kinda weeb shit is that?"

"I dunno, my son's into it. It's like, *transported into another world*, or something like that. And, uh, I think that's what's going on here."

"The *fuck* is that supposed to mean?"

"Well, either that, of I'm tripping major balls right now, cuz there's a camp of orcs and goblins down there."

Two-Speed swore up and down, before crawling up tree to Beans, snatching the scope from Beans. Sure enough, setting up fires and tents was a band of green men and women, wearing clothes of hides and skins. The larger ones had tusks protruding from their mouths. The smaller ones, the size of children, with abnormally large heads and ears proportional to their bodies. He took a large inhale from his cigarette, exhaled, then looked to Beans. "What the *fuck*?"

"Oh, sweet, I'm not tripping balls. Thought for a second there the dispensary spiked my shit." He pulled out a hand-rolled cigarette, with a green core. "Speaking of which, lemme borrow a light."

"Heh, never took you as a weed type of guy. Power of the DD-214, I guess." As Beans lit up, Two-Speed pinched the bridge of his nose. "Fuck, man, what do we tell the rest of the boys?"

"The truth, probably. Let 'em take a look for themselves if they don't believe it."

"Okay, but what do we *do*, then?"

"I dunno. We could try our luck in talking with them. If things go south, we are packing a rifle each. Might be enough to scare 'em off."

A shout from a younger man rang from below. "Hey, assholes, the fuck is taking so long?"

Both Two-Speed and Beans, simultaneously, yelled back instinctively, "Fuck you, Rio." They then repeated the cycle with Rio; disbelief into shock into unwitting acceptance.

After discussing between the three of them, they went back to the group, completing the two-dozen team. They explained the situation, and cycled again, with the whole group this time. Not everyone was really sure what to believe, but they all agreed that the only way to tell was by asking. That, and the sun was setting fast. Better to be sheltered in the dark; and if things went sour, they could lose their persuers in the forest.

"Okay," Beans said, picking up the old habits of his prior rank. "Let's do this fucking thing, boys."
