The Federal Reserve has voted to increase the revenue cap for bank subsidiaries' securities underwriting. This decision is expected to provide banks with more opportunities to generate revenue and expand their business.
The revenue cap is a limitation placed on banks from engaging in securities underwriting. Historically, the revenue cap was put in place to prevent conflicts of interest between banking and investment banking operations. The original cap was set at 5% of a bank’s tier 1 capital, which is a measure of the bank’s financial strength.
The Board also approved a revenue cap increase for banks with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion, from 3.25% to 4.25%, and those with assets under $50 billion, from 2% to 2.5%.
The Federal Reserve Board's decision to approve the increase in the revenue cap is seen as a win for many in the banking industry. It is expected that this move will reduce the regulatory burden on banks and help them to better compete with non-bank financial institutions.
In a statement, the Federal Reserve Board acknowledged that the financial industry has undergone significant changes since the revenue cap was last reviewed. The Board noted that technological advancements have made it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with banks in the securities underwriting market.
This change in the revenue cap is expected to provide banks with a greater incentive to engage in securities underwriting, which will help to expand their businesses and generate more revenue. It is also expected to facilitate the growth of smaller banks, which have traditionally faced more regulatory hurdles in expanding their securities underwriting operations.
Overall, the Federal Reserve Board's decision to increase the revenue cap for bank subsidiaries' securities underwriting is seen as a positive development for the banking industry. The increased flexibility will enable banks to better position themselves to compete with non-bank financial institutions and further cement their position in the securities underwriting market.
The new rules on bank subsidiaries' securities underwriting will go into effect on January 1, 2021. Banks will have to adjust their security underwriting operations to the new rules, but the impact is expected to be relatively minor.
