Pyramid schemes continue to be the most prevalent scam on the internet, despite efforts to clamp down on fraudulent activities. According to a recent report by the non-profit organization, Pyramid Scheme Alert (PSA), countless individuals have been duped through online pyramid schemes, resulting in significant monetary loss.
The report surveyed more than 500 victims of online pyramid scheme scams in 2020. The study found that victims lost an average of $4,000 each, with some losing up to $50,000. These losses represented a significant chunk of the victims' total savings and could have a long lasting effect on their financial health. The most common type of scam reported was pyramid schemes that promised rewards for recruiting additional members to the scheme. These schemes utilized social media to reach more potential investors and to build an impression of credibility.
In addition to the financial repercussions, experts warn that participation in pyramid schemes can have lasting psychological effects. According to an article in The Atlantic, victims of pyramid schemes often experience feelings of guilt and shame as a result of their decisions. Participants can also become resentful of family and friends, who they may feel were in on the scheme but didn’t inform them. This can lead to a loss of trust and the breakdown of relationships.
The report calls for stronger legal action against pyramid schemes and increased awareness among the public. “Unfortunately, pyramid schemes are very attractive to people looking for quick and easy ways to make money,” said Robert FitzPatrick, president of PSA. “It can be difficult for even sophisticated investors to differentiate between a pyramid scheme and a legitimate business opportunity.”
With the advancement of technology and the prevalence of the Internet, most pyramid schemes now recruit members through online platforms, including social media and messaging apps. Furthermore, the increased access to financial technology, such as mobile payment services, has made it easier for scammers to move money between different accounts with ease.
The report provides an extensive overview of strategies employed by financially-motivated fraudsters, as well as useful information on how to identify and protect oneself against the common red flags of a pyramid scheme. Consumers are advised to be wary of offers that require the payment of money upfront, that emphasize recruitment of additional members, and that offer bonuses or rewards for bringing in new investors. Moreover, they are warned to stay away from schemes that feature generic or interchangeable products, and those that do not have a tangible source of income or a reasonable exit strategy.
The takeaway from the report is that, in addition to taking legal action against online fraudsters, investors should also be wary of potential pyramid schemes. The report encourages individuals to do their own research before investing, and to look out for the tell-tale signs of fraudulent activities. Additionally, the report recommends that investors take advantage of resources that can help them better distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent investment opportunities. Finally, investors should report any suspicious activity to their local law enforcement agency.
Overall, the report is a reminder that internet-based pyramid schemes remain a real threat to investors and the public, and that it is essential to stay vigilant and informed.
