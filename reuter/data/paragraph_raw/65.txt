An international task force has proposed the expansion of internet addresses with new top-level domains (TLDs) aimed at increasing online accessibility and branding opportunities. The proposal was made after several years of consultation with stakeholders, including governments, tech experts, and private sector organizations.
Top level domains are the last part of a website address, like .com, .org, or .net. The current TLDs on the internet are around 1,500 varieties with .com being the most used domain extension worldwide. With the limits of widely utilized domain extensions, the new open-door policy to TLDs will result in the allowance of a broader range of extensions with a specific meaning, such as .music or .nyc to demonstrate location and purpose.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is responsible for approving and regulating the use of TLDs. ICANN's Board of Directors recently met to create the guideline for renewing and grading TLD applications. Key criteria that will be considered for TLD approvals are the functionality of domain extensions, potential security concerns, and the prevention of domain name confusion.
Supporters of the proposed expansion believe that the new domain extensions will help resolve the issue of having limited options for domain names. If there are more domain extensions to choose from, businesses will have a greater chance of acquiring a domain name that matches their brand. Moreover, the change is expected to enhance online marketing, as businesses will be able to incorporate branding benefits into their domain names.
Additionally, the new TLDs will create an immense opportunity for regional branding as they will reflect the Geo-location of websites, making it easier to establish regional branding. Moreover, these wider domain options will help innovative startups to easily acquire the domain names they want. This is a crucial factor for the growth of startups, as it will give them a better chance of establishing a recognizable web-based brand.
The new TLDs may also have a massive impact on the online presence of developing countries. For example, if Africa acquires its TLD, it will likely have a profound impact on how the world perceives the African continent and its entire online sphere. As Roberto Gaetano, a member of the ICANN Board of Directors, stated, "The expansion of TLDs will be a catalyst for innovation and will allow developing countries to have a greater presence on the internet."
However, it is important that ICANN continues to closely monitor the applications for these new TLDs to ensure that the expansion is secure and free of potential malware and phishing websites. Cybersecurity risks should also be considered when approving new domain extensions to prevent any cybercrimes. These are just some of the challenges that ICANN must take into consideration when allowing new domain extensions.
In conclusion, the proposed expansion of internet addresses with new top-level domains is an innovative idea. It is expected to have a transformational impact on the online sphere, greater branding opportunities, and provide increased accessibility to developing countries. However, it would help if ICANN were to be very vigilant in approving these domain extensions to prevent cybercrime and confusion among internet users.
