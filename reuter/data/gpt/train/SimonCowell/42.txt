Royal & Sun Alliance (RSA) reported its annual results today, announcing plans to buy back shares but also revealing a hit to its profits due to environmental claims in the United States.
The insurer reported a net profit of £447 million ($610 million) for 2020, up from £371 million in 2019. Operating profit, which reflects the company's ongoing business without one-off items, rose 15% to £751 million.
RSA announced plans to buy back £400 million worth of shares, following in the footsteps of other insurers such as Aviva and Prudential. The buyback is expected to begin in the second quarter of this year and be completed by the end of 2022.
However, the company also revealed a hit to its profits due to environmental claims in the United States. RSA said it had increased its reserves for environmental claims by £42 million, after a review of its policies in response to higher-than-expected claims.
The claims relate to pollution and contamination liability policies sold to businesses in the United States. While the policies have been profitable for RSA in the past, the company said it had identified potential issues with claims handling and underwriting practices.
RSA said it was taking steps to improve its claims handling and underwriting processes, and that it expected the impact of the reserve increase to be non-recurring.
In addition to the environmental claims, RSA said it had also been hit by losses related to the UK floods and storms earlier this year. The company said it had set aside £60 million to cover claims related to the flooding that affected many parts of the country in January and February.
Despite these challenges, RSA said it was confident in its future prospects. CEO Stephen Hester said the company had made "excellent progress" in 2020, with its UK and international businesses delivering strong results.
Hester added that RSA was committed to growing its business in key markets, such as Canada and Scandinavia, and to improving its customer service and digital capabilities.
Investors appeared to welcome the news, with RSA shares rising over 2% in morning trading in London. The company's share price has risen by almost a third in the past year, helped by a recovery in global stock markets and increased demand for insurance products.
However, some analysts warned that RSA could still face headwinds in the future. A recent report by Fitch Ratings warned that insurance companies could face rising claims related to climate change, which could lead to higher premiums and lower profits.
RSA is not the only insurer to face environmental claims in recent years. In 2018, French insurer AXA announced it would stop selling insurance policies to companies involved in the coal industry, due to concerns about climate change.
RSA's announcement comes just weeks after the UK Supreme Court ruled in favor of policyholders in a dispute over business interruption insurance. The court ruled that many policyholders affected by the Covid-19 pandemic were entitled to payouts under their insurance policies, which could lead to significant losses for insurers such as RSA.
Despite these challenges, RSA said it remained committed to its customers and to providing "fair and prompt settlement" of claims. The company said it would continue to invest in digital technology, to improve its claims handling and underwriting processes, and to meet the changing needs of its customers.
As the global economy continues to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, insurers such as RSA will face both opportunities and challenges. With demand for insurance products expected to rise in many markets, and new risks emerging all the time, it will be important for companies to remain agile and focused on meeting the needs of their customers.
