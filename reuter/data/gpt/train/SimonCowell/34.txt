The British public is strongly against insurance companies using the results of genetic tests to determine premiums, according to a recent survey.
The survey, conducted by YouGov, found that 78% of people in the UK believe that it is unfair for insurance companies to use genetic test results to calculate premiums. The survey also revealed that 72% of people think that insurance companies should not be allowed to ask for genetic test results from their customers.
The findings come in the wake of a growing trend among insurance companies to use genetic testing in their underwriting processes. This has led to concerns about discrimination against people who have genetic mutations that could increase their risk of developing certain illnesses, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, or Huntington's disease.
Critics of the practice argue that it would be unfair for insurance companies to charge higher premiums or deny coverage based on genetics, as this is a characteristic that people cannot change. They also worry that the use of genetic testing could discourage people from getting tested and potentially receiving life-saving treatments.
Dr. Anna Middleton, a genetic counsellor at the University of Cambridge, told The Guardian: "If people are worried about being penalised by their insurance company for having had genetic testing, then they won't have testing. If they don't have testing, they won't find out if they are at risk of a genetic condition, meaning they won't be able to receive appropriate medical management."
However, some in the insurance industry argue that the use of genetic testing is necessary to ensure that premiums are based on accurate risk assessments. They argue that people who have a higher risk of developing certain illnesses should pay more for coverage, as this reflects the higher costs that insurers are likely to incur in paying out claims.
The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has published guidelines on the use of genetic information in underwriting, which state that insurers should not ask for genetic test results unless they are relevant to the risk being assessed. However, critics argue that these guidelines are not legally binding and do not provide sufficient protection to consumers.
The UK government is currently considering whether to ban the use of genetic testing in insurance underwriting, as part of a wider consultation on genetics and genomics in healthcare. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: "We are considering the balance between protecting people from unfair treatment and ensuring that insurers have access to the information they need to make accurate and fair decisions."
The debate over the use of genetic testing in insurance underwriting is likely to continue, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. However, one thing is clear: the British public is firmly against the use of genetic test results to determine insurance premiums, and any decision on this issue must take their views into account.
