Legal & General, the British multinational financial services company, has reported a double-digit rise in profits as it revealed a strong dividend growth prospect. The company witnessed a 14% jump in underlying operating profits from 2.3 billion pounds to 2.6 billion pounds for the year 2020, beating expectations. Legal & Generalâ€™s share price increased by more than 5% on the back of the news.
The profit growth was primarily driven by the high performance of its life insurance and pension businesses, which generated a profit of 1.4 billion pounds, a steep 19% YoY increase. Meanwhile, its retirement division posted an 11% profit growth, reaching 1.2 billion pounds.
Legal & General's CEO, Nigel Wilson, attributed the impressive results to the company's long-term investment strategy, digital transformation, and focus on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) opportunities. He stated, "Our record operating profits, double-digit EPS growth, and 7% increase in dividends reflect the successful execution of our growth, digitalization and ESG strategies. Our strategy of focusing on structural growth drivers that benefit society and the environment, whilst playing a strong financial role in the recovery from the pandemic, has served us well."
The company also revealed that it has surplus capital of 6.8 billion pounds and its solvency ratio, a measure of the company's ability to meet its long-term obligations, stands at 173%, well above the regulatory minimum of 100%.
Legal & General's dividend, one of the largest in the FTSE-100, is also expected to grow in the coming years following the latest results. The company announced a 7% increase in the full-year dividend to 17.57 pence per share, up from 16.42 pence per share in 2019. This increase marks the 11th consecutive year of dividend growth, giving investors strong reasons to invest in the company.
Furthermore, Nigel Wilson said, "Our balance sheet, capital surplus, and cash generation allow us to increase our dividend, invest in growth and invest in new opportunities. We expect to deliver another year of strong operating profit growth in 2021, in line with our medium-term growth target. We continue to innovate, digitalize, and invest in the sustainable infrastructure and finance that society needs."
Legal & General's investment business also performed well, with gross inflows of 42.6 billion pounds, up from 33.9 billion pounds in 2019. The company's property arm, Legal & General Investment Management Real Assets, continued to build its portfolio, expanding its holdings outside of the UK to 39% of its total assets, up from 31% in 2019.
The company's financial advisory network, Legal & General Financial Advice, also delivered a strong performance, recording an 11% increase in sales to retail customers as the company pivots towards digital services.
In conclusion, Legal & General's solid 2020 performance indicates the success of its long-term investment strategy and digital transformation. The company's dividend growth prospects, underpinned by its strong capital position and cash generation, make it an attractive proposition for investors. Looking ahead, Legal & General has a clear plan for ESG growth, investing in sustainable infrastructure projects in the UK and internationally. With such positive results and strategy in place, Legal & General is well-positioned to provide investors with long-term value.
