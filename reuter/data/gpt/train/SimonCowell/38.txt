British insurer General Accident Plc has reported a £15m drop in profits in 1996. The company, which has been in existence for over a century, cited stiff competition and severe weather in the US as the main reasons for the decline in profits.
General Accident Plc's gross written premium for the year was £2.71bn, a marginal increase from the previous year, but the combined ratio, which measures the company's profitability, was 103.7%, up from 101.7% in 1995.
The UK market was particularly challenging for General Accident. The company's CEO, Kevin Ryan, stated that competition in the UK market had been "intense" during the year. This had resulted in a decline in prices for many types of insurance products. The company's income from motor insurance was down, as prices in that market remained under pressure.
In addition, the company's investment income was lower than expected due to a volatile stock market and lower interest rates. General Accident had anticipated making £165m from its investment portfolio, but in reality, it earned only £126m.
However, the most significant impact on General Accident's profits in 1996 was the severe weather conditions experienced in the US. The company has a significant presence in the US market, where it operates under the name Commercial Union. The US operations had been hit hard by Hurricane Fran, which caused extensive damage in the US, and the company was forced to pay out significant claims.
Despite these challenges, Ryan remained optimistic about the company's future. In a statement, he said, "We have made significant strides in restructuring our business, and we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead."
Ryan had overseen significant changes at General Accident since taking over as CEO in late 1995. He had cut the company's workforce, merged its UK operations with Commercial Union, and streamlined its products and services. These changes were aimed at making the company more competitive in the increasingly tough insurance market.
However, some industry analysts were sceptical about Ryan's optimistic outlook. They pointed out that General Accident was still facing intense pressure from competitors, particularly in the UK market, and the company's margins were likely to remain under pressure in the short to medium term.
General Accident's share price had fallen significantly in 1996, from a high of 375p in January to a low of 275p in December. The company's dividend had also been cut, from 14.5p per share in 1995 to 10.4p per share in 1996.
Despite these challenges, General Accident remained one of the UK's largest insurers. The company had a market capitalisation of around £3bn, and its products and services were sold in over 40 countries.
The company had a strong reputation for customer service and had won numerous awards for its products, including motor insurance, travel insurance, and home insurance.
Ryan remained committed to ensuring that General Accident remained a leader in the insurance market, saying, "We will continue to focus on providing our customers with the best products and service available, while ensuring that our business is organised to deliver sustainable returns for our shareholders."
Overall, 1996 had been a challenging year for General Accident, but the company remained optimistic about its future. The insurance market was likely to remain competitive, but the company had made significant strides in becoming more streamlined and efficient. The company's customers and shareholders would no doubt be watching closely to see how Ryan's vision for the company would unfold.
