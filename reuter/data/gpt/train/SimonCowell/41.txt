Royal & Sun Alliance (RSA) has reported lower than expected results for the first half of 2021 due to ongoing pandemic-related losses. The insurance company has also announced plans to seek shareholder approval for a share buyback scheme.
RSA reported an operating profit of £247m ($341m) for the six months ending in June 2021, compared to the £333m ($461m) it reported for the same period last year. The company was hit by continued COVID-19 claims in addition to property damage claims as a result of severe weather conditions.
Despite the lower profits, RSA’s CEO, Stephen Hester, expressed optimism in a statement, saying: “We have delivered strong results and maintained momentum in our transformation program despite the ongoing pandemic.”
Hester added that RSA’s strategic focus on sustainability and digitization was paying off, with the company set to launch a new digital platform for customers later this year.
Looking ahead, however, RSA’s board is seeking shareholder approval to buy back up to £500m ($690m) of the company’s shares over the next 12 months. The scheme is aimed at improving RSA’s capital efficiency and returning cash to shareholders.
The proposed buyback represents a significant investment in the company, representing almost 7% of its total market capitalization. However, it is worth noting that RSA has recently completed a major sale of its Israeli business, giving it additional funds to invest in its own shares.
The buyback scheme will be put to a vote at RSA’s annual general meeting, which is scheduled for May 2022. In the meantime, the company will continue to prioritize cost management and underwriting discipline to drive growth.
RSA is not the only insurance company to have been hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, with many others reporting higher losses and lower profits as a result of COVID-19-related claims. However, despite these challenges, the insurance industry as a whole has remained resilient, with many companies continuing to invest in new initiatives and digital transformation.
RSA’s decision to pursue a share buyback is a reminder of the importance of capital management in this challenging operating environment. While the company’s profits may have taken a hit, its forward-looking approach to investing in its own shares demonstrates a commitment to long-term growth and sustainability.
However, some analysts have raised concerns that the buyback may not be the best use of RSA’s cash, particularly given ongoing challenges in the insurance industry. There are also concerns that the buyback could reduce the company’s flexibility to invest in other initiatives or make necessary acquisitions.
Despite these concerns, RSA’s board appears to be confident in the buyback scheme, with Hester stating that it was a “sensible” use of the company’s funds.
Ultimately, shareholders will be the ones to decide whether the buyback is the best course of action for RSA, with the vote on the scheme set to take place next year. In the meantime, the company will continue to focus on cost management, underwriting discipline, and growth opportunities as it navigates the ongoing challenges of the insurance industry.
