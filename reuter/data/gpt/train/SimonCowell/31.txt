Commercial Union, one of the UK's leading insurance companies, has reported a sharp fall in profits for the year ending 1996. The fall in profits has been attributed to the strength of sterling, which has made the company's products more expensive to customers overseas.
Commercial Union reported a pre-tax profit of £527m for the year, down from £863m for the previous year, a drop of almost 40%. This has come as a big blow to the company and its shareholders, who had been hoping for more positive results.
The company has said that the strength of sterling is largely responsible for the fall in profits. The value of the pound has soared against many other major currencies, particularly the US dollar and the Japanese yen, making Commercial Union's products more expensive for overseas customers.
The company's chairman, Sir John Collins, said in a statement that the strength of sterling had had a "significant" impact on the company's results. He added that the company was looking at ways to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on its business in the future.
The results were also affected by increased claims in several areas, including property and liability insurance. The company said that natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes had led to increased claims in some regions.
Despite the fall in profits, Commercial Union said that it remained a strong and profitable company. It has been investing heavily in new technology and expanding its business in several areas, including the internet and emerging markets such as Asia and Latin America.
The company's shares have fallen on news of the results, however. Shares in Commercial Union fell by more than 5% shortly after the results were announced. The fall in share price is likely to be a concern for the company and its shareholders, as it could make it harder to raise capital in the future.
Commercial Union is not the only UK company to be hit by the strength of sterling in recent months. Many other companies, particularly those in the manufacturing and exporting sectors, have reported negative effects from the currency's rise. Some economists have even warned that the strong pound could lead to a downturn in the UK economy.
Despite the challenging results, however, Commercial Union remains confident in its long-term prospects. The company's CEO, Max Taylor, said that the results were disappointing but that the company remained committed to its long-term strategy. He added that the company would continue to invest in new technology and expand its business in emerging markets, particularly in Asia.
Commercial Union is one of the UK's largest insurance companies, with interests in a range of areas including property, casualty and life insurance. The company employs more than 20,000 people worldwide and has a strong reputation for customer service and innovation.
