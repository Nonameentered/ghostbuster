Norwich Union policyholders are set to receive free shares worth £5bn in a flotation plan aimed at returning £2bn to customers in the UK's largest ever bonus share issue.
Aviva, the parent company of Norwich Union, has announced its plans to float its UK life and pensions business, which includes Norwich Union, on the London Stock Exchange in 2022. The announcement comes as part of Aviva's strategy to focus on general insurance, where it has a stronger competitive position.
The flotation, which is expected to value the UK life and pensions business at between £8bn and £10bn, will include an offer of shares to customers who have held policies for at least a year. The shares will be distributed on a pro-rata basis, with eligible policyholders receiving an average of £1,200 worth of shares.
“We want to reward our customers for their loyalty and create a shared ownership structure that aligns our interests with theirs,” said Amanda Blanc, Aviva's CEO.
The move, which has been approved by Aviva's board, is expected to be welcomed by policyholders who have seen several previous attempts to float the UK life and pensions business fail to materialize.
"I'm delighted that the company is finally recognizing the importance of its policyholders, and I think it's an excellent way of repaying their loyalty," said Charles Hill, spokesperson for the Norwich Union Policyholders Action Group.
The flotation is also expected to be well-received by investors, with the UK life insurance industry having shown resilience in the face of Covid-19. Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic, the industry has reported strong profits and a rise in demand for protection and savings products.
“Investors will see this as an attractive opportunity to gain exposure to the UK life insurance industry, which has demonstrated its ability to weather difficult economic conditions,” said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.
Aviva's flotation comes after a period of uncertainty for the company, which faced pressure from shareholders to improve its performance. The company has been restructuring its operations and divesting non-core businesses to focus on areas where it has a competitive advantage.
The decision to float the UK life and pensions business is part of Aviva's broader strategy to simplify its operations and improve its balance sheet. The company aims to reduce debt, improve return on equity and increase capital efficiency as it prepares for a potential change in regulatory requirements.
“By focusing on selected markets where we can achieve scale and profitability, we can drive long-term sustainable growth and create value for our customers and shareholders,” said Blanc.
Aviva's flotation is expected to be one of the largest UK corporate events of 2022 and could attract significant interest from investors. The company is yet to disclose details of the timing or pricing of the offering.
However, the decision by Aviva to float its UK life and pensions business has been met with some criticism. Trade union Unite has expressed concerns about the impact on job security for staff at Norwich Union.
“This is a short-term strategy that may ultimately harm the long-term sustainability of the business,” said Rob MacGregor, national officer for Unite.
Despite these concerns, the flotation is set to go ahead, with Aviva stating that it remains committed to working with stakeholders to ensure a successful outcome.
Overall, the flotation of Aviva's UK life and pensions business is expected to bring significant benefits for both policyholders and investors. With the UK insurance industry showing resilience in the face of Covid-19 and demand for protection and savings products on the rise, Aviva's move is likely to be well-received by the market.
