British insurers announced on Monday that individuals seeking new life insurance policies may be required to disclose their genetic test results from April 2019. This move comes in response to advancements in genetic testing, which provide more detailed information about an individual’s genetic makeup than ever before.
Previously, disclosure of genetic test information was voluntary, and insurers were not entitled to ask for it. However, the new agreement between the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the Government’s Department of Health and Social Care will allow insurers to request access to test results for policies worth over £500,000 ($650,000) for customers from the beginning of next year.
The ABI has said that, as part of the new agreement, insurers will ask for genetic test information only on a “disclosure basis”. Customers will not be automatically required to disclose information about any tests they have undergone, and will only be asked if relevant. This means that if a customer has a test that is unrelated to the conditions covered by their life insurance policy, they will not have to disclose the results.
The new agreement will also introduce a “moratorium” that will prohibit insurers from asking about the results of genetic tests over ten years old. The Government has set out these measures to ensure that individuals are not unfairly penalised due to having a genetic predisposition towards certain health conditions.
The Director General of the ABI, Huw Evans, said the agreement would help to ensure that genetic tests do not become a barrier to people protecting themselves through insurance: “Insurers use very specific information to price risk for certain conditions, and this agreement will provide clarity for consumers and the industry alike on the use of genetic test results.”
Genetic testing can disclose an increased risk of certain health conditions including cancers and Alzheimer’s disease. In some cases, people may choose not to undergo testing for fear that it will impact their ability to obtain life insurance. The new agreement sets out a framework for how genetic test results are disclosed by insurers, which should provide customers with more reassurance that their test results will be treated appropriately.
The Chief Executive of cancer charity The Eve Appeal, Athena Lamnisos, welcomed the new agreement, saying: “We believe that any measure that assures the public that genetic information will not be used against them is a step forward.”
The announcement has also been welcomed by scientists, who have said that it will provide an opportunity to further research the links between genetics and health. Catherine Hubbard, Chief Executive of the British Society of Genetic Counselors, said: “Research into genetics and health is advancing rapidly, and it is essential that this information is used for the public good. We believe that this move by the ABI will help to facilitate this.”
The announcement of the new agreement has drawn criticism from some quarters, however, with Labour MP and Shadow Health Secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, criticising it as “a green light for insurers to ask customers a series of leading personal questions”.
The new agreement comes as genetic testing becomes more common, with an increasing number of people seeking information on their genetic heritage. Last year, US company 23andMe began offering UK customers the chance to “explore their DNA” for £149, and the NHS has also launched its own genomic sequencing programme. The Insurance industry has said that it was important to provide a clear framework for insurance companies to access information about people’s health, while assurance was provided to customers that their interests were being protected.
The new agreement represents a significant step forward in the regulation of genetic testing in the insurance industry, providing clearer guidance for customers and insurers alike. For many, it is a positive move forward, providing assurance that genetic testing will not prevent people from accessing the life insurance policies they need.
