Prudential Corp has reported a strong rise in its profits for the year, but has remained tight-lipped on negotiations with the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) over so-called orphan assets.
The insurance giant - which provides a range of financial services, including life insurance, annuities and pensions - revealed that it had seen a strong performance across all of its businesses, particularly in its key markets of Asia and the United States.
Profits for the full year rose to £2.4 billion, up from £2.1 billion in the previous year. The company's share price also rose by almost 5% on the back of the results.
"Our strong performance in 2020 demonstrates the resilience and adaptability of our business in the face of unprecedented challenges," said Charles Lowrey, Prudential's CEO.
He added that the company had benefited from its "diversified portfolio of high-quality businesses, broad geographic footprint and strong financial position".
However, the company declined to comment on ongoing negotiations with the DTI over orphan assets - a pool of funds that have built up in with-profits funds over the years, but which are no longer linked to individual policies.
The DTI has been in talks with insurers over how these assets should be distributed, with some arguing that the money should be returned to policyholders, while others say it should be used to pay down debt.
Prudential is one of several insurance companies that is thought to have a significant amount of orphan assets on its books.
The issue has proved highly controversial, with consumer groups accusing insurers of hoarding billions of pounds that rightfully belongs to policyholders.
However, many industry insiders argue that the orphan assets do not represent a windfall, but are necessary to support the long-term stability of with-profits funds.
Prudential's decision not to comment on the negotiations is likely to fuel speculation about the outcome of the talks, which are expected to conclude later this year.
The company also revealed that it had made progress in expanding its business in Asia, where it is focusing on higher-margin products such as health and protection insurance.
Asia remains a key growth area for Prudential, with the company's profits in the region rising by 14% to £2.5 billion last year.
However, the company is also facing increasing competition in the region from a range of local and international players.
"We continue to face some challenges in Asia, particularly around increased competition and regulatory scrutiny, but we remain confident that our strategy and market position will enable us to continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders," said Mr Lowrey.
Prudential's results were broadly in line with market expectations, although some analysts expressed caution about the company's prospects going forward.
"We believe Prudential has strong fundamentals, but we remain cautious on its exposure to the ongoing pandemic and the impact this may have on the global economy," said Erika Karp, chief executive of Cornerstone Capital Group.
Overall, however, Prudential's strong results suggest that the company remains well-placed to weather the ongoing challenges facing the insurance industry.
As well as the ongoing orphan assets negotiations, insurers are also grappling with low interest rates, increased regulation and growing competition from new entrants into the market.
However, Prudential's diversified business portfolio and focus on higher-margin products in Asia mean that it is well-placed to navigate these challenges and continue to deliver strong results for its shareholders.
