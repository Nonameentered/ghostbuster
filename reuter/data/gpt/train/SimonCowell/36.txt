NatWest Markets Unit Discovers Mispricing Errors and Suspends Senior Trader for Failure to Supervise
NatWest Markets’ London-based unit has discovered mispricing errors in some of its trades, according to sources familiar with the matter. The bank has suspended a senior trader for failing to supervise the pricing of certain transactions, the sources said.
NatWest Markets is the investment banking arm of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) that focuses on bond trading, foreign exchange, and rates trading. The unit is led by Chris Marks, who started in his role last year. The bank has not disclosed the name of the suspended trader.
The mispricing errors were detected during a routine review of the bank's trading books, the sources said. It is unclear how much money was at stake as a result of the pricing errors, but the bank has been working to rectify the situation.
A spokesperson for NatWest Markets declined to comment on the matter.
NatWest Markets has been working to rebuild its investment bank after it was bailed out by the UK government during the financial crisis. RBS was forced to sell off large parts of its operations, including its US retail bank Citizens Financial Group.
The bank has been investing in its systems and technology to improve risk management and compliance. In August, it hired Nandita Bakhshi, a former executive at Bank of America, to lead its US business.
The mispricing errors could be an embarrassment for NatWest Markets as the bank seeks to regain the trust of its customers and regulators. It remains to be seen whether the bank will face regulatory sanctions as a result of the incident.
The suspension of the senior trader is a reminder of the importance of effective supervision and control systems. Banks are required to have adequate controls in place to manage their risks and prevent misconduct.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been focused on improving the culture and conduct of banks in the wake of the Libor and forex scandals. The regulator has called on banks to strengthen their risk management and control systems and hold senior executives accountable for the behavior of their staff.
In June, the FCA fined The Bank of New York Mellon £126m for failing to keep client money safe during the financial crisis. The bank was found to have breached the regulator’s client money rules between November 2007 and August 2013.
The FCA is also investigating Barclays Bank over allegations that it breached client confidentiality rules by monitoring employee communication. The regulator revealed in July that it had launched an investigation into the bank's whistleblower program.
NatWest Markets will be hoping to avoid a similar fate and has been working to improve its risk management and control systems. It remains to be seen whether the mispricing errors will have any significant impact on the bank's reputation or its profitability.
The mispricing errors are a reminder of the complex nature of financial markets and the importance of effective risk management and supervision. Banks must continue to work to improve their control systems and hold their staff accountable for misconduct.
NatWest Markets will need to demonstrate that it has taken the necessary steps to address the mispricing errors and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The bank will be keen to restore the trust of its customers and investors and avoid regulatory sanctions.
