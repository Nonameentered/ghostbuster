Germany and the Czech Republic are set to sign a post-World War Two reconciliation declaration next month, marking a historic event in the two nations' relationship. The announcement was made jointly by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš on Tuesday.
The declaration aims to address the painful legacy of the war and subsequent forced expulsions of millions of Germans from Czechoslovakia. It represents a significant step towards reconciliation and healing the wounds of the past.
"Germany and the Czech Republic are united by a long history of cultural exchange, economic cooperation, and political partnership," Merkel said in a statement. "But we cannot ignore the fact that our shared history was marred by war, occupation, and forced displacement."
The declaration is expected to acknowledge the suffering of both Czechs and Germans during the war and the post-war period. It will also reaffirm the importance of dialogue and cooperation between the two nations, particularly in light of the challenges facing Europe today.
"This declaration is not about forgetting the past, but about acknowledging it in order to build a better future," Babiš said. "It is a significant step towards improving our relationship and promoting peace and stability in Europe."
The forced expulsions of Germans from Czechoslovakia after the war remain a deeply contentious issue in both countries. Nearly three million Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia between 1945 and 1947, with many facing violence and discrimination.
Some Germans argue that they were victims of ethnic cleansing, while some Czechs consider the expulsions to be justified retribution for Nazi Germany's occupation of their country. The issue has been a source of tension between the two nations for decades.
Despite ongoing debates over the expulsions, Merkel and Babiš emphasized the need to move forward and build a stronger relationship based on mutual respect and understanding.
"We know that the wounds of the past cannot be healed overnight," Merkel said. "But by acknowledging the suffering of both sides and committing ourselves to a brighter future, we can build a stronger, more prosperous Europe."
The declaration has been welcomed by both German and Czech politicians, as well as by European Union leaders. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praised the initiative as a "responsible and courageous step towards reconciliation and understanding".
The signing of the declaration will take place on June 3rd in the Czech capital of Prague. Merkel and Babiš will be joined by other German and Czech officials, as well as by representatives from the EU and other international organizations.
The event is expected to be an emotional moment for many Germans and Czechs, particularly those who have been directly affected by the expulsions. But it also represents a hopeful new chapter in the two nations' relationship, one that is based on cooperation and a shared commitment to peace and stability in Europe.
"Germany and the Czech Republic have a bright future together," Babiš said. "We may have had a difficult past, but we can build a better future by working together and by never forgetting the lessons of history."
