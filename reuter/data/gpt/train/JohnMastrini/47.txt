Prague, Czech Republic - Fans of the late King of Pop, Michael Jackson, gathered at Prague's O2 Arena on Friday, May 27, as the controversial "HiStory" tour made its stop in the city. The tour, which features a mix of Jackson's classic hits and tracks from his 1995 album "HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I," has been met with both excitement and criticism from fans and music critics alike.
The "HiStory" tour, which began on June 16, 1996, in Prague and concluded on October 15, 1997, in Durban, South Africa, has long been a source of controversy due to the sexual abuse allegations that have surrounded Jackson throughout his career. While Jackson was never convicted of any charges, the allegations have led some fans and critics to question whether the tour should still be performed and celebrated today.
Despite these concerns, the Prague crowd was eager to see Jackson perform some of his greatest hits, such as "Billie Jean," "Beat It," and "Thriller," as well as newer songs like "Scream" and "They Don't Care About Us." Fans dressed in sequined jackets and white gloves danced along to the beat, while others sang along to every word.
However, the tour's darker themes were not forgotten. Throughout the concert, images of war, poverty, and racism were projected onto the stage, while Jackson himself appeared onscreen as a soldier, a prisoner, and a victim of police brutality.
The performance also paid tribute to victims of violence, with a poignant rendition of "Gone Too Soon," a song written by Jackson in memory of his friend and fellow performer, Ryan White, who died from AIDS-related complications in 1990. White, who was just 18 years old at the time of his death, had been ostracized by his community due to his diagnosis, but Jackson remained one of his closest friends until the end.
While some have criticized the "HiStory" tour for glorifying Jackson's troubled past, others have argued that it is an important part of his legacy. Jackson was a complex figure, they say, and his art reflects the complexity of his life and his experiences.
For Jackson's fans in Prague, the show was a chance to celebrate the life and music of one of the greatest performers of all time. "We miss him so much," said one fan. "But through his music, he is still with us."
The "HiStory" tour is set to continue in other cities throughout Europe, including Berlin, Amsterdam, and Paris. Despite the controversy surrounding the performance, it seems that Jackson's legend continues to live on, more than a decade after his death.
