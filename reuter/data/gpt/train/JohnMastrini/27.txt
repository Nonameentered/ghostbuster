The Czech crown has reached its highest level yet against the mark and dollar basket, following comments by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on the country's economic growth and stability.
In a televised address on Thursday, Klaus said that the Czech Republic's economy had weathered the global economic downturn and was in a strong position for future growth.
"Our solid economic fundamentals and sound fiscal policies have put us in a position of strength," he said. "We have worked hard to maintain stability and predictability for investors, and our efforts have paid off."
Klaus's comments were well received by investors, who have been bullish on the Czech economy in recent months. The country's GDP grew by 2.3% in the first quarter of 2017, well above the Eurozone average of 1.7%.
The Czech crown has been steadily increasing in value over the past year, as investors have become more optimistic about the country's economic prospects.
Since January, the crown has gained around 4% against the mark and dollar basket. On Thursday, it hit a new high of 24.24 crowns per dollar, up from 24.63 earlier in the day.
Analysts say that the crown's gains are due in large part to the country's strong economic fundamentals and stable political environment.
"The Czech Republic is one of the few countries in the region that has managed to maintain a stable political environment in recent years," said Jan Stankovsky, an analyst at Erste Bank.
"That has given investors confidence that the country will continue to maintain its strong economic fundamentals and remain a good place to invest."
Stankovsky added that the crown was likely to continue to gain in value in the coming months, as investors look for safe-haven currencies amid global uncertainty.
"The crown is seen as a safe haven currency, much like the Swiss franc or the Japanese yen," he said. "As global uncertainty continues to weigh on the markets, we expect investors to continue to seek out safe-haven currencies like the crown."
However, some analysts are warning that the crown may be overvalued, and that the gains could be temporary.
"The crown has been rising very quickly over the past few months, and there is a risk that it has become overvalued," said David Marek, an economist at Deloitte.
"If the country's economic growth were to slow down, or if there were to be a shift in investor sentiment, the crown could quickly lose value."
Despite these concerns, most analysts agree that the Czech Republic's economic outlook remains strong, and that the country is likely to continue to attract investment in the coming months.
"The Czech Republic has a strong track record of economic growth and stability, and investors are clearly taking notice," said Marek.
"As long as the government continues to maintain its sound fiscal policies and strong economic fundamentals, we expect the country to continue to attract investment and experience economic growth in the years ahead."
