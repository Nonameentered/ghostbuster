Berlin, Germany: Germany and the Czech Republic are set to initial a landmark reconciliation declaration that aims to heal the wounds of the past and move forward towards a more peaceful future. The document is expected to be signed later this week by representatives of both countries to underscore the positive steps taken to promote greater cooperation and understanding. The move is symbolic, but its impact could have far-reaching consequences if it is approved by both countries.
While there is no guarantee of its final approval -- as negotiations between the Germans and the Czechs are still ongoing -- the reconciliation declaration has been long anticipated by many in both countries. The meeting between German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his Czech counterpart Milos Zeman last year was a key step in this direction.
"The reconciliation between the Czech Republic and Germany is a very important and mutual process," Zeman said during a joint news conference with Steinmeier in Prague in August 2020. "We have raised some issues in the past few weeks, but we accepted solutions that we believe are very good.‚Äù
The declaration is a direct response to the painful history between the two countries, which was marked by violence, death and destruction during and after the Second World War. Tensions between Czechs and Germans reached their peak in the 1940s when Nazi Germany occupied much of the Czech Republic, annexing parts of it as part of Germany.
The brutality of the occupation led to ethnic cleansings, murders, and deportations, and remains a driving force for contemporary Czech-German relations. After the war, the Czech Republic was a staunch ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, while West Germany joined NATO.
Despite the historic divide, the post-war period has seen a stark improvement in relations between the two countries. The latest effort to mend ties has seen representatives of both countries drafting a declaration on mutual understanding intended to help overcome the bitter legacy of the past.
The declaration is envisaged as a guiding light to steer both parties towards greater cooperation, with a renewed focus on shared values and mutual interests. None of this would have been possible without a shared understanding of the dark history between the two nations.
The declaration sets out with the explicit aim of acknowledging the "terrible events" that occurred in the past, while highlighting the new sense of mutual cooperation between the two countries. The draft text of the declaration also affirms that the horrors of the past should never be forgotten.
Representatives from both sides have welcomed the proposed declaration, while expressing hope that it would help to build on the current relationship between the two nations, which is progressing well.
However, concerns still remain about how the declarations will end up being received by the governments of both countries. Some within the German government have been wary of agreeing to language within the document that goes further than simply expressing regret for past mistakes, while others may feel that the text does not go far enough to recognize the suffering endured by the Czech people.
In contrast, Czech politicians, including President Zeman, have been more aggressive in pushing for the statement to be more balanced in its assessment of the past. Zeman has been particularly keen to ensure that the declaration makes clear that the Nazi occupation was a specific and intolerable historical event that cannot be compared with other instances of occupation.
Despite the stances taken by both sides, it is expected that a final agreement will be reached that is acceptable to all involved. If so, the reconciliation declaration will help to cement a sense of shared values and hopes for the future between two nations that have been bitterly divided by history. The move is seen as an important step in furthering the progress made in relations between Germany and the Czech Republic, and in boosting peace and stability throughout Europe.
