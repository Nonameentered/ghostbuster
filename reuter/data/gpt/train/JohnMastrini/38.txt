The Czech Republic’s Justice Minister, Marie Benešová, resigned from both the government and parliament on Monday, bowing to pressure over allegations that she had claimed false academic titles.
Benešová, who is also an attorney, was appointed justice minister in June of last year on the recommendation of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš. However, she landed in hot water after questions were raised about her supposed academic credentials.
The allegations against Benešová centered around two degrees she claimed to have earned from the University of Paris: a master’s degree in law and a doctorate in political science.
However, the university denied that Benešová had ever received these degrees, prompting widespread calls for her to resign.
After initially defying calls to step down, Benešová eventually caved, announcing her resignation on Monday in a statement posted on the government’s official website.
“In light of the recent media coverage regarding my academic titles, I have decided to resign from my position as Minister of Justice,” Benešová said. “I wish to express my regret for the confusion and inconvenience caused by this matter.”
Benešová's resignation represents a significant blow for Babiš, who has faced a number of scandals since coming to power in 2017.
The anti-corruption campaigner, who made his fortune in the food industry, has been under investigation for fraud over allegations that his company received government subsidies intended for small businesses.
Benešová’s resignation comes just days after another key member of Babiš’s government, Labour and Social Affairs Minister Jana Maláčová, resigned over similar allegations of academic fraud.
Despite these setbacks, however, Babiš remains deeply committed to his reform agenda, which he says is intended to reinvigorate the Czech Republic’s economy and promote greater political stability in the country.
“Despite these recent setbacks, I remain fully committed to pursuing meaningful reform and advancing the interests of Czech citizens at home and abroad,” Babiš said in a statement.
For now, it remains unclear who will replace Benešová as justice minister. However, given the sensitivity of this position in the current political climate, it is likely that Babiš will move quickly to name a suitable replacement.
