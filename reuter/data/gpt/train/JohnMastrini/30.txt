Prague, Czech Republic – The Czech crown reached its highest level against the mark/dollar basket in over two years on Wednesday after comments from the country's prime minister, Andrej Babiš.
In a statement to parliament, Babiš said that the Czech Republic's economic recovery was "better than expected" and that he saw no need for continued intervention by the central bank to weaken the currency.
The comments sparked a surge in demand for the crown, which rose as much as 1.2% against the basket, hitting its highest level since March 2019. Against the euro, the currency climbed to its strongest level in over six months.
Analysts say the prime minister's remarks were interpreted as a signal that the central bank may halt or even reverse its policy of keeping the crown weak in order to support exports and inflation.
"The market took the prime minister's words as a sign that the central bank may not be as committed to the intervention policy as it has been so far," said Jan Vejmelek, chief analyst at Komerční banka.
The Czech National Bank has been intervening in the foreign exchange market since 2013, selling the crown to prevent it from appreciating too quickly. The aim has been to boost exports, which account for around 80% of the country's gross domestic product, and to support inflation, which has remained stubbornly below the bank's target of 2%.
However, the central bank has faced criticism for its intervention policy, with some analysts arguing that it artificially depresses interest rates and distorts the financial system.
The bank has defended its actions, saying that the currency interventions are necessary to maintain price stability and support economic growth.
"The Czech National Bank will continue to do everything necessary to keep inflation close to its target and support the functioning of the economy," the bank said in a statement on Wednesday.
Despite the central bank's assurances, some analysts say that the crown's recent strength suggests that the market is testing the bank's resolve.
"The market may be challenging the central bank's ability to intervene effectively and keep the crown weak," said Vejmelek. "If the crown continues to strengthen, the central bank may have to rethink its strategy."
The central bank is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting on June 23, where it is expected to discuss the currency intervention policy.
