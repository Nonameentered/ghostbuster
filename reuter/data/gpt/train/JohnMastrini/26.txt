The Czech Republic has recently received its first Senate since before World War II, after a long-standing debate on the constitutionality of the country's upper house. However, discussions of early general elections have been smothered by political parties and their leaders.
The Senate will be composed of 81 members elected for six-year terms, with one-third of the Senate up for re-election every two years. The new Senate, which was sworn in on Tuesday, will have greater powers and responsibilities, including vetoing decisions made by the majority party in the lower house of parliament.
However, the celebrations surrounding the formation of the new Senate have been overshadowed by the tense political atmosphere in the country. The country's ruling coalition government, led by Prime Minister Andrej Babis, has faced a no-confidence vote in the lower house, which has added to the political discord.
The opposition parties have been rallying for early elections, hoping to capitalize on the discontentment over the government’s handling of the ongoing pandemic. However, they have failed to gain enough support from their colleagues to push the early election plan forward.
Despite the deadlock between the ruling coalition and the opposition parties, President Milos Zeman has called for stability and urged the politicians to focus on the country’s problems and not on the upcoming elections.
Addressing the newly elected Senate on Tuesday, President Zeman said, “I believe that the Senate will interfere into the opinions of the lower house and that it will help to find the delicate balance in our political system.”
“This country doesn’t need an early election,” added Zeman. “It needs stability.”
The new Senate’s first task will be to ensure swift approval of the government’s proposed budget for next year. The ruling party is confident that it has the numbers to push the budget through, but the opposition is eyeing the opportunity to use the budget as a bargaining chip for their political motives.
With the new Senate now in place, the Czech Republic has taken a significant step towards a more balanced political system. However, the country's political environment remains fragile, as the opposition continues to push for early elections and the ruling coalition is working hard to maintain control.
Only time will tell whether the country's politicians can set aside their differences and work towards a common goal for the betterment of the Czech people.
