Prague, Czech Republic - Czech President Vaclav Havel has been moved out of the intensive care unit at the Podoli hospital in Prague, but will have to spend Christmas in the hospital. The 84-year-old former dissident, playwright, and human rights activist was admitted to the hospital on December 8th with respiratory problems.
While Havel's condition has improved, doctors have decided that he needs to remain in the hospital for further observation and treatment. "The president's condition has stabilized, but it is necessary for him to continue treatment at the Podoli Hospital at least until Christmas," his spokesman, Martin Krafl, said in a statement.
Havel, who served as the country's first president after the fall of communism in 1989, has been in poor health for some time. He has suffered from chronic respiratory problems, and underwent surgery to remove a tumor from his lung in 1996. He also had a liver transplant in 1998.
The news of Havel's hospitalization has prompted an outpouring of concern and support from Czech citizens and politicians. The country's current president, Milos Zeman, paid a visit to Havel in the hospital on Tuesday. "I came to see President Havel to wish him well and to express my sincere concern for his health," Zeman said.
Havel, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from US President George W. Bush in 2003, is widely regarded as a symbol of the struggle for democracy and human rights in Central and Eastern Europe. He played a leading role in the Velvet Revolution that brought down communism in Czechoslovakia, and was a key figure in the country's transition to pluralistic democracy.
Many Czechs see Havel as a unifying figure who transcends the country's political divisions. His stay in the hospital over the holiday season has brought renewed attention to his legacy and his enduring influence on Czech politics and society.
As news of Havel's condition spreads, people across the country are sending their wishes for his speedy recovery. One well-wisher, a blogger based in Prague, summed up the sentiment of many: "Thank you, Mr. Havel, for all you have done for our country and for the world. We are thinking of you and hoping for your swift return to good health."
