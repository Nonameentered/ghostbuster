The retired general and former commander of Colombia's armed forces, Jesús Armando Arias Cabrales, has suggested that an attack similar to the one on the Japanese embassy in Lima, Peru, in 1996 should have been carried out during the 1985 Palace of Justice siege in Bogotá, Colombia.
The controversial statement was made during an interview with a local radio station in which Arias Cabrales was discussing the recent false positive scandal in Colombia, where military personnel killed civilians and passed them off as guerrillas to inflate their combat kill records.
When asked about his role in the siege of the Palace of Justice, Arias Cabrales suggested that the military should have attacked the M-19 guerrillas holding the building with greater force, including the use of missiles, and compared the situation to the Japanese embassy siege in Lima 11 years later.
In 1996, 14 members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrilla group stormed the Japanese embassy in Lima, taking over 70 hostages, including the ambassador. The siege lasted 126 days and ended when the Peruvian government launched a military assault on the building, killing all 14 guerrillas and 2 hostages.
Arias Cabrales is well known for his role in the Palace of Justice siege, where 94 people died, including 11 Supreme Court justices. He was later accused of covering up evidence of military involvement in the killings.
The former general's comments have caused outrage among human rights groups and the families of the victims of the Palace of Justice siege.
"This is a disgraceful and insensitive comment from someone who should know better," said Luz Marina Bernal, a human rights activist whose father was killed in the siege. "We should be focused on finding the truth and justice for the victims, not advocating for more violence."
Arias Cabrales has not responded to the criticism, but his comments have sparked a renewed debate about the role of the military in Colombian politics and the need for accountability and justice for past human rights abuses.
The Colombian government has also come under fire for its handling of the false positive scandal, with critics accusing President Iván Duque of failing to address the issue and protect human rights in the country.
Despite these challenges, Colombia has made progress in recent years, with a peace agreement signed between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016, and ongoing efforts to address other issues related to violence and human rights abuses.
