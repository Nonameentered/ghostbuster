FARC, the Marxist guerrilla group in Colombia, has hailed the Peruvian rebel group's attack on the Japanese ambassador's residence as "spectacular and well-planned." The group released a statement on Tuesday congratulating the Peruvian rebels and vowing to continue their mutual struggle "to achieve a better world for all oppressed people."
The attack occurred on Sunday when a group of 20 unidentified gunmen broke into the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, Peru, holding 15 hostages for several hours. The police and army forces managed to rescue the hostages after a standoff, but two soldiers lost their lives during the operation.
The Peruvian rebel group, known as the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was aimed at highlighting the plight of political prisoners in Peru. In a statement, the MRTA demanded the release of their jailed comrades and the implementation of socio-economic reforms to benefit the poor.
The FARC statement praised the MRTA for their "courage and determination" in carrying out the attack and said it was "a blow to the imperialist powers that dominate our continent." The group also called on other rebel groups in the region to unite and intensify their struggle against the ruling elites.
The Colombian government, meanwhile, has condemned the attack and expressed its solidarity with the Japanese ambassador and his staff. President Ivan Duque called it a "cowardly act of terrorism" and vowed to work with Peru to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Some analysts have expressed concern that the FARC's endorsement of the attack may signal a renewed alliance between the two rebel groups. The MRTA and FARC have cooperated in the past, with the MRTA providing training to FARC members in urban warfare tactics.
The attack on the Japanese ambassador's residence has raised questions about security in Lima, which is set to host the upcoming Pan American Games. The Peruvian government has vowed to step up security measures for the event, which will take place from July 26 to August 11, and has called on international partners for help. 
Despite condemnation from governments around the world, the FARC continues to operate in Colombia, and the recent endorsement of the MRTA's actions demonstrates the group's continued active involvement and influence in the region.
