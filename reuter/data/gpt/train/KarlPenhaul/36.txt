A tragic bus crash in the Andes Mountains has left 37 people dead and dozens injured. The accident occurred on a remote stretch of mountain road on Monday evening, and rescue efforts have been hindered by difficult terrain and challenging weather conditions.
The bus was carrying a total of 50 passengers, including several children, when it plummeted off a cliff and crashed into a ravine. The cause of the accident is not yet known, but early reports suggest that heavy rain and fog may have played a role.
Authorities have stated that most of the victims were Peruvian citizens, and that the driver of the bus is among those who were killed. Rescue workers who were able to access the crash site have reported that many of the passengers suffered significant injuries, with some of them still trapped in the wreckage.
Efforts to recover the bodies of the victims have been hampered by the remote location of the crash and the difficult terrain. The area is known for its steep cliffs and rocky terrain, which has made it challenging for rescue teams to access the site.
In addition to the difficult terrain, rescue workers have also had to contend with challenging weather conditions. Heavy rain and fog have made it difficult to see and navigate the area, while low temperatures have made working conditions uncomfortable for those on the scene.
Despite these challenges, rescue efforts have continued around the clock, with teams working tirelessly to reach the victims and recover the bodies of those who have tragically lost their lives. Helicopters have been deployed to airlift some of the injured to nearby hospitals, while other victims have been transported by ambulance.
The Peruvian government has declared a state of emergency in the region, mobilizing resources to support the rescue effort and provide relief to those affected by the crash. The country's president, Pedro Castillo, has expressed his condolences to the families of the victims, calling the accident a "tragedy that has deeply affected us all."
The bus company involved in the accident has issued a statement expressing their own condolences and stating that they are cooperating with authorities in the investigation of the incident. The company has pledged to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of their passengers in the future.
As rescue efforts continue, the focus remains on supporting the victims and their families in the aftermath of this devastating event. With so many lives lost and so many others affected, the impact of this tragedy will be felt for years to come.
