Bogota, Colombia- The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) has refused to release the 10 soldiers and police officers it has held captive for over a month, demanding the demilitarization of an area in the southwest of the country. FARC leaders say the demilitarized area would serve as a safe zone for negotiating a ceasefire and peace agreement with the Colombian government.
The 10 troops were captured by FARC in the southwestern department of Cauca on April 28th. Following their capture, President Juan Manuel Santos ordered a halt to peace talks with FARC and launched a military offensive against the group. However, FARC’s latest demands have thrown the peace process into further uncertainty.
In a statement released on Thursday, FARC called on the government to demilitarize the area around the town of Toribio in Cauca, where the troops are being held. FARC wants a 2.5-mile radius around the town cleared of military personnel and weaponry.
“The government must understand that to achieve peace, we must put an end to the war,” said FARC leader, Timoleon Jimenez, also known as Timochenko.
The Colombian government has refused to meet FARC’s demands, saying it will not negotiate the demilitarization of any area. Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon called FARC’s demands “unacceptable,” while President Santos reiterated that peace talks could only continue if the soldiers and police officers are released.
“I won’t negotiate under pressure,” Santos said. “The only way peace can be achieved is if FARC releases the soldiers and police officers and engages in genuine dialogue at the negotiation table.”
The situation has been further complicated by reports that FARC is recruiting minors to fight for their cause. The Colombian government has accused FARC of kidnapping children and forcing them into the guerrilla army. The United Nations has condemned the practice, calling for the immediate release of all child soldiers.
Both sides have already made significant progress in peace talks, which began in 2012. However, the latest demands from FARC have put the future of the talks in doubt. Meanwhile, the families of the captive troops continue to plead with FARC to release their loved ones.
“Our children didn’t go to war to fight FARC,” said Maria Luisa Angulo, mother of one of the soldiers. “They went to defend their country. They should be released immediately.”
The captives’ families have held several protests and vigils across the country, hoping to pressure FARC into making concessions. However, FARC remains steadfast in its demands, saying it will only release the troops if the government agrees to demilitarize the area around Toribio.
