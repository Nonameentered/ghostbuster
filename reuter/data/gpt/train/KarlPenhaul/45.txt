Mexico's Foreign Minister, Marcelo Ebrard, has criticized the US policy on drug trafficking certification, arguing that it is a unilateral and arbitrary process that undermines the sovereignty of other countries. Speaking at a press conference in Mexico City, Ebrard said that the US practice of certifying countries based on their cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking is flawed and ineffective.
Ebrard's remarks come as the US State Department released its annual report on international narcotics control, which evaluates countries' efforts to combat drug trafficking and production. The report assigns certifications to countries based on their performance, with those failing to meet the standards facing economic sanctions and restrictions on US aid and trade.
According to Ebrard, the US drug policy is based on "a logic of stigmatization and coercion" that ignores the root causes of drug trafficking and the complexities of international cooperation. He argued that the US should work with other countries to address the structural issues of drug production, consumption, and trafficking, rather than using certification as a punitive tool.
Ebrard cited Mexico's efforts to combat drug trafficking and organized crime, including the deployment of the National Guard to border regions and the extradition of drug lords to the US. He criticized the US for failing to recognize Mexico's efforts and for blaming the country for the drug crisis in the US.
"We have deployed all our resources and efforts to fight drug trafficking, but the problem is complex and multi-dimensional," Ebrard said. "We need a comprehensive approach that addresses the demand, supply, and money laundering aspects of the drug trade. The US cannot expect us to solve the problem alone."
Ebrard's criticism of the US drug policy reflects the long-standing tensions between the two countries on the issue of drug trafficking and illegal immigration. The Trump administration has consistently blamed Mexico for failing to control the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US, while Mexico has criticized the US for its gun policy and consumption patterns that fuel the drug trade.
