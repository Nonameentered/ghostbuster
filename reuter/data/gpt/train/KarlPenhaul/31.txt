Former Colombian Rebel Leader Urges Peruvian Guerrillas to Keep Cool in Hostage Crisis
The tense hostage crisis unfolding in the mountains of Peru has captured the world’s attention. The Peruvian military has been locked in a standoff with a faction of the Revolutionary Movement Tupac Amaru (MRTA) since they took 72 diplomats and officials hostage at a reception at the Japanese embassy in Lima on December 17th, 1996. The hostages have been held in the embassy for over 100 days with the rebels demanding the release of imprisoned MRTA members. 
As tensions rise and negotiations stall, many are weighing in on the situation, including a former rebel leader from Colombia. Rodrigo Londoño, also known as Timochenko, was a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) for over 50 years, before it disbanded in 2017 as part of a peace deal with the Colombian government. Londoño has urged the Peruvian guerrillas to keep cool and avoid any actions that may escalate the situation. 
Speaking from a remote location, Londoño told reporters, “I understand the frustration and anger that can come during negotiations, but I implore the MRTA to consider the lives of the hostages, and the potential consequences of their actions. Violence will not resolve this situation, particularly when you are asking for the release of political prisoners. The international community is watching, and your actions will impact the cause you are fighting for.”
The MRTA and FARC have similar roots, both seeking changes in their respective governments. However, Londoño believes that the approach of the MRTA may not be effective. “Kidnapping is never the solution, and it often leads to long-term damage for the cause. Colombia and FARC learned this the hard way. Instead, I suggest investing in peaceful negotiations. Listen and understand the concerns of the people, negotiate for what is important, and work together towards a resolution that benefits all parties involved.”
Londoño’s words come at a critical moment in the hostage crisis. The Peruvian government has stated that it will not negotiate with terrorists, with President Alberto Fujimori refusing to budge from his position of refusing to release any of the prisoners. The MRTA, on the other hand, is growing increasingly desperate, demanding the release of their members in exchange for the hostages. 
It remains to be seen what the consequences of Londoño’s words will be, but the call for peaceful negotiations is one that warrants attention. The world is watching as this historic event unfolds, and the lives of those involved hang in the balance. The hope of many is that a peaceful resolution can be achieved, one that is achieved through dialogue, understanding, and compromise.
