Medellin, Colombia: A car bomb detonated on Sunday evening in the La Candelaria neighborhood of downtown Medellin, killing one woman and injuring dozens of other people. The government of Colombia is suspecting the involvement of drug cartels in the incident.
According to eyewitnesses, the car bomb detonated outside a police station, causing significant damage to nearby buildings and injuring several passers-by. The woman who died in the explosion has been identified as a 32-year-old mother of two.
The authorities have not yet released any information on the perpetrators of the attack, but the Colombian government has long been engaged in a war with various drug cartels operating in the country. Medellin, the second-largest city in Colombia, has been no stranger to such violence, much of which has resulted from competing interests of these drug cartels.
Though no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, the suspicion has fallen on the National Liberation Army (ELN) â€“ the country's largest remaining rebel group. The ELN, which has been in talks with the Colombian government over a peace deal since 2017, has been known to carry out such attacks in the past.
At the same time, Colombia has also seen a rise in drug cartels' violence in recent months. The country saw a record number of homicides in 2020, with many of them linked to drug gangs.
The explosion has created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty in Medellin, a city that has been struggling to overcome its past as the headquarters of Pablo Escobar's notorious Medellin Cartel in the 1990s. The bomb blast was carried out in a part of the city that is known for its bars, restaurants, and nightlife, which is often frequented by tourists.
The authorities have vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice and have promised to provide security for residents of the area. Colombian President Ivan Duque has condemned the attack and has vowed to take all necessary measures to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Sunday night's incident was the first bomb attack in Colombia's second-largest city in over a year. It has brought back memories of the era when Medellin was a battleground in the country's drug wars.
In recent years, the city has undergone significant transformation, becoming a symbol of urban renewal and innovation. However, the recent surge in violence has threatened to undermine its progress and reputation.
The Colombian government has been struggling to tackle the drug cartels that have been a source of much unrest in the country for decades. The latest attack in Medellin highlights the ongoing battle the authorities are waging to keep these groups in check.
