Colombia has been working tirelessly to distance itself from the pariah status that it has long been associated with as a result of its decades-long drug war. Recent efforts to curb drug production and trafficking have caught the attention of the United States, which has long been a key ally in the fight against narcotics in Colombia.
In a statement made by the US ambassador to Colombia, Philip Goldberg, the envoy commended Colombia's progress in fighting drug trafficking, giving credit to President Ivan Duque and his administration for their efforts. The ambassador noted that drug production in Colombia has significantly decreased, while drug seizures have increased.
Goldberg emphasized the importance of the relationship between the US and Colombia in the fight against drug trafficking, highlighting the joint efforts of the two countries in ensuring that drug cartels are shut down and that drug traffickers are brought to justice.
The US State Department's annual report on drug trafficking worldwide, released earlier in 2021, also noted Colombia's progress in fighting drug production and trafficking, saying the country had met the requirements to be removed from the drug watchlist.
According to the report, Colombian law enforcement agencies had seized a record-breaking 498 metric tons of cocaine in 2020, a 26% increase from the previous year. The report also noted that the Colombian government had eradicated over 130,000 hectares of coca, the plant used to produce cocaine, in 2020, which was a 7% increase from the previous year's efforts.
While Colombia's recent successes in fighting drug production and trafficking have been praised, the country still faces several challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the proliferation of drug trafficking groups that have taken advantage of the void left by the demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
In recent years, drug trafficking groups like the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the Gulf Clan have emerged, with the latter becoming one of the most powerful drug trafficking organizations in Colombia.
Another challenge that Colombia faces is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a significant impact on the country's economy. The pandemic has slowed down the progress of government efforts to fight drug trafficking, as many resources have been diverted to battling the virus.
Despite these challenges, Duque's administration has remained focused on the fight against drug trafficking, with the government implementing several measures to combat the problem.
One of the most significant measures has been the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan for the Transformation of the Illegal Crop Use, which aims to substitute illicit crops with legal crops. The plan provides farmers with incentives to switch to crops like cacao, coffee, and fruits, which are more profitable and less harmful to the environment.
The plan has been successful in some areas, with farmers in several regions benefiting from the incentives offered by the government. However, there have been challenges in some regions, with drug trafficking groups using violence and intimidation to prevent farmers from abandoning coca crops.
Despite these challenges, Colombia's fight against drug trafficking has been recognized by the international community, with Goldberg's recent statement highlighting the country's progress in shedding its pariah status.
Colombia's success in fighting drug production and trafficking is not only vital to its own security but also to the safety and stability of the entire region and the world. As the US and Colombia continue to work together in the fight against drugs, there is hope that the progress made so far will continue to bear fruit and lead to a safer, more prosperous future for the country.
