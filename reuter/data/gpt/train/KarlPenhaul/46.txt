Two British yacht owners who were arrested earlier this month on charges of smuggling cocaine have been caught with a second multi-million dollar drug stash in Colombia. Simon Clarke, 49, and Trevor Clark, 51, were detained in Cartagena on May 8 after authorities discovered 1.5 tons of cocaine on their yacht, the SY Nomad.
The duo had been travelling from the Caribbean to Europe when they were intercepted by the Colombian Navy and Anti-Narcotics Police. They were subsequently charged with drug trafficking and faced up to 25 years in prison.
However, the case took a dramatic turn on Wednesday when Colombian authorities announced that a second stash of drugs had been found on a property owned by the pair in the city of Santa Marta. The seizure reportedly included 545 kilos of cocaine, worth an estimated $14 million.
Police said the cocaine was being stored in two underground bunkers on the property, located in the exclusive Taganga area of Santa Marta. The discovery came after a joint operation between Colombian authorities and the UK's National Crime Agency.
"The investigation revealed that Simon Clarke and Trevor Clark had used their yacht and other assets to transport and store cocaine, which was destined for the UK and other European countries," a Colombian police statement said.
The case has attracted international attention and sparked a flurry of media coverage in both the UK and Colombia. Speaking to reporters outside their courtroom in Cartagena earlier this month, Clarke and Clark denied any involvement in drug smuggling and claimed they were simply travelling the world on their yacht.
"We are not drug dealers, we are sailors," Clarke said. "We have no connection to the cocaine found on our yacht. We are innocent and we will fight to clear our names."
Their lawyer, Hernando Villa, has also denied the charges and said his clients were being unfairly targeted by Colombian authorities.
"This is a case of mistaken identity," he said. "My clients are yacht owners and have no connection to drug trafficking. We will do everything in our power to prove their innocence."
The case is set to continue in the coming weeks, with both Clarke and Clark expected to remain in custody for the time being.
