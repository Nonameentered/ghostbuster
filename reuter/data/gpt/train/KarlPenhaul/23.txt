The Colombian oil union has decided to delay their indefinite strike following negotiations with the government. The decision came after the recent arrests of several union members. The union had planned to hold the strike in protest of government policies that they claim have undermined their wages and job security. However, talks between the union and government officials have been ongoing in efforts to resolve their grievances. Union leaders have stated that while they are delaying the strike, they will continue to push for fair treatment of oil workers and hold the government accountable for any mistreatment of their members.
