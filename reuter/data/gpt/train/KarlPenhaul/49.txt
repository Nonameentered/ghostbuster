New peace talks are being scheduled to put an end to Latin America’s longest-running conflict between the government of Colombia and leftist rebels. The President of Colombia, Ivan Duque, has announced that a new round of negotiations will begin soon with the National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia’s last remaining rebel group. The previous peace talks between the government and ELN collapsed in 2019, leaving the country’s political situation in a state of uncertainty.
The Colombian government has been conducting peace negotiations with various leftist groups for over five decades. The government, along with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), successfully signed a peace agreement in 2016, ending a 50-year-long conflict. However, the peace agreement was not honored by all parties, leading to the resurgence of violence in certain regions of the country.
The ELN, which is the largest of the remaining rebel groups in Colombia, has been in conflict with the government since its formation in 1964. The group has carried out numerous attacks on infrastructure, oil pipelines, and other targets in an attempt to destabilize the government and push for more rights for rural areas. The group has been blamed for several bombings and kidnappings in recent years, causing significant social and economic damage.
The new round of peace talks planned by the government comes after several attempts to negotiate with the ELN in the past, which were unsuccessful. Previous negotiations between the government and the ELN stalled due to a series of disagreements between both parties.
In a statement, President Duque has expressed his hopes of ending the country’s protracted conflict through a new peace process. He emphasized that the government is committed to “peace with legality,” meaning that the peace deal will be based on the rule of law and respect for democratic values. The government has also reiterated that while it is committed to achieving peace, it will not tolerate criminal activities by any armed group.
The announcement of the new round of peace talks has been met with both skepticism and optimism. Some Colombian citizens are skeptical of the government's ability to end the conflict given the failures of past negotiations. Others, however, believe that the peace talks are a step in the right direction and hope that they will help reduce violence in the country.
In conclusion, the renewed peace talks between the government and the ELN could bring an end to Colombia’s decades-long conflict, which has caused significant social and economic damage. The success of the new peace talks, however, will depend on the willingness of both parties to compromise and find a lasting solution to the conflict.
