In a bid to nurse the Colombian economy back to health, the President has declared an economic emergency to tackle the mounting fiscal deficit. An economic emergency implies that the government is taking drastic measures to stabilize the economy and avoid a full-blown crisis.
The announcement by the President was made shortly after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasted a gloomy outlook for the country's economy, stating that the forecasted GDP growth rate for Colombia is -8.2% due to the economic fallout caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Colombian government has been hit hard by the pandemic. The decline in oil prices coupled with the fall in global demand has affected the country's revenue sources significantly. Additionally, the lockdown measures imposed by the government to contain the virus have hit businesses and affected consumer spending.
The President's announcement means that the government would be implementing several measures aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit and mending the economy. Some of these include increasing taxes, cutting government spending, and directing resources to sectors such as healthcare, infrastructure, and innovation.
The plan hopes to achieve the necessary reform measures to put the country's economy back on track by 2021 and prevent the current crisis from dragging into the future. President Ivan Duque announced several measures, including cutting public spending by $3.6 billion, shifting funds to productive sectors, and hiking taxes on high-income earners and large corporations.
While these measures are likely to impact negatively on the citizens, the government has promised to cushion the blow by increasing the number of social transfers given as the country enters its 5th month of lockdown.
In a statement, the Governor of the Central Bank of Colombia, Juan Jose Echavarria, praised the President's move and termed it as necessary for the re-emergence of the country's economy. He acknowledged that the measures would cause short-term economic pain, but long-term benefits in a stable economy would be worth it.
The declaration of an economic emergency is expected to restore confidence in the market and reassure investors that the government is taking the necessary steps to stabilize the economy. It is also expected to boost the country's credit ratings globally, which have dropped due to the pandemic crisis, and generate funds to finance the government's ambitious economic recovery plan.
Despite the planned measures, some economists and business community members have raised concerns that the government's economic action plan may not be sufficient to cushion Colombia's economic vulnerabilities. These critics argue that the plan does not adequately address the informal sector, which comprises a significant portion of the country's economy.
In conclusion, President Ivan Duque's economic emergency declaration is a necessary measure if the country has any hopes of bouncing back from the unprecedented effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its economy. The government's measures, coupled with support from the Central Bank, are essential for stimulating growth, fostering development, and minimizing the economic pain that the country has suffered in recent months.
