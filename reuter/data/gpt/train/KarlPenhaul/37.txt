In a daring operation to combat illegal drug trade in Colombia, a US pilot has been lauded as a hero for his bravery and skill.
On September 20, Captain John Peters flew a US-made A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft deep into enemy territory where he successfully destroyed a drug-processing facility in the southern province of Caqueta, a stronghold of drug cartels in Colombia.
The operation, carried out in cooperation with Colombian forces, was part of a joint effort to curb the drug trade in the country, which is responsible for producing the majority of the world's cocaine.
News of Peters's heroic mission spread quickly, with the US Embassy in Bogota praising him for his "professionalism, courage, and dedication to the fight against drugs."
The Colombian government also hailed Peters as a hero, with President Ivan Duque thanking him and his team for their service and commitment to the cause.
"Yesterday reminded us of the importance of international cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking," Duque tweeted. "Thanks to the United States for their continued support in our fight against this scourge."
According to reports, the destroyed drug-processing facility was part of a larger network responsible for producing and distributing cocaine in Colombia and elsewhere.
Peters, a veteran pilot with years of experience in combat operations, was hailed for his precision in targeting the facility and avoiding civilian casualties.
Speaking to reporters after the mission, Peters said he was honored to have played a role in the fight against drugs in Colombia.
"I'm just doing my job," he said. "But I'm proud to be part of a team that's making a difference in the world."
The successful operation comes amid a surge in drug-related violence in Colombia, where cartels have become increasingly aggressive in recent years, often targeting police and military personnel.
However, Peters's mission is seen as a significant victory in the battle against the drug trade and a symbol of the continued partnership between the US and Colombia in the fight against drugs.
