Jailed Chinese dissident Wang Dan receives 11-year sentence and the possibility to appeal.
Wang Dan, a well-known Chinese dissident, has been sentenced to 11 years in prison for "inciting subversion of state power," according to his lawyer. The decision was made by a Beijing court on Friday, July 16.
Wang was arrested in January 2020 and charged with "inciting subversion of state power" for expressing political opinions on social media. When his trial took place in December 2020, his family was not allowed to attend, and Wang's lawyers were only able to meet him briefly.
The Chinese government has been cracking down on dissent in recent years, especially since President Xi Jinping took office in 2013. Wang is just one of many activists who has been targeted by the government for speaking out against its policies.
Wang is a prominent figure in the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement of 1989, which was brutally suppressed by the Chinese government. He was a student leader during the protests and was arrested and imprisoned for several years. He was released in 1998 and went into exile in the United States, where he continued to advocate for human rights in China.
Despite the risks, Wang returned to China in 2016 to continue his activism. He has been a vocal critic of the government's handling of protests in Hong Kong, as well as its treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.
In a statement released by his lawyer, Wang said he had no regrets about his actions and would continue to fight for democracy and human rights in China. "I have always believed that democracy, freedom, and human rights are the fundamental values of human civilization," the statement read. "I will never give up my pursuit of these values, even if I have to pay a heavy price."
Wang's sentencing has been widely condemned by human rights organizations and governments around the world. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted, "We condemn today's sentencing of Wang Dan to 11 years in prison by a Chinese court. The human rights and fundamental freedoms of all individuals should be respected, including those peacefully expressing their views and defending human rights."
Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Regional Director Yamini Mishra said in a statement, "This outrageous sentence is a clear violation of Wang Dan's right to freedom of expression. He is a prisoner of conscience who has been targeted for peacefully expressing his views, and he must be immediately and unconditionally released."
Wang's lawyer told reporters that he plans to appeal the verdict and sentence. "We believe that the evidence presented against Wang Dan is insufficient to support such a heavy sentence," the lawyer said. "We will continue to fight for his rights and freedom."
It is unclear when Wang's appeal will be heard, and what the outcome will be. China's legal system is widely regarded as opaque and subject to political influence, especially in cases involving national security.
Nevertheless, Wang's case has drawn attention to China's crackdown on dissent and its human rights record. The Chinese government has repeatedly dismissed criticism from the international community, saying that it is an internal matter of China's. However, many experts believe that the government's actions are creating a dangerous climate of fear and repression in China.
As the world watches and waits for the outcome of Wang's appeal, the question remains: will the Chinese government continue to silence dissent, or will it allow for greater freedom of expression and respect for human rights?
