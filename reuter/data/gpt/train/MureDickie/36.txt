Beijing, China - Chinese leaders have strongly condemned the unjust exclusion of the country from the World Trade Organisation (WTO), calling the move a violation of international trade rules and a serious impediment to the further development of global trade.
The WTO was established in 1995 to promote international trade and economic development by setting common rules and regulations for all member countries. But China, the world's second-largest economy, was not granted membership until 2001, following years of negotiations and trade disputes with the US and other western countries.
Despite being a member for almost 20 years, China is still facing discrimination and protectionist measures that prevent it from fully participating in the global trade system. The US, in particular, has accused China of trade practices that harm American industries and jobs, and has imposed tariffs on numerous Chinese products.
Chinese officials have repeatedly denied these accusations, stating that China has upheld its WTO obligations and provided fair treatment to foreign businesses operating in the country. They also argue that China has made significant contributions to the global economy and deserves equal treatment under international trade rules.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying urged the US and other countries to respect China's rights and interests as a WTO member and to avoid unilateral actions that undermine the multilateral trading system. "No country should be allowed to bully others, or use its own domestic laws to dictate international trade," she said at a recent press briefing.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang echoed these sentiments, highlighting the importance of free trade and open markets for global economic growth. "We believe that all countries, big or small, strong or weak, should have equal rights and opportunities in international trade," he said in a recent speech.
China has also been pushing for reforms to the WTO that would address some of the organization's shortcomings and make it more efficient and transparent. These reforms include measures to improve dispute settlement mechanisms, ensure the equal treatment of developing countries, and enhance the participation of all member countries in decision-making processes.
While some countries have expressed support for these reforms, others remain skeptical and have resisted China's efforts to play a bigger role in global trade governance. The US, in particular, has blocked the appointment of new judges to the WTO's Appellate Body, leading to a backlog of unresolved disputes and concerns about the future of the organization.
Despite these challenges, China remains committed to upholding the principles of free trade and multilateralism, and to working with other countries to create a fair and level playing field for all. "We hope that all parties will work together to strengthen the WTO and build a more open, inclusive, and balanced global trade system," said Hua.
