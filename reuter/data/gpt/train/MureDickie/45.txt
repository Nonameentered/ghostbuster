Motorola Mobility, a subsidiary of Lenovo Group, has appealed to Chinese authorities over the taxes on capital imports for its $500 million semiconductor plant in China. The U.S.-based technology company believes that the taxes, which are part of China's tariff system designed to protect domestic manufacturers, are discriminatory and potentially damaging to foreign investment.
According to company officials, the facility in Wuhan is the first plant outside the U.S. to produce mobile phone chips, and the investment represents a significant commitment to the Chinese market. However, the taxes on capital imports have added considerable costs to the project and threaten to undermine its viability.
"We are appealing to the Chinese authorities to reconsider the tariffs on capital imports for our semiconductor plant in Wuhan," said Claude Nicollier, Motorola's vice president of manufacturing. "We believe that these tariffs are discriminatory and contrary to China's commitments under the World Trade Organization."
Motorola's appeal comes at a time of heightened tensions between China and the U.S. over trade and technology issues. The Trump administration has made moves to limit Chinese investment in certain sectors and has placed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. In response, China has imposed tariffs on U.S. goods and has taken steps to support domestic industries.
The taxes on capital imports are part of China's broader strategy to promote domestic manufacturing and reduce dependence on foreign technology. However, some critics argue that the policy is protectionist and violates China's international trade obligations. 
In its appeal, Motorola argues that the tariffs on capital imports for its semiconductor plant are not in line with China's trade commitments and could deter foreign investment. The company also claims that it has taken steps to localize its operations in China, including establishing partnerships with local suppliers and hiring local talent.
Motorola's appeal has received support from business groups and industry organizations. The U.S.-China Business Council, a trade group representing American companies doing business in China, has urged the Chinese government to address the concerns raised by Motorola and other companies facing similar issues.
"We support efforts to promote domestic manufacturing and innovation, but policies that unfairly target foreign companies can have unintended consequences," said Craig Allen, president of the USCBC. "We urge the Chinese government to work with foreign companies to create a level playing field and encourage investment in China."
The appeal also highlights the challenges faced by foreign companies operating in China, particularly in sectors that are deemed sensitive by the Chinese government. Despite China's efforts to attract foreign investment, some companies have faced difficulties in accessing the market or have been subject to regulations that are seen as unfair or discriminatory. 
For Motorola, the appeal represents a crucial test of its relationship with Chinese authorities and its ability to navigate the country's complex regulatory environment. The company has invested heavily in China in recent years, and the outcome of the appeal could have implications for its future operations in the country.
"We remain committed to the Chinese market and to working with Chinese authorities to create a level playing field for foreign companies," said Nicollier. "We hope that our appeal will result in a positive outcome that benefits both Motorola and China's economy."
