China's Power Minister Pledges to Protect Foreign Investor Interests in Power Generation Investment
In a move aimed at foreign investors, China's power minister has pledged to protect their interests in power generation investment. The announcement follows concerns by some investors about the government's recent actions to increase control over the sector.
"The Chinese government is committed to creating a level playing field for all investors, both domestic and foreign," said Power Minister Zhang Jianhua at a press conference on Monday. "We will take all necessary measures to ensure that foreign investors' interests are protected."
Mr. Zhang noted that China has made significant progress in improving the investment climate for foreign companies over the years. The country has brought down its negative list of sectors closed to foreign investment from 63 to 33, and it has promised to further open up its markets to foreign firms.
However, investors from some countries have expressed concerns about the government's recent actions to increase its control over certain sectors, including power generation. The government has sought to promote state-owned enterprises while at the same time cracking down on debt-ridden firms.
In response to these concerns, Mr. Zhang stated that China welcomes investment from all countries, regardless of their political systems or ideologies. He also pledged to create more opportunities for foreign investors to enter China's power generation market.
"We are committed to building a transparent, fair and competitive investment environment for all investors," he said. "We will continue to open up our markets and promote international trade and investment."
Foreign investors have long been attracted to China's power generation sector, which is the largest in the world. The country has dominated the global market for renewable energy, with solar and wind power accounting for two-thirds of new capacity added in 2020.
Despite these successes, however, the Chinese government has faced criticism for its treatment of foreign firms in the past. Some investors have complained of unequal treatment compared to domestic companies, while others have accused the government of infringing on their intellectual property rights.
In light of these concerns, Mr. Zhang's pledge to protect foreign investors' interests will likely be welcomed by the international business community. It is hoped that his commitment will translate into concrete actions by the Chinese government to improve the investment environment for foreign companies in the power generation sector.
"Countries like China play an increasingly important role in the global economy," said John Denton, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce. "It is essential that they work to improve the investment climate for foreign companies to ensure sustainable economic growth for all."
