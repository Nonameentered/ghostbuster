Beijing Accuses United States of Pursuing Hostile Policies towards China, Defends Campaign to Boost Patriotism
China has begun to accuse the United States of attempting to pursue hostile policies towards China. This comes after the US issued a statement expressing "concerns regarding China's recent actions in Hong Kong, human rights abuses, and unfair trade practices."
In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, stated that the United States is responsible for the current tensions between the two countries. Hua suggested that the US was engaging in a campaign of "smear, libel, and attack" against China.
The Chinese authorities have also launched a campaign to boost patriotism among the Chinese people. The focus of the campaign is to promote national pride and to encourage people to support the Communist Party of China (CPC).
The campaign, called "Positive Energy," was launched after President Xi Jinping urged citizens to "carry forward the spirit of patriotism and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
The campaign includes a series of events and activities aimed at promoting patriotism. These include nationalistic films, patriotic songs, and the promotion of traditional Chinese culture.
While the Chinese authorities have defended the campaign as a way of promoting unity and national pride, critics have suggested that it is merely an attempt by the CPC to maintain control over the population.
Wu Qiang, a former politics professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University, suggested that the campaign was "a warning to society that the Communist Party's stance is the only legitimate one."
Wang Dan, a former student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, suggested that the campaign was "an attempt by the Chinese leadership to divert attention away from the country's problems and increasing authoritarianism."
The Chinese authorities have dismissed such criticism, stating that the campaign is aimed at promoting the country's cultural heritage and its achievements. However, critics have pointed out that the campaign is heavily focused on promoting the role of the CPC and its leadership in China's development.
The increasing tensions between China and the United States are causing concern around the world. The two nations have been engaged in a trade war for the last two years, with the US imposing tariffs on Chinese goods in an attempt to reduce the US trade deficit with China.
China has responded with similar tariffs, and the dispute has had an impact on the global economy. In addition, tensions have also grown over China's actions in Hong Kong, where the government has been accused of suppressing pro-democracy protests.
The United States has expressed support for the protesters, while China has accused the US of interfering in its internal affairs.
Despite the growing tensions, there are still many who believe that the two nations can find a way to work together. Tony Blair, the former UK Prime Minister, has suggested that the US and China need to "work together to solve the world's biggest challenges."
Blair suggested that the two nations should focus on global issues such as climate change and international terrorism and work together to find solutions.
Whether the two nations can find a way to overcome their differences remains to be seen. However, the recent accusations and campaigns in China suggest that tensions are likely to remain high for some time.
