Beijing – Chinese authorities on Monday defended the detention of a well-known dissident lawyer, Gao Zhisheng, insisting that it is not a human rights issue but rather a matter of national security and social stability.
Gao, who had been missing for years and was feared dead, was recently found to have been secretly imprisoned since 2017, according to his family. The activist had been known for his outspoken opposition to China’s human rights abuses and had represented many activists and religious minorities, including Falun Gong practitioners.
However, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian dismissed criticism of Gao’s arrest, saying that the lawyer had committed “illegal and criminal acts” that threatened national security and social stability.
“As a country governed by law, China’s handling of cases involving Gao Zhisheng is in line with legal procedures and practices,” Zhao told reporters at a regular press briefing. “His case is not related to human rights.”
Gao’s family, who have been campaigning for his release, are reportedly dismayed by the Chinese authorities’ response. His brother, Gao Zhiyi, described the claims of illegal activity as “baseless” and called for an independent investigation into his detention.
“Gao Zhisheng is a human rights lawyer whose only ‘crime’ was to stand up for justice and freedom,” Gao Zhiyi said in a statement. “China’s claim that his detention is not a human rights issue is a mockery of justice and the rule of law.”
The controversy over Gao Zhisheng’s case comes amid growing concerns over China's human rights record, including its treatment of minority groups such as the Uighurs in Xinjiang and its crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.
Many human rights campaigners have called for Gao’s release, pointing out that his case is just one of many examples of China’s disregard for the rights of its citizens.
“China uses vague and overly broad laws to punish individuals who dare to speak out against the government,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. “Gao Zhisheng’s detention is yet another example of how China’s legal system is used to suppress dissent.”
Others have suggested that Gao’s detention is part of a wider crackdown on lawyers and activists in China over the past decade, which has seen scores of people jailed or harassed for defending human rights or criticizing the government.
In 2015, Gao was released from a previous spell of imprisonment, during which he was reportedly tortured and held incommunicado. Following his release, he went missing again in 2017 and was feared dead until his family recently discovered that he had been imprisoned in a remote part of Xinjiang.
Gao’s case has attracted international attention, with several governments, including the US and UK, expressing concern about his detention and calling for his release.
However, China has dismissed such criticism as interference in its internal affairs and rejected calls for an independent investigation into Gao’s detention.
“China is a sovereign state and we will not accept any interference in our judicial and legal affairs,” said Zhao. “We urge relevant countries to respect China’s sovereignty and judicial independence, and refrain from using human rights as an excuse to meddle in China’s internal affairs.”
Despite such protests, human rights activists say that China’s record on human rights is a matter of global concern and should not be ignored by the international community.
“China’s repression of lawyers, activists, and religious and ethnic minorities is getting worse,” said Richardson. “The international community must speak out against these abuses and hold China accountable for its human rights violations.”
