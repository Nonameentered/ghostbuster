BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese court has sentenced a leading dissident, Xu Zhiyong, to 11 years in prison on charges of "inciting subversion" and "disturbing public order," despite widespread criticism from western governments and rights groups.
Xu, a well-known advocate for government transparency and human rights, was arrested in July 2013 and initially detained for six months before being formally charged. The Chinese government has accused Xu and his associates of organizing a series of protests and online campaigns aimed at advocating for political reform and greater civil liberties.
Xu's trial was held behind closed doors, with few details about the proceedings made public. The court found him guilty of “inciting subversion”, and he was sentenced to 11 years in prison.
“The charges against him are extremely vague and seem to be politically motivated. It’s very clear that Xu’s only ‘crime’ is that he has spoken out against the government’s failings,” said Maya Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The Chinese government has vigorously denied that Xu's imprisonment is a human rights issue, arguing that he was prosecuted strictly according to Chinese law and that he had received a fair trial.
"The relevant Chinese judicial authorities conducted the trial of Xu Zhiyong in strict accordance with the law, protected his legal rights, and issued a judicial verdict based on the facts and evidence presented at the trial,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said at a news conference.
The sentencing of Xu has been widely condemned by Western countries and human rights groups. Commenting on the verdict, the United States said it was "deeply disturbed" and called for his release. "The United States calls on the Chinese authorities to release Xu and all other political prisoners immediately and to allow them to freely express their views," said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.
The European Union also criticized the decision to sentence Xu, calling it "disappointing" and urging for his release. "The European Union deplores this situation and reiterates the importance of respecting fundamental freedoms, including the right to a fair and public trial," said Catherine Ray, the EU's spokesperson for foreign affairs.
Xu's imprisonment is likely to further strain relations between China and the West, with many governments already critical of Beijing's human rights record. Despite these criticisms, the Chinese government has remained steadfast in its crackdown on dissidents and activists, citing the need for social stability and national security.
