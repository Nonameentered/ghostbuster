Senior U.S. Arms Control Official Encouraged by Chinese Efforts to Control Nuclear Exports, but Beijing Says Taiwan Remains Key Issue in Talks
The United Statesâ€™ senior arms control official has recently expressed his appreciation for China's efforts in controlling nuclear exports. However, China remains vocal about its concerns regarding the United States' arms deal with Taiwan.
Marshall Billingslea, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for arms control, praised China's efforts in enforcing export controls on materials with nuclear applications in an address on Thursday. Billingslea described China's efforts as "completely appropriate and in line with international norms and standards."
Billingslea's remarks were delivered at a virtual event hosted by the Arms Control Association, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting effective arms control policies. During the event, Billingslea underlined the importance of China's participation in ongoing negotiations to extend the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) agreement. The treaty aims to limit the number of nuclear weapons held by the United States and Russia.
The Chinese government has yet to signal whether it is willing to extend the treaty, which is set to expire in February of next year. Billingslea warned that China's exclusion from the treaty could lead to an "arms race that would be hugely destabilizing for the region."
Despite the positive sentiment toward China's nuclear controls, Beijing has reiterated its concerns over the United States' arms deal with Taiwan. A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian, issued a statement on Friday, stating that the sale of U.S. weaponry to Taiwan undermined China's national security interests.
"China firmly opposes any arms sale to Taiwan by any country in any form," Zhao said. "If the U.S. continues to pursue this path, China will take necessary measures to safeguard our national interests."
The United States has been a long-standing supporter of Taiwan's military, selling them arms and supporting their defense efforts. The arms deals between the United States and Taiwan have not gone unnoticed by Chinese officials, who have repeatedly expressed their outrage and asked that they be terminated.
In 2018, the Trump administration approved the sale of $2.2 billion worth of arms to Taiwan, which included 108 M1A2 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles. This was met with vocal criticism from China's Foreign Ministry, who reportedly summoned the U.S. ambassador to China to issue a formal protest.
The Chinese government considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province and has repeatedly threatened to take military action if Taiwan ever declares formal independence.
Despite the ongoing tensions, Billingslea remained optimistic about the future of arms control negotiations between China and the United States. In his remarks, he stressed the importance of cooperation between both countries, especially as the world was currently facing unprecedented challenges.
"Effective arms control agreements contribute directly to global stability and security," Billingslea said. "It is imperative that China and the United States work together to ensure that our nuclear arsenals do not become the accelerant of global instability and conflict."
However, it remains to be seen whether China will prioritize arms control negotiations over their concerns about the United States' relationship with Taiwan. With the treaty set to expire in a matter of months, both countries will need to come to a resolution soon if they hope to avoid an arms race that could destabilize the entire region.
