Beijing, China -- Chinese leaders have expressed their dissatisfaction with what they perceive as unfair treatment from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). They accuse the international trading body of deliberately excluding China from its rule-making process, despite the country being one of the world's largest economies.
According to Chinese officials, this exclusion has resulted in discriminatory policies that have hindered the country's economic growth. Vice-Premier Hu Chunhua has spoken out against the WTO's decision to limit Chinese firms' access to certain markets, citing it as an example of the organisation's bias.
"We strongly condemn any discrimination or unfair treatment based on unfounded allegations or political considerations," Hu said at a press conference on Tuesday. "This is not only an unjust decision but also a serious violation of the principles of the WTO."
China's stance has been echoed by other emerging economies, including India and Brazil. These countries argue that the WTO's rules are more favorable to established economies such as the US and Europe, and that their voices are often ignored in negotiations.
However, some experts are skeptical of the claims made by China and other emerging economies. They argue that the WTO is a rules-based organization that treats all members equally. "The WTO's purpose is to devise rules that benefit all members, not just a few," said Robert Koopman, chief economist at the WTO. "It is designed to make sure that trade is fair and predictable for everyone."
Koopman added that China has been a significant beneficiary of the WTO's rule-making process, and that the country's export-led growth model would not have been possible without the global trading system's support.
But critics argue that the WTO has not done enough to ensure that its rules are fair for all members. They point to recent trade disputes between the US and China as evidence of a lack of impartiality in the organisation's decisions.
In 2018, the US imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in response to what it claimed were unfair trade practices. The two countries engaged in a bitter trade war that lasted for over a year and resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides. Many of the issues in the dispute concerned intellectual property theft and the forced transfer of technology from US firms operating in China.
China argued that the US did not follow the WTO's established protocol for resolving trade disputes, and accused it of using tariffs as a political tool to harm China's economy. Officials in Beijing have also expressed frustration with the WTO's inability to resolve the dispute to their satisfaction.
With the US administration having recently changed, it remains to be seen whether the two countries will be able to resolve their differences through dialogue and compromise, or whether they will continue to rely on tariffs and other measures that risk damaging economic relations.
Meanwhile, China and other emerging economies will continue to push for greater representation in the WTO. They argue that the body's decision-making process must be more transparent and inclusive, and that the concerns of all members must be taken into account in its rule-making.
As the world's trading dynamics continue to shift and evolve, it is likely that the role of the WTO will become increasingly contested. The organization will be faced with the challenge of balancing the interests of established and emerging economies while also remaining true to its principles of impartiality and fairness.
