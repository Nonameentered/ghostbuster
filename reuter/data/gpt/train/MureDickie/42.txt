Beijing, China – The Chinese Government has welcomed the visit of the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, to Beijing for talks on trade, climate change and human rights. However, Chinese officials have warned that the countries have “significant differences” on these issues.
The talks between the two nations come as global leaders prepare for the United Nations’ Climate Change Conference in Glasgow later this year. China and the U.S. are the top two carbon-emitting nations and will play a crucial role in setting global targets and reducing emissions.
“China is ready to work with the United States to enhance mutual understanding, manage differences, expand cooperation, and promote constructive and healthy development of China-U.S. relations,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, at a press conference in Beijing ahead of Blinken’s arrival.
But, Zhao also warned that China would defend its sovereignty and would not tolerate any “interference in China's internal affairs” or “groundless accusations” on issues like Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Taiwan.
Blinken, who arrived in Beijing after visiting Japan and South Korea, echoed similar sentiments on finding areas of cooperation as well as addressing the “tough issues.”
In a joint press conference with his Japanese counterpart, Blinken had said the U.S. was committed to promoting peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait while also acknowledging China’s concerns on the issue. He had also said that the U.S. would advocate for Hong Kong’s autonomy and human rights in Xinjiang.
However, China has rejected any criticism or interference in its domestic affairs with officials warning that any such attempts would be met with a firm response.
On the economic front, Blinken has said that the U.S. wanted to have a “level playing field” and fairer trade relations with China. The two countries have been locked in a trade war, and the Biden administration has yet to make a decision on whether to roll back tariffs imposed by the previous administration on Chinese imports.
Before departing for Beijing, Blinken had also said that he would raise the issue of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where Chinese authorities have been accused of forcibly detaining and “re-educating” Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities. China has vehemently denied the allegations and has defended its actions as necessary measures to counter terrorism and separatism.
“Certainly, I think the reports that we've seen…are very troubling,” Blinken said in a CNN interview. “I think it is incumbent upon us and others to speak out against these abuses and to try to take action to prevent them.”
Critics, however, have accused the U.S. of “selective” outrage on human rights and have pointed out that the U.S. also has its own issues with police brutality, racism and voting rights.
The talks between the two nations are expected to be difficult as Blinken seeks to balance cooperation on climate change and the pandemic with addressing human rights and trade issues.
China’s state-run media have also weighed in on the visit, with the Global Times newspaper warning that the U.S. should not try to corner China and that any confrontation would be “futile.”
“Any attempts by the U.S. to pressure China, interfere in its internal affairs or make unreasonable demands in the dialogue will be hard and meaningless,” the editorial read.
On social media, the visit has also attracted widespread attention with netizens from both countries sharing their views. While some have welcomed the dialogue between the two nations, others have expressed concern over the lack of progress on human rights and trade issues.
The talks between the U.S. and China will be closely watched by the rest of the world, especially as the two nations are key global players. The success of the visit will depend on whether both sides can find common ground on the key issues facing the world today.
