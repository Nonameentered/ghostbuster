As China marks the 155th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth on November 12th, the country reflects on the legacy of the founding father of the Republic of China and his vision for reunification with Taiwan and national unity.
Sun, also known as Sun Zhongshan, was a Chinese revolutionary, philosopher, and politician who played a pivotal role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912. He is widely revered in China as the “Father of the Nation” and his legacy is celebrated annually on his birthday, which is also a national holiday.
One of Sun's most significant contributions to Chinese politics was his advocacy for reunification with Taiwan. During his tenure as President of the Republic of China, he made several attempts to reconcile with the Taiwanese people and advocated for peaceful reunification based on a “one country, two systems” framework.
Today, the issue of reunification with Taiwan remains a top priority for the Chinese government, and Sun's vision of a unified China is still seen as a critical national objective. For Chinese leaders, the reunification of Taiwan is a matter of national sovereignty, and any attempt to challenge that sovereignty is viewed as an attack on the integrity of the Chinese state.
In recent years, tensions between China and Taiwan have escalated, with Beijing accusing Taipei of promoting independence and many Taiwanese people opposing China's political and economic influence on the island. As China continues to assert its territorial claims over Taiwan, the legacy of Sun Yat-sen remains a symbol of hope for a peaceful reunification in the future.
Aside from his advocacy for reunification, Sun's legacy also includes his vision for national unity. He believed that political stability and social progress could only be achieved through a united China, where all citizens, regardless of their ethnicity or religious beliefs, would have equal rights and opportunities.
During his lifetime, Sun worked tirelessly to promote national unity, even going so far as to declare his support for the Chinese Communist Party as a means of ending the country's civil war and bringing about peace and reconciliation.
Today, the call for national unity remains a fundamental principle of the Chinese government, and the legacy of Sun Yat-sen continues to inspire China's leaders to promote social harmony and unity among the country's diverse population.
As the Chinese people celebrate the legacy of Sun Yat-sen, the country looks to the future with hope and optimism, continuing to build on the foundations laid down by its founding father to achieve greater political stability, social progress, and national unity.
Despite the challenges facing China today, from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to the tensions with Taiwan and other nation-states, the legacy of Sun Yat-sen serves as a reminder of the country's resilience and the determination of its people to overcome adversity and build a brighter future for all.
In a statement released to mark the anniversary of Sun's birth, Chinese President Xi Jinping praised the founding father for his contributions to modern China and urged the Chinese people to uphold his legacy and work towards a peaceful and united future.
"As we celebrate the legacy of Sun Yat-sen, we must redouble our efforts to promote national unity, social harmony, and international cooperation," Xi said in the statement.
"We must build on the achievements of the past and work together to create a better future for our country and our people. Let us remember the vision of Sun Yat-sen and the sacrifices made by our forefathers to build our nation and inspire us to continue their work for generations to come."
