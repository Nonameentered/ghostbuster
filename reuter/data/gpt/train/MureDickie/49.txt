China's chosen child monk celebrates quietly in Beijing
Beijing, China - The city of Beijing witnessed a solemn event that was attended by hundreds of devotees. The event was the anniversary of the ordination of the new child monk. The eight-year-old boy named Sangay Dorjee is considered to be the "chosen one" who will continue the all-male monastic tradition of one of China's most important Buddhist monasteries.
Sangay was chosen at a young age to become the new head of the famous Yonghe Temple in Beijing, the fresco-filled jewel of Tibetan Buddhism in China. The temple, more commonly known as the Lama Temple, is the largest and most extravagant Tibetan monastery in China, and one of the most revered, housing some of the country's most important relics and artifacts.
The child monk was announced as the new head of the temple in May 2020, succeeding his predecessor, Master Yinguo. Since then, Sangay has been undergoing rigorous training to prepare himself for his future as a spiritual leader and head of the monastery.
While Thursdayâ€™s anniversary was an important event for the monastery, the family and followers of Sangay kept the celebrations low-key due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Only a limited number of devotees were allowed to enter the temple to celebrate the ordination anniversary with the new head monk.
The ceremony took place in the main hall of the temple, where the child monk paid homage to the Buddha and sought blessings from his spiritual teachers. He recited mantras and prayers in Tibetan language, while the devotees lit incense sticks and offered flowers and khatas, traditional ceremonial scarves, as offerings.
Many of the followers present at the ceremony were emotional and expressed their hopes for the future of the monastery under the guidance of the young monk.
"I'm very happy to be here today to witness such an important moment in the history of our temple," said Lhamo, a devout Buddhist. "I believe Sangay will bring positive changes to our temple and help its followers grow spiritually."
Despite his young age, Sangay has already won the hearts of many of the temple's followers with his serene nature and his eagerness to learn about the teachings of Buddha.
The child monk's journey to becoming the head of the monastery was a long and complicated one. He was born in India to refugee parents who had fled Tibet in the 1990s. Sangay and his family later moved to China, where he was spotted by the abbot of the Yonghe Temple while playing with his siblings. The abbot believed him to be the child destined to lead the monastery after an old monk's death, in line with tradition.
The Chinese government, with whom the temple has had a complicated history, has fully supported the succession of Sangay as the head monk. Officials have lauded the choice of the child as a symbol of China's openness to different religious faiths and their desire to preserve cultural heritage.
The succession of Sangay has been controversial for some members of the Tibetan community, who believe that the Chinese government is using Tibetan heritage for propaganda purposes. However, the temple and the government have stated that the succession is in line with a centuries-old tradition that has been practiced by the temple throughout its history.
The ordination anniversary of the new child monk was a significant event for the monastery and its followers, marking the beginning of a new era for the temple, which will eventually be led by the young and inspiring head monk, Sangay Dorjee.
