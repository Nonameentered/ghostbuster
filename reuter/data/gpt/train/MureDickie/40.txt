The Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has accused Western nations of conspiring with pro-independence activists to split China. This statement came amid rising protests in the region and a growing separatist movement.
Chairman Shohrat Zakir made the comments at a press conference following a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Xinjiang Regional People's Congress. Zakir claimed that Western nations were supporting pro-independence activists in a bid to weaken China's territorial integrity.
"The separatist forces in Xinjiang are nothing more than pawns of Western countries," said Zakir. "They are being used to try and split China and undermine our sovereignty."
Zakir singled out the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western nations as the main culprits behind the separatist movement. He accused these countries of using "double standards" and "hypocrisy" in their handling of Xinjiang.
"Western countries are quick to criticize China on human rights issues, but they turn a blind eye when it comes to our sovereignty and territorial integrity," said Zakir.
Zakir's comments were met with strong criticism from Western governments and human rights groups. The US State Department issued a statement condemning China's treatment of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang, including Uyghurs and other Muslim communities.
"We urge China to respect the human rights and dignity of all people, including those in Xinjiang," said the statement.
Human rights groups have accused China of operating a system of internment camps in Xinjiang, where Uyghurs and other minorities are subjected to political re-education, forced labor, and other abuses. China has denied these allegations, saying that the camps are vocational training centers designed to combat extremism and terrorism.
However, these claims have done little to quell the growing separatist movement in the region. Pro-independence activists have continued to call for greater autonomy for Xinjiang, with some advocating for full independence from China.
The Chinese government has responded to these calls with increased surveillance and repression. Xinjiang has been placed under heavy government control, with restrictions on internet access, mobile phones, and other technologies.
Zakir's comments suggest that China is taking a hardline approach to the separatist movement, with little room for compromise. The Chinese government has made it clear that it sees any attempt to split the country as a direct challenge to its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
As such, it seems unlikely that the separatist movement in Xinjiang will be resolved anytime soon. The international community will need to continue to pressure China on human rights issues while also working to support the rights of ethnic minorities in the region. Only through sustained efforts can we hope to find a peaceful and just resolution to this ongoing conflict.
