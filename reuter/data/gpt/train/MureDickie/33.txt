Beijing, China – With the results of the United States presidential election now confirmed, Beijing is hoping for a fresh approach from Washington when it comes to maintaining and improving Sino-U.S. ties.
China’s government has long been working to foster closer diplomatic and economic relations with the U.S., but tensions have escalated in recent years due to disagreements over trade, human rights issues, and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As a result, there is a sense of cautious optimism that the new Biden administration can help to reset the relationship between the two countries.
One of the areas where Beijing is hoping to see progress is in trade negotiations. The Trump administration initiated a trade war with China in 2018, implementing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods, and China in turn retaliated with tariffs of their own. This disrupted global trade flows and sent shockwaves throughout the global economy.
While President-elect Joe Biden has yet to outline his approach to this issue in detail, there are signs that he may be more willing to work with China rather than taking a combative stance. In an interview with The New York Times earlier this year, Biden said that he did not believe that China was “our enemy,” and that he would aim to work with allies to confront China in a more collaborative manner.
“I think we need to build up our alliances. We need to demonstrate that democracies can still compete and win in the 21st century,” he said.
China’s government has been careful to avoid commenting too much on U.S. domestic politics, but officials have expressed hope that the incoming administration will take a more pragmatic and constructive approach to trade negotiations.
“We hope the new U.S. administration can meet China halfway to promote the healthy and stable development of China-U.S. economic and trade relations,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a press conference last week.
Another area where Beijing is looking to improve relations is in the area of human rights. The Trump administration was vocal in its criticism of China’s treatment of minority groups such as the Uighurs in Xinjiang and the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and it remains to be seen whether the Biden administration will take a similar approach.
In response to these concerns, Chinese officials have defended their government’s actions. In a speech earlier this year, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the U.S. of “smearing” China’s human rights record, and said that China was “committed to promoting and protecting human rights in a people-centered manner.”
Despite these differences, there are some areas where China and the U.S. will need to work together, particularly when it comes to tackling global issues such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Both countries have the potential to be leaders in these areas, but cooperation will be crucial in order to make meaningful progress.
China was one of the first countries to be hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and its strict lockdown measures helped to contain the spread of the virus. However, the government has faced criticism over its transparency and handling of the early stages of the outbreak.
In recent months, Beijing has sought to improve its image on the global stage, providing aid and medical supplies to other countries and offering to share any potential COVID-19 vaccine it develops.
On the issue of climate change, China has emerged as a global leader, with President Xi Jinping emphasizing the importance of reducing emissions and transitioning to a cleaner, more sustainable economy. The U.S. under the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, but President-elect Biden has pledged to rejoin on his first day in office.
Beijing will be looking for a more cooperative approach from Washington on these issues, as well as a renewed commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation.
Overall, the incoming administration presents an opportunity for both China and the U.S. to reset their relationship and work towards a more stable, productive partnership. While there are certainly areas of significant disagreement, there is also scope for collaboration and joint action on shared global challenges.
Whether or not this will happen remains to be seen, but for Beijing, the hope is that the new administration will approach Sino-U.S. ties with a fresh perspective and a willingness to engage in dialogue and cooperation.
