Leaders from nations along the Mekong River, known as the Mekong Region, have come together to explore ways to boost cooperation and infrastructure development to encourage economic growth and improve the livelihood of the 240 million people who live along the river.
The Mekong River, which flows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, has become a key strategic and economic waterway in the region, providing access to trade and transportation for millions of people.
The gathering of leaders took place during the Mekong-Japan Summit, where the Japanese government pledged Â¥750 billion ($6.8 billion) in aid, acknowledging the importance of the Mekong Region and its potential to the global economy.
Under the framework of the "Mekong-Japan Cooperation," the leaders of the Mekong nations and Japan agreed to work closely together on infrastructure projects, including road and water transportation, power grids, and other critical infrastructure needs.
Prime Minister of Japan, Yoshihide Suga, told leaders during the summit that Japan would be committed to backing the region's sustainable growth and would provide aid towards improving its infrastructure. "Japan will lead the international support for the Mekong region's sustainable development," Suga said.
The aid package offered by Japan is structured to provide for three main components: connectivity, human resources development, and Covid-19 response.
Japan will set up an office in Southeast Asia to coordinate the aid and to provide support for each country's needs. The package also seeks to help the Mekong nations in adopting the latest technologies to fight climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Leaders from the Mekong nations welcomed Japan's support, saying that the aid would help to boost cooperation, trade, investment, and the region's economic growth.
"The development of Mekong nations has over the years been hindered tremendously due to inadequate infrastructure," said Laotian Prime Minister, Phankham Viphavanh.
He went on to say that the Mekong nations recognized the importance of regional connectivity and that Japan's investment in the region would go a long way to promote economic growth and development.
The Mekong Region countries are expected to make final decisions on project selection in the coming months, but the infrastructure development plan is estimated to help boost trade, promote tourism, and improve the overall standard of living in the region.
As nations around the world continue to struggle with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the cooperation between the Mekong River nations and Japan is seen as a positive step for the global economy. By working together, the nations hope to create a model for economic growth and sustainable development in the region that could serve as an example for other nations.
