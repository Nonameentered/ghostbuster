The Swedish Prime Minister, Stefan Löfven, confronted his Chinese counterpart, Premier Li Keqiang, during a bilateral meeting over the issue of a jailed dissident. The meeting took place on Tuesday during Li's visit to Sweden.
Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen, was arrested by Chinese authorities in 2015 for selling books critical of the Chinese Communist Party. He was released in 2017 but was again arrested in January 2018 while on a train to Beijing with two Swedish diplomats. Gui was then paraded on Chinese state television, making a forced confession to a drunk-driving offence that Swedish officials say was entirely fabricated.
Löfven raised his concerns about Gui's case during the meeting with the Chinese premier. "We are very concerned about the situation with Gui Minhai," he told Li. "A Swedish citizen has been denied his rights in your country. We expect Gui Minhai to receive proper medical attention and be released immediately."
Li responded by saying that Gui's case was an internal matter for China and emphasized that the country was committed to upholding the rule of law. He added that China respected Sweden's judicial system and expected Sweden to respect China's, while calling for mutual respect between the two countries.
The Chinese premier went on to say that he hoped both countries would work together to resolve any issues, emphasizing that "sound and stable" China-Sweden ties were essential for the benefit of both countries.
After the meeting, Löfven expressed his disappointment with Li's response. "It's not good enough that a person is not getting the assistance he's entitled to. We spoke about the rule of law, and I think that also includes making sure that a person has the right to a proper defence and to be seen by a doctor when they need it," he said at a press conference.
The Swedish Foreign Minister, Ann Linde, who accompanied Löfven during the meeting, tweeted that the Swedish government was "extremely concerned" about Gui's health and called for his release.
Gui, who suffers from a neurological disease, has reportedly been denied medical care while in custody and has been subjected to endless interrogations. He is believed to be held in a secret detention facility in China and has been denied contact with family and friends.
Gui's case has strained relations between China and Sweden, with Sweden's handling of the case criticized by some Chinese officials. However, the Swedish government has insisted that it will continue to seek Gui's release and ensure the protection of his rights as a Swedish citizen.
