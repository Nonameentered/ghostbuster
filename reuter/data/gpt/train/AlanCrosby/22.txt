Prague, Czech Republic- The Czech Republic’s monthly trade deficit has eased off in the month of October, coming in at CZK 6.6bn ($287mn), a figure surprisingly lower than analyst’s expectations. This drop is attributed to a boost in commodity exports and a slower rise in imports during the month. This unexpected improvement in trade balance has provided a significant boost to market sentiment and is a significant break from the country’s previous three consecutive months of trade deficit.
Analysts had forecasted a rise in October trade deficit to around $371mn following September’s gap of $316mn. But the improvement in balance of trade is a result of a stronger performance in key export sectors like automobile and engineering, which have witnessed a steady rise in demand in recent months. Also, imports grew only marginally which helped in curbing the expansion of the deficit.
“The improvement is suggestive of some underlying strengths and demand for our products of late despite a complex geopolitical situation in our neighbourhood” said Commerce Minister Marta Novakova while talking about the recent data. The competitiveness of Czech currency also played an important role in keeping prices of export products lower than competing economies, added Novakova.
The country’s automobile industry, which accounts for a major share of exports, has grown at a robust pace and is expected to maintain its positive momentum. Similarly, engineering exports have benefited from the strong performance of European economies. Additionally, the country has made significant investments in renewable energy and green technology, which along with the manufacturing and engineering sectors, addresses a growing demand for eco-friendly products. Overall, the export sector in the country is expected to remain robust in the near future.
The recent improvement in trade balances has offered a much-needed respite to the Czech economy, which had been witnessing a slowdown in growth in the recent months. The news has buoyed the investment community and has come as a relief to the country's policy makers, who are now more optimistic about the economic growth outlook of the country. The country is eager to see this trend continue for the rest of the year, which is expected to translate into significant economic gains.
