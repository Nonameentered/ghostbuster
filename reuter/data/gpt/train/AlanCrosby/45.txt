Prague, Czech Republic - Czech shares rallied on a technical correction following a decisive win by the ruling coalition in the Senate elections, which showed that the government's policies remain popular with voters.
The Prague Stock Exchange index jumped by 2.4% in a day, while the crown rose against the euro as investors welcomed the news, highlighting the country's resilience in the midst of global economic uncertainty.
The victory of the coalition of ANO, Social Democrats, and Christian Democrats in all but one of the constituencies in the upper house of parliament has strengthened the position of the government, which has been pursuing a pro-business agenda and cutting corporate taxes.
"The election outcome confirms that our policies are on the right track, and investors are responding positively to the stability and predictability of our economic policies," said Prime Minister Andrej Babis.
The outcome of the Senate elections has also boosted the chances of the government passing other reforms, including overhauling the pension system and reducing the fiscal deficit.
Czech shares had been underperforming compared with its peers in the region, partly due to concerns about the government's ability to fight corruption and criticism over its handling of the media.
However, with the ANO-led coalition now strengthened, investors are more optimistic about the prospects of the country's economy, which has been one of the fastest-growing in Europe over the past few years.
"The election results provide a boost to corporate confidence, which has been wavering due to the global trade tensions and geopolitical risks," said Tomas Sedlacek, an economist at the Charles University in Prague.
The rally in the Prague bourse has also been helped by positive economic data, showing that the Czech economy grew by 2.7% in the second quarter of the year, with strong consumer spending and export growth.
The country's central bank has also been supportive, keeping interest rates low and allowing the crown to depreciate, which has made Czech exports cheaper and boosted economic growth.
Investors are now eyeing the next round of elections, scheduled for 2021, which will determine the composition of the lower house of parliament and the overall balance of power in the government.
"The Senate elections have set the scene for the next big game, which will be the general elections," said Sedlacek.
"But for now, investors are happy with the stability and predictability of the government, which is good news for the Czech economy."
