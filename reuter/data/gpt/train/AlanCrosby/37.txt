Prague, Czech Republic â€“ The upcoming Senate runoff elections in the Czech Republic are not expected to have a significant impact on the country's capital markets, according to analysts.
The second round of voting, set to take place on October 9th and 10th, will decide the remaining 27 seats in the 81-member Senate. The first round of voting, which took place on September 25th and 26th, saw no party win an outright victory in any of the 54 seats at stake.
Despite the importance of the Senate in passing legislation and approving constitutional amendments, experts predict that the election outcomes will not change the current political landscape significantly.
"The Senate elections are not likely to have a considerable impact on the country's economy or capital markets," said Tomas Havranek, an economist at Charles University. "Although the Senate has a role in shaping Czech politics, it is the lower house of Parliament, which holds more sway over the government's economic policy."
The current government, led by Prime Minister Andrej Babis' ANO party, has a comfortable majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, which makes passing legislation and implementing policies much easier.
Moreover, the Senate does not have as much say in fiscal matters or monetary policy, which are primarily under the purview of the Finance Ministry and the central bank, respectively.
The slight political change that could occur would be the possible shift in the number of independent senators. "This election will decide whether the independent senators, who hold the most power in the Senate, will remain in control or whether the party-affiliated senators will take over," said political analyst Tomas Lebeda.
According to Lebeda, this outcome could lead to a slightly different dynamic in the Senate, with party-affiliated senators potentially pushing for policies more aligned with their respective parties' interests.
However, Havranek believes that any significant policy changes will still be improbable, given the current economic climate. "The Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn are still the most pressing issues for the government," he said. "Any significant economic changes will take place only after the pandemic subsides."
On the bright side, the country's capital markets have been recovering relatively well since the pandemic-induced market crash in March 2020. This recovery has been primarily driven by the government's stimulus packages and the European Central Bank's liquidity measures.
Despite the slight decline in the economy's performance due to the recent resurgence of Covid-19 cases, the Czech Republic's economic outlook has been forecasts a GDP growth of 3.1% in 2022.
Furthermore, long-term prospects for the country's capital markets remain optimistic, with a growing number of startups, low unemployment rates and an increasing number of foreign investments.
In conclusion, even though the Senate elections could potentially bring about a shift in power dynamics, the country's capital markets remain resilient in the face of these changes. The economic focus will continue to be on containing the Covid-19 pandemic and stabilising the economy.
