Sepap Group, one of the leading paper manufacturers in the country, has reported a significant drop in its net profit for the first nine months of the year. According to the company's financial statement, the net profit for the period ended September 30, 2021, was down by 25% compared to the same period last year.
The company attributed the decline in profit to the shutdown of its main paper mill, which was temporarily closed down in June due to maintenance issues. The shutdown had a significant impact on the company's production, resulting in a decrease in sales volume and revenue.
In addition, the paper cycle has been experiencing a prolonged downturn, causing a decline in demand for paper products and pricing pressures. The pandemic has also contributed to a decrease in demand for paper products as more businesses shift towards digital solutions.
Despite these challenges, Sepap Group has been working to mitigate the impact on its business. The company has implemented cost-saving measures such as optimizing its production process, reducing overhead costs, and focusing on high-margin products.
The company also plans to invest in new technology and equipment to improve its efficiency and competitiveness in the market. The company is confident that its strategic initiatives will help it weather the challenging market conditions and emerge stronger.
Sepap Group remains committed to its sustainability goals, which include reducing its environmental footprint through responsible paper production and supporting local communities by creating employment opportunities.
The company's shareholders have expressed their support for the management's efforts to navigate the challenging business environment. Despite the decline in profit, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects and remains committed to delivering value to its stakeholders.
