The Czech Republic is anticipating a steady September trade deficit, but also a record deficit for the first nine months of the year. The Czech Statistical Office reported that the country's trade balance saw a deficit of 11.2 billion Czech crowns in August, slightly lower than the expected 11.5 billion.
Despite this, the country's overall trade deficit for the first eight months of the year reached 132.2 billion crowns, the highest it's been since records began. A significant factor contributing to this deficit is the ongoing pandemic, which has affected global trade and caused a decreased demand for Czech exports.
Export figures for August showed a decrease of 5.7% compared to the same month last year, with a total of 343.1 billion crowns worth of goods being exported. Imports, on the other hand, increased by 1.7% year on year, totaling 354.3 billion crowns.
The significant decrease in exports was due to lower shipments of motor vehicles, the country's main export, which dropped by 15.1%, and machinery, which saw a drop of 15.7%. Chemicals and related products also saw a decrease of 8.7%.
The Czech Republic's trade balance with the European Union (EU) remained in the negative, as it has every year since joining the bloc. In August, the country had a trade deficit with the EU of 67.9 billion crowns, a slight decrease from July's 69.4 billion. Exports to the EU fell by 5.5%, while imports increased by 1.8%.
Despite the negative figures, there are still some positive developments in the country. The Czech Republic is the only country in the European Union to have a balance of trade surplus with China, due to the demand for machinery, electronics, and automobiles. The country also has a trade surplus with the United States, due to strong exports in pharmaceuticals, precision instruments, and aircraft.
It remains to be seen whether the Czech Republic's trade deficit will continue to grow in the coming months, or if there will be a turnaround in the country's fortunes. For now, it seems that a steady deficit is to be expected in September, with a nine-month record deficit looming for the end of the year.
