In October, Czech Republic's trade deficit rose as expected, according to data recently released by the Czech Statistical Office. The country's trade balance saw a deficit of CZK 19.8 billion, up from CZK 16.1 billion deficit in September.
Analysts had predicted the trade deficit to increase, given the country's continued reliance on imports and sluggish demand for exports, resulting from the current global economic conditions.
Exports in October totaled CZK 280.8 billion, down 0.3% compared to the same month in 2019. In contrast, imports rose 1.4% year-on-year, reaching CZK 300.7 billion.
The growing trade deficit is a result of the pandemic, which has caused a significant dip in foreign demand for Czech exports. The country has been hit hard, especially in the automotive sector, which accounts for over 30% of its exports. The sector has seen a decline in production due to supply chain disruptions and weak demand conditions in the global market.
According to the Czech Automotive Industry Association, the exports of cars from the country fell by 20% in October compared to the same period last year. The total sales for the industry were CZK 163 billion, down from CZK 171 billion in September.
Experts believe that the decline in car exports is likely to continue, especially with the reimposition of lockdowns in some European countries. With consumers saving more and spending less due to the pandemic, the demand for cars and other non-essential items will remain low.
However, there is some good news for the country's economy. Although exports of cars and related products have slowed, there has been an increase in sales of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and electronics.
Exports of pharmaceuticals, which account for 5% of total Czech exports, rose by 37% in October compared to the same period in 2019. There has also been an increase in the production of electronics, which accounts for 10% of the country's exports, and the industry has continued to grow in spite of the pandemic.
Overall, the Czech Republic's trade balance remains in negative territory, and the country's economy is expected to continue to face challenges in the coming months. The return of lockdowns, uncertainty over Brexit, and the slow vaccine rollout could further impact the country's economic recovery.
The government, however, has announced a series of stimulus measures, including financial aid for small businesses and the tourism sector, to promote economic growth and recovery. The country is also looking to strengthen its domestic production capabilities and reduce its reliance on imports to help reduce the trade deficit in the long term.
