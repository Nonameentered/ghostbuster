A Central Bank scheme to purchase doubtful debts of smaller banks has gained interest from ten participating banks across the nation. The scheme, which aims to improve the liquidity of smaller banks, was launched last week by the Central Bank of the country.
The scheme will allow smaller banks to sell their doubtful debts to the Central Bank at fair market value, which will help them improve their balance sheets. The Central Bank will hold the debts until they mature and then recover the principal and interest. This will help the smaller banks improve their liquidity and increase their lending capacity.
The scheme has received a positive response from the banking industry, with ten banks expressing their interest in participating. These banks together have a significant volume of doubtful debts worth billions of dollars that they plan to dispose of.
The participating banks have appreciated the Central Bank's initiative, which they believe will help them free up their resources and improve their business prospects. They are hopeful that the scheme will provide them with an opportunity to clean up their balance sheets and reduce their non-performing assets.
The scheme will be beneficial for the smaller banks as they will no longer have to bear the burden of managing and recovering troubled loans, which can be expensive and time-consuming. By selling their doubtful debts, smaller banks will be able to focus on their core business, which is lending, and thus increase their profitability in the long run.
The Central Bank has assured the participating banks that it will buy the doubtful debts at a fair market value, and that the process will be transparent and professional. It will also undertake a rigorous due diligence process to ensure that the debts are genuine and have a high likelihood of recovery.
The scheme is expected to provide a stimulus to the banking system and the economy as a whole by freeing up resources and reducing non-performing assets. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the government has been taking measures to ensure that the banking system remains healthy and resilient, and the Central Bank scheme is a step in that direction.
The Central Bank is confident that the scheme will be successful and is open to extending it to more banks in the future. The participation of ten banks in the scheme is a positive sign for the economy and will provide much-needed relief to the smaller banks, which have been struggling with their non-performing assets.
In conclusion, the Central Bank's scheme to purchase doubtful debts of smaller banks has received a positive response from the banking industry, with ten banks expressing their interest in participating. The scheme is expected to provide a boost to the economy by improving the liquidity and lending capacity of smaller banks.
