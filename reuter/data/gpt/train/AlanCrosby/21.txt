According to a survey conducted by the Czech Statistics Office, economists are predicting that the September trade deficit in the Czech Republic will grow by 13-15 billion crowns. This trend is expected due to a notable increase in imports compared to exports.
In the month of September, the country's imports climbed up by 16.2% in comparison to last year, while simultaneously, exports dropped by 1.2%. The economists alert us that the trade surplus, which had been in place for four years, has shifted towards a trade deficit.
One of the leading causes behind the rise in imports is the hike in demand for consumer goods. In contrast, the drop in exports is generally due to a decrease in automobile exports by around 8.7%. This decline can be attributed to a drop in production and also the disruption in the supply chain caused by globally imposed regulations to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.
Experts predict that this negative development in foreign trade will probably keep affecting the Czech economy for the coming months.
The trade deficit in the country has been growing since May this year. Although the difference between imports and exports is still small, it may lead to grave consequences for the country's overall economy. 
This trade deficit will no doubt cause concern for businesses, manufacturers and consumers as the prices of imported goods are likely to climb. Since it will be more expensive to import goods into the country, this may lead to reduced growth, increased inflation, and decreased purchasing power for Czech consumers.
The Czech government and businesses may be compelled to devise ways to reduce imports, promote exports and stimulate economic growth in the near future. However, such measures may take considerable effort and time to be implemented and show definite results.
