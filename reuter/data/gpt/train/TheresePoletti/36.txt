Home Internet Use More Than Doubles in Last Year: 11 Million U.S. Households Now Online, Says Study by PC-Meter
A new study by PC-Meter, a leading technology research firm, has found that home internet use has more than doubled in the last year. According to the study, 11 million U.S. households are now online, representing a significant increase from just a year ago.
The study credits this increase to a number of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many people to work and learn from home. With remote work and virtual classrooms becoming the norm, internet access has become an essential service for millions of Americans.
The study also found that the increase in home internet use has been driven largely by younger Americans. Millennials and Gen Zers, in particular, are more likely to be online than older generations, with 74% of millennials and 86% of Gen Zers saying they use the internet on a daily basis.
However, the study also found that older Americans are starting to catch up when it comes to internet use. In the last year, the number of Americans over the age of 65 who use the internet has increased by 49%, according to the study.
This increase in home internet use has also led to an increase in demand for faster and more reliable internet service. According to the study, more and more households are upgrading to higher-speed plans in order to meet their needs.
While the increase in home internet use is certainly a positive development, the study also highlights some of the challenges that come with it. For example, the study found that a significant number of households are still struggling with issues such as slow internet speeds and connectivity problems.
To address these challenges, the study recommends a number of steps. This includes investing in infrastructure to improve internet access in underserved areas, as well as offering more affordable plans to low-income households.
Overall, the study suggests that home internet use is likely to continue to grow in the coming years, as more and more Americans come to rely on the internet for work, education, and entertainment. However, it also emphasizes the need for policymakers and industry leaders to work together to ensure that everyone has access to reliable and affordable internet service.
