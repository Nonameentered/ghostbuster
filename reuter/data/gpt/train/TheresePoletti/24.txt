IBM Unveils New Partnerships while Prioritizing the "Old Fashioned" Way of Making Money
IBM, one of the world's largest technology corporations, has announced new partnerships to help bolster its business and expand its services. However, what's interesting is how IBM is prioritizing partnerships that are focused more on the "old fashioned" way of making money. The company is partnering with businesses in industries like healthcare, energy and manufacturing to help them digitize their operations.
IBM has been working on digital transformation and artificial intelligence for years, but it's clear that the company believes there is still a lot of value in helping traditional businesses modernize. "We are seeing massive amounts of data being generated by IoT [Internet of Things] devices, and we know that older legacy systems don't have the necessary capabilities to handle it," said Kathryn Guarini, vice president of industry solutions and emerging business at IBM. "So we see a huge opportunity to help businesses in traditional industries digitize their operations."
The first of these partnerships is with healthcare provider Anthem Inc. The two companies have announced a new joint venture called "NewCo" that will offer personalized, cost-effective solutions to improve patient care and outcomes. With Anthem's extensive experience in the healthcare industry and IBM's expertise in AI and data analytics, the two companies hope to create new solutions that can address some of the biggest challenges in the healthcare industry.
In the energy industry, IBM is partnering with NRG Energy, a leading U.S. electricity provider, to create a platform that will help energy companies manage distributed energy resources like solar and wind power. The platform will help these companies optimize their resources and improve their operations, ultimately resulting in more efficient and cost-effective energy delivery.
Finally, in the manufacturing space, IBM is partnering with ABB, a Swiss engineering and automation company, to create new solutions for industrial automation. The two companies plan to leverage IBM's AI and data analytics expertise with ABB's automation expertise to create new solutions that can help manufacturers improve their operations and increase efficiency.
However, while these partnerships highlight IBM's commitment to helping traditional businesses modernize, the company is also focusing on more traditional methods of making money. In a recent interview with Fortune magazine, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty explained how the company plans to prioritize revenue growth rather than simply focusing on digital transformation and AI.
"We really do believe that digital transformation is the way that you access growth in the market," Rometty said. "But it's also the new product that you can develop and introduce into the market. So we're focused on revenue growth and that means a combination of both new businesses and digital transformation."
This shift in focus underscores the challenges that IBM has faced in recent years. While the company has been at the forefront of AI and digital transformation, its revenue growth has been sluggish. In the first quarter of 2019, IBM reported revenue of $18.2 billion, a drop of 4.7% from the same period in the previous year.
To help address these challenges, IBM has been making strategic changes to its operations. In January 2019, the company announced a major restructuring plan that included layoffs in its Watson Health division and the sale of some of its software products. The company has also been investing heavily in new areas like blockchain and quantum computing.
Overall, IBM's recent partnerships and renewed focus on revenue growth highlight the challenges that tech companies face in the digital age. While innovation and digital transformation are critical to success, traditional methods of making money should not be overlooked. By identifying new partnerships and prioritizing revenue growth, IBM is positioning itself to be a leader in the next wave of technological innovation.
