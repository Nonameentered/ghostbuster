The new strategy, which is part of IBM's ongoing efforts to drive innovation and growth across all industries, features several key components. First, IBM plans to build out its cloud infrastructure to support businesses of all sizes, from small startups to large enterprises.

"Businesses today face a number of challenges, from managing large amounts of data to keeping up with the pace of technological change," said Ginni Rometty, IBM's Chairman, President, and CEO. "With our new internet strategy and partnerships, we are positioning ourselves to help businesses of all sizes address these challenges and unlock new opportunities for growth."
In addition to its cloud infrastructure, IBM is also investing heavily in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. These cutting-edge tools can help businesses automate tasks, gain insights from data, and improve their overall operations.
"We believe that AI and ML will be the next frontier in business innovation," said Rometty. "By investing in these technologies, we are helping businesses to not only keep up with the pace of change, but to lead the way in driving innovation and growth."
To help bring its internet strategy to life, IBM has announced a number of new partnerships with leading firms in the tech industry. Among these partners are AT&T, Box, and Cisco.
Under the partnership with AT&T, IBM will leverage the telecom giant's edge computing capabilities to enable low-latency AI and ML applications for businesses. This will enable businesses to process large amounts of data in real-time, making them more responsive and agile.
The partnership with Box, a leading provider of cloud-based content management services, will enable businesses to securely store, manage, and collaborate on their content. This will help businesses to streamline their operations and improve their overall productivity.
Finally, the partnership with Cisco aims to help businesses leverage the power of AI and ML to improve their network performance and security. This will enable businesses to optimize their network resources and enhance their overall security posture.
"With these new partnerships, we are putting ourselves at the forefront of the digital revolution," said Rometty. "By working together with these leading firms, we can help businesses across all industries to unlock new opportunities and drive growth."
