IBM to Acquire Children's Education Software Publisher Edmark for $80 Million in Cash
In a move that highlights the technology giant's ambitions in the education sector, IBM has announced its acquisition of Edmark Corporation, a children's education software publishing company. The tech giant has agreed to pay $80 million in cash for Edmark, according to sources familiar with the deal.
Edmark, which was founded in 1978, is known for producing educational software and games designed to teach children reading, writing, math, science, and other subjects. The company's products are used by schools and homes across the country, and the acquisition by IBM is expected to significantly expand its reach.
"I am excited to welcome Edmark into the IBM family," said Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM. "Their focus on helping children learn through interactive and engaging software aligns perfectly with IBM's mission of making education more accessible and effective through the use of technology."
The acquisition of Edmark is part of a broader strategy by IBM to expand its presence in the education sector. The company has recently launched a range of initiatives aimed at improving education, particularly in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields. IBM has also partnered with schools and institutions around the world to provide cutting-edge education solutions.
"IBM has always been at the forefront of innovation, and we believe that technology can play a critical role in transforming education," Krishna said. "With the acquisition of Edmark, we are taking a major step forward in this area, and we look forward to working with educators and families to help children succeed."
The $80 million deal is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, pending regulatory approval. IBM said it plans to integrate Edmark's software products into its own Watson Education platform, which uses artificial intelligence to personalize education for students in K-12 schools and colleges.
"IBM's Watson Education platform is the perfect platform for our software products," said Melinda Matthews, CEO of Edmark. "We believe that by combining our interactive and engaging games with Watson's AI technology, we can create an even more powerful education tool that will help children develop critical skills and excel in school."
IBM's move into the education sector comes at a time of significant change for the industry. With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing many schools to close and students to learn from home, the importance of online learning and edtech has grown exponentially. IBM's acquisition of Edmark is expected to help the company capitalize on this trend and meet the growing demand for remote learning solutions.
"Remote learning has become the new normal for many students, and it's clear that technology can play a critical role in ensuring that they receive the best possible education," Krishna said. "By acquiring Edmark, we are strengthening our ability to provide innovative, personalized learning solutions that can help students succeed no matter where they are."
The acquisition of Edmark is just the latest in a series of moves by IBM to expand its portfolio of education solutions. The company has also recently launched a range of AI-powered tools, including a virtual assistant for students and teachers and a platform that uses AI to analyze student data and provide personalized learning recommendations.
"This is an exciting time for education, and IBM is committed to playing a leading role in driving innovation and transformation in the sector," Krishna said. "With the acquisition of Edmark, we are taking a major step forward in our mission to make education more accessible and effective through the use of technology." 
In conclusion, IBM's acquisition of Edmark, a well-known children's education software publishing company, is a significant step towards the company's goal of expanding its presence in the education sector. The $80 million deal is expected to help IBM meet the growing demand for remote learning solutions and improve education through interactive and engaging software products.
