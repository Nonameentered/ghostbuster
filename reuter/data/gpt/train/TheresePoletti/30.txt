CompuServe, one of the pioneers in the computer networking industry, has announced the dissolution of its consumer online service, Wow!. This move is aimed at better focusing on the corporate market, where the company sees more potential for growth and revenue.
Wow! was launched in 1999 as a consumer-focused internet service provider (ISP), offering dial-up and broadband internet access, email, and other online services. However, in recent years, the service has struggled to keep up with the more innovative and affordable offerings by competitors like AOL, Yahoo, and Google.
CompuServe CEO, John Doe, said in a statement that the decision to dissolve Wow! was not an easy one but was necessary to adapt to the changing market dynamics and meet the evolving needs of its customers. "We have been observing a sharp decline in the demand for consumer-focused online services, which is no longer a major part of our revenue stream," he said.
The company has also faced challenges in retaining its customer base, as many have migrated to other ISPs such as cable or telephone-based since the emergence of broadband. In recent years, the company struggled with a lack of investment in the platform to keep up with technological advancements, a fall in subscription numbers, and low consumer interest.
CompuServe hopes to redirect its resources and expertise towards the corporate market. The company already has a strong presence in this sector, providing customized network solutions, data backup, disaster recovery, and cloud computing services. With the dissolution of Wow!, the company plans to expand its offerings to include virtual private networks (VPNs), cybersecurity, and business communication solutions.
Industry observers say this move comes in response to the increasing demand from businesses for reliable and secure digital services amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Many companies have had to embrace remote work, making them more dependent on internet-based solutions for communication and collaboration, making cybersecurity a key issue if access to the company environment is maintained remotely.
The decision to focus on the corporate market is seen as a strategic move by the company to realign its resources, streamline its operations, and build new revenue streams. CompuServe is also expected to invest heavily in research and development to deliver more innovative products and services for the business sector.
Experts agree this will be an uphill task for the company, with competitors already well-established in the market. However, with its long-standing reputation for quality services, and extensive experience in the industry, CompuServe is likely to give competitors a run for their money and establish itself as a leading provider of business-focused networking services.
In conclusion, the decision by CompuServe to dissolve Wow! is a clear indication of the shifting landscape of the internet service industry. The move to the corporate market signals a new era for the company and is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of CompuServe as it positions itself for growth and success.
