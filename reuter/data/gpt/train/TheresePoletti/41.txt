International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) has announced plans to restructure its global sales and services businesses under a single brand name â€“ 'IBM Global Services.' The move is aimed at simplifying the company's complex organization and making it easier for clients to do business with IBM.
IBM revealed that the reorganization will affect its hardware, software, and consulting businesses. The company's Global Technology Services (GTS), Global Business Services (GBS), and IBM Watson Health will be combined under the IBM Global Services brand.
In a statement released yesterday, IBM's CEO Arvind Krishna said that the move reflects the company's focus on delivering integrated, holistic solutions to its clients. "Our clients are looking for a partner to help them navigate the uncertainty of the business world, drive new value from their data, and harness the power of artificial intelligence," Krishna said.
IBM Global Services, the new brand, is expected to offer a wide range of products and services, including IT consulting, cloud solutions, and cybersecurity. The brand will be led by Mark Foster, who was formerly in charge of IBM Services and who will be reporting directly to Krishna.
The restructuring comes after IBM reported a decline in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020. The company's revenue decreased by 6% year-over-year to $20.4 billion, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business.
According to Krishna, the restructuring is part of a broader effort to streamline IBM's operations and focus on core areas including hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. "[We are] accelerating our shift to a more cloud-based, artificial intelligence-driven business model," Krishna said.
The new brand name and structure will also help IBM to compete more effectively with cloud giants such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. In recent years, IBM has lagged behind these companies in the cloud market, and the reorganization is seen as a way to drive growth and improve performance.
IBM's shares rose by 2.8% to $124.57 in after-hours trading following the announcement. The company is expected to provide more details on the restructuring and its impact on employees and shareholders in the coming months.
