As the final quarter of 2018 comes to a close, U.S. computer makers are expected to report solid earnings despite a stronger dollar and Apple's loss forecast.
The computer industry has been facing challenges due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, which has increased the costs of computer components, and the stronger dollar, which makes U.S. goods more expensive in foreign markets. However, strong demand for laptops, personal computers and gaming consoles, along with cost-cutting measures adopted by computer companies, are expected to offset these challenges.
Apple, which was expected to lead the tech industry, recently announced that it would miss its revenue target for the first quarter of 2019 due to weaker than expected sales in China. However, this has not dampened the outlook for other computer makers. Hewlett Packard, Dell Technologies, and Microsoft are expected to report strong earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018.
Hewlett Packard, which has been focusing on cost-cutting measures to improve its bottom line, is expected to report solid earnings for the fourth quarter. The company has been pursuing growth in the commercial PC market, which has been growing due to strong demand for laptops and the transition from desktops to smaller form factors. The company has also been focusing on driving growth in its Printing segment, which has been improving due to a shift towards higher margin services.
Dell Technologies is also expected to report strong earnings for the fourth quarter due to the continued growth of its Infrastructure Solutions Group. Dell has been focusing on building out its portfolio of offerings in this group and has been targeting high-end data center customers with its PowerEdge servers, hyper-converged infrastructure, and networking solutions. The company has also been driving sales in its Client Solutions Group, which includes laptops, desktops, and workstations.
Microsoft, which has been focusing on expanding its cloud business, is also expected to report strong earnings for the fourth quarter. The company has been growing its Azure cloud platform, which has been gaining market share against Amazon Web Services. Microsoft has also been growing its Office 365 suite, which has been a strong revenue driver for the company.
