Lotus Unveils SmartSuite 97 with Eye on Internet Functionality and Competitive Pricing
Lotus Development Corporation, a software company known for its productivity applications, has announced the release of SmartSuite 97. The new offering is aimed at business users, who are increasingly relying on the Internet for their work and need software that can handle online tasks. The suite includes a number of applications, such as word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, and database programs. 
The announcement of SmartSuite 97 comes at a time when Lotus is facing tough competition from Microsoft, which dominates the productivity software market with its Office suite. Lotus hopes to attract customers with its focus on Internet functionality and competitive pricing. The new suite includes features such as integrated Internet support, HTML export capabilities, and improved e-mail capabilities. 
"We've heard from our customers that they need powerful and flexible software that can help them work better, both online and off," said Lotus CEO Jim Manzi. "SmartSuite 97 delivers on that promise, with a host of new features and enhancements that will make our customers more productive than ever before."
One of the key features of SmartSuite 97 is its support for the Internet. Users can now access the Web directly from within the suite, without having to switch to a separate browser. The suite includes a built-in search engine that allows users to find information on the Web without leaving their application. The suite also includes support for file transfer protocol (FTP), which allows users to upload and download files from Web servers directly within their application. 
SmartSuite 97 also includes several features specifically designed to make working with HTML easier. Users can now save their documents as HTML files with a single click, and the suite includes HTML editing tools that allow users to create and edit Web pages directly within their application. The suite also includes support for cascading style sheets (CSS), which allow users to apply a consistent look and feel to their Web pages across multiple documents. 
Another area where SmartSuite 97 aims to compete with Microsoft is pricing. The suite is being offered at a discount to customers who switch from Microsoft Office, and is priced lower than Office for new customers. Lotus believes that its pricing strategy will be attractive to small and medium-sized businesses, who are increasingly cost-conscious. 
"SmartSuite 97 is a great value for business users who need high-quality productivity software without breaking the bank," said Manzi. "We're confident that our low prices, combined with our powerful features, will make SmartSuite 97 a top choice for customers around the world." 
Lotus faces an uphill battle against Microsoft, which has dominated the productivity software market for years. However, the company believes that its focus on Internet functionality and competitive pricing will help it stand out from the competition. SmartSuite 97 is the latest in a series of products aimed at reestablishing Lotus as a major player in the software industry. 
Overall, SmartSuite 97 offers a compelling set of features for business users who need powerful productivity software with Internet functionality. Whether it will be enough to challenge Microsoft's dominance remains to be seen, but Lotus is certainly making a strong bid for a share of the market.
