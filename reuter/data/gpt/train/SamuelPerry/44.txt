Netscape Expects to Hold Onto Market Share in Growing Internet and Intranet Market, Critical Approval for New Communicator Software
Netscape Communications Corp., a pioneer in web browsing software, announced on Friday that it expects to maintain its market share despite other competitors in the growing internet and intranet market. The company plans to remain dominant with the approval of its new Communicator software, which is touted to revolutionize web browsing.
The Communicator software combines various features, including email, web browsing, and scheduling, in one application. The software comes equipped with a new version of Netscape's Navigator browser that has improved support for frames and Java applets. The company also introduced a new lightweight HTML editor to make it easier for users to author web pages.
Netscape's Communicator software is a direct competitor to Microsoft Corp's Internet Explorer and is essential for its survival in the internet market. Since Microsoft launched its free web browser bundled with its Windows operating system in 1995, it has become the default browser for most users. According to a survey by Internet Tracking Services, Microsoft's browser has a 70 percent share of the US market.
To help counteract Microsoft's dominance, Netscape has embarked on a strategy of offering its Communicator software free of charge to encourage downloads. The company has also entered into an alliance with Sun Microsystems Inc. to promote Netscape's software in corporate settings. As part of the agreement, Sun will bundle Netscape's browser with its Solaris operating system and market Netscape to its business customers.
"We are confident that our aggressive pricing strategy and distribution partnerships will help us maintain our market share, and also help us grow our business," said Jim Barksdale, Netscape's CEO.
Netscape's Communicator has already received critical approval from industry analysts. Gartner Group, a technology research firm, predicted that Netscape's software would take away some share from Microsoft and place Netscape's products into the corporate environment. The company's new browser is also expected to help bolster its market share in intranet applications, where Netscape has already gained a significant foothold.
Intranets are private networks that are used by businesses, enabling their employees to access company information, communicate, and collaborate online. Netscape currently dominates the intranet market, with about 90 percent of intranets installed in US firms using the company's software.
According to industry analysts, Netscape's dominance in the intranet market will help the company expand into e-commerce and web services. Netscape is currently developing technologies that will enable users to conduct secure online transactions, including payments, for goods and services purchased over the internet.
"The intranet market is crucial to Netscape's future growth and success," said Nina Lytton, an analyst with Rosen Research, a market research firm. "With its new Communicator software, Netscape is poised to build on this strong foundation and expand its market share in the fast-growing internet and intranet marketplace."
Netscape's Communicator software is currently available for download from its website. The company is also planning to distribute the software through its partnerships with other technology companies. With the release of the new software, Netscape is confident that it can continue to offer itself as a viable option to internet users and intranet providers alike.
