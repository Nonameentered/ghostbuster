The battle for groupware dominance has been heating up between the three tech giants Netscape, Microsoft, and Lotus. Groupware is a collaborative software that allows users to work together on documents, calendars, and emails. With a market size of $10 billion, these companies have been vying for a bigger piece of the pie.
Netscape took the first step in the groupware market with its release of Netscape Communicator. The software included email, calendaring, and newsgroup capabilities, which were all integrated into the browser. Netscape’s success with Communicator prompted Microsoft to release its version of groupware software called Exchange Server.
In response, Lotus released its own groupware software called Domino which combined its existing email system, Lotus Notes, with its new Web server, Lotus HTTP Server. Domino quickly became the go-to groupware solution for businesses because it allowed users to access their email from anywhere with the use of a web browser.
However, Microsoft was not deterred by the popularity of Domino. The company announced its intention to become the leader in the groupware market with the release of Exchange Server 5.0. This version of Exchange Server boasted improvements to its user interface and performance, as well as integration with Microsoft’s popular desktop applications.
Netscape, meanwhile, was struggling to keep up with its competitors. In 1998, Netscape announced that it would be giving away its Communicator software for free, which was a move that surprised many industry analysts. Netscape’s decision to offer its software for free was an attempt to gain market share, but it didn’t have much of an effect on the groupware market.
In the same year, Microsoft acquired a small groupware company called WebCal. The company was working on a web-based calendaring solution that would eventually become a part of Exchange Server. This acquisition helped Microsoft to stay ahead of its competitors by offering new features and capabilities to its groupware software.
Lotus also made some strategic moves in the groupware market. In 1999, Lotus announced that it would be releasing a new version of Domino called R5. This version of Domino included new features such as support for Java and XML, as well as improved scalability and reliability.
Despite the efforts of its competitors, Microsoft continued to dominate the groupware market. The company’s Exchange Server software was installed in millions of businesses around the world. Microsoft’s success in the groupware market was due to its ability to integrate with its other popular desktop applications, as well as its focus on security and reliability.
Netscape was bought out by AOL in 1999, which effectively ended its involvement in the groupware market. This left Microsoft and Lotus as the only two major players in the industry.
In 2000, Microsoft released Exchange Server 2000 which included a number of new features such as improved mobile support, enhanced security, and better integration with other Microsoft applications. However, Lotus was not far behind with its release of Domino 6 in 2002. This version of Domino included new features such as improved performance, support for wireless devices, and better integration with Java.
Both companies continued to release new versions of their groupware software in the following years. Microsoft released Exchange Server 2003 in 2003, which focused on improving security and administration. Lotus released Domino 7 in 2005, which included new features such as improved search capabilities and support for IBM’s WebSphere Application Server.
By 2006, the groupware market had changed dramatically. Google had entered the market with its web-based email service, Gmail. This service offered users a new way to access their email and quickly gained popularity. However, Google did not have a groupware solution at the time.
In 2007, Microsoft released Exchange Server 2007 which included new features such as unified messaging and improved scalability. Lotus continued to innovate with its release of Domino 8 in 2007, which included support for composite applications and integration with Lotus Sametime, a real-time communication tool.
Today, Microsoft and IBM (Lotus’ parent company) remain the two major players in the groupware market. Both companies continue to innovate and improve their offerings, with Microsoft focusing on its Office 365 suite of applications and IBM expanding its offerings with the acquisition of so-called social software like Connections. Google still dominates the email market with Gmail, but has yet to make a big play in the groupware space.
In conclusion, the battle for groupware dominance has been a long and intense one between Netscape, Microsoft, and Lotus. While Netscape has bowed out of the market, Microsoft and Lotus remain two of the biggest players in the industry. As the market continues to evolve, both companies will need to continue to innovate in order to stay ahead of their competitors and remain leaders in the groupware market.
