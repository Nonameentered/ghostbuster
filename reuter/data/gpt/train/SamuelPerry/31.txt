Tokyo, Japan - Masahoshi Son, the Chief Executive Officer of SoftBank, announced today that he is shifting the company's focus to organic growth and the launch of a new joint venture, JSkyB.
The announcement comes as SoftBank, a telecommunications giant known for its investments in cutting-edge technology, seeks to recover from the fallout of its high-risk investment strategy in WeWork.
SoftBank recently announced a $8.9 billion net loss for the fiscal year ending in March 2020, largely due to the collapse of WeWork's proposed initial public offering last year. The company now faces intense scrutiny from investors who are looking for a change in strategy.
In response, Son said that SoftBank will move away from "conglomerate-style growth" and refocus on "organic growth." According to Son, this means that SoftBank will prioritize investments in businesses that have strong cash flows and promising growth potential.
"We need to focus on building sustainable businesses that can generate long-term value for our shareholders," Son told reporters.
As part of this new approach, SoftBank will be launching a new joint venture with a consortium of Japanese broadcasters, including Nippon TV, TV Asahi, and Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS).
The new company, called JSkyB, will offer a range of streaming services, including original content, live sports, and news. The platform is set to launch by the end of this year and will compete with existing streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.
"We believe that there is tremendous growth potential in the streaming market, especially here in Japan," Son said. "We're excited to work with our partners to create a world-class streaming service that can meet the needs of Japanese consumers."
According to Son, JSkyB will operate independently of SoftBank, with the telecoms giant holding only a minority stake in the new company. However, SoftBank will provide the infrastructure and technology needed to launch the new service.
JSkyB is just one example of SoftBank's new emphasis on organic growth. The company is also investing heavily in its existing businesses, including its mobile phone operator, SoftBank Corp., and its enterprise solutions subsidiary, SoftBank Vision Fund.
SoftBank Corp. reported a 12% increase in operating profit for the quarter ending in March, while SoftBank Vision Fund saw a 4.8% increase in net assets under management.
However, investors remain cautious about SoftBank's ability to deliver on its promises. The company's shares are down by over 20% so far this year, and many analysts are skeptical about its ability to recover from the WeWork debacle.
"I think there's still a lot of concern among investors about SoftBank's overall strategy," said Kazunori Ito, chief analyst at Ibbotson Associates Japan. "They've made a lot of risky bets in the past, and it's not clear yet whether they can pivot successfully to a more conservative approach."
Son acknowledged these concerns, but he remained optimistic about SoftBank's future.
"We recognize that we've made mistakes in the past, and there's no doubt that we have a lot of work to do to regain the trust of our shareholders," he said. "But I believe that our new focus on organic growth and our partnership with JSkyB will help us lay the foundation for long-term success."
Time will tell whether SoftBank's new strategy will pay off. But for now, investors are cautiously optimistic about the company's future, and they'll be watching closely to see how SoftBank navigates the challenging economic environment ahead.
