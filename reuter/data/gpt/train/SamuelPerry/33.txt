High technology venture fund investment in the United States rose by 50% in the third quarter, according to a report by the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), as overall U.S. venture investment increased by 25% compared to year-ago levels. The report shows that venture capitalists invested $34 billion across 1,500 companies in the quarter, with high technology sectors such as biotechnology, software, and finance technology (fintech) leading the way.
"This is a strong indication that the venture capital industry continues to play a critical role in supporting entrepreneurial innovation, job creation, and economic growth," said Bobby Franklin, President, and CEO of the NVCA.
The biotechnology sector secured the lion's share of venture capital dollars, raising over $7 billion in the quarter, a 30% increase from the second quarter of 2020. Software companies attracted $6.3 billion in venture funding, up by 16% from a year ago, while fintech saw significant growth as investments soared by 82% compared to the same period last year.
The COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the pace of innovation in the high technology sectors, prompting venture capitalists to pour funds more into the companies that are shaping the future. Tarek Merhebi, an analyst at Juniper Ventures, said: "The pandemic has spurred an increase in health care technology along with digital transformation, not to mention the rise of remote work and e-commerce. These trends and increased activity in fintech will likely remain prevalent for some time, ushering in change on multiple levels."
The report also revealed that venture capitalists are becoming more cautious with early-stage investments as seed-stage investments declined by 18% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, the lowest quarterly total in four years. However, later-stage investments increased by 37%, signaling that more investors are putting money into established companies with proven business models and growth potential.
The NVCA report notes that venture capital firms are sitting on record levels of uninvested capital, or 'dry powder,' that have not been deployed due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. "While the pandemic has led to significant short-term headwinds and disruption, venture capital remains well-positioned to play a key role in the long-term economic recovery and the transformation of many industries," said Franklin.
The outlook for venture capital in the coming quarters is mixed, with uncertainties around the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election and the future path of the pandemic. However, venture capitalists are optimistic about opportunities for investment in high-growth sectors that are driving innovation and change.
"Despite the economic disruptions wrought by the pandemic, 2020 remains on track to be one of the most active years in the history of the venture capital industry," said Franklin. "We expect this upward trend to continue throughout the fourth quarter and beyond as investors seek to support high-growth companies and game-changing innovations across a broad range of industries."
