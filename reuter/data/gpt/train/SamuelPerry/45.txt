In a move to consolidate the semiconductor equipment industry, KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments have announced their merger in a $3.4 billion deal that creates a powerhouse with over $1 billion in combined revenue.
The two companies have long been industry leaders in the development of process control and yield management systems for semiconductor manufacturers. KLA Instruments specializes in metrology and inspection solutions while Tencor Instruments focuses on surface analysis and profile measurement tools.
With the merger, the companies aim to offer a more comprehensive product portfolio to their customers. The combined entity will be able to provide end-to-end solutions for semiconductor manufacturing, from defect detection to wafer inspection to final packaging.
"This is a transformative partnership that brings together two highly complementary product portfolios and creates a powerful force in the industry," said Rick Wallace, CEO of KLA Instruments. "We are excited about the opportunities this merger presents to enhance our capabilities and drive innovation for our customers."
Under the terms of the agreement, KLA Instruments will acquire all outstanding shares of Tencor Instruments for $56.50 per share in cash and stock. The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
The merger will create a company with a combined workforce of approximately 10,000 employees and operations in more than 25 countries. The new entity will be named KLA-Tencor Corporation and will be headquartered in San Jose, California.
The leaders of both companies emphasized the complementary nature of their product portfolios. KLA's metrology and inspection systems are focused on detecting defects in the manufacturing process, while Tencor's surface analysis tools provide insights into the quality of the final product.
"We believe that by combining our strengths, we can offer our customers a more complete set of solutions that enable them to improve their yields and reduce their costs," said Mike Slessor, CEO of Tencor Instruments.
The semiconductor equipment industry has seen a wave of consolidation in recent years as companies seek to gain scale and broaden their product offerings. In 2015, Lam Research announced its acquisition of KLA's competitor, KLA-Tencor, in a $10.6 billion deal. Last year, Applied Materials acquired Kokusai Electric in a $2.3 billion deal.
Industry analysts have praised the KLA-Tencor merger, noting that it brings together two of the most respected names in the industry.
"This is a significant strategic move that creates a real powerhouse in the semiconductor equipment space," said Weston Twigg, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. "KLA and Tencor are both leaders in their respective areas of expertise, so there's a good chance that the combined entity will be able to offer some truly innovative solutions."
The merger comes at a time of strong growth for the semiconductor industry, which has seen demand surge in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales grew by 6.5% in 2020, reaching a record high of $439 billion.
For KLA and Tencor, the merger is seen as a way to capitalize on this growth and position themselves as leading providers of equipment and solutions for the rapidly-growing semiconductor market.
"We are excited about the future of the semiconductor industry and believe that the combination of KLA and Tencor will be a powerful force within it," said Wallace. "Together, we can drive innovation, support our customers' growth, and help shape the future of the industry."
