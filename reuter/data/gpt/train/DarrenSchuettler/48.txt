As the Canadian federal budget approaches, the country's big banks are hoping for tax relief. However, analysts are doubtful that any major changes will be made.
The big banks have made their desire for tax relief known ahead of the budget. In a submission to the federal government, the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) called for lower corporate tax rates and changes to the tax treatment of capital investments.
The CBA argues that lower corporate tax rates would encourage investment and help boost Canada's economic competitiveness. In addition, changes to the tax treatment of capital investments would allow banks to better compete with other countries, where the treatment is more favourable.
The federal government has already lowered corporate tax rates in recent years, but the CBA says more needs to be done. The association argues that Canada's current corporate tax rate of 26.5% is higher than other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, which have rates of 19% and 21% respectively.
However, analysts are doubtful that the government will make any major changes to corporate tax rates in the upcoming budget. The federal government, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has been focused on reducing income inequality and increasing social spending, which suggests that a reduction in corporate tax rates may not be a priority.
In addition, the government faces pressure to address climate change and has proposed a new tax on carbon emissions. This tax, which is set to increase over time, could offset any benefits the banks would receive from a reduction in corporate tax rates.
The government is also facing pressure to address the housing market, which has become increasingly unaffordable for many Canadians. The CBA has suggested changes to the mortgage stress test, which was implemented by the government in 2018 to ensure Canadians could afford their mortgages if interest rates rose. The CBA argues that the stress test has made it more difficult for Canadians to access mortgages and has hurt the housing market.
However, analysts say that any changes to the stress test are unlikely to be drastic. The government has spoken out against rising house prices and has promised to address the issue, but it is also aware of the risks associated with loosening mortgage rules and encouraging Canadians to take on more debt.
The government is also under pressure to address the issue of income inequality, which has been a growing concern in Canada. The CBA has proposed changes to the tax treatment of dividends, arguing that the current system penalizes individuals who invest in Canadian companies rather than foreign ones.
However, analysts say that any changes to the tax treatment of dividends are unlikely to be significant. The government has been focused on increasing social spending, and any changes to the tax system that would benefit the wealthy are likely to face political backlash.
Overall, the big banks are unlikely to receive the tax relief they are hoping for in the upcoming budget. While the government may make some minor changes to address specific concerns, such as the housing market or the tax treatment of dividends, any major changes to corporate tax rates or other areas are unlikely.
The government's focus on income inequality and social spending suggests that any tax relief for the banks would be met with criticism from those who argue that the wealthy in Canada are already benefiting from the current system.
As the federal budget approaches, it remains to be seen how the government will address the various concerns facing the country. While the big banks will continue to push for tax relief, analysts say that any major changes are unlikely, given the government's current priorities.
