Canada's Financial Markets React Favorably to Finance Minister Paul Martin's 1997/98 Budget
Toronto, March 04, 1997 – Finance Minister Paul Martin’s 1997/98 Budget has been warmly greeted by the Canadian financial markets, with investors and analysts lauding the document as one that strikes a good balance between fiscal discipline and growth-oriented policies.
The budget, which was presented to the House of Commons on February 18th, aims to reduce the deficit from $18.7 billion in 1996/97 to $9.6 billion in 1997/98. It also sets out a long-term plan to eliminate the deficit altogether by the year 2000/01. According to Minister Martin, the budget is based on “cautious optimism” and will put the Canadian economy on a sound footing for the future.
The initial reaction to the budget from the financial community has been positive. 
“The budget is balanced and credible,” said William Downe, Co-chairman of the Canadian Bankers Association. “It is a very solid foundation and we look forward to working with the government to create the conditions for long-term growth and prosperity.”
Stocks also performed well on the day of the budget announcement, with the TSE 300 index rising by 36.85 points, or 0.5%, to close at 7174.05. The Canadian dollar also strengthened against other major currencies, including the US dollar, Japanese yen, and Euro.
One of the main reasons for the positive reaction to the budget is the fact that it includes a number of measures aimed at promoting investment and economic growth. For example, the budget sets aside $540 million over three years for job creation programs, including programs to help youth, women, and Aboriginal people find work.
The budget also includes a new $1.5 billion Canada Investment Fund to help small and medium-sized companies obtain venture capital. This is expected to stimulate investment and innovation in Canada’s high-tech and knowledge-based industries.
Another key feature of the budget is the tax package, which includes measures to reduce the tax burden on middle-income families. For example, the budget raises the basic personal exemption to $7,131, which means that Canadians will be able to earn more income before they are subject to federal income tax.
The budget also reduces the tax on capital gains by 1% and provides for a 2% reduction in the general corporate income tax rate. According to the Minister, these measures will stimulate investment and job creation.
Overall, the 1997/98 Budget has been widely praised for its combination of fiscal prudence and growth-oriented policies. As Minister Martin himself said in his budget speech, “We have a choice in this country: we can choose between fiscal responsibility and economic growth. I say we can have both, and this budget proves it.”
It remains to be seen whether the budget will produce the desired results, but for the time being, investors and analysts are optimistic about Canada’s economic prospects. The government’s commitment to fiscal responsibility and economic growth is seen as a positive step, and the financial markets are sending a clear signal that they endorse the budget and the government’s economic policies.
