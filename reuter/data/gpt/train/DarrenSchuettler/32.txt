Toronto, ON - The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) has announced that it posted a record profit for the year 2021 and is boosting its dividend payout six per cent, following a robust period for the bank amid the pandemic.
The RBC’s net income climbed to $15.3 billion for the year ending on October 31, up from $12.7 billion a year earlier. The bank’s total revenue increased by 12% to $53 billion, compared to the previous year, with a strong performance in wealth management and capital markets.
“RBC delivered strong results in 2021, contributing to the bank’s ongoing leadership position in these uncertain times,” said RBC President and CEO Dave McKay. “Our strategy, client focus, and resilience continue to differentiate us in a competitive market.”
RBC's wealth management unit, which includes Global Asset Management, Personal and Commercial Banking Canada, and Personal and Commercial Banking the United States, saw a 15% increase in net income to reach $11.7 billion. Meanwhile, the bank’s capital markets unit, which includes its trading and investment banking businesses, recorded a net income of $4.6 billion, up 17% from a year earlier.
The bank’s domestic retail banking business, the largest division of RBC, recorded net income of $7.3 billion in 2021, up 13% from a year before.
RBC's latest earnings results were the strongest among the country's six largest banks, which have all posted better-than-expected profits in their most recent quarters amid a strong economic recovery.
In addition to RBC’s strong results, the bank has also announced an increase to its dividend payout, with an increase of six per cent for the first quarter of 2022. The bank said it will pay out $1.20 per share, up from $1.13 in the previous quarter. This marks the 11th consecutive year the bank has raised its quarterly dividend, a move that will provide a significant boost to the bank's shareholders.
“Given our strong capital position and confidence in our business outlook, we are pleased to increase our dividends for the 11th straight year,” said McKay.
The RBC also said it is focused on continued investment in technology and innovation to enhance the customer experience and help the bank maintain its leading position in the financial industry.
The bank's positive results and dividend hike signal a bright future for Canada's largest bank and provide a positive outlook for the country's economy in the coming months.
