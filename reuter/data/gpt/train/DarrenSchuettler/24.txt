In a move that could have far-reaching implications for the financial industry, major shareholders of Altamira Management Ltd. have set a deadline for court action against Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. Ltd in relation to its takeover bid.
The shareholders, who own almost 30% of Altamira's outstanding shares, have been critical of the way Manufacturers Life has approached its bid for the company. They accuse the Canadian insurer of undervaluing Altamira and failing to consider the interests of its shareholders.
In a statement released on Monday, the shareholders announced that they will be seeking an injunction to prevent the takeover from proceeding. The move follows several months of negotiations between the two companies, during which time the shareholders have been lobbying for a better deal.
"We have been extremely disappointed by the way Manufacturers Life has handled this process," said John Smith, a representative of the shareholders. "Despite our repeated efforts to engage in meaningful dialogue, they have refused to listen to our concerns or to take our interests into account."
Smith added that the shareholders would be seeking damages from Manufacturers Life if the takeover goes ahead. "We believe that our rights as shareholders have been seriously compromised by the actions of this company," he said. "We will not hesitate to take legal action in order to protect our interests."
The shareholders have set a deadline of March 31 for Manufacturers Life to respond to their demands. If the company fails to meet this deadline, the shareholders say they will be seeking a court order to prevent the takeover from proceeding.
Manufacturers Life, for its part, has defended its bid for Altamira. In a statement released on Tuesday, the company said that its offer was fair and reasonable, and had been made in the best interests of all stakeholders.
"We are committed to working with Altamira's board and management to ensure a smooth and successful transition," the statement read. "We believe that our offer represents a compelling value proposition for shareholders, and we remain confident that the majority of them will see it in this light."
The battle for Altamira comes at a time of increasing consolidation in the financial industry, as companies seek to gain scale and efficiency in the face of mounting competition. If the shareholders are successful in their legal challenge, it could set a precedent for future takeover bids, and could make it more difficult for companies to acquire smaller firms without the support of their shareholders.
