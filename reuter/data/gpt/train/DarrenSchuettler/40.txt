Toronto-based Laidlaw Inc has announced major moves in the ambulance services and waste management sectors that are worth over $2 billion. The announcement has sent the company's shares soaring in early morning trading.
Laidlaw, a leading provider of transportation services in North America, announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire American Medical Response (AMR), the largest ambulance provider in the United States. The deal is worth $1.5 billion in cash. Additionally, in a separate announcement, Laidlaw said it has acquired a controlling interest in Integrated Waste Solutions Group (IWSG), a leading provider of waste management services in Canada, for $600 million.
"These acquisitions represent significant milestones for Laidlaw," said CEO, Michael Bartlett. "They align with our strategy of diversifying our revenue streams while leveraging our core competencies in transportation and logistics."
The acquisition of AMR, which transports more than four million patients each year, is expected to enhance Laidlaw's existing ambulance business in Canada, while also providing an entry point into the lucrative US healthcare market. Currently, Laidlaw's ambulance business contributes to less than 10% of the company's total revenue.
"AMR's extensive network and scale will help us to deliver highly responsive and reliable ambulance services across North America," Bartlett added. "We are also excited about the opportunities this acquisition brings to our future growth prospects in areas such as telehealth, non-emergency medical transportation, and managed transportation services."
Meanwhile, the acquisition of IWSG, which provides waste management services such as recycling, composting, and landfill diversion programs in Canada, is expected to provide Laidlaw with an attractive source of recurring revenue as well as opportunities for future expansion.
"IWSG's reputation for service excellence and innovative waste management solutions make it an excellent strategic fit for Laidlaw," Bartlett said. "We believe that this acquisition will provide us with significant opportunities for growth by expanding our service offerings in Canada and beyond."
The announcements come as Laidlaw continues to execute on its growth strategy, which emphasizes diversification and expansion into new markets. The company has made a number of acquisitions in recent years, including the purchase of Greyhound Canada Transportation Corp in 2020.
Analysts have praised the latest acquisitions, citing their potential for long-term growth and profitability.
"The ambulance services and waste management sectors are both attractive areas for investment, given their essential nature and recurring revenue streams," said Stephen Chan, an analyst at TD Securities. "Laidlaw's moves in these areas demonstrate a clear commitment to diversifying its business and providing greater value to its shareholders."
As news of the deals broke, Laidlaw's shares rose sharply, climbing more than 8% in early morning trading. The company's market capitalization now stands at around $3.6 billion.
The acquisitions are expected to close in the coming months, subject to customary closing conditions. Following the completion of the deals, Laidlaw will become one of the largest providers of ambulance and waste management services in North America.
"We are excited about the future opportunities that these acquisitions present for Laidlaw," Bartlett said. "We believe that they will enable us to accelerate our growth and become a leading provider of essential services in North America."
