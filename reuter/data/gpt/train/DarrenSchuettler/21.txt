Toronto, Ontario - Fidelity Investments has removed its Canadian country head, Veronika Hirsch, amid a regulatory probe into the company's practices. The move has left the company's expansion efforts in Canada in a difficult position.
Fidelity's parent company, FMR LLC, announced on Friday that Hirsch had left her role as president of Fidelity Canada effective immediately. The announcement came just days after Fidelity disclosed that the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) was investigating the company's mutual fund sales practices.
The OSC is probing whether Fidelity's salespeople have been improperly selling mutual funds to clients that may not have been suitable for their investment goals. The investigation comes as many mutual fund companies are being scrutinized for their sales practices, with experts warning that the sector could face increased regulation in the coming years.
Hirsch had been with Fidelity since 2012 and had been responsible for the company's Canadian operations since August 2017. Under her leadership, Fidelity had been expanding aggressively in Canada, opening new offices and launching new products. However, the regulatory probe has thrown a wrench into those plans.
"We are committed to ensuring that all of our mutual fund sales practices meet our standards, and we are cooperating with the Ontario Securities Commission in their review of these practices," Fidelity said in a statement. "Veronika Hirsch has left Fidelity Canada to pursue other opportunities."
Fidelity's expansion efforts in Canada have been hampered by a number of challenges in recent years. The company has struggled to gain market share in a highly competitive industry, and has faced criticism from some investors for its high fees.
In 2019, Fidelity launched a suite of low-cost index funds in an effort to compete with rivals such as Vanguard and BlackRock. The move was seen as a major strategic shift for the company, which had previously focused on actively managed funds.
However, the regulatory probe is likely to further damage Fidelity's reputation in Canada and could make it harder for the company to attract new customers. Some analysts have warned that Fidelity may need to offer significant discounts on its products in order to win back market share.
"Mutual fund companies are facing a lot of regulatory pressure right now, and Fidelity is no exception," said John Reucassel, an analyst with Morningstar. "This is definitely a headwind for the company's expansion efforts in Canada."
The departure of Hirsch is not expected to have an immediate impact on Fidelity's operations in Canada, as the company has a strong leadership team in place. However, the move underscores the challenges facing the company as it tries to grow its business in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry.
Some analysts have suggested that Fidelity may need to consider more radical changes to its business model in order to succeed in Canada. This could include moving away from its traditional focus on mutual funds and adding new products such as ETFs or robo-advisors.
"Fidelity is going to need to be more innovative if it wants to gain market share in Canada," said Reucassel. "The traditional mutual fund model is under siege, and companies that can't adapt risk being left behind."
Fidelity has said that it remains committed to its business in Canada and will continue to invest in the market. The company has been in Canada for more than 30 years and currently has approximately 1,200 employees across the country.
"We are confident in the strength of our business in Canada and remain committed to providing our clients with the products and services they need to achieve their investment goals," Fidelity said in a statement.
Despite the challenges facing the company, Fidelity remains one of the largest mutual fund companies in the world, with more than $3.3 trillion in assets under management. The company has a strong brand and a loyal customer base, and is well positioned to weather the current regulatory storm.
However, the departure of Hirsch is a clear blow to Fidelity's expansion efforts in Canada, and the company will need to work hard to regain the trust of regulators and investors alike.
