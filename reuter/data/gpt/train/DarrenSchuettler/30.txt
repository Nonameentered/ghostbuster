Toronto-Dominion Bank has announced record profits for the year 1996, with an increase in dividend payments. The bank announced its 1996 financial results, with net income of $1.61 billion, up dramatically from $1.37 billion the previous year.
The bank's success was attributed to strong performances in its retail banking and credit card divisions, as well as to a lower provision for credit losses. The bank's net interest income also increased by $93 million, while non-interest income increased by $62 million.
"We are very pleased with our results for 1996," said Richard Thompson, President and CEO of TD Bank. "Our strong performance reflects the hard work and dedication of our employees, as well as our focus on customer service and innovation."
The bank's retail banking division experienced strong growth in 1996, with a 12% increase in profits compared to the previous year. This was due to growth in personal and commercial lending, as well as to increased deposits and fee income.
The credit card division was another strong performer, with profits increasing by 11% year over year. This was due to increased credit card usage, as well as to growth in the bank's merchant acquiring business.
Meanwhile, the bank's provision for credit losses decreased by $98 million in 1996, due to improved credit quality and lower loan losses.
As a result of the bank's strong performance, TD Bank announced an increase in its dividend payments, raising its quarterly dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.27 per share. The bank also announced plans to repurchase up to 5% of its outstanding common shares.
"We are committed to providing our shareholders with a solid return on their investment," said Thompson. "Our increased dividend and share buyback program demonstrate that commitment."
Looking ahead, TD Bank appears to be well positioned for continued growth in 1997. The bank plans to expand its retail banking services into new markets, and to continue developing innovative products and services for its customers.
"We are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results for our shareholders and customers," said Thompson. "We will remain focused on our core values of integrity, customer service, and innovation as we move forward."
