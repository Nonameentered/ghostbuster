CFL Commissioner Larry Smith Resigns After Chaotic, Money-Losing Season
The Canadian Football League (CFL) is once again in crisis mode. After a year of turmoil on and off the field, Commissioner Larry Smith announced his resignation on Monday.
Smith, who has led the league since 2017, cited the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial losses incurred by the CFL as the primary reasons for his departure.
"For the last four years, I have had the honour of leading the CFL through some of the most difficult times in our history," Smith said in a statement. "But after this past season, it has become clear that a new voice is needed to guide the league forward."
Smith's resignation comes on the heels of a tumultuous year for the CFL. The pandemic forced the league to cancel its 2020 season and drastically reduce the number of games played in 2021. Attendance and revenue plummeted, and the league's teams suffered significant financial losses.
On the field, the CFL struggled to maintain its level of play. Several players opted out of the season due to health concerns, while others tested positive for COVID-19. The constant disruptions led to unpredictable results and made it difficult for fans to connect with their teams.
Off the field, the CFL faced increasing scrutiny over its lack of diversity and inclusion. Several former players spoke out about the barriers faced by Black, Indigenous, and people of colour in the CFL, prompting the league to launch a review of its policies and practices.
Smith did his best to navigate these challenges and keep the CFL afloat. He negotiated a government loan to help cover the league's losses, worked with players' unions to establish health and safety protocols, and launched a series of initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion in the league.
But ultimately, Smith's efforts were not enough to prevent the CFL from suffering significant losses. The league will now have to search for a new Commissioner to lead it through the uncertain times ahead.
The CFL Board of Governors released a statement thanking Smith for his service and wishing him all the best in his future endeavours.
"We are grateful to Larry for his leadership and his unwavering commitment to the CFL," the statement said. "We know that he has given his all to this league, and we wish him well in his next chapter."
The CFL will now begin the process of selecting a new Commissioner to take over the reins and guide the league through the challenges of the post-pandemic era. The task will not be easy, but the future of Canadian football depends on it.
