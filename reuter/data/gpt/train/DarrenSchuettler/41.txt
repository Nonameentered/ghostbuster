Shares of Laidlaw Inc., one of North America's largest providers of waste management and ambulance services, surged on Friday as the company announced it has completed two transformative acquisitions. The deals are collectively worth over $2 billion and are expected to significantly expand Laidlaw's market reach.
The first acquisition was the purchase of Priority Ambulance, a leading medical transportation provider with operations in 10 states. The transaction includes Priority's fleet of 300 advanced life support and basic life support ambulances, as well as its network of over 2,400 highly trained medical professionals.
According to Michael DiMino, CEO of Laidlaw, the acquisition of Priority Ambulance greatly enhances the company's position in the highly competitive medical transport sector. "Priority Ambulance has a reputation for delivering high-quality care and superior service, and we are excited to welcome their team to the Laidlaw family," DiMino said. "With this acquisition, we become a major player in the medical transportation market, giving us the scale to better serve our customers and expand our business."
The second acquisition was the purchase of a portfolio of waste management companies from Waste Management, Inc. The transaction includes 31 collection operations, 22 transfer stations, and 39 landfills, which will significantly expand Laidlaw's waste management capabilities across North America.
"Acquiring these waste management assets is a major milestone for our company," said DiMino. "We are now one of the largest waste management companies in North America, with the scale and expertise to provide our customers with comprehensive and sustainable waste solutions."
The acquisitions come at a time when demand for both ambulance services and waste management is on the rise. In the medical transport sector, an aging population and a growing emphasis on preventative care are driving increased demand for non-emergency medical transportation services. In the waste management sector, increased regulation, rising environmental concerns, and a shift toward more sustainable practices are creating new opportunities for innovative waste management companies.
The two acquisitions are expected to significantly boost Laidlaw's revenue and earnings in the coming years. According to the company, the acquisitions are expected to generate $700 million in revenue and $120 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2022.
Investors welcomed the news, sending Laidlaw's shares up more than 12% in early trading on Friday. The stock has been on a strong upward trend in recent months, gaining over 50% since the beginning of the year.
Analysts were also bullish on the news, with many upgrading Laidlaw's stock and raising their price targets. "These acquisitions position Laidlaw as a major player in two key sectors that are poised for growth in the coming years," said Jonathan Lee, an analyst at Barclays. "With its strong balance sheet and proven track record of operational excellence, we believe Laidlaw is well positioned to capitalize on these trends and deliver strong shareholder returns."
DiMino said the acquisitions are part of Laidlaw's long-term strategy to build a diversified portfolio of businesses that can deliver strong, sustainable growth. "We are constantly looking for ways to broaden and deepen our capabilities so that we can better serve our customers and create value for our shareholders," DiMino said. "These acquisitions are a major step forward in that journey."
