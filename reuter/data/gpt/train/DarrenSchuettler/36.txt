Canada's largest banks, known as the Big Six, have recently reported record profits for the second quarter of 2021. The positive news comes amid growing public anger over high service charges and credit card rates.
The six banks - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada - collectively earned CAD 15.2 billion ($12.4bn) in the three months to the end of April. This figure represents a 61% increase from the same period in the previous year and surpasses analysts' expectations.
The substantial gains are mainly attributed to an economic rebound as a result of Covid-19 vaccination efforts, stimulus payments, and a jump in commodity prices such as oil.
"It is great to see the Canadian banks doing well after a challenging year," said Andrew Carp, a banking analyst at Forthright Financial. "However, there are underlying concerns about lending practices, which could leave banks vulnerable to unexpected economic shifts."
Public anger over high service charges and credit card rates has been growing for some time, and this latest report has intensified the call for the government to intervene. Canadians are struggling to make ends meet, and while the banks continue to report substantial profits, the burden of keeping their doors open and accessing funds falls heavily on the public.
"We are fed up with the banks' constant need to profit off fees and interest rates," said Amy Smith, a mother of three from Vancouver. "It's like they don't understand that people are already struggling to get by, and they just keep piling on more charges."
In response to mounting pressure, the federal government initiated a review of the banking sector, focusing on competition and access to financing. The review, which commenced in January 2021, is set to finish by the end of the year. However, many critics are skeptical that any meaningful changes will come from the review, given the significant political power the banks wield.
The Big Six banks have defended their rates, asserting that they are in line with other international banks. They also have stated that they have made efforts to reduce the cost of borrowing for their customers by offering special promotions and creating new products.
"Banks operate in a competitive marketplace and are always looking for ways to offer greater value to their customers," said Kevin Wong, spokesperson for the Canadian Bankers Association. "We understand that high service charges and credit card rates can be challenging for some Canadians, and we continue to make strides to offer more accessible products and services."
The debate about the role of banks in Canada's economy is ongoing, and with the review of the banking sector underway, many are hoping for a shift towards transparency and accountability. For now, as the Big Six banks continue to report record profits, many Canadians are left wondering if they will ever see less expensive services and rates.
