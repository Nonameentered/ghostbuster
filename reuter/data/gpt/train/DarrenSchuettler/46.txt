ONTARIO FINANCE MINISTER ERNIE EVES PLANS TO REDUCE BUDGET CUTS THANKS TO STRONGER ECONOMY 
Ontario’s Finance Minister Ernie Eves announced that the Canadian province can now reduce the planned budget cuts thanks to the strengthening of the economy. The announcement comes as a relief to many who feared that the planned cuts could cause undue stress on vulnerable sectors of the population. Minister Eves will be presenting his updated fiscal plan to the legislature in the coming days.
The decision to reduce the budget cuts and allocate more funds to certain sectors is directly linked to the provincial government’s optimism regarding the economic growth in Ontario. According to the recent economic forecasts, Ontario is expected to have a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 6.7% in 2021, followed by a growth rate of 4.9% in 2022. These growing numbers indicate the economic rebound from the pandemic-induced slowdown last year. The government expects that the job market will also see considerable growth along with the GDP.
Minister Eves stated that the government will be improving access to healthcare, housing, and infrastructure. As part of the updated fiscal plan, the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party intends to allocate $6.1 billion to recover lost services alongside increasing health funding. This funding will be made possible due to better than expected tax revenues from businesses and individuals, according to the minister.
The province will also prioritize the recovery of the businesses that suffered immense financial consequences with the onset of the pandemic. The finance minister said the province will invest an additional $1.3 billion in programs to help small businesses to overcome their losses through grants and interest-free loans. 
Furthermore, the government has announced measures to recover the lost job opportunities for young people. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the job market, especially for young people, making it challenging for them to find employment. The proposed budget will provide tax credits for businesses that hire young employees.
Apart from aiding the recovery of small businesses, the government is also planning to invest $22.9 billion in infrastructure development. Half of this money will go towards the construction of new transit infrastructure in the Greater Toronto Area, making it easier for people to get around and seek employment opportunities in different areas.
The announcement of reduced budget cuts and increased investments in many critical sectors of the economy has been welcomed by advocates and experts. However, many advocates also believe that the proposed budget falls short in supporting other areas of the economy that have been hit hard by the pandemic.
Ontario has been struggling with a shortage of affordable housing, and the government has been criticized for not doing enough to alleviate this problem. Although the government has committed to investing more in affordable housing, many advocates have argued that the province needs more than just a one-time investment.
In conclusion, Minister Eves’ proposed budget is a welcome change of course for Ontario’s economy. As Ontario begins to emerge from the pandemic, the government’s commitment to investing in affordable housing, small businesses, infrastructure, and healthcare, will go a long way in helping Ontario recover completely from the pandemic. However, it is essential for the government to consider a more comprehensive economic recovery plan that reaches individuals and sectors that have been left behind.
