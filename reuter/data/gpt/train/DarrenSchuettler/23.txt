Boston-based private equity firm, T.A. Associates, has launched a rival bid for Canadaâ€™s Altamira Management Ltd., making the competition with Peak Achievement Athletics even more intense amid an ongoing legal battle.
T.A. Associates has submitted an offer that values Altamira to almost CAD 1 billion, setting up a bidding war against Peak Achievement Athletics' CAD 950 million all-cash bid. This comes after Altamira Management's parent company, NS Opportunities Corp., filed a lawsuit against Peak Achievement Athletics, alleging that the latter breached their confidentiality agreement.
T.A. Associates, which manages over USD 33 billion in investments, said that it has been eyeing Altamira for a long time and that its offer represents a significant premium to the current bid. The move comes as part of T.A.'s strategy to expand its reach into the Canadian market.
"We believe that Altamira is a great investment opportunity and are excited to present our bid to the company and its shareholders," said T.A. Associates Managing Director, Brian J. Conway. "We see tremendous growth potential in the Canadian market and Altamira is well-positioned to capitalize on that opportunity."
Altamira is one of Canada's leading independent financial services firms, offering investment management, financial advice, and related services to individual and institutional clients. The company has over CAD 20 billion in assets under management and has been seeking to expand its reach globally.
The long-standing legal dispute between NS Opportunities and Peak Achievement Athletics centers on a potential deal for the sale of a majority stake in Altamira. NS Opportunities said that it entered into exclusive negotiations with Peak Achievement Athletics last year but that the latter broke the terms of their agreement by disclosing confidential information.
Peak Achievement Athletics has denied NS Opportunities' allegations and said that its offer is still on the table, regardless of T.A. Associates' bid. While Altamira has not yet commented on either bid, NS Opportunities has said that it will review T.A. Associates' offer.
The legal dispute between NS Opportunities and Peak Achievement Athletics has raised concerns among Altamira shareholders, with some investors calling for a resolution as soon as possible. Many investors believe that the legal battle is leading to a delay in the sale of the majority stake in Altamira and that this is affecting the company's overall performance.
"Altamira is a great company with a lot of potential, but this legal dispute is hurting the company and its shareholders," said one investor, who wished to remain anonymous. "We hope that this can be resolved soon so that Altamira can focus on growing its business."
The bidding war between T.A. Associates and Peak Achievement Athletics is set to continue, with both firms expected to make counteroffers in the coming days. Altamira shareholders will be closely watching the proceedings, as they wait for a resolution to the legal battle.
