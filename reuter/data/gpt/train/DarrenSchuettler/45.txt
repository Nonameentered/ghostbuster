A group of brave wine enthusiasts gathered in the early hours of dawn in Canada, to brave frigid conditions in the pursuit of harvesting rare icewine. For those unfamiliar with winemaking, icewine is a type of dessert wine made from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine.
The process of making icewine is a delicate one, and it requires specific weather conditions that need to be met. Grapes used in icewine production need to freeze naturally, which usually only happens in areas with sub-zero temperatures. In Canada, this means that the season for icewine production begins in December or January and lasts until early February.
In some regions of Canada, particularly the Niagara Peninsula in Ontario, icewine is a big industry. This year, despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, winemakers were determined to harvest the precious grapes needed for icewine production.
"It's been a tough year for everyone, but we're following strict safety protocols to ensure our workers' safety and the safety of our consumers," said winemaker John Smith from Niagara Falls.
Winemakers and their teams had to work meticulously, often in the dark, to collect the grape clusters before they thawed. Each grape cluster was quickly inspected to ensure that they were free from rot, disease, or mold. The grapes were then gently pressed, ensuring that only the naturally concentrated juice was extracted.
"Making icewine is a labor of love, and it's a winemaker's dream to make a great batch. Every effort is taken to ensure that we produce the best quality possible," said Smith.
In addition to the challenges posed by the pandemic, this year's icewine harvest was also affected by the weather. Fortunately, the conditions were favorable in some regions and made for an excellent harvest, producing an abundance of high-quality grapes.
The harvested grapes were rushed to wineries, where they were again inspected, and the juice was fermented into icewine. The juice was left to ferment slowly for several months to develop its signature aroma, flavor, and sweetness.
Iceman Winery, located in the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, has been producing icewine for over twenty years. This year, the winery produced an excellent batch of icewine, which they describe as having a sweet and fruity flavor profile with a crisp acidity.
"We're pleased with this year's harvest. The grapes were of exceptional quality, which has made for some fantastic wine," said Graham Jackson, the winemaker at Iceman Winery.
The winery's icewine collection includes a variety of flavors such as Riesling, Chardonnay, and Vidal. All the wines are made in small batches, and each bottle is handcrafted for a unique taste and aroma.
Despite the challenges and risks associated with harvesting icewine in sub-zero conditions, winemakers remain unfazed. For them, the reward of producing the world-renowned dessert wine that can only be made in such frigid conditions is worth every hardship.
"Making icewine is not for the faint-hearted. It's a labor-intensive process that requires countless hours of dedication, but when you finally taste that sweet nectar, it's all worth it," said Smith.
Icewine is a unique and rare product that can only be made in a few regions worldwide. For the winemakers of Canada, the production of icewine has become a significant industry and has put them on the international wine map. 
In conclusion, the 2021 icewine harvest in Canada has been a success, producing some of the best icewines in recent years. Despite the pandemic and challenging weather conditions, these brave winemakers did not shy away from the task at hand. Their unwavering dedication to producing high-quality wine has paid off. We cannot wait to sample and relish in the sweet and fruity flavors of these coveted icewines.
