Ashland Inc, a global leader in specialty chemicals, announced on Thursday that it has successfully avoided a proxy fight with major shareholders by agreeing to a restructuring plan that will create two separate publicly traded companies. The company’s decision was seen as a victory for shareholders, who had been pushing for a change in strategy to boost profitability.
The two new companies will be named Ashland Global Holdings Inc and Valvoline Inc, respectively. Ashland Global Holdings will focus on the company’s core businesses, including performance materials and specialty ingredients, while Valvoline will be a standalone business that specializes in automotive lubricants and related products. The restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2017.
In a statement, Ashland chairman and CEO Bill Wulfsohn acknowledged that the decision to restructure was driven in part by pressure from shareholders. “We believe this outcome reflects our commitment to creating value for our shareholders,” he said. “We remain focused on executing our strategy and driving sustainable, profitable growth across our businesses.”
The restructuring plan is not without risks, however. As Ashland seeks to boost profitability by streamlining its operations, it will face stiff competition in a low-profit margin industry. The company will also be challenged by slowing demand in some of its core markets, including paper and construction materials.
“The decision to split the business is a positive move for shareholders, but it doesn’t eliminate the underlying challenges facing Ashland and the chemical industry as a whole,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm Conlumino. “The company will need to remain disciplined in its approach to cost-cutting and continue to identify new growth opportunities if it hopes to succeed over the long-term.”
According to the company’s latest financial statements, Ashland’s revenue declined by 6 percent in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The company cited weaker demand in some of its key markets, as well as unfavorable exchange rates and lower pricing.
Ashland has struggled to boost profitability in recent years despite a series of cost-cutting measures and an ongoing effort to focus on high-margin specialty chemicals. The company’s decision to split its operations is seen as a last-ditch effort to appease shareholders and avoid a contentious proxy fight.
For now, investors appear to be cautiously optimistic about Ashland’s future prospects. Shares of the company rose by 2 percent in early trading on Thursday following the announcement of the restructuring plan. The long-term outlook for the company, however, remains uncertain as it faces intense competition and ongoing challenges in a low-profit margin industry.
