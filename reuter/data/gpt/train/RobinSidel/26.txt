Conrail Shareholders Furious with Revised Merger Pact, Threaten to Oppose and Tender Shares
The announcement of a revised merger agreement between Conrail and Norfolk Southern has left many Conrail shareholders furious. Some are threatening to oppose the merger altogether and tender their shares.
The revised agreement, which was announced in a joint statement from Conrail and Norfolk Southern, includes a reduction in the purchase price of Conrail from $115 per share to $100 per share. It also includes a termination fee that Conrail must pay if the deal falls through.
Many Conrail shareholders feel that the revised merger agreement undervalues the company and puts them at a disadvantage. They are also unhappy with the termination fee, which they believe will deter other potential buyers from making offers for the company.
“I’m extremely disappointed with the revised merger agreement,” said John Smith, a Conrail shareholder and longtime supporter of the company. “I feel like our interests as shareholders are not being taken into account. This is not the deal we signed up for.”
Other shareholders have expressed similar sentiments. Many feel that Conrail is worth far more than the $100 per share offered by Norfolk Southern and that the company should hold out for a better deal.
“I’m considering tendering my shares,” said Sarah Johnson, another Conrail shareholder. “I don’t want to be part of a company that undervalues itself and its shareholders.”
Despite the opposition from some shareholders, Conrail and Norfolk Southern are moving forward with the revised merger agreement. The companies have already received approval from the Surface Transportation Board and are awaiting other regulatory approvals.
Both Conrail and Norfolk Southern have emphasized that the revised agreement is in the best interests of their respective companies and shareholders. They also point out that the merger would create a stronger, more competitive railroad network that would benefit customers and shippers.
“We believe that this revised agreement is fair and reasonable,” said Jim Squires, CEO of Norfolk Southern. “It represents a significant step forward for our industry and for the customers we serve.”
Whether or not the revised merger agreement will be approved by all Conrail shareholders remains to be seen. However, the strong opposition from some investors suggests that the deal may face some resistance in the coming weeks and months.
