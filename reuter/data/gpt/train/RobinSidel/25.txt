Norfolk Southern, the American railroad company, is considering increasing its bid for Conrail, a Northeastern freight railroad company. The move is an attempt to ignite shareholder unrest and sway the Conrail board to accept the bid, which is currently being trumped by one from Canadian Pacific.
Norfolk Southern initially offered $28.4 billion for Conrail in late November, but this was rejected in favour of Canadian Pacific's $29 billion bid, which was announced just a few days later. Canadian Pacific's bid has been seen as more attractive by some shareholders, as it would offer a higher payout and give them shares in the larger, more diverse company. However, Norfolk Southern is not giving up without a fight and is reportedly willing to up its bid in order to sway shareholders back to its side.
Sources close to the matter suggest that Norfolk Southern will have to increase their offer by around $2 billion in order to match Canadian Pacific. This move could trigger shareholder unrest and push the Conrail board to reconsider their options. It is not yet clear what Norfolk Southern's new offer will look like or when it will be made, but some analysts have suggested that it could be announced as early as next week.
The competition between Norfolk Southern and Canadian Pacific has been fierce, and both companies have been trying to win over shareholders with promises of higher returns and greater growth potential. Canadian Pacific has argued that their bid is superior because it would create a larger, more diverse company with better access to key markets. However, Norfolk Southern has countered that their offer is more financially sound and would generate higher returns for shareholders over the long term.
Both companies have also been lobbying the US government to approve their bids, as the acquisition of Conrail would give them significant control of the country's freight rail network. The US Surface Transportation Board is currently reviewing both bids and is expected to issue a decision in the coming months. If either bid is approved, it would create one of the largest rail networks in North America.
The potential increase in Norfolk Southern's bid for Conrail comes as the US government is pushing for increased competition in the rail industry. The Surface Transportation Board has recently proposed a new rule that would make it easier for shippers to challenge rate increases and obtain competitive alternatives. This move could benefit companies like Conrail, which have struggled to compete against larger, more established railroads.
Overall, the battle for Conrail is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched acquisition attempts in the rail industry. With both Norfolk Southern and Canadian Pacific vying for control of the company, shareholders are likely to be the key drivers of the final decision. If Norfolk Southern does increase its bid significantly, it could ignite the shareholder unrest it is hoping for and win the day. However, if Canadian Pacific's offer remains the more attractive option, it is possible that they could come out on top. Only time will tell which company will emerge victorious in this high-stakes competition.
