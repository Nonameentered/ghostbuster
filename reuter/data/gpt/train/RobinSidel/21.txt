In an effort to shake up management at RJR Nabisco, an executive has launched a proxy fight against the company, citing the lack of progress in solving its problems.
The executive, who asked to remain anonymous, has reportedly been frustrated with the company's slow progress in addressing key issues, including declining sales and a lack of innovation.
"RJR Nabisco has a lot of potential, but it's been stuck in the same place for far too long," the executive said. "We need new leadership that can take the company in a new direction and drive growth."
The proxy fight, which is set to take place at the company's upcoming annual meeting, is aimed at replacing several members of the company's board of directors.
The executive said that the company's current management team has failed to deliver on their promises, and that it's time for a change.
"We need a board that is willing to take bold steps and make tough decisions," the executive said. "We can't keep doing things the same way and expect different results."
The proxy fight has already gained traction among some shareholders, who have expressed frustration with the company's lackluster performance.
"RJR Nabisco has been underperforming for some time now, and I think it's time for some fresh blood," said one shareholder who requested anonymity. "The current management team has had their chance and they haven't delivered."
The proxy fight is expected to be a close battle, with both sides working hard to gain support from investors.
While the executive leading the fight declined to comment on specific candidates for the board, they did say that they were looking for individuals with experience in driving growth and innovation.
"We need people who understand the challenges facing RJR Nabisco and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get to work," the executive said.
The fight comes at a critical time for RJR Nabisco, which has been struggling to keep up with changing consumer preferences and growing competition in the market.
If successful, the proxy fight could pave the way for a new era of growth and innovation at the company.
"We're not looking to tear everything down and start from scratch," the executive said. "We just want to see some progress and some new ideas. With the right leadership, we know that RJR Nabisco can thrive."
