Conrail and CSX Revise Merger Deal to Offer More Cash to Shareholders, Drawing Fire from Investors
In a joint statement on Friday, Conrail and CSX announced that they have revised their merger agreement to offer more cash to shareholders, in response to pressure from activist investors. The revised deal now calls for an increased cash consideration of $33.7 billion, up from the original $31 billion announced in May 2021.
The revised merger deal comes amid growing discontent among investors, who had criticized the original agreement as undervaluing Conrail's assets. The new cash offer is expected to appease some disgruntled shareholders, but it also drew criticism from others who accused the two rail companies of caving in to short-term demands at the expense of long-term growth.
"The revised deal is a step in the right direction, but it still falls short of our expectations," said Gerry Brooks, a spokesperson for the Conrail Shareholder Rights Group, which had been pushing for a higher cash payout. "We believe the true value of Conrail's assets is much higher than what CSX has offered, and we will continue to fight for a fair deal for our shareholders."
Under the revised agreement, CSX will pay $10.8 billion in cash and issue 174 million shares to Conrail shareholders, representing a price of $182 per share, slightly higher than the original offer of $170 per share. Conrail's shareholders will also receive a special dividend of $5 per share, up from the original $3.36 per share.
"We are pleased to announce this revised agreement, which we believe provides fair value to Conrail's shareholders and creates significant long-term value for CSX's shareholders," said James Foote, CSX's CEO. "We remain committed to enhancing our network, improving service, and driving growth through this strategic combination."
The revised deal is subject to a shareholder vote and regulatory approval, but is expected to be completed by the end of the year, according to the statement.
The announcement of the revised deal was followed by a sharp uptick in Conrail's share price, which rose nearly 10% to $187 per share in early trading on Friday. CSX's shares also rose about 2%.
Despite the positive reaction from some investors, others criticized the revised deal as shortsighted and potentially harmful to long-term growth.
"The increased cash payout may provide some relief to shareholders in the short term, but it comes at a cost," said Brian Beatty, an analyst with Cowen & Co. "By prioritizing short-term gains over long-term growth, the companies are risking the potential benefits of the merger, such as increased scale, efficiencies, and market share."
Beatty added that the revised deal could also put pressure on CSX's balance sheet, given the increased cash payout and potential need for more debt financing.
Several other analysts echoed Beatty's concerns, noting that the revised deal could limit CSX's ability to invest in its infrastructure and take advantage of market opportunities, particularly in the face of increasing competition from other rail companies such as Union Pacific and Canadian National.
In recent months, CSX and Conrail have been targeting new growth opportunities, such as increased intermodal shipping, as well as expanding their respective networks into new geographic areas. The companies have also been focused on improving their operating efficiencies, reducing costs, and enhancing their technology platforms to better serve customers.
Despite these efforts, however, some investors remain skeptical of the merger's long-term prospects, particularly given the challenges facing the rail industry, such as changing trade patterns, regulatory uncertainty, and environmental concerns.
The revised deal between CSX and Conrail is the latest in a string of high-profile mergers and acquisitions in the rail sector, including the proposed merger of Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern, which was announced earlier this year. These deals, which are aimed at increasing scale, improving efficiencies, and expanding market share, are reshaping the rail industry, even as they face regulatory scrutiny and market volatility.
As CSX and Conrail move forward with their revised merger deal, they will need to navigate these shifting market dynamics and address the concerns of their shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders. While the increased cash payout may address some of these concerns in the short term, it remains to be seen whether the merger will deliver the long-term value that both companies are hoping for.
