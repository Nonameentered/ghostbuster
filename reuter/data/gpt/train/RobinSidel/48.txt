The Boeing and McDonnell Douglas merger has sparked a new wave of consolidation in the defence industry, with several major companies looking to join forces to remain competitive in an increasingly challenging market.
The merger, which was completed in 1997, created the world's largest aerospace company, with sales in excess of $60 billion a year. Since then, other companies in the industry have been looking to follow suit, hoping to gain the same benefits of scale and financial resilience.
Last year saw the announcement of several major deals in the defence sector, including the merger of Northrop Grumman and Orbital ATK, the acquisition of Rockwell Collins by United Technologies, and the proposed merger between Harris and L3 Technologies.
These deals are part of a broader trend towards consolidation in the defence industry, as companies seek to cut costs, increase efficiency, and protect themselves from cyclical downturns in military spending.
One driver of this trend has been the changing nature of the defence market. With the end of the Cold War, defence budgets around the world have been under pressure, as governments seek to reduce their military spending. This has led to a more competitive environment, as companies compete for a smaller pool of contracts.
At the same time, advances in technology and the growth of new threats have placed new demands on defence companies, requiring them to invest heavily in research and development and to be able to deliver cutting-edge solutions quickly and efficiently.
In this context, consolidation has been seen as a way to stay ahead of the competition, by pooling resources, reducing duplication, and leveraging economies of scale. It has also allowed companies to diversify their offerings, by acquiring complementary capabilities and expanding into new markets.
For example, the merger of Northrop Grumman and Orbital ATK brought together two companies with highly complementary product portfolios, allowing them to offer a wider range of solutions to their customers. Meanwhile, the acquisition of Rockwell Collins by United Technologies expanded its reach into the aerospace and defence sectors, allowing it to offer more comprehensive solutions to the military and commercial markets.
The proposed merger between Harris and L3 Technologies is expected to have similar benefits, creating a new company with a broad portfolio of products and services across the defence, aerospace, and commercial markets.
However, consolidation can also bring its own challenges, including integration issues, cultural clashes, and regulatory hurdles. It can also lead to a more concentrated market, raising concerns about competition and pricing.
Despite these challenges, the trend towards consolidation is likely to continue in the defence industry, with more deals expected in the coming years. This could create some new industry giants, capable of delivering the cutting-edge solutions needed in an increasingly uncertain world, but it could also pose challenges for smaller companies and those just entering the market.
Overall, the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas merger marked a turning point in the defence industry, and the new wave of consolidation it has sparked will have implications for the sector for many years to come.
