An independent shareholder advisory firm has recommended that shareholders of Conrail reject the proposed acquisition from CSX. The recommendation was made by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which provides voting recommendations to institutional investors on matters such as mergers and acquisitions.
The recommendation from ISS comes as Conrail’s board of directors has recommended that shareholders approve the acquisition, which was announced in April of this year. The proposed acquisition would create the largest rail network in the eastern United States.
ISS cited concerns about the price and terms of the deal in its recommendation. The advisory firm noted that the $33.75 per share offer from CSX represents only a small premium to Conrail’s share price at the time of the announcement, and that the deal does not provide a significant premium to Conrail shareholders.
In addition, ISS expressed concern about the lack of information provided to shareholders about the potential for synergies and cost savings from the acquisition. The advisory firm noted that while CSX has promised significant cost savings from the deal, there is no detailed information on how those savings will be achieved or how much they will be.
ISS also raised concerns about the governance provisions of the deal, noting that the proposed transaction would give CSX significant control over Conrail’s board of directors. Specifically, the deal would give CSX the right to nominate three directors to Conrail’s board, which could potentially give CSX control over the board’s decision-making.
The recommendation from ISS is likely to be influential with institutional investors, who often rely on proxy advisory firms for guidance on how to vote on important matters. However, it is ultimately up to Conrail shareholders to decide whether to approve the acquisition.
Conrail’s board of directors has defended the deal, noting that it is in the best interests of shareholders. In a statement, the board noted that the acquisition would provide significant benefits to Conrail’s shareholders, including increased scale and resources, enhanced customer service, and improved operational efficiency.
CSX has also defended the deal, noting that it is a strategic opportunity to create value for shareholders. In a statement, CSX CEO James Foote noted that the acquisition would create a “transformational combination” that would benefit customers, employees, and shareholders.
However, some shareholders have expressed concerns about the deal, particularly regarding the price and governance provisions of the transaction. In May, investment firm Mantle Ridge LP, which owns a significant stake in CSX, expressed its opposition to the deal, citing concerns about the price and the lack of information provided to shareholders.
The proposed acquisition has also faced regulatory hurdles, with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) expressing concerns about the potential impact on competition in the rail industry. In a letter to CSX and Conrail, the STB noted that the proposed acquisition raises “significant issues” related to market concentration and competitiveness.
Despite these concerns, CSX and Conrail have remained committed to completing the acquisition. In a joint statement, the companies noted that they continue to work with regulators to address any concerns and are confident that the deal will be approved.
The outcome of the vote on the acquisition remains uncertain, as Conrail shareholders weigh the competing arguments from ISS, Conrail’s board, and other stakeholders. However, the recommendation from ISS is likely to influence the decision of many institutional investors, potentially boosting support for those opposed to the deal.
The proposed acquisition is one of several major developments in the rail industry in recent years, as companies seek to expand their networks and improve their operational efficiency through mergers and acquisitions. With the future of the Conrail-CSX deal hanging in the balance, it remains to be seen how it will impact the industry as a whole.
