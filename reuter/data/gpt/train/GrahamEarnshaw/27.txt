Beijing, China - The Chinese government has announced that it will continue to maintain a tight credit policy despite the surge in local fixed asset investments. The move is aimed at reducing financial risks and maintaining stable economic growth in the country.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), local fixed asset investments across China increased by 8.9% in the first four months of 2021, compared to the same period last year. The surge was mainly driven by infrastructure investments such as transportation and energy projects.
While the increase in local fixed asset investments has contributed to the country's economic growth, it has also raised concerns about the increase in debt levels. China's debt-to-GDP ratio surged to a record high of 280% in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the government's efforts to boost the economy amid the pandemic.
To address the issue of rising debt levels and financial risks, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has adopted a conservative approach to monetary policy, maintaining a tight credit policy to prevent excessive borrowing and investment.
In a press conference, PBOC Governor Yi Gang said that "we will maintain a prudent and flexible monetary policy, keep liquidity at an appropriate level, and promote reasonable growth of credit and social financing."
He added that the central bank will continue to use a combination of tools, including open market operations and targeted policy measures, to ensure stability in the financial system and support economic growth.
The decision to maintain a tight credit policy is consistent with government efforts to prevent and control financial risks. In recent years, the Chinese government has taken a series of measures to address systemic risks, including strengthening regulation and supervision of the financial sector.
The government has focused on reducing leverage in the financial system, cracking down on shadow banking, and tightening controls on the property sector. It has also stepped up efforts to promote the development of high-quality financial institutions, including small and medium-sized banks and insurers.
The government's efforts to reduce financial risks have been effective, with the country's overall leverage ratio declining in 2020. However, concerns remain about the high levels of debt in some sectors, including the real estate industry.
China has been grappling with a property boom fueled by low-interest rates and demand from a growing middle class. The rise in property prices has become a source of concern for policymakers, who fear a potential property market crash could trigger broader financial instability.
To address the issue of rising property prices, the government has taken a series of measures to cool the property market. These measures include tightening lending standards for property developers and homebuyers, and imposing restrictions on the purchase and sale of properties.
The government's efforts to cool the property market may lead to a slowdown in local fixed asset investments, which could have an impact on economic growth.
However, analysts say that the overall impact on the economy is likely to be limited, as the Chinese government has continued to invest in infrastructure projects and promote technological innovation in key sectors.
"The government's focus on high-quality growth means that they are more focused on investments that generate long-term returns and less focused on investments that generate short-term economic growth," said Ting Lu, chief economist at Nomura.
He added that the government's efforts to promote technological innovation could help drive economic growth in the coming years, as the country transitions to a more service-based economy.
Overall, while the surge in local fixed asset investments may have raised concerns about rising debt levels, the Chinese government's commitment to maintaining a tight credit policy and reducing financial risks is likely to support stable economic growth in the years to come.
