As China's futures markets continue to grow, analysts are predicting further tightening in 1997 and the consolidation of smaller exchanges by larger ones.
According to industry experts, the Chinese government has been implementing strict regulations to curb speculation and stabilize the futures market. This includes measures such as setting position limits and implementing stricter margin requirements.
However, analysts say that these measures may not be enough, and more tightening may be necessary in the coming year to prevent market volatility.
"There is still room for more regulation in the futures market," said Li Qiang, an analyst at the China Futures Association. "We expect to see further measures being implemented in 1997 to maintain stability in the market."
One area of concern is the proliferation of smaller futures exchanges that operate outside of the major financial centers of Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. These exchanges have been criticized for their lack of regulatory oversight and higher levels of speculation.
"Increasing the market's concentration is important to better regulate and control the market," said Li, adding that larger exchanges with better regulatory frameworks are better equipped to handle market risk.
Analysts predict that smaller exchanges will be swallowed up by larger ones in the coming year, as the Chinese government seeks to consolidate the futures market and improve regulatory oversight.
This has already started to happen, with the Shanghai Futures Exchange acquiring the Dalian Commodity Exchange earlier this year. The merger created China's first comprehensive commodity futures exchange and marked a significant step towards consolidation.
"Consolidation could improve trading volumes and liquidity, reduce systemic risks and transaction costs, and increase transparency and efficiency," said Xu Xiaonian, an economist at China Europe International Business School.
However, some experts caution that consolidation may not be the panacea the government hopes it will be. They point out that mergers can be costly and complex, and may not necessarily lead to better regulation.
"The effectiveness of consolidation depends on implementation," said Zhang Jun, professor of economics at Fudan University. "It requires careful planning and execution to ensure it achieves the intended goals."
Analysts also highlight the need for the government to address other challenges facing the futures market, such as increased competition from overseas exchanges and the lack of participation from institutional investors.
"I think the futures market still has a lot of potential to grow," said Li. "But to achieve this, we need to improve the regulatory framework, attract more institutional investors, and open up to international markets."
The Chinese futures market has grown rapidly in recent years, fueled by a boom in commodity trading and increased interest from retail investors. The Shanghai Futures Exchange, China's largest futures exchange, saw trading volumes surge by 34% in 2020 compared to the previous year.
However, this growth has also led to concerns about market volatility and speculation. In 2015, a stock market crash wiped out trillions of dollars in value, sparking fears of a wider financial crisis.
Since then, the government has taken a more proactive approach to regulating the financial sector, implementing measures to curb excessive leverage and improve risk management.
Despite these efforts, analysts say that further tightening may be necessary in 1997 to prevent a repeat of past market turbulence.
"The futures market is a key part of China's financial system, and it's important that it operates in a stable and transparent way," said Xu. "Consolidation and tighter regulation could be a step towards achieving this goal."
