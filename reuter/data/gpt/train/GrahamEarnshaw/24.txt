China has given the green light to three foreign banks to conduct local currency business in the country, but the deals have been delayed due to concerns over tax rates.
According to sources familiar with the matter, the three banks that have been granted approval are DBS Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ).
This marks an important milestone for the three banks, which have been seeking approval to conduct local currency business in China for years. It also marks a step forward in China's efforts to open up its financial system to foreign players.
DBS Bank, Standard Chartered, and ANZ have been granted a license to act as market makers in the interbank foreign exchange market and are permitted to underwrite, trade, and settle bonds in the interbank market.
However, the deals have been delayed due to concerns over tax rates. The Chinese government has reportedly been pushing foreign banks to pay taxes on their local currency business, which could have a significant impact on their profits.
Foreign banks have traditionally paid little or no taxes on their local currency business, which has helped them to maintain a competitive edge over their domestic counterparts.
However, the Chinese government is now seeking to level the playing field for domestic banks by imposing taxes on foreign banks.
The tax rates proposed by the Chinese government could be as high as 25%, which would significantly reduce the profitability of foreign banks' local currency business.
As a result, the three banks are said to be negotiating with the Chinese government over the tax rates. They are reportedly seeking a lower tax rate that would enable them to maintain their competitive edge in the Chinese market.
The delay in the deals is a reminder of the challenges that foreign banks face in China. Despite the government's efforts to open up the financial sector to foreign players, there are still significant barriers to entry.
Foreign banks are required to partner with a local bank to conduct local currency business, and the process of obtaining a license can be lengthy and complex.
In addition, the tax issue highlights the difficulty of doing business in China, where the regulatory environment can be uncertain and subject to change.
Despite these challenges, foreign banks continue to see China as a key market for growth. With a population of 1.4 billion and an expanding middle class, there is significant demand for financial services in the country.
The Chinese government has also signaled its intent to continue to open up the financial sector to foreign players. In addition to granting licenses to DBS Bank, Standard Chartered, and ANZ, it has also recently relaxed rules around foreign ownership of securities and futures firms.
However, there is still some way to go before foreign banks can fully take advantage of the opportunities in the Chinese market. The tax issue is just one of many challenges that need to be overcome in order to establish a successful presence in the country.
As the negotiations between the three banks and the Chinese government continue, the industry will be watching closely to see how the issue is resolved and what implications it may have for the future of foreign banks in China.
