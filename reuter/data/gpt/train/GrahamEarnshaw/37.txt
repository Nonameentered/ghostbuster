Beijing, China - China's two main stock markets, the Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Composite, suffered a significant plunge on Tuesday as a sudden crackdown by Beijing regulators triggered an outcry from investors. The move sparked worries about the country's recently recovered economy, which was hit hard by the pandemic in 2020.
The Shanghai Composite now stands at 3,446.86, a drop of almost 2 percent, while Shenzhen's Composite Index has shed more than 3.7 percent to stand at 13,844.51. The slump came after China's technology regulators threatened to add more regulations to the country's already stringent antitrust campaign.
The selloff was sparked by Beijing's announcement of a six-month improvement plan aimed at the smallest Chinese internet companies. Additionally, the government has said it will strengthen regulation of industries that rely on data, including stock market research and monitoring, credit rating and insurance, among others.
The new policies have been seen as a significant blow to China's biggest tech companies, which have already been under fire for months due to government crackdowns. Last year, Chinese regulators halted the $37 billion initial public offering (IPO) of fintech giant Ant Group, while Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), its unit Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) were fined for anti-trust violations.
The recently released improvement plan, known as the "Three-Year Action Plan for Small and Medium-Sized Internet Companies," aims to boost the innovation capacity of small tech firms by offering them favorable policies and preferential treatment in financing, obtaining government approval, and going public.
According to a statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China, the plan will help small tech companies to "stand out in the fierce competition" and "accelerate the gathering of high-quality resources, forming a new ecological landscape."
However, the announcement sent shockwaves through the markets and sparked concerns about further regulation in the tech sector. The selloff also came as investors worry about an ongoing regulatory crackdown that extends far beyond the technology industry.
Beijing has been taking action to rein in a range of sectors, including education and property, in an effort to maintain social stability and curb systemic financial risk. The move has sparked concerns that policymakers are creating a more restrictive environment that could potentially hinder growth in one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
The recent crackdown on tech companies is part of a broader push by Beijing to make its market more competitive and protect consumers and smaller businesses. Authorities are also increasingly concerned about the power and influence of big businesses, particularly in the tech sector, which they believe holds too much market share.
China has vowed to step up its antitrust actions to help level the playing field and eliminate industry monopolies. The latest regulations are aimed at preventing data discrimination and preventing companies from leveraging data to gain an unfair advantage over smaller rivals.
The announcement also heralds a new era of regulation for China's technology sector, which has grown rapidly in recent years and plays a critical role in the country's economy. Concerns about the sector have intensified in recent years, following allegations of data privacy violations and other infractions by some of China's largest tech firms.
China's antitrust campaign has also targeted foreign firms in recent years, including US tech giants Google and Apple, which have been fined for antitrust violations. The campaigns have led to a strained relationship between the country and the United States, which has accused China of stealing American intellectual property.
The selloff on Tuesday also highlighted concerns about the Chinese government's ability to support the country's economic recovery. Although China was the only major economy to grow in 2020, the country's economic recovery has been fragile, with many sectors still struggling to rebound from the pandemic's effects.
Tuesday's slump also refocused attention on the potential risks facing foreign investors in China's notoriously volatile markets. Many investors have been drawn to the country's booming tech sector, which has been a significant driver of growth in recent years.
However, analysts warn that the recent crackdown on tech firms could lead to increased volatility and uncertainty in the markets, particularly for foreign investors who could be subject to unpredictable regulations and market conditions.
At the close of trading on Tuesday, the Shanghai Composite had lost 1.9 percent, while the blue-chip index CSI300 shed 2.4 percent. The Shenzhen Composite shed 3.7 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.4 percent.
