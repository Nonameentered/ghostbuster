Shanghai copper futures are expected to face further decline in early 1997 due to poor fundamentals and stable demand, according to analysts. The global copper market has been struggling for the past few years due to an oversupply of the metal and weak demand, which has resulted in a decline in prices. 
This trend is likely to continue in the coming year, as analysts predict that the market will remain oversupplied due to the continued growth of copper production in China and other major producing countries. Meanwhile, demand is expected to remain stable as the global economy continues to recover slowly from the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to a report by the International Copper Study Group, global copper production is expected to rise by 3.5% in 2021, driven by growth in China, Peru, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. At the same time, demand is expected to increase by only 2.5%, primarily due to growth in the construction and energy sectors.
While the oversupply of copper is expected to continue to put downward pressure on prices, some analysts are optimistic about the long-term outlook for the metal. In the near term, however, they expect prices to remain weak.
"The fundamentals for copper are not particularly strong right now," said one analyst. "There's a lot of supply coming on board, and demand is not growing at the same pace."
The decline in Shanghai copper futures is likely to have an impact on other copper markets around the world. Copper is a widely used metal in the manufacturing of various goods, including construction materials, electrical wiring, and transportation equipment. As such, changes in the copper market can have ripple effects throughout the global economy.
The decline in copper prices may also impact the mining industry, which has already been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many mining companies have been forced to cut production and delay investment plans due to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic and the decline in copper prices.
Despite the challenges facing the copper market, some analysts remain optimistic about the future of the metal. They point to the long-term trends of urbanization and electrification, which are expected to drive demand for copper in the coming decades.
In the meantime, however, the copper market is likely to remain under pressure, with prices expected to remain weak in the early months of 1997.
