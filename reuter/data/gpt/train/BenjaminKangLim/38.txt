China is expected to see a sharp increase in bankruptcies as authorities move to weed out hopeless and indebted firms. Reports suggest that the number of bankruptcies in the country is likely to more than double in the coming years, impacting not only businesses but also policymakers. The surge in bankruptcies could point to a slowdown in China's economy as well.
The move to weed out hopeless and indebted firms is part of a broader effort by China's government to curb the country's excessive debt levels. China's non-performing loan ratio has been inching up for years, reaching 1.94% at the end of 2020. It is the highest level since 2009, as the country grapples with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Economists say that China’s economy is facing a tough challenge, given the mounting pressure from rising debt levels, trade tensions with the U.S, and a slew of other domestic issues. Therefore, they say, the government must take action to tackle these challenges before they escalate into a full-blown crisis.
The potential uptick in China's bankruptcies is in contrast to a recent trend in the country, where policymakers had been relatively lenient with troubled firms, providing them with financial assistance to avoid layoffs and other negative impacts. The move to close loss-making firms is a change of course for China, which has long prioritized making sure all firms had access to credit.
However, economists warn that this shift could be risky as it could lead to an uptick in unemployment and create a ripple effect across the Chinese economy. According to Chinese bankruptcy lawyers, there are over 30 million registered businesses, many of which are small enterprises that account for the bulk of China's employment.
The surge in bankruptcies could also impact China's construction industry, which accounts for about 6% of the country's GDP. The sector has been struggling with a rise in bad loans and a drop in property sales, making many firms vulnerable to bankruptcy.
Despite the risks, the Chinese government is forging ahead with this tough stance, with Vice Premier Liu He making speeches calling for prompt action to deal with insolvent businesses. More recently, domestic banks have stepped up their efforts to deal with bad debt and are working in collaboration with local authorities to ensure that they're lending in compliance with laid down guidelines.
The Chinese government has also been incentivizing banks to lend to small businesses to help cushion the impact of the pandemic. However, the move has proved challenging for many institutions that have been struggling to balance the risk of loose lending protocols against the need to keep businesses afloat.
In recent months, several local governments across China have set up “bad asset banks'' to help small businesses secure financing. These institutions are essentially marketplaces for distressed debt, where businesses can auction off assets to pay off creditors.
Bankruptcies of businesses could still grow exponentially in China, as the government's crackdown on debt and loss-making firms continues in earnest. But as challenging as this new course of action may be, economists say it is what China needs to avoid long-term financial damage, and while the shift may be painful for firms, it could help to strengthen the country's economy in the long run.
In conclusion, China’s decision to crack down on hopelessly indebted businesses could be a tough pill to swallow, but it is one that the country desperately needs. By tackling the country's debt problem and closing down loss-making businesses, the Chinese government may be able to reduce risk in the broader economy and help ensure that firms with the potential to grow and prosper can do so more easily. The implications of this tough line are far-reaching and could have a significant impact on not only the economy of China but also the global economy.
