Johannesburg, South Africa – In a move that marks a significant shift in its foreign policy, South Africa has officially abandoned its diplomatic relations with Taiwan and recognized China instead. This decision, which was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday, has been hailed as a major victory for Beijing, which has been engaged in a diplomatic tug-of-war with Taipei for years.
The decision to switch recognition stems from South Africa's belief that official relations with China will bring enormous economic benefits. China is one of South Africa's top trading partners and investments with the Asian giant are worth billions of dollars. In addition to this, Beijing has promised significant investment in various infrastructure projects such as power plants, railways and ports, which South Africa has been struggling to finance.
According to Ramaphosa, “this decision was not taken lightly and was based on a thorough analysis of our interests. We have always viewed China as a key player in the global arena and believe that this recognition will bring enormous benefits to our country.”
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing "deep regret" over South Africa's decision. The statement urged South Africa to "look at the long-term interests of the two countries" and reconsider its decision to switch diplomatic recognition to China. Taipei states that such recognition will lead to diplomatic uncertainty in the region, fuel tension and complicate international relations on the continent.
The move by South Africa is a blow to Taiwan's diplomatic efforts. With the African nation now joining the growing list of countries that recognize China, Taiwan is left with just 15 diplomatic allies globally, including mostly small and impoverished countries in the Pacific and Central America. Beijing has also repeatedly used its economic clout to lure other nations into switching diplomatic allegiance, often by enticing them with investment, aid, or access to its huge market.
The Chinese government has applauded South Africa's decision, with spokesperson Zhao Lijian saying that “this is a reflection of South Africa's adherence to the one-China principle.” The one-China principle states that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. This is a key position of Beijing, which refuses to recognize independent diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes Taiwan as a sovereign state. Taiwan has been ruled separately from China since 1949 after the end of a civil war between the nationalist forces and the Chinese Communist Party.
The news has not been altogether surprising, given the growing influence of China in Africa. Beijing has invested heavily in several African nations, providing infrastructure projects, loans, and investments for resources such as minerals, and oil. Many African countries, in turn, have recognized China as their most significant trading partner, often switching diplomatic allegiances to secure economic benefits. South Africa is China's biggest trading partner in Africa and has a significant trading deficit with Beijing, which China has promised to address through additional investment.
The decision by South Africa to recognize China and abandon Taiwan marks a significant shift in the country's diplomatic orientation and marks a major victory for Beijing. It has been a long-time goal of Chinese leaders to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and assert greater influence on the world stage. South Africa's decision is also likely to increase tensions between Taiwan and China and could lead to continued diplomatic uncertainty in the region.
