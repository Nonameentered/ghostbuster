Chinese activists have taken to the streets to protest the United States' support for Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
The protesters gathered in front of the U.S. embassy in Beijing, holding banners and chanting slogans denouncing the U.S. for backing Japan's campaign for a permanent seat. They accused the U.S. of supporting Japan's efforts to "rewrite the history of World War II" and of disregarding the feelings of Chinese people.
China has long opposed Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council, arguing that Japan has not shown enough remorse for its wartime aggression and atrocities, including the forced enslavement of Chinese women during World War II.
The U.S., a close ally of Japan, has been supportive of its bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council, arguing that Japan is a major contributor to the UN's peacekeeping operations and a key player in global politics and economics.
The U.S. support for Japan's bid has been a major bone of contention between the two countries and has caused frictions in their bilateral relationship.
The Chinese activists who protested outside the U.S. embassy on Monday accused the U.S. of overlooking Japan's war crimes and of not respecting China's dignity and sovereignty.
One of the protesters, Wang Dong, told reporters that the U.S. was "not qualified to comment on Japan's position in the international community."
"Japan has never shown remorse for its war crimes against Chinese people and has even tried to cover up its atrocities. The U.S. support for Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council is a blatant disregard for the feelings of Chinese people," he said.
Another protester, Li Mei, said that the U.S. should "listen to the voices of Chinese people" and not support Japan's efforts to gain a permanent seat on the Security Council.
"We urge the U.S. to reconsider its position on Japan's bid for a permanent seat. Japan should first acknowledge its war crimes and apologize to the victims before it can be accepted as a responsible member of the international community," she said.
The U.S. embassy in Beijing did not comment on the protests.
Japan has been seeking a permanent seat on the Security Council for many years, arguing that as the world's third-largest economy and a leading democracy, it deserves a place at the table with the five permanent members: the U.S., China, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom.
However, China and other countries in the region have opposed Japan's bid, citing its lack of remorse for its wartime atrocities and its ongoing territorial disputes with neighboring countries.
The U.S. support for Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council has been seen as a key factor in Japan's campaign, as the U.S. holds significant influence over the UN's decision-making process.
The protests outside the U.S. embassy in Beijing are unlikely to alter the U.S. position on Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council, but they do highlight the deep-seated animosity and mistrust between China and Japan, as well as between China and the U.S.
