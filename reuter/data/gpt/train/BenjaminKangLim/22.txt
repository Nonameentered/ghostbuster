In yet another move against dissenting voices, Chinese authorities have placed leading pro-democracy activist Chen Ziming under tight police surveillance after his release on medical parole.
Chen, a prominent dissident known for his vocal opposition to the Chinese Communist Party, was granted medical parole earlier this month after spending nearly three decades in prison for his role in organizing the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.
While many had hoped that Chen's release would mark a positive turning point for China's treatment of political dissidents, it seems that the Chinese government has other plans.
According to sources close to Chen, he has been placed under 24-hour police surveillance since his release, with officers stationed outside his residence and following him wherever he goes.
This is not the first time that Chen has faced persecution for his political views. In the years leading up to his arrest in 1989, Chen was an outspoken advocate for democracy and freedom of speech in China, and had been placed under house arrest several times for his activism.
Following his arrest in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests, Chen was sentenced to 13 years in prison on charges of "counterrevolutionary incitement." His sentence was later extended by another 16 years, making him one of the longest-serving political prisoners in China.
Despite his long imprisonment, Chen remained committed to promoting democracy in China and continued to speak out against the government from behind bars.
In 2019, Chen was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer and was given medical parole. At the time, many saw his release as a sign that China was starting to ease its crackdown on political dissidents.
However, the latest move to place Chen under police surveillance suggests that the Chinese government is not yet ready to embrace dissenting voices like his.
Human rights groups have condemned the surveillance of Chen as a blatant violation of his human rights, and have called on the Chinese government to respect his right to freedom of speech.
"Chen Ziming has already suffered enough for his peaceful activism, and the Chinese authorities should not be punishing him further simply for speaking out," said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch.
"His continued surveillance is a clear violation of his right to privacy and freedom of movement, and sends a chilling message to others who dare to criticize the government."
Despite facing constant surveillance, Chen has remained defiant in his opposition to the Chinese government. In an interview with Voice of America last week, he vowed to continue speaking out for democracy and human rights in China.
"I am not afraid of anything. I am not afraid of the government, I am not afraid of the police, I am not afraid of anything," he said.
"I will continue to fight for democracy and freedom until the end of my life." 
As China's government continues to crack down on dissenting voices, it remains to be seen what the future holds for Chen and others like him who dare to speak out against the status quo.
