Beijing, China - Two sons of Bo Xilai, the former Communist Party boss of Chongqing who was jailed for life in 2013, have been detained in the city of Yan'an on suspicion of "economic crimes," according to the Yan'an Public Security Bureau.
Bo Guagua, 33, and his younger brother Bo Guancong, 29, were taken into custody on Saturday and are being held for "investigation and possible prosecution" in an undisclosed location. The two men had been living in the southwestern province of Yunnan, where they reportedly ran a car dealership and other businesses.
The news of their detention has been met with shock and disbelief in China, where Bo Xilai was once one of the country's most powerful politicians. He was widely seen as a rising star in the Communist Party before his spectacular fall from grace in 2012, when his wife Gu Kalai was found guilty of murdering a British businessman and he was accused of covering up the crime.
Bo Xilai was convicted of corruption, bribery, and abuse of power the following year and sentenced to life in prison. His downfall was one of the biggest political scandals to hit China in decades, and his case was widely seen as a sign of growing corruption and power struggles within the Communist Party.
The news of his sons' detention has reignited speculation about the extent of corruption within the Communist Party. Some analysts have linked the move to the ongoing crackdown on corruption by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has made rooting out graft one of his top priorities.
"Bo Xilai's case was a clear warning to other officials about the dangers of corruption and misconduct," said Zhang Ming, a political scientist at Renmin University in Beijing. "Now his sons have been caught up in the same net. It sends a powerful message that nobody is above the law."
The detention of Bo Guagua, who has been living in the United States since his father's downfall, has also raised questions about his possible extradition to China. Bo, who graduated from Oxford University and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, has been living in self-imposed exile since 2012 and is rumored to have already obtained American citizenship.
The Chinese government has not yet made any official statement on the matter, but some officials have hinted that they may seek his extradition if he is found to have committed "serious economic crimes" in China.
"The Chinese government has a long memory, and they will not let anyone who has violated the country's laws go unpunished," said Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing. "It doesn't matter how famous or powerful they are."
The detention of Bo's sons has also sparked a flurry of commentary and speculation on Chinese social media, with many users expressing shock and disbelief at the news.
"This is a tragedy for the Bo family, and it's a tragedy for China," wrote one user on the microblogging site Weibo. "I hope the government is fair and just in its handling of this case."
Others took a more cynical view, questioning whether the move was part of a broader political crackdown by President Xi.
"In China, everything is political, and nothing is what it seems," wrote one user on WeChat. "The detention of Bo's sons may have more to do with power struggles within the Communist Party than with their alleged crimes."
Whatever the true motivations behind Bo's detention, it is clear that the case will be closely watched by both the Chinese public and the international community. The judicial system in China has long been criticized for its lack of transparency and independence, and many will be eager to see if the government can prove that it is truly committed to rooting out corruption at all levels of society.
