A Tibetan nun named Ngawang Sangdrol's sentence has been doubled from nine years to eighteen after she refused to accept the state-sanctioned choice as the second holiest monk in Tibet. Sangdrol, who has been in prison for over two decades now, is an iconic figure in the ongoing fight for religious freedom in Tibet.
Sangdrol was arrested in 1992 for staging a peaceful pro-Tibet protest in Lhasa, along with a group of other nuns. Following the protest, she was detained and tortured in Chinese prison for protesting against China's communist regime, which incorporated Tibet in 1950.
The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) recently declared that the search for the 15th Dalai Lama, who is regarded as the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, must be approved by the Chinese government. The Dalai Lama, who has been living in exile in India since 1959, disputes Beijing's right to choose his successor.
Sangdrol is one of many Tibetan nuns who have been unjustly imprisoned over the years, as part of China's aggressive and decade-long crackdown on Tibetan sovereignty. The nun's plight highlights the harsh reality facing millions of Tibetans who continue to live under the CCP's oppressive rule.
Sangdrol's family and supporters have been barred from visiting her since she was imprisoned, and the Chinese authorities have denied requests made by the United Nations and other human rights organizations to inspect the situation in Chinese prisons.
Sangdrol's case has been taken up by the International Campaign for Tibet, an organization that has called for her release and that of other political prisoners in Tibet. "The doubling of Ngawang Sangdrol's sentence, handed down merely for her peaceful religious activism, represents a flagrant abuse of power," said Matteo Mecacci, president of the Washington-based campaign.
The rise in extreme sentences like the one handed down to the nun is a matter of concern for all those who support non-violent participants in religions. Sangdrol's case, along with that of other Tibetan nuns who continue to languish behind bars, underscores the urgency of establishing long-term solutions to address the human rights crisis in Tibet.
The Chinese government, however, maintains that it is protecting the rights of Tibetan people and preserving the region's social and economic stability. It remains to be seen whether the CCP will take any steps to address the situation faced by Sangdrol and other political prisoners in Tibet.
As it stands, Sangdrol will continue to serve her sentence in Chinese prison, where she is subjected to inhumane conditions and deprived of her basic human rights. Her case serves as a testament to the adage that the struggle for freedom is ongoing and that the fight to protect human rights is never-ending.
