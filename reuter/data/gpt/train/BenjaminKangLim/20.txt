China has once again urged Taiwan to lift the decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links between the two sides. The Chinese government has stated that the measure will help deepen economic integration and improve ties across the Taiwan Strait.
The ban on direct links between Taiwan and mainland China has been in place since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. At that time, the Communist Party of China forced the Kuomintang government to retreat to Taiwan, and a cold war has existed between the two sides ever since.
In recent years, Taiwan's relationship with the mainland has improved somewhat, but there is still no direct air, sea, or postal links between the two sides. Instead, goods and people must pass through a third location, typically Hong Kong, before reaching their final destination.
According to China's Taiwan Affairs Office, the ban on direct transport links is hurting the economies of both sides and is a significant hindrance to trade between them. By lifting the blockade, the two nations can enhance economic cross-strait exchanges and bring the interests of compatriots on both sides closer together.
"The opening of direct cross-strait links for trade and transport will provide a more convenient and cost-effective way for Taiwan and mainland China to interact and will bring mutual benefits to businesses and people on both sides," said Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office.
Ma Xiaoguang added that the Chinese government has always encouraged and supported cross-strait contacts, and that it welcomes the Taiwanese authorities to respond positively to China's proposal to open up direct trade and transport links.
However, Taiwan has so far refused to comply with China's request for direct transport links. Taiwan's government has been cautious about taking any steps that could be interpreted as conceding to China's demands, as it worries about China's intentions towards it.
The Taiwan Strait is seen as a hotspot for potential military conflict between China and the US. The US has a significant military presence in the region, and tensions between the two sides have increased in recent years due to US support for Taiwan and China's claims to territory in the South China Sea.
"The US has been an active participant in the cross-strait issue, and this has only added to the tension and mistrust between China and Taiwan," said Professor Zhang Fulin at Beijing Normal University.
Zhang Fulin added that, despite this, China remains committed to finding a peaceful solution to the issue with Taiwan and hopes that Taiwan can put aside any doubts and work with China to achieve this goal.
The issue of direct transport links is just one of many that will need to be addressed before cross-strait relations can be normalized. Issues such as Taiwan's sovereignty and China's military ambitions in the region will also need to be resolved for there to be any lasting peace between the two sides.
However, with China urging Taiwan to lift the ban on direct trade and transport links, it seems that there may be some hope for the peaceful resolution of the issue. Only time will tell whether Taiwan's government is willing to take this step and open up direct links between the two sides.
