He emphasized that China is open to dialogue and to working with other countries to resolve disputes.
The Chinese government has been working to improve relations with Taiwan in recent years, as part of a broader strategy to increase economic and political influence in the region. While political tensions between the two nations remain high, there are signs that economic cooperation is continuing to expand, with more Taiwanese businesses investing in China and more Chinese companies doing business in Taiwan.
Overall, the meeting between President Jiang and Taiwanese business leaders was seen as a positive step towards improving cross-strait economic ties. Despite political differences between the two nations, economic cooperation is likely to continue to benefit both sides and play an important role in regional economic growth.
