Washington D.C. - The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is set to visit China in the coming weeks, and human rights groups are urging him to raise the issue of Chinese dissident Wang Dan's 11-year prison sentence. Wang Dan, a student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, has been imprisoned several times for his pro-democracy activism. His most recent imprisonment came in 2016, when he was sentenced to 11 years for subversion.
As Blinken prepares for his trip to China, Wang Dan's appeal against his sentence is set to be considered. The appeal was filed in 2020 and has been pending for over a year. The Chinese government is yet to schedule a hearing, and Wang Dan's lawyers are citing a lack of transparency regarding their client's case.
Human rights groups are calling on Blinken to use his visit to China to highlight Wang Dan's case and urge the Chinese government to release him. They are also urging the U.S. government to apply pressure on China to improve its human rights record.
Wang Dan's imprisonment is emblematic of China's approach to dissent and democracy. The Chinese government has a long history of cracking down on dissident voices, often using vague legal charges to silence critics and activists. Wang Dan's case is one of many where the Chinese government has used subversion charges to imprison individuals for peacefully advocating for democracy.
Wang Dan's family has been vocal in their support for his release. In a statement, his sister Wang Chen said, "My brother has done nothing wrong. He has been punished for his unwavering commitment to democracy and freedom. We urge the Chinese government to release him and allow him to return to his family."
Wang Dan's case has drawn international attention and condemnation. Governments and civil society organizations around the world have called on the Chinese government to release him and other pro-democracy activists. The United States, in particular, has been vocal in its criticism of China's human rights record. The Biden administration has made it clear that human rights will be a key issue in its relationship with China.
As Antony Blinken prepares for his trip to China, he will face the difficult task of balancing diplomatic relations with the need to address human rights abuses. The U.S. government has been criticized in the past for prioritizing diplomatic relations over human rights concerns. It remains to be seen how the Biden administration will approach this issue.
As for Wang Dan, his future remains uncertain. His appeal against his 11-year sentence is yet to be heard, and his family continues to call for his release. His case is a reminder of the ongoing struggle for democracy and human rights in China.
