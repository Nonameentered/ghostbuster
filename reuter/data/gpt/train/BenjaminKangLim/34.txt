Beijing, China - Dissident Wang Dan's appeal against his 11-year prison sentence has been rejected by a court in Beijing. The 51-year-old activist, who is a former leader of the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square, had been hoping for a reduction in his sentence.
Wang was initially charged with "plotting to overthrow the Communist Party of China," a charge he denies. He has been a vocal critic of the Chinese government for many years, and was first arrested in 1989 following the Tiananmen Square protests.
In a statement after the court's decision, Wang expressed disappointment but said he would continue to fight for democracy and human rights. "The court's decision is unjust and unfair," he said. "But I will not give up my beliefs or my fight for democracy and freedom for the Chinese people."
Wang's lawyer, Liang Xiaojun, said the court's decision was expected but still disappointing. "We knew it was going to be difficult to win an appeal in the current political climate," he said. "But we had to try."
Wang's sentence is the latest in a series of harsh sentences handed down to political dissidents in China. The government has been cracking down on dissent in recent years, particularly following the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019.
Wang's case has drawn international attention, with human rights groups calling for his release. Amnesty International has labeled Wang a "prisoner of conscience" and called for his immediate release.
"The Chinese government's treatment of Wang Dan is a clear violation of his human rights," said Patrick Poon, China researcher at Amnesty International. "Wang has been imprisoned simply for peacefully advocating for democracy and human rights, which is a fundamental right."
The government of China has defended the sentence, saying that Wang's actions were a threat to national security. "China is a sovereign state, and we will not tolerate individuals who seek to undermine our political system or our national security," said a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Wang's case is likely to further sour relations between China and the international community. The United States has already imposed sanctions on several Chinese officials over human rights abuses, and other countries are likely to follow suit.
The decision to uphold Wang's sentence has also sparked protests in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy activists have long been challenging the Chinese government's authority. "We stand in solidarity with Wang Dan and all those who are fighting for freedom and democracy in China," said Joshua Wong, a prominent Hong Kong activist.
Despite the rejection of his appeal, Wang Dan remains resolute in his fight for democracy. "I will not be silenced," he said. "The struggle for freedom and democracy in China will continue, no matter how long it takes."
