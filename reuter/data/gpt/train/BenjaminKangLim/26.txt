Taiwanese business leader urges Beijing to resume talks for fear of losing investor confidence
Taiwanese business leader, Terry Gou, has called on Beijing to resume talks with Taipei to avoid damaging investor confidence amid worsening cross-strait relations.
Gou, the founder of Foxconn Technology Group, made the comments during a news conference in Taipei on Tuesday. He warned that the ongoing political tensions between the two sides could have severe consequences for economic relations.
"I urge Beijing to avoid any misunderstandings and to open up channels of communication with Taiwan," Gou said. "The lack of dialogue is worrying investors and affecting the economic relationship between Taiwan and China."
The call for dialogue comes amid growing tensions between China and Taiwan, heightened by Beijing's increasing military posturing in the Taiwan Strait.
The Chinese military has stepped up its activities around the island in recent months, including conducting live-fire drills and sending fighter jets and bombers into Taiwanese airspace.
Taiwan, for its part, has responded with increased military exercises and the purchase of advanced weaponry from the United States.
The situation has alarmed investors in Taiwan, who fear that a military conflict could disrupt key trade and investment flows between the two sides.
Gou, who has extensive business interests in China, warned that the escalating tensions could have serious economic consequences for Taiwanese firms.
"If cross-strait relations continue to deteriorate, Taiwan's businesses will suffer," he said. "Many Taiwanese firms rely on China as a key market and supply chain partner, and any disruption to that relationship would be disastrous."
Gou also cautioned against any attempts by the Taiwanese government to "play politics" with the business relationship with China.
"I think it's important for the government to ensure that Taiwan's businesses can continue to operate smoothly in China," he said. "This is not the time to engage in political posturing or to make inflammatory statements."
The call for dialogue has been echoed by other business leaders in Taiwan, who have urged the government to take a more conciliatory approach towards Beijing.
However, some analysts have raised concerns that Beijing may be using the economic relationship between the two sides as a tool to further its political goals.
"China has a history of using economic leverage to achieve its political objectives," said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It's possible that Beijing could use pressure on Taiwanese businesses as a way to force the Taiwanese government to accept its political demands."
The Taiwanese government has said that it remains committed to peaceful dialogue with Beijing, but has also vowed to defend itself against any military threats.
"We hope that China can recognize the reality of the situation and engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan based on mutual respect and understanding," said Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.
However, with tensions between the two sides continuing to rise, it remains unclear whether both sides will be able to find a way to ease the situation and avoid harming the economic relationship between Taiwan and China.
