In a move to root out corruption, lawlessness and other forms of misconduct among public officials in China, the country's parliament has vowed to intensify supervision of the executive and judiciary branches. The National People's Congress (NPC), the top lawmaking body in China, made the announcement in its annual session, following a series of high-profile cases of corruption and abuse of power.
The NPC's chief justice, Zhou Qiang, told delegates that the judiciary would play a critical role in reducing corruption and ensuring public trust in the legal system. "The key to building a fair and impartial judiciary is to strictly regulate the behavior of judges and to prevent any form of misconduct," he said.
Zhou promised to increase the transparency of court proceedings, standardize the handling of cases, and strengthen judicial accountability. He added that judges who violate the law or ethical standards would be severely punished, and that the country's existing system for disciplining judges would be improved.
Meanwhile, the head of China's anti-corruption watchdog, Xiao Pei, announced that the agency would investigate officials accused of violating moral and ethical standards. Xiao said that corruption was "the biggest threat" to the Communist Party's legitimacy, and that the agency would act swiftly and decisively to root out lawlessness and other forms of corruption.
The Chinese government has been stepping up its efforts to combat corruption and misconduct among public officials in recent years. President Xi Jinping has made the crackdown a major priority of his administration, and has vowed to continue the campaign until all corrupt officials have been brought to justice.
The effort has resulted in the investigations and prosecution of numerous high-profile officials, including former security czar, Zhou Yongkang, and former Chongqing party chief, Bo Xilai. Other top officials, including two former generals and government ministers, have also been targeted in the campaign.
The NPC's announcement comes as China prepares to hold its 19th Communist Party Congress later this year, a gathering that will see major leadership changes and policy decisions. The crackdown on corruption and lawlessness is expected to be a key theme of the meeting, as party leaders seek to bolster their legitimacy and win public support.
Critics of the crackdown have charged that it is politically motivated and has been used as a tool to purge dissidents and rivals. Some have also accused the government of violating due process and using torture to extract confessions. The government has denied the allegations, saying that all investigations are conducted in accordance with the law.
Despite these criticisms, the NPC's announcement is likely to be welcomed by many in China who are fed up with corruption and abuse of power. As government officials are held to a higher standard of accountability, it is hoped that the legal system can begin to win back public trust and offer greater protection to ordinary citizens.
