China's exports have seen a significant rebound in recent times, buoyed by strong demand from foreign markets and government support. The country's foreign trade rose by 7.5 percent year on year in July and totalled 2.93 trillion yuan ($424 billion) for the first seven months of 2019.
Experts in the industry attribute the success to a number of factors including the weakening of the yuan, lower labour costs and the transfer of production from other countries in the wake of trade tensions with the United States. The exports of mechanical and electrical products, the backbone of the country's exports, grew 8.6 percent in July, and totalled 1.24 trillion yuan ($179 billion) in the first seven months of 2019.
"The United States' tariffs on China have pushed more multinational firms, particularly those from Japan and South Korea, to shift their production capacity to China, thereby boosting China's exports," said Zhang Junhua, a professor of economics at Peking University.
However, the growth in exports comes at a time when China is facing sluggish domestic demand due to a drop in consumer spending and lower investment, fuelled by slowing economic growth. The country's GDP growth rate hit a 27-year low of 6.2 percent in the second quarter of 2019.
To shore up the domestic economy, the Chinese government has launched measures including cuts on taxes, fees, and interest rates, as well as increased infrastructure investment and consumption incentives. However, these measures have not yet had the desired effect, with many firms still feeling the impact of the economic slowdown.
Fortunately, experts believe that China's exports are expected to pick up the slack in the near future, helping to offset the slow domestic demand that the country is currently experiencing. Some economists predict that China's export growth rate could increase to 5 percent or more in the second half of 2019, and could continue into 2020.
"Given the current sluggish economic growth in China, exports will undoubtedly remain a major engine of growth for the country's economy, especially in the second half of the year," said Bai Ming, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.
Bai noted that the country's exports could also continue to benefit from the trade tensions between the US and China, as the disputes push more companies to relocate their production facilities to China from other countries.
Looking ahead, China's businesses are expected to continue expanding their overseas operations, particularly in other parts of the world such as Europe and Southeast Asia. Improved transport infrastructure, communication links, and reduced trade barriers make it easier for these firms to penetrate new markets and tap into new business opportunities, further boosting the country's exports.
In conclusion, China's exports are expected to continue their strong performance in the coming years, acting as a critical buffer for the country's economy as domestic demand remains largely subdued. Thanks in part to the ongoing trade tensions with the US, China's exports are poised to help the country weather the current economic slowdown while also boosting growth in the future.
