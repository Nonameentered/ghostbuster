Daewoo Electronics, the South Korean electronics giant has launched a new charm offensive in response to the controversy surrounding its plans to buy Thomson Multimedia.
As previously reported, Daewoo is the leading contender in a race to buy Thomson Multimedia, which is owned by French company Thomson, for a reported $2 billion. However, the proposed acquisition has been met with opposition in France, with some politicians and trade unions expressing concern about potential job losses.
In response, Daewoo has taken to the media, launching a new charm campaign designed to win over the French public and alleviate concerns about its plans.
The campaign, which has been dubbed "Daewoo Loves France," centres around a series of advertisements in French newspapers and on social media, featuring images of Daewoo's products next to famous French landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre museum.
The advertisements also carry messages such as "We are not here to destroy French jobs, but to build a stronger future for everyone," and "We've been making our products in Europe for over 30 years, and we're committed to continuing to do so."
Speaking to reporters, a spokesperson for Daewoo confirmed that the campaign was part of a wider effort to counter the negative perception of the company in France, and to engage with the French public by highlighting the benefits of the proposed acquisition.
"Our goal is to show the French people that we're not a faceless corporation looking to make a quick buck," the spokesperson said. "We're a company with a strong commitment to quality, innovation, and social responsibility. We want to work with the French people to build a brighter future for everyone."
The charm offensive has been praised by some analysts as a smart move by Daewoo, which has historically struggled to build its brand outside of Asia.
"Daewoo's decision to launch a charm campaign in France is a savvy strategy that shows the company is willing to engage with the public and be transparent about its plans," said Laura Hales, a marketing expert at the London School of Economics.
"By showcasing its commitment to quality and innovation, as well as its strong track record of working in Europe, Daewoo is showing that it's a responsible corporate citizen that cares about its employees and the communities it operates in."
However, not everyone is convinced that the charm offensive will be enough to win over the French public. Some politicians and trade unions have continued to voice their opposition to the proposed acquisition, arguing that it could lead to job losses and a decrease in French influence in the global technology industry.
"We're not against foreign investment, but we need to make sure that any acquisition is in the best interests of French workers and our national economy," said Christine Prunaud, a member of the French Senate. "Daewoo has a lot of work to do if it wants to convince us that this deal is a good thing for France."
Despite the opposition, Daewoo remains confident that it can win over the French public and successfully complete the acquisition of Thomson Multimedia.
"We're committed to working with the French government, unions, and workers to ensure that this is a win-win situation for everyone involved," the company spokesperson said. "We believe that by continuing to engage with the French public and showcasing our commitment to quality and innovation, we can overcome any obstacles and build a brighter future for all."
