PARIS — The French Finance Minister defended on Monday the procedure of the planned sale of Thomson SA, a multinational electronics company.
Speaking to reporters, the minister reiterated that the auction process to sell the company has followed a strict and transparent protocol.
“The sale of Thomson SA has been managed in an exemplary manner, with the aim of finding the best buyers for the company and its employees,” said the Finance Minister.
The French government owns a 10.7% stake in Thomson SA and is keen to ensure that the sale of the company is in the best interest of its employees and shareholders.
According to reports, the company has attracted the interest of several buyers including a consortium led by French private equity firm Apax Partners, and Swiss industrial group Temenos.
The French government is also keen to ensure that any buyer is committed to investing in the company’s research and development in France.
Thomson SA, which was once a leading manufacturer of television sets, has struggled in recent years due to competition from Asian rivals.
Last year it reported a net loss of €143m on revenue of €1.16bn.
However, the company has some valuable assets including its intellectual property portfolio which includes patents covering video compression technology used in digital broadcasting.
The sale of the company has also attracted interest from Chinese firms, which the French government is wary of because of concerns about the transfer of technology.
“We are aware of the interest from Chinese firms, but we will be very careful because we believe it is important to protect our strategic assets,” said the Finance Minister.
The French government has been criticized in the past for its interventionist approach to corporate affairs, but the Finance Minister defended its stance.
“We are not against globalization, but we need to ensure that it is fair and that the rules of the game are respected,” he said.
The sale of Thomson SA is seen as a test of the French government’s resolve to maintain its influence in the corporate sector.
The government has been criticized for its interventionist approach to business affairs, including the recent decision to block the proposed merger between two French supermarkets, Carrefour and Casino.
However, the Finance Minister rejected suggestions that the French government is hostile to foreign investors.
“We welcome foreign investors who want to invest in France, but they need to understand that France has its own interests to protect,” he said.
The Finance Minister also dismissed criticism of the government’s handling of the sale process, saying that it is following the established protocol.
“We are following a transparent and rigorous process and we are confident that we will find the best buyer for Thomson SA,” he said.
The sale of Thomson SA is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, with the company set to be divided into several business units. The company’s patents are expected to be sold separately.
