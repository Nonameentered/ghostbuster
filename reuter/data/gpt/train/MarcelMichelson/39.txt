Thomson Multimedia employees are fighting back against the proposed sale of their company to South Korean electronics giant, Daewoo. On Monday, hundreds of employees held a protest outside Thomson's headquarters in Paris, carrying signs and shouting slogans to express their anger and disappointment at the decision to sell the company.
The employees' protest comes after the French government gave its approval for the sale of the iconic electronics brand to Daewoo last week. Many Thomson employees feel that they are being ignored in the decision-making process and fear that the sale to Daewoo could result in job losses and a loss of the company's reputation for quality and innovation.
Thomson Multimedia, which was founded in 1987, is a major supplier of consumer electronics, including televisions, DVD players, and home entertainment systems. The company has struggled financially in recent years due to intense competition from rivals such as Sony and Samsung. The decision to sell the company to Daewoo was seen as a way to inject new life into Thomson and make it more competitive in the global electronics market.
However, employees at Thomson have expressed concerns that a sale to Daewoo could result in a loss of jobs and expertise. Many fear that Daewoo, which has previous experience of acquiring struggling companies and slashing jobs, could take a similar approach with Thomson.
"We're here to say that we don't want to be sold off like pieces of meat," said Christophe Girard, a Thomson employee who attended the protest. "We love our company and we want to see it thrive. We don't want to see it dismantled by a foreign company that doesn't understand our values and traditions."
The protest follows a letter sent by a group of Thomson employees to French President Emmanuel Macron, urging him to intervene in the sale to Daewoo. The employees argued that the sale could result in a loss of jobs and a weakening of France's position in the global electronics market.
Despite the protests, Thomson Multimedia CEO Frederic Rose has defended the decision to sell the company to Daewoo. In a statement issued on Monday, Rose said that the sale was necessary to ensure the long-term success of Thomson and that the company would remain committed to its employees and customers.
"We understand the concerns of our employees, but we believe that a sale to Daewoo is the best way to secure the future of Thomson Multimedia," Rose said. "We will work with our new partners to ensure that the transition goes smoothly and that our employees are treated fairly."
The sale of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. However, it remains to be seen whether the protests by Thomson's employees will have any impact on the outcome of the sale.
