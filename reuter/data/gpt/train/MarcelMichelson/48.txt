Paris, France - French multinational, Rhone-Poulenc, could see a significant boost in its share value, according to leading French broker, Societe Generale. The potential demerger of Rhone-Poulenc's operations into two separate groups - chemicals and pharmaceuticals - could lead to a share value increase of up to 33%.
Rhone-Poulenc, one of France's largest companies, has been considering a split for some time. The company's leadership has been analyzing the benefits and drawbacks of creating separate business entities to manage its diverse operations. Rhone-Poulenc's portfolio includes a range of chemicals and pharmaceutical products and services, which are viewed as complementary but also distinct in scope.
Societe Generale's research suggests that Rhone-Poulenc could be worth up to €60 billion ($70 billion) if demerged. This would represent a significant increase from the company's current valuation, which stands at around €45 billion ($53 billion).
The French broker's analysis indicates that investors would favor a more focused approach to Rhone-Poulenc's operations. A demerger would allow each new business entity to have greater clarity and focus on their respective industries and core competencies. Moreover, a split would enable Rhone-Poulenc to develop more tailored growth strategies, increase profitability, and respond more effectively to market conditions.
Despite the potential benefits, some analysts have raised concerns that a demerger could also lead to challenges for Rhone-Poulenc. Some investors may be hesitant to invest in a company that is no longer as diversified as it was previously. Meanwhile, establishing two separate businesses could prove costly and complex.
As of now, Rhone-Poulenc has not confirmed whether or not it will proceed with a demerger. However, the company has been vocal about the need to evaluate all its options and strategies to ensure long-term growth and stability.
If Rhone-Poulenc does proceed with a split, it would follow in the footsteps of other major companies that have undergone similar restructurings in recent years. In February 2021, IBM announced plans to spin off its managed infrastructure services unit into a new public company to focus on hybrid cloud growth. In addition, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer spun off its animal health division, Zoetis, in 2013.
Rhone-Poulenc's conglomerate structure has been in place since the merger of Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst AG's chemical operations in 1999, which created Aventis. The company was then spun off from Aventis in 2008, and its pharmaceutical operations became Sanofi. Since then, Rhone-Poulenc has continued to expand its product portfolio through acquisitions and investments.
The potential for a demerger has fueled speculation about how Rhone-Poulenc's divisions would be split. According to some industry insiders, the most likely split would be between the company's pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical businesses, given their fundamental differences in operations.
Rhone-Poulenc's chemicals division supplies a range of industries, including agriculture, energy, and materials. Its products include specialty chemicals, industrial enzymes, and crop protection solutions. The pharmaceutical division, on the other hand, develops, manufactures, and markets prescription drugs and vaccines for a wide range of therapeutic areas, from infectious diseases to oncology and rare diseases.
In conclusion, a potential demerger of Rhone-Poulenc into separate chemicals and pharmaceuticals groups could lead to a significant boost in share value, according to leading French broker, Societe Generale. While there are concerns over the costs and complexity of such a move, the potential benefits of a more focused approach to Rhone-Poulenc's operations are likely to attract investors. The company's leadership has yet to confirm whether a demerger will proceed, but it appears they are evaluating all options to ensure long-term growth and stability.
