EDF, the French multinational energy company, has sold its stake in Sydkraft AB, a Swedish energy company, to Statkraft SF, a Norwegian state-owned renewable energy company. The deal marks a significant milestone in EDF's strategic plan to focus on renewable energy and divest from non-core assets.
The transaction was worth €3.3 billion and included EDF's 66.7% stake in Sydkraft AB, which operates four hydroelectric power plants in southern Sweden. Statkraft, which already holds a 33.3% stake in Sydkraft, will now become the sole owner of the company.
EDF's decision to sell its stake in Sydkraft is part of its wider plan to prioritize renewable energy investments and reduce its carbon footprint. The company has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 and is investing heavily in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.
"In line with our strategic plan, we are focusing our investments on the development of renewable energy sources and divesting from non-core assets," said Jean-Bernard Lévy, EDF CEO. "With the sale of our stake in Sydkraft, we are reinforcing our commitment to a low-carbon future and accelerating our transition to renewable energy."
As part of the deal, EDF and Statkraft have also formed a strategic alliance to develop hydroelectric projects in Southeast Asia. The two companies will explore opportunities to develop new hydropower projects in the region and strengthen their presence in the growing Southeast Asian renewable energy market.
Southeast Asia is rapidly emerging as a hotbed for renewable energy investments, with growing demand for energy and a shift away from fossil fuels. Both EDF and Statkraft see significant growth potential in the region and are keen to capitalize on this trend.
"Southeast Asia represents a significant opportunity for renewable energy investments, and we are excited to partner with EDF to explore new hydropower projects in the region," said Christian Rynning-Tønnesen, CEO of Statkraft. "We believe that our joint expertise and experience in the renewable energy sector will enable us to create value for our shareholders while contributing to the growth of the sustainable energy industry in Southeast Asia."
The EDF-Statkraft alliance will focus on developing hydropower projects that are environmentally sustainable and socially responsible. The two companies will work closely with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that their projects have a positive impact on the local economy and environment.
The sale of its stake in Sydkraft and the formation of a strategic alliance with Statkraft represent a major shift in EDF's business strategy. The company is refocusing its investments on renewable energy and divesting from non-core assets, as it seeks to accelerate its transition to a low-carbon future.
With growing demand for renewable energy in Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, EDF and Statkraft are positioning themselves as key players in the global renewable energy industry. As they explore new opportunities to develop hydropower projects in Southeast Asia and beyond, they are likely to become major drivers of growth in the renewable energy sector for years to come.
