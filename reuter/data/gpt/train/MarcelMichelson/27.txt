Daewoo Electronics, the South Korean consumer electronics giant, has defended its controversial deal to buy France's Thomson Multimedia with a pledge of investments. The deal, worth around €1.5 billion, has been criticized by some in France for potentially endangering local jobs and technology.
However, in an interview with the Financial Times, Daewoo Electronics CEO Kim Dong-woo said that the company was committed to investing in France in order to maintain and grow the country's research and development capabilities.
"We are very aware of the concerns of the French government and people about this deal," Kim said. "We want to be a good partner to France and to contribute to its economy. That is why we are pledging to invest in local R&D and manufacturing, and to work with French universities and research institutes."
Daewoo Electronics has promised to invest €600 million in France over the next five years, with a focus on developing new technologies in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, and the Internet of Things. The company has also committed to buying products and services from French suppliers, and to partnering with French companies in joint R&D projects.
"We believe that France has some of the best talent and expertise in the world when it comes to technology and innovation," Kim said. "We want to tap into that talent and expertise, and to help France maintain its position as a global leader in these fields."
The deal between Daewoo Electronics and Thomson Multimedia has been controversial since it was announced in October 2020. Critics have accused Daewoo of seeking to acquire Thomson's patents and technology in order to compete with rivals such as Samsung and LG, rather than to maintain and build on Thomson's existing capabilities.
However, Kim has dismissed these concerns, saying that Daewoo Electronics is committed to keeping Thomson's existing R&D capabilities intact, and to building on them with new investments and collaborations.
"We are not here to strip assets or to take over existing technologies," he said. "We are here to invest in France and to work with local experts to develop new technologies and products that will benefit both France and Daewoo Electronics."
Daewoo Electronics is one of the largest consumer electronics companies in the world, with a presence in over 100 countries. The company's products include televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners.
Thomson Multimedia, on the other hand, has a history dating back to the early 20th century, and was one of the pioneers of television technology. The company has struggled in recent years, however, and has been shedding jobs and divisions in order to stay afloat.
The deal with Daewoo Electronics is seen as a lifeline for Thomson, but has faced opposition from French politicians and labor unions, who fear that it will lead to job losses and a loss of control over key technology.
However, Kim has sought to reassure these groups, saying that Daewoo Electronics will work closely with Thomson's existing employees and stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition.
"We know that this is a big decision for everyone involved," he said. "We are committed to working with Thomson's management, employees, and other stakeholders to ensure that this deal benefits everyone."
