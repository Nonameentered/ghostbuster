Protests and backlash over the planned sale of state-owned Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics have caused a significant drop in Lagardere shares. The French media group, which currently owns a 25% stake in Thomson Multimedia, has been met with opposition from shareholders and employees alike regarding the proposed acquisition.
The planned sale of Thomson Multimedia has been controversial from the start. The French government, which owns a majority stake in Thomson, has long been seeking a buyer for the struggling company. Lagardere became the leading contender for the acquisition earlier this year, but recently announced that it would be selling its stake to Daewoo Electronics instead.
Many Lagardere shareholders were surprised and disappointed by the decision, as they were hopeful that the company would take a more active role in the acquisition. Some believe that Lagardere is simply looking to cash out and move on, rather than invest in the struggling electronics company.
Employees of Thomson Multimedia in France have also expressed concern over the potential acquisition by Daewoo Electronics. They fear that the Korean company will prioritize cost-cutting measures and relocate jobs, instead of investing in the long-term growth of the company.
These concerns have led to a series of protests across France, with workers picketing outside the office of French President Emmanuel Macron and calling for government intervention to prevent the sale. Some politicians have also spoken out against the move, citing national security concerns and the need to protect jobs in France.
The backlash against the proposed sale has had a significant impact on Lagardere shares. The company's stock price has fallen by more than 10% since the announcement, wiping out over €500 million in market value.
Analysts suggest that the drop in Lagardere shares is due in part to the negative sentiment surrounding the acquisition, as well as concerns over the potential financial impact. Many investors are worried that Daewoo Electronics may be overpaying for Thomson Multimedia, which could lead to a significant hit to the Korean company's bottom line.
Despite the protests and backlash, the acquisition by Daewoo Electronics is still set to go ahead. Lagardere has said that it will sell its stake in Thomson Multimedia to the Korean company for €140 million, pending regulatory approval.
The sale represents a significant strategic move for Daewoo Electronics, which is looking to expand its presence in the global electronics market. The company has faced financial difficulties of its own in recent years, and is hoping that the acquisition of Thomson Multimedia will help to boost its profits and secure its future.
For Thomson Multimedia, the future remains uncertain. The company has struggled to compete with other electronics giants in recent years, and it is unclear whether the acquisition by Daewoo Electronics will be enough to turn its fortunes around.
Meanwhile, the protests and backlash over the planned sale highlight the growing concern over the role of foreign companies in the French market. Many are calling for greater protectionism and government intervention to prevent foreign companies from taking over French firms and relocating jobs overseas.
As the debate over the Thomson Multimedia acquisition continues, it remains to be seen what impact it will have on the French and global electronics markets. For now, investors in Lagardere and Daewoo Electronics will be closely watching the developments, hoping for a positive outcome.
