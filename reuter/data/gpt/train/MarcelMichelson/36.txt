Paris, France - Cie Generale des Eaux (CGE) has announced its plans to rival France Telecom by launching a fixed-line network. The news was announced by CGE's CEO, Antoine Frerot, during the company's annual general meeting on Monday. The announcement has sent shockwaves through the telecommunications industry, as CGE is better known for its water and waste management operations.
Frerot stated that CGE plans to invest several billion euros in the project, with the aim of providing an alternative to France Telecom's fixed-line network. "We see a clear opportunity to provide a high-quality service to customers while also bringing much-needed competition to the market," he said. "We believe that this will benefit not only customers but also the broader economy by promoting innovation and creating jobs."
France Telecom currently dominates the fixed-line market in France, with around 13 million subscribers. CGE's entry into the market is likely to shake up the industry, as it will offer customers an alternative choice for their fixed-line needs. The move also highlights the growing trend of companies diversifying their operations to explore new revenue streams.
CGE will start by rolling out the network in several major cities, including Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. Customers can expect to see the first services launched in the next two years. Initially, CGE will focus on providing services to residential customers, with plans to expand to businesses and public sector organizations in the future.
According to Frerot, CGE has the necessary expertise to succeed in the fixed-line market, citing its experience in managing large-scale infrastructure projects as evidence of its capabilities. The company also believes that its existing relationship with local authorities will be an advantage as it navigates the complex regulatory environment.
The announcement has been received positively by industry experts, who see CGE's entry into the market as a much-needed boost of competition. Telecoms analyst, Eric Beaudet, said: "France Telecom has been dominant in the market for a long time, and it's about time that they had some competition. CGE is a well-respected company with a good track record, and I think they have a strong chance of making an impact."
However, there are concerns that CGE's lack of experience in the telecoms sector could make it difficult for the company to compete. "Telecoms is a complex market with a lot of established players," said Beaudet. "CGE will need to innovate and provide a compelling offering if it wants to make a real dent in France Telecom's market share."
The move also comes at a time when France Telecom is facing pressure from the French government to improve its network and services. The government has been critical of the company's performance, particularly in rural areas, where coverage and quality can be poor. The launch of CGE's network is likely to increase the pressure on France Telecom to improve its offering.
Despite the challenges, Frerot is confident that CGE can succeed in the market. "We believe that we have the capabilities and expertise to launch a high-quality fixed-line network that will provide customers with a genuine choice," he said. "We are committed to investing in this project and creating a network that will benefit both customers and the wider economy."
The launch of CGE's fixed-line network is likely to be one of the most significant developments in the French telecoms industry in recent years. The move highlights the importance of innovation and competition in the sector, and the potential for companies from other industries to disrupt established players. Customers can expect to benefit from greater choice and improved services, while the wider economy could see a boost from increased investment and job creation.
