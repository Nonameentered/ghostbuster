French Prime Minister Alain Juppe has called for a public debate on the privatisation plans for Thomson SA. The move comes after several high-profile politicians in France expressed concerns over the proposed sale of the state-owned company.
Thomson SA, which is best known for its electronics and defence products, has been up for sale for several months. The French government, which owns a 33% stake in the company, has been considering several bids from potential buyers.
However, the privatisation plans have come under fire from some French politicians, who argue that selling off one of the country's most important defence contractors to foreign investors could put national security at risk.
In a statement released on Monday, Juppe said that he understood the concerns being raised by some politicians and that he was willing to hear their arguments. "It is important that we have an open and transparent debate about the future of Thomson SA," Juppe said.
The Prime Minister added that he would be convening a panel of experts to study the potential risks and benefits of selling Thomson SA to foreign investors. The panel will include representatives from the French military, industry leaders, and national security experts.
Juppe said that the panel's findings would be used to inform the government's decision on whether to approve the privatisation plans. "We need to make sure that any decision we make on Thomson SA is in the best interests of France and its citizens," Juppe said.
The call for a public debate on the privatisation plans has been welcomed by some of the politicians who have been critical of the proposed sale. Christian Jacob, a lawmaker from the opposition party Les Republicains, said that he was pleased that Juppe was taking the concerns over Thomson SA seriously.
"Thomson SA is a critical part of France's defence infrastructure, and we need to make sure that we are not putting our national security at risk by selling it off to foreign investors," Jacob said. "I am glad that the Prime Minister is listening to our concerns and taking steps to address them."
However, not everyone is convinced that a public debate on the privatisation plans is necessary. Some industry analysts have argued that selling Thomson SA to foreign investors could actually be good for the company and its employees.
"Thomson SA has been struggling financially for years, and a sale to a foreign investor could inject much-needed capital into the company," said Jean-Michel Huet, a partner at the consulting firm BearingPoint. "It could also open up new markets and opportunities for Thomson SA."
The French government has been looking for ways to reduce its stake in Thomson SA for several years. The company has struggled to compete in the global market, and has faced stiff competition from companies in Asia and the United States.
Despite the concerns being raised by some politicians, it appears that the government is determined to proceed with the privatisation plans. The panel of experts appointed by Juppe is expected to report its findings in the coming weeks, and the government is expected to make a final decision on the sale of Thomson SA by the end of the year.
