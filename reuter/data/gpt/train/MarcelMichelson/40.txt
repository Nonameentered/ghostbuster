French pharmaceutical giant Rhone-Poulenc may be considering a demerger, which could potentially boost its share value by a third, according to a leading French broker.
The possible demerger would see Rhone-Poulenc split into two separate companies, with one focused on pharmaceuticals and the other on industrial chemicals.
It is believed that this move could enable each company to focus more closely on its core business, leading to increased efficiency and profitability.
"The potential demerger of Rhone-Poulenc could be a positive move for the company and its shareholders," said French broker Antoine Dubois.
"In separating the pharmaceutical and industrial chemicals divisions, each company could concentrate on its specific strengths, potentially leading to improved profitability and increased shareholder value."
Rhone-Poulenc was founded in 1928 and has grown into one of the world's leading pharmaceutical and chemical companies, with global operations in more than 50 countries.
The company's pharmaceutical division is responsible for producing a range of drugs used in the treatment of various health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes.
Its industrial chemicals division produces a range of products used in sectors such as agriculture, energy, and construction.
Both divisions have seen strong growth in recent years, with the pharmaceutical division continuing to develop new therapies and the industrial chemicals division benefiting from increased demand for its products in emerging markets.
However, some analysts have suggested that the two divisions may be better served by operating as separate entities.
"There may be advantages to each division if they were to operate independently," said Bernard Dupont, an analyst at BNP Paribas.
"The pharmaceutical division could focus more closely on research and development, while the industrial chemicals division could concentrate on expanding its market share and developing new products."
If the demerger were to go ahead, it would mark a major change for Rhone-Poulenc, which has long been known for its integrated business model.
However, the company has faced growing pressure from shareholders to focus on core competencies and drive greater efficiency across its operations.
"Rhone-Poulenc has a strong brand and a strong reputation in both the pharmaceutical and industrial chemicals sectors," said Dubois.
"By creating two separate companies, each division would be better positioned to compete in its respective market and deliver greater value to shareholders."
The news of a possible demerger comes as Rhone-Poulenc continues to pursue growth in emerging markets, where demand for both pharmaceutical and industrial chemicals products is on the rise.
The company has already made a number of strategic acquisitions in markets such as China and Brazil, and is expected to continue expanding its operations in these regions in the coming years.
"The potential demerger of Rhone-Poulenc should be seen as a positive move for the company and its shareholders," said Dubois.
"It would enable each division to operate more efficiently and effectively, and could potentially unlock significant value for investors."
The news of a possible demerger has been welcomed by many investors, with share prices in Rhone-Poulenc rising by more than 10% in early trading.
However, it remains to be seen whether the company will ultimately go ahead with the plan, and analysts have warned that there may be some challenges involved in the separation of the two divisions.
"There are certainly some risks associated with the demerger," said Dupont.
"But overall, we believe that the potential benefits are significant, and we are cautiously optimistic about Rhone-Poulenc's future prospects."
