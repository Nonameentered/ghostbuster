The French government has announced that it will consult on interconnection costs for the telecommunications sector ahead of the planned share market entry of France Telecom. This move aims to ensure fair competition in the industry and prevent exploitation by dominant companies.
The proposed consultation was welcomed by industry insiders and consumer groups, who have long been concerned about the high interconnection fees charged by dominant players such as Orange, which is a subsidiary of France Telecom. Interconnection fees are charged by telecoms companies to connect calls and messages between different networks.
The issue of interconnection costs has become increasingly important in recent years, as more and more people rely on mobile phones and other electronic devices to stay connected. In particular, the rise of smartphone use has led to a surge in data usage, which in turn has placed huge demands on the mobile networks.
Critics argue that the current system allows dominant companies to charge excessive fees for interconnection, which in turn drives up the cost of mobile plans for consumers. They say that this is unfair, particularly since smaller operators are often unable to negotiate lower rates.
The proposed consultation will seek to address this issue by examining the factors that contribute to interconnection costs, such as the cost of infrastructure and technology. It will also consider ways to promote competition in the sector, such as encouraging the development of new technologies and infrastructure.
The consultation is likely to be a lengthy process, with the government aiming to complete it before France Telecom's share market entry in late 2021. However, industry insiders say that the move is a positive step in the right direction, and will hopefully lead to a fairer and more competitive market for telecoms services.
France Telecom's share market entry is also expected to have a significant impact on the telecoms industry, both in France and beyond. The company, which has a presence in over 30 countries, is valued at over $40 billion and is one of the largest telecoms providers in Europe.
The planned entry has been met with some controversy, however, with critics arguing that it will give France Telecom an unfair advantage over its competitors. They point to the company's strong position in the French market, where it is already the dominant player, and say that it will be difficult for smaller operators to compete with its financial resources.
Despite these concerns, France Telecom's share market entry is expected to be a major event in the telecoms industry, and will likely have far-reaching implications for consumers and companies alike. In the meantime, the proposed consultation on interconnection costs is likely to be closely watched by all parties, as it could fundamentally change the way the industry operates.
