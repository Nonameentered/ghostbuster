In a recent statement, French Industry Minister, Eric Besson, asserted his country's right to control the majority of the proposed Anglo-French nuclear merger. The merger, which involves the combination of both British and French nuclear expertise, is expected to create a global leader in the nuclear industry. However, Besson has made it clear that France will not give up control of the new company without a fight.
Besson was responding to reports in the British press which suggested that the British government was pushing for equal control of the new company. Speaking to reporters, Besson argued that France had a long history in the nuclear industry and had invested heavily in its development. He insisted that the new company would be based in France and that the French government would retain the right to make key decisions.
"This is a merger between two companies - but it is much more than that. It is about combining the expertise of two nations to create a global leader in the nuclear industry. France has always been at the forefront of this field, investing billions of euros and developing the technology. We will not allow another country to take control of what we have built."
Besson's comments are likely to create tension between the two countries, which have a history of disagreements over the issue of nuclear power. The French government has long been a proponent of nuclear power, and France is one of the world's largest producers of nuclear energy. In contrast, the British government has been hesitant to embrace nuclear power in recent years, although it has recently signaled a shift in policy.
The proposed merger involves the combination of two major energy companies: France's EDF and the UK's Centrica. The new company is expected to have a combined value of more than Â£30bn and will control a significant portion of the global nuclear industry. Both companies have stated that the merger would create "a strong and efficient nuclear partner, which will support the growth of both nuclear fleets."
Despite the potential benefits of the merger, there are concerns about the impact it could have on jobs and the wider economy. The nuclear industry is a major employer in both countries, and there are fears that the merger could lead to job losses. Additionally, there are concerns that the new company could become too powerful, leading to increased prices and reduced competition in the market.
Besson sought to address these concerns in his statement, arguing that the French government would ensure that the merger would have a positive impact on jobs and the wider economy. He also stressed that France would work closely with the British government to ensure that the new company did not become too powerful.
"We understand that there are concerns about the impact of this merger on jobs and the wider economy. We want to assure both the French and British people that we will work together to ensure that this merger is a success. We will also ensure that the new company does not become too dominant, and that prices are kept fair for consumers."
The proposed Anglo-French nuclear merger is a major development in the global nuclear industry. However, with both countries vying for control, it remains to be seen how the merger will pan out. What is clear is that the French government will not give up control of its nuclear assets without a fight, and that the merger will have significant implications for both countries.
