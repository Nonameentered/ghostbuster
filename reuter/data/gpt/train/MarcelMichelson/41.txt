French technology company Jet Multimedia is set to take on giants Netscape and Microsoft with its new browser France Explorer, which aims to become the French standard for web browsing.
With the backing of French President Jacques Chirac, Jet Multimedia CEO Christian Guillemot announced the launch of France Explorer on Monday, 2nd of August 1999 at a press conference in Paris.
Guillemot expressed his optimism during the conference, stating that France Explorer was not just a browser but a movement aimed at preserving French culture. He also highlighted France Explorer's unique features, such as integrated search functionality in French, built-in news updates from French media outlets, and the ability to easily access French government websites.
"We are not just launching a browser but a revolution in French technology and culture," Guillemot said.
He also emphasized the browser's relevance in a globalized world, stating that France Explorer's focus on French language and culture would generate interest among French-speaking individuals worldwide.
France Explorer has been in development for several years, with Jet Multimedia investing heavily in research and development to ensure that it is up to par with competitors such as Netscape and Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
Jet Multimedia hopes that their browser becomes the preferred choice among the French user base and aims to reach at least half of France's internet users by the end of the year. This will be facilitated by partnerships with France's leading internet service providers, giving France Explorer preferential treatment and access to their customers.
The French government's support of France Explorer is crucial to its success, with President Chirac keen on promoting French technology and culture in an increasingly globalized world. Chirac highlighted the need for France to have a stake in the internet industry, citing France's past contributions to technological innovation.
"France has always been at the forefront of technological innovation, and we will continue to do so in the internet industry. We need to ensure that we have a say in the future of the internet," Chirac said at the press conference.
Despite its ambition to become the French standard for web browsing, France Explorer faces challenges from established players such as Netscape and Microsoft, who dominate the browser market worldwide. It remains to be seen whether France Explorer can gain significant market share against these giants.
However, with Jet Multimedia's extensive investment in development and partnerships with internet service providers, along with the French government's support, France Explorer may have the potential to become a serious contender in the browser market.
In conclusion, the launch of France Explorer marks a significant milestone in French technology and culture. It remains to be seen whether Jet Multimedia's ambitious goals can be achieved, but the browser's unique features and focus on French language and culture may generate interest among French-speaking individuals worldwide. The French government's support is crucial to its success, and it will be interesting to see how France Explorer fares against established players Netscape and Microsoft.
