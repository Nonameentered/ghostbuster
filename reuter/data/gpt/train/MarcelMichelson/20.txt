Rhone-Poulenc SA, a leading global pharmaceutical and chemical company, has announced better than expected third quarter profits despite the impact of a product recall.
The French multinational, which reported its earnings on Monday, revealed that its third-quarter profits had beaten market expectations, with revenues of €5.4 billion ($6.3 billion).
This success comes after the company conducted a product recall in early September due to the discovery of an impurity in one of its key products, which led to a temporary halt in production.
The recall affected its heartburn medication Zantac, which is sold over-the-counter and by prescription, and is available in many countries around the world.
The recall was initiated after regulators in several countries, including the US, found traces of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) – a potentially cancer-causing chemical – in the active ingredient in the drug.
Rhone-Poulenc SA has since said that it has taken appropriate measures to address the issue, including withdrawing the product from the market, investigating the cause of the impurity, and implementing measures to prevent it from happening again.
Despite the challenges posed by the recall, the company still managed to report a 12% increase in sales for the third quarter, driven by strong demand for its vaccines and oncology drugs. The company's pharmaceuticals division saw sales rise by 8.4% to €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion), while its specialty care division recorded a sales growth of 17.1% to €1.6 billion ($1.9 billion).
The strong results were also attributed to the company's expansion into emerging markets, particularly China, where sales grew by 14.4% in the third quarter.
In a statement, Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, the Chief Executive Officer of Rhone-Poulenc SA, said: "Our better-than-expected results in the third quarter demonstrate the resilience of our business, despite the challenges posed by the temporary suspension of production of Zantac."
"We remain committed to our strategy of investing in innovative products and expanding our presence in emerging markets, which continue to offer significant growth opportunities," he added.
The company's shares rose 2.8% following the announcement, reflecting investors' optimism about the company's future prospects.
Rhone-Poulenc SA is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical and chemical companies, with operations in more than 100 countries. Its products include prescription drugs, vaccines, industrial chemicals, and consumer healthcare products.
The company was formed in 1999 through the merger of two French companies, Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst AG, and is now part of the Sanofi Group, a global pharmaceutical company.
Despite the challenges posed by the product recall, Rhone-Poulenc SA's strong third-quarter results are a positive sign for the company's future, and demonstrate its ability to overcome adversity and maintain its position as a leading player in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry.
