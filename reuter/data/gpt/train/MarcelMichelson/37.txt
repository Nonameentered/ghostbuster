Cie Generale des Eaux, a French water supply and waste management company, has announced a bold move to challenge France Telecom in the fixed telephone network industry. The company is planning to launch a new fixed telephone network that will offer customers an alternative to France Telecom, which has a near-monopoly in France.
This new project is part of Cie Generale des Eaux's broader strategy to diversify its business portfolio. The company, which owns over 400 subsidiaries worldwide, has been expanding its reach into new markets, including energy and telecommunications.
The new fixed telephone network will leverage Cie Generale des Eaux's existing infrastructure and expertise in installation and maintenance services. The company will focus on providing high-speed internet, television, and telephone services to customers in 24 French cities by 2020.
The move comes as France Telecom faces increasing criticism over its pricing and customer service. Many customers have complained about expensive tariffs, slow internet speeds, and technical issues that take days to resolve.
Cie Generale des Eaux aims to address these concerns with its new telephone network, promising competitive pricing, faster internet speeds, and superior customer support. The company also plans to roll out new technologies like fiber-optic cables and 5G wireless networks to further enhance its services.
The launch of the new network will be a significant challenge for Cie Generale des Eaux, as France Telecom has dominated the fixed telephone market for decades. The company holds a virtual monopoly on landline infrastructure and services, which has made it challenging for other companies to enter the market.
However, Cie Generale des Eaux is not alone in its efforts to challenge France Telecom. Other companies, including SFR and Bouygues Telecom, have also started to invest in their own fixed telephone networks, aiming to challenge the dominance of France Telecom.
Observers believe that these new competitors will pose a significant threat to France Telecom's market share, as customers are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with its services.
The launch of the new network is also likely to have benefits for customers, as they will have access to more competitive pricing and a wider range of services. This competition is expected to drive innovation and expansion in the telecommunications industry.
The move by Cie Generale des Eaux also aligns with the French government's push for more competition in the telecommunications industry. French authorities have been working to increase the number of companies operating in the fixed telephone market, to promote growth, and improve the quality of services.
The government has also announced plans to award licenses to new companies that are interested in entering the market. The licenses will give these companies access to the existing infrastructure, making it easier for them to compete with France Telecom.
The launch of the new network by Cie Generale des Eaux is likely to benefit from these initiatives, as the government will be keen to support new entrants to the market.
In conclusion, the launch of the new fixed telephone network by Cie Generale des Eaux is a significant development in the telecommunications industry in France. The company's move to challenge France Telecom's dominance in the market comes at a time when customers are increasingly dissatisfied with the services of the existing provider. The launch of the new network could drive competition and innovation in the sector, leading to better pricing and services for customers. The French government's push for more competition in the telecommunications sector is also likely to support new entrants like Cie Generale des Eaux. Overall, this is a positive development for customers and the industry as a whole.
