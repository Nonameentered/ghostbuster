Tung Chee-hwa appointed as Hong Kong's first Chinese leader
Hong Kong has chosen its first Chinese leader. Tung Chee-hwa, a successful businessman and member of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), was appointed to lead the territory following a vote by the city's Basic Law Committee.
In his new role as Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa will be the first leader of Hong Kong to have been born and raised in the city. He will also be tasked with leading a region that has undergone significant changes since it was handed over to China in 1997.
Tung Chee-hwa's appointment comes at a critical time for Hong Kong. The region has been rocked by months of social unrest, protests and violent clashes between police and protesters. The protests, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have highlighted the deep divisions between Hong Kong's pro-democracy and pro-Beijing camps, and the city's longstanding struggle to maintain its autonomy and freedom.
Speaking to reporters after his appointment, Tung Chee-hwa acknowledged the difficult challenges facing Hong Kong, but said he was confident that the city could weather the storm.
"I understand and respect the concerns and aspirations of the people of Hong Kong," he said. "I will do my best to listen to the voices of all sectors of society and work hard to rebuild trust and confidence in our government."
Tung Chee-hwa also emphasized that he would prioritize Hong Kong's economic development, particularly in the areas of technology and innovation. He noted that Hong Kong remained one of the world's most dynamic and competitive economies, and said he was keen to ensure that the city continued to thrive.
"My administration will focus on promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, fostering talent, and enhancing the competitiveness of our industries," he said.
Tung Chee-hwa's appointment was met with mixed reactions in Hong Kong. Some pro-Beijing politicians welcomed his selection, saying that he was a capable and experienced leader who could help restore stability to the region. Others, however, criticized Tung Chee-hwa as a figurehead who would be beholden to Beijing, and accused him of not doing enough to promote democracy and protect the city's freedoms.
Martin Lee, a prominent pro-democracy activist and former member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, said that Tung Chee-hwa had a "duty" to uphold the city's autonomy and ensure that Beijing did not interfere in its affairs.
"He needs to be a strong and independent leader who can protect Hong Kong's interests, even if it means sometimes standing up to Beijing," Lee said.
Tung Chee-hwa was born in Hong Kong in 1937, the son of a shipping magnate. He graduated from the University of Liverpool with a degree in civil engineering, and later obtained an MBA from Harvard University.
He rose to prominence in the business world as the head of Orient Overseas Container Line, a shipping company founded by his father. From there, he went on to become a leading figure in Hong Kong's financial and political circles, serving as a member of the city's Executive Council and Legislative Council, and later as Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
He was appointed as Hong Kong's first Chief Executive by Beijing in 1997, following the handover of the territory from Britain to China. During his tenure, he oversaw the economic development of Hong Kong, but was criticized by some for being out of touch with the city's ordinary citizens and for failing to address social and political problems.
Despite these criticisms, Tung Chee-hwa remains a respected figure in Hong Kong. He is known for his philanthropy and has been a major supporter of various charitable causes. He has also been credited with helping to improve relations between Hong Kong and mainland China, and with laying the groundwork for the city's current status as a major financial and commercial hub.
As Hong Kong's new Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa will face numerous challenges, both political and economic. He will need to find a way to address the city's deep social divisions and restore trust in its government, while also navigating the complexities of China's relationship with Hong Kong. It will be a difficult task, but one that Tung Chee-hwa is well positioned to tackle.
