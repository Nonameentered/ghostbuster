As China's grip on Hong Kong tightens, the UK has found itself unable to protect holders of British passports living in the former British colony. 
The British government has long maintained that it has a "moral and historical" responsibility to the people of Hong Kong. Following the handover of the territory to China in 1997, the UK established a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers with British National (Overseas) passports, which allowed them to live and work in the UK for up to six months at a time. But with the recent crackdowns by the Chinese government on pro-democracy activists and the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy, many fear that the UK's commitment to the people of Hong Kong is nothing more than empty rhetoric.
The situation has come to a head in recent months, as the Chinese government has cracked down on pro-democracy protests and passed a sweeping national security law that criminalizes dissent and makes it easier for the authorities to arrest and detain activists and journalists. The UK government has condemned these moves, but has been unable to offer any concrete support to Hong Kongers who fear for their safety and their future.
Many have called on the UK to offer greater protection to Hong Kongers with British passports, such as by offering them permanent residency or citizenship, but the government has been reluctant to do so. Some argue that the UK is hamstrung by its diplomatic relationship with China, which has become increasingly important to the UK as it prepares to leave the EU and seeks to forge new trading partnerships. Others suggest that the UK simply lacks the resources and infrastructure to support a large influx of Hong Kongers.
Whatever the reason, the UK's inaction has left Hong Kongers with British passports feeling betrayed and abandoned. Many are considering leaving Hong Kong altogether and moving to countries that offer greater protection, such as Canada or Australia. Others are staying put, but live in fear of being arrested by the authorities or having their passports invalidated.
The situation is particularly dire for young people in Hong Kong, who face a future in which their freedoms and opportunities are severely curtailed. Many are considering emigrating to escape the new restrictions, but face obstacles such as high costs and language barriers. 
The UK government must do more to support Hong Kongers with British passports and to hold the Chinese government accountable for its actions. This could include imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who are involved in human rights abuses in Hong Kong, speaking out more forcefully against the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy, and offering greater support to Hong Kongers who wish to emigrate. 
If the UK does not take action soon, it risks becoming complicit in the Chinese government's abuses and betraying the people of Hong Kong who look to Britain for support and solidarity. The UK must stand up for what is right and ensure that Hong Kongers with British passports are not left to fend for themselves in a hostile and increasingly dangerous environment.
