Hong Kong's new leader and "iron lady" Carrie Lam may form a "dream team" for its handover to China, according to political analysts.
Lam, a former civil servant, was elected as Hong Kong's chief executive in March 2017. She is widely regarded as a powerful and experienced politician who is capable of handling Hong Kong's complex political and economic issues.
Lam's appointment comes at a crucial time for Hong Kong, as it prepares for the 20th anniversary of its handover to China on July 1, 2017. The handover marks the end of British colonial rule in Hong Kong and the start of Chinese sovereignty.
Many analysts believe that Lam's experience and leadership skills will be essential in navigating Hong Kong's relationship with China, which has become increasingly complex in recent years.
Lam has already demonstrated her ability to work with China, having served as Hong Kong's chief secretary under outgoing chief executive Leung Chun-ying. During her time in office, Lam was responsible for implementing a controversial political reform package, which was eventually rejected by pro-democracy lawmakers.
Despite this setback, Lam remains popular among Hong Kong's elite, who see her as a pragmatic and effective leader. In fact, some political analysts believe that Lam's appointment may signal a shift towards a more conciliatory approach towards Beijing.
"Carrie Lam is a seasoned politician who has the trust and respect of Beijing," said Francis Lun, a Hong Kong-based political analyst. "She is the right person to lead Hong Kong during this critical time, when its relationship with China is under such intense scrutiny."
Lam's appointment has also been praised by Chinese officials, who have said that they look forward to working with her on a wide range of issues.
"We believe that Carrie Lam has the necessary skills and experience to lead Hong Kong during this important period of transition," said Han Chunyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry.
While Lam's appointment has been welcomed by many in Hong Kong, there remains concern among pro-democracy activists that she may not be willing to stand up to Beijing on issues such as political reform and human rights.
"Lam has always been seen as somebody who is willing to toe the party line," said Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist. "We are concerned that she will not be willing to fight for Hong Kong's democratic rights and freedoms."
Despite these concerns, many political analysts believe that Lam's appointment may signal a new era of cooperation between Hong Kong and China.
"This is a critical moment for Hong Kong, and it is essential that the new chief executive is able to work effectively with Beijing," said Jonathan Fenby, chairman of the China Research Centre. "Lam's appointment sends a strong signal that Hong Kong is committed to working closely with China in the years ahead."
As Hong Kong prepares to mark the 20th anniversary of its handover to China, all eyes will be on Carrie Lam and her ability to navigate the complex political landscape of the city. Whether she is able to build a strong and effective relationship with Beijing remains to be seen, but many of her supporters believe that she has the skills and experience necessary to lead Hong Kong through this challenging time.
