Hong Kong shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa is considered the best man to deal with China in the upcoming transition due to his close ties with Beijing, according to experts in the field.
Tung Chee-hwa, 83, is a former chief executive of Hong Kong and one of China’s most prominent pro-Beijing figures. He is currently serving as the vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which advises the Chinese government on policy matters.
“Mr. Tung has extensive experience dealing with China and is well-respected by the Chinese leadership. He is the most suitable candidate to represent Hong Kong in the upcoming transition,” said a Hong Kong political analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
China is preparing for a leadership change as President Xi Jinping’s second term is set to end in 2022. The succession process is expected to be closely watched both in China and around the world, as Xi has consolidated his power over the past decade and is widely seen as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.
Hong Kong, a former British colony that retains a high degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework, is likely to play a key role in the transition as one of the few regions in China that enjoys a degree of democracy and political freedom.
Tung’s close ties to Beijing are seen as an advantage for Hong Kong, which has been struggling with political unrest and a struggling economy in recent years. Tung is seen as a conciliatory figure who may be able to bridge the gap between Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and Beijing’s hardline stance on political reform.
“Mr. Tung’s experience and his status as a pro-Beijing figure make him ideally suited to communication with the mainland leadership,” said a spokesman for the Hong Kong government.
Tung Chee-hwa’s career began in 1969, when he founded Orient Overseas International Limited (OOIL), a shipping company that grew to become one of the largest in the world. He served as CEO of OOIL from 1979 to 1999, during which time the company expanded into Europe and the United States.
After the transfer of sovereignty from the UK to China in 1997, Tung was appointed as the first chief executive of Hong Kong, a position he held until 2005. During his tenure, Hong Kong saw the start of an economic decline that has continued to the present day.
Tung is also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory body to China’s parliament known as the National People’s Congress.
“Mr. Tung has played a leading role in promoting patriotic education and national unity in Hong Kong. His appointment as vice chairman of the CPPCC reflects the central government’s recognition of his contributions,” said Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.
Tung is widely seen as a key player in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a flagship project to extend China’s economic and political influence across Asia, Europe, and Africa. He has been involved in many of the initiative’s major projects, including the construction of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
Critics of Tung’s leadership argue that his close ties to Beijing have come at the expense of Hong Kong’s autonomy and democratic institutions. His tenure as chief executive was marked by protests and unrest over his handling of political reform, and his reputation was further damaged by his delayed response to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003.
Despite these criticisms, Tung remains a respected figure in Hong Kong’s business community and has been praised for his efforts to promote economic cooperation between China and Hong Kong. His appointment as the best man to deal with China in the upcoming transition is seen as a recognition of his long-standing contributions to Hong Kong and his role as a bridge between the two governments.
