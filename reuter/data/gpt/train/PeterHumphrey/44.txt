Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten has come out strongly against Beijing's recent proposal for a "rubber stamp" legislative body, calling it a "threat to democracy".
In an interview with a local newspaper, Patten spoke out against the proposed changes to the Hong Kong electoral system, which would give Beijing more control over the process of selecting lawmakers in the city.
"Under this new system, the Hong Kong legislature would be nothing more than a rubber stamp for Beijing," Patten said. "This is a clear and present threat to democracy, and it must be stopped."
Patten, who served as the last British governor of Hong Kong before the territory was handed over to China in 1997, has long been a vocal advocate for democratic reform in the city.
He has criticized Beijing's increasing interference in Hong Kong's political affairs, including the recent disqualification of several pro-democracy legislators and the imposition of a national security law last year.
"The Chinese government is systematically eroding Hong Kong's autonomy and suppressing its people's basic freedoms," Patten said. "This cannot be allowed to continue."
Under the proposed changes, a new committee dominated by pro-Beijing figures would be responsible for selecting a majority of the lawmakers in the Hong Kong legislature.
Critics say this would effectively eliminate any meaningful opposition to the Chinese Communist Party's rule in the city.
The proposal has been widely condemned by pro-democracy activists and the international community, with many calling for Beijing to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and uphold the "One Country, Two Systems" principle that was supposed to govern the city after the handover.
Patten called on the British government and other democratic countries to speak out against the proposed changes and support the people of Hong Kong in their struggle for freedom and democracy.
"We cannot allow China to undermine the rule of law and human rights in Hong Kong without consequences," he said. "We must stand up for the values that we hold dear and defend those who are fighting for their rights and freedoms."
