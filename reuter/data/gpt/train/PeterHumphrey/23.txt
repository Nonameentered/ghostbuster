China and Britain have opened talks ahead of the appointment of the next post-colonial governor of Hong Kong. The talks come as China is stepping up its control over the city, and Britain is grappling with the fallout from Brexit.
Hong Kong was returned to China by Britain in 1997, under a "one country, two systems" agreement that was meant to safeguard the city's freedoms and autonomy. But in recent years China has been increasingly assertive in its dealings with Hong Kong, leading to a series of protests and clashes.
The current governor of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, is widely seen as a Beijing loyalist, and has been criticized for her handling of the pro-democracy protests that swept the city in 2019.
The appointment of the next governor is seen as a key test of China's commitment to the "one country, two systems" agreement, and a potential flashpoint in the ongoing tensions between Beijing and the West.
In a statement, the British government said the talks were "an important opportunity to ensure that Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms are protected in line with the Basic Law", the city's mini-constitution.
The talks are being held against a backdrop of growing global concern about China's human rights record and its treatment of minority groups, including Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province.
Britain has been a vocal critic of China on these issues, and the talks are likely to touch on them as well as on Hong Kong's future.
The talks come as the two countries look to deepen their economic ties, with London eyeing post-Brexit trade agreements with China and Asia. China, meanwhile, is seeking to boost its global influence and offset the damage to its reputation caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The appointment of the governor of Hong Kong is a sensitive issue for both Beijing and London. China has been tightening its grip on the city since the protests of 2019, and fears any further escalation could lead to a wider crackdown.
For Britain, the appointment is seen as a test of its influence in the region as it seeks to forge closer ties with Asian nations following its departure from the European Union.
The two sides are likely to discuss a wide range of issues, including human rights, democracy, trade, and regional stability. The talks will be closely watched by governments and commentators around the world as they seek to gauge the direction of China's policy in Hong Kong and beyond.
Some commentators have expressed skepticism that the talks will lead to any meaningful progress, given the stark differences between the two sides on issues such as human rights and democracy.
Others are more hopeful, pointing to recent indicators that China may be willing to engage in dialogue on these issues in order to bolster its international standing.
Whatever happens, the appointment of Hong Kong's next governor is sure to be watched closely by the global community. As tensions between China and the West continue to rise, the fate of the city's autonomy and freedoms will be seen as a bellwether for the future of the international order.
