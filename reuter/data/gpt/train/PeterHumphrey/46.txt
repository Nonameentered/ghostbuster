In a move that could fundamentally alter the relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China, Chinese authorities have established a new lawmaking body that will have jurisdiction over the territory. The move has sparked outrage among pro-democracy activists and some Western governments, with Britain challenging the legality of the move in the International Court of Justice.
The new lawmaking body, known as the Hong Kong National Security Committee, was established by the Chinese government on July 1st, exactly one year after the introduction of the controversial national security law in Hong Kong. The committee is headed by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, and is responsible for enacting legislation related to national security offenses.
The move was widely criticized by pro-democracy activists and human rights groups, who fear that the new lawmaking body will be used to suppress dissent and curtail civil liberties in Hong Kong. Critics argue that the move is a clear violation of Hong Kong's Basic Law, which guarantees the territory a high degree of autonomy and the right to make and implement its own laws.
The British government has also expressed its concern about the new lawmaking body, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab calling the move a "clear breach" of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which established Hong Kong's autonomy when the British handed over the territory to China in 1997. The British government has called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation in Hong Kong.
In response to the British government's challenge, the Chinese government has defended the establishment of the new lawmaking body, arguing that it is necessary to maintain national security in Hong Kong. China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, accused the British government of interfering in China's internal affairs and urged it to stop its "mistaken words and deeds".
There is growing concern among Western governments about China's increasingly assertive posture in Hong Kong. The national security law, introduced last year, criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, and has been used to arrest and imprison pro-democracy activists and journalists. The law has also been criticized for its vague and sweeping definitions, which critics say could be used to silence dissent and suppress free speech.
The Chinese government's decision to establish the Hong Kong National Security Committee is seen by many as a further step in its efforts to tighten its grip on Hong Kong and erode the territory's autonomy. The move comes just days after several Hong Kong pro-democracy activists were sentenced to between 6 and 10 years in prison for their role in organizing and participating in anti-government protests in 2019.
Pro-democracy activists and human rights groups have called on the international community to take action to protect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. They argue that the Chinese government's actions in Hong Kong are a clear violation of international law and that the international community has a duty to uphold the rights and freedoms guaranteed to the people of Hong Kong under the Basic Law.
The situation in Hong Kong is likely to remain tense in the coming weeks and months, with pro-democracy activists and human rights groups continuing to call for action to protect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. The British government's challenge to the legality of the Hong Kong National Security Committee in the International Court of Justice is likely to further escalate tensions between China and Western governments. It remains to be seen how the Chinese government will respond to the challenge, and whether it will take further steps to assert its authority in Hong Kong.
