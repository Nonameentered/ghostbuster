The selection committee for Hong Kong's next chief executive was rocked on Tuesday as candidate Tung Chee-hwa broke ranks to speak out against the proposed new subversion law.
Tung, who served as the city's chief executive from 1997 to 2005, stated that the proposed law would infringe on the rights of Hong Kong residents and damage the city's reputation as a free and open society.
"We must be careful not to infringe on the rights of Hong Kong residents," Tung said during his vetting for the committee. "We must protect our freedoms and our open society. We must not damage the reputation of Hong Kong as a place where people can speak their minds and express their opinions freely."
The proposed subversion law has been a contentious issue in Hong Kong for several months, with pro-democracy activists and human rights groups warning that it would be used to silence dissent and curtail civil liberties. The law would criminalize any acts that are deemed to be subversive, secessionist, or seditious, with penalties including fines, imprisonment, and even expulsion from Hong Kong.
Many in the pro-Beijing camp have argued that the law is necessary to maintain social stability and protect China's sovereignty. However, Tung's remarks are likely to fuel concerns that introducing the law would further erode Hong Kong's autonomy and undermine the "one country, two systems" framework that has governed the city since its return to Chinese rule in 1997.
Tung's comments came as a surprise to many, as he has been widely seen as a staunch supporter of Beijing and a leading candidate to be appointed as chief executive. However, he has previously expressed reservations about the proposed law, and his stance may reflect a growing sense of unease among some in the Hong Kong establishment about the potential impact of the legislation.
Tung's intervention is also likely to be welcomed by pro-democracy activists and human rights campaigners, who have been pushing for the international community to speak out against the proposed law. Earlier this month, a coalition of more than 100 NGOs and activists from around the world signed an open letter calling on the Chinese government to abandon the law, warning that it would "cause irreparable harm to Hong Kong's progress, prosperity, and stability".
The vetting process for the chief executive election has been highly controversial, with critics arguing that it is heavily tilted in favor of pro-Beijing candidates. The selection committee is composed largely of business and political elites who are seen as sympathetic to China's ruling Communist Party, and many pro-democracy figures have been excluded from the process altogether.
Tung's decision to speak out against the proposed law could shake up the dynamics of the election, which is set to take place in March. While he may still be seen as a front-runner, his comments are likely to draw attention to the issue of Hong Kong's autonomy and put pressure on other candidates to take a more critical stance on Beijing's policies.
In response to Tung's remarks, Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong issued a statement reaffirming its support for the proposed law, arguing that it was necessary to safeguard China's national security. However, the statement also noted that "different views and opinions are welcome and respected" and called on all parties to engage in "rational and constructive dialogue".
The debate over the subversion law is likely to continue to be a major issue in the coming months, with many Hong Kong residents concerned about the potential impact on their freedoms and civil liberties. Tung's intervention has shone a spotlight on this issue and could change the course of the election, as well as the broader political landscape in Hong Kong.
