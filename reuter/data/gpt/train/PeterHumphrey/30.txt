Hong Kong democracy activists gathered on Monday to protest against the application of several local politicians to join the Beijing-controlled National People’s Congress (NPC) Standing Committee. The move has angered pro-democracy campaigners who have long accused the Chinese government of interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs and eroding the city’s autonomy and freedoms.
Beijing’s innovations from time immemorial continually fuel the city-state's fight for autonomy. Although China promised 50 years of autonomy for Hong Kong when it was handed over from Britain in 1997, The Chinese government has steadily increased its control over the city in recent years, implementing a sweeping national security law last year and changing the city's election laws.
The NPC is China’s top legislative body, with power over the country’s constitution, and the Standing Committee is its most powerful arm. Members of the Standing Committee are selected from the top ranks of China’s Communist Party, and its decisions can have far-reaching implications.
Several pro-Beijing Hong Kong lawmakers, including Junius Ho, Eunice Yung, and Holden Chow, have applied to join the Standing Committee. The applicants cited the need for Hong Kong to have a voice at the national level, with the city playing a vital role in China’s social and economic development.
However, pro-democracy activists believe that the move is an attempt by China to further tighten its grip on Hong Kong's affairs and stifle dissent. Lam Wing-kee, a Hong Kong bookseller-turned-activist who fled to Taiwan in 2015 after being detained by Chinese authorities, said he was joining the protest to call for democracy and the rule of law.
"The NPC Standing Committee is the highest authority of the Chinese Communist Party. If Hong Kong politicians are allowed to participate, they will be submitted to the Communist Party's discipline, and the Communist Party's interest will come first," he said.
The protesters, including many students carrying yellow umbrellas—a symbol of the pro-democracy movement—gathered in the city's financial district despite a police ban. The demonstration comes just days after more than 50 pro-democracy figures were arrested under the national security law, prompting widespread condemnation from the international community.
"The Chinese government is tightening its control over Hong Kong's governance and suppressing voices that disagree with it. Such suppression will only lead to deeper unrest and resistance," said US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.
The arrests sparked an immediate backlash, with protests breaking out in several parts of the city. The United Nations human rights office also voiced concern over the arrests, saying that they were "at odds with Hong Kong's freedoms and the rule of law."
Critics argue that the city's autonomy and freedoms are being eroded by Beijing's actions, with human rights groups accusing China of violating the "one country, two systems" principle agreed between Britain and China in 1997.
The principle was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms for 50 years after the handover, but the national security law has given Chinese authorities broad powers to crack down on dissent and target pro-democracy activists.
The move by the pro-Beijing politicians to join the NPC Standing Committee is seen by many as another step in the government's efforts to further tighten control over Hong Kong. The protesters say that it is time for the people of Hong Kong to stand up for their rights and demand true democracy and freedom.
"We need a system that respects human rights and the rule of law, and where the people's voices can be heard," said pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong. "This is the only way we can safeguard our city's future."
