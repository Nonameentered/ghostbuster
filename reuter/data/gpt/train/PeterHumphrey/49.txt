Hong Kong’s government recently expressed confidence that its police force is equipped and capable of managing any disturbances that may arise following the city’s handover from Great Britain to China without the involvement of People’s Liberation Army (PLA).
In a press conference on Monday, Hong Kong's Secretary for Security, John Lee Ka-chiu, stated that the potential for violence and social unrest following the handover is low given the city's current state of peace and stability.
The statement follows concerns raised by pro-democracy protesters and legislators over increasing pressure from Beijing, which has demonstrated a hardline stance over dissenting voices in the semi-autonomous city-state.
Hong Kong was previously a British colony until 1997 when it was handed over to China under the “one country, two systems” agreement that granted the region a degree of autonomy, including its own legal and financial systems.
The agreement is set to expire soon, and experts have predicted that Beijing may move to exert greater control over the city and its political and business affairs. Many have voiced concerns that this could result in human rights violations and an erosion of democratic values.
While the possibility of unrest cannot be ruled out entirely, Secretary Lee stressed that Hong Kong's police force has the experience, training, and resources to handle any potential threats to public order.
Hong Kong's police force, which consists of around 30,000 officers, has been bolstered by regular training exercises and the introduction of specialized units that can handle a variety of threat scenarios.
In recent years, the force has been equipped with a range of crowd control and riot gear, including tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets. The use of such tactics, however, has faced fierce criticism from human rights groups.
Lee also emphasized that the police have the support of Hong Kong's government and people, who he said would be united in maintaining law and order.
In a recent survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong, 79 percent of the city's residents expressed confidence in the police force's capacity to handle disturbances.
The survey, which also highlighted concerns about the erosion of democratic values, found that over 60 percent of respondents opposed any introduction of the PLA to the city's streets.
The Hong Kong government has made efforts to defuse tensions and maintain calm in the run-up to the handover by offering reassurances about the city's future and engaging in dialogue with various stakeholders.
However, the recent conviction of prominent democracy activists and the increasing pressure on the media and civil society groups have raised concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms.
Despite these challenges, Secretary Lee remained confident that Hong Kong would emerge from the handover process as a stable and prosperous city.
"We have a resilient society that has been through many challenges, and our police force is capable of maintaining public order," he said.
"Whatever happens, we will work together to ensure that Hong Kong remains a safe and stable city that upholds the rule of law and protects the rights and freedoms of its people."
