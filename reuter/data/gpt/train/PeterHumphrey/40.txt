Prince Andrew, Duke of York, has arrived in Hong Kong on a five-day visit to inspect troops ahead of the territory’s handover to China next year. He is the first member of the royal family to visit Hong Kong since the announcement of the historic handover in 1997.
The prince has been given a full schedule for his visit, which includes meeting with political leaders and attending a number of events. The main purpose of his visit is to inspect the British military garrison in Hong Kong and to speak with soldiers about the upcoming handover.
Hong Kong was a British colony for 156 years before it was transferred to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” principle, which guarantees the territory’s capitalist system and political freedom for 50 years. Prince Andrew’s visit comes as China and the UK are strengthening their ties ahead of the handover.
The Prince’s visit is seen by many as a symbolic gesture of Britain’s commitment to the stability of Hong Kong and its interests in the region. The Prince’s visit also coincides with the 30th anniversary of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which laid down the framework for Hong Kong’s handover.
On the first day of his visit, Prince Andrew was greeted by government officials at the airport. He was then taken to the British military garrison in Hong Kong, where he inspected the troops and spoke with commanders.
Speaking to reporters, the Prince said he was “very impressed” with the discipline and professionalism of the troops. “I know that the handover of Hong Kong to China is a sensitive issue, but I am confident that the British troops are well-prepared and well-trained to handle any challenges that may arise,” he said.
Later in the day, the Prince met with members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, including the Chief Executive and the leader of the Opposition. The meetings were described as “cordial and constructive” by both sides, and the Prince was said to have expressed his support for Hong Kong’s continued development.
On the second day of his visit, Prince Andrew visited a number of military installations in the New Territories area of Hong Kong. He also met with members of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force and learned about their role in maintaining law and order in the territory.
The Prince’s visit has been closely followed by the media, with local and international news outlets reporting on his every move. Some have criticized the visit as being too late, given that the handover is scheduled to take place next year.
However, many Hong Kong residents have welcomed the Prince’s visit, seeing it as a sign of Britain’s commitment to the territory and its people. “It’s good to see that Britain still cares about Hong Kong and is willing to show its support,” said one resident.
Despite the warm welcome, the Prince’s visit has also been marked by protests from pro-democracy activists. Demonstrations have been held outside the British Consulate in Hong Kong, with protesters calling for greater democracy and autonomy for the territory.
The Prince’s visit comes amid growing concern over China’s influence in Hong Kong. Critics accuse Beijing of tightening its grip on the territory and stifling dissent, while authorities in Hong Kong have been accused of cracking down on pro-democracy protests.
For his part, Prince Andrew has expressed his hope that the handover will be a smooth and peaceful process. “I think it’s important that Hong Kong enjoys political freedom and economic prosperity,” he said. “The UK has a longstanding relationship with Hong Kong, and I am here to show our support for the territory and its people.”
