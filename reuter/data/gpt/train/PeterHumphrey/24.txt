Amidst the ongoing protests and tensions in Hong Kong, reports have been circulating that there could be a mass exodus of Hong Kong residents to Canada ahead of the city's handover to China. However, Canadian envoys have dismissed these reports, stating that there is no evidence to suggest such a mass return.
"We have been in close contact with our colleagues in Hong Kong, and there is no indication of a mass exodus of Hong Kong people to Canada ahead of the handover," said John McCallum, Canada's ambassador to China. "It is important that we do not spread false rumors and further exacerbate the situation in Hong Kong."
The reports of a mass return to Canada were first circulated on social media and online forums, with some claiming that large numbers of Hong Kong residents were planning to leave the city due to the ongoing protests and fears of Beijing's increasing influence over the semi-autonomous region.
However, Canadian envoys have emphasized that such reports are unfounded and that Hong Kong residents have every right to stay in the city and continue to fight for their rights and freedoms.
"Canada has a long-standing commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, and we stand with the people of Hong Kong in their struggle for these values," said McCallum. "We believe that Hong Kong residents should be free to express their views and participate in peaceful protests without fear of reprisals."
The recent protests in Hong Kong began in June 2019, sparked by a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to mainland China. The bill has since been withdrawn, but the protests have continued, with demonstrators calling for greater democracy and an end to police brutality.
The situation in Hong Kong has attracted international attention and condemnation, with many countries expressing support for the protesters and warning China against further escalation of the situation.
Canada has been among the countries speaking out against the situation in Hong Kong, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently stating that Canada stands with the people of Hong Kong in their fight for democracy and human rights.
"We are watching closely and with concern what is happening in Hong Kong," Trudeau said. "We're calling for peace, for order, for dialogue, and for respect for the rule of law and for human rights."
Despite the ongoing protests and tensions in Hong Kong, Canadian envoys have emphasized that the Canadian government remains committed to its relationship with China and to promoting trade and economic ties between the two countries.
"Canada and China have a long-standing trade relationship, and we are committed to continuing to build and strengthen that relationship," said McCallum. "While we have concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, we believe that dialogue and constructive engagement are the best ways to address these issues and move forward."
For now, it remains to be seen whether there will be a mass exodus of Hong Kong residents to Canada ahead of the city's handover to China. However, Canadian envoys have made it clear that the Canadian government is ready to offer support and assistance to any Hong Kong residents who may need it in the coming weeks and months.
