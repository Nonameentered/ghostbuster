Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting Tung Chee-Hwa has invited Chief Secretary Anson Chan for a meeting amid speculation over her future post-China takeover. Chan, who has been the second-highest ranking official in the Hong Kong government since 1993, announced her retirement earlier this year. Speculation has been rife that she may be offered a top post in the post-handover government.
Tung, who will become the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the handover on July 1, has been under pressure to fill key positions in his government. Chan, who has been widely respected for her handling of the transition to Chinese rule, is seen as a strong candidate for a senior post.
Sources close to Tung said the invitation was a significant move, but they declined to speculate on the outcome of the meeting. "The fact that Tung has invited Chan for a meeting shows that he is seriously considering her for a position in his government," said one source.
Tung has been holding talks with various groups and individuals in the run-up to the handover. He has also been working on the formation of his cabinet, which is expected to be announced shortly after the handover.
Chan, who has been praised for her efficiency and dedication, has been rumored to be a candidate for the position of principal official, a post that is equivalent to that of a minister in other countries. The appointment of a high-ranking official like Chan would send a positive signal to the business community and investors, who are concerned about the continuity of Hong Kong's economic policies after the handover.
Despite her popularity and reputation, Chan has been criticized by some for being too Western-oriented, which has led to speculation that she may not be offered a senior post in the post-handover government. However, her supporters argue that her experience, knowledge, and skills are essential for a smooth transition and for maintaining the confidence of the international community in Hong Kong.
The meeting between Tung and Chan comes at a time when questions are being raised about the future of Hong Kong's political and economic systems after the handover. Many analysts believe that the Chinese government will not tolerate dissent or challenges to its authority in Hong Kong, which may lead to a crackdown on civil liberties and free speech.
However, Tung has repeatedly emphasized that he will uphold the "one country, two systems" formula, which guarantees Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms. He has also pledged to maintain Hong Kong's status as a financial center and a gateway to China.
The outcome of the meeting between Tung and Chan will be closely watched by the business community, investors, and the wider public, who are eager to see a smooth and stable transition to Chinese rule. The appointment of a competent and experienced official like Chan would go a long way in reassuring them that their interests will be protected and that Hong Kong's future is in capable hands.
In conclusion, Tung's invitation to meet with Chan is a positive sign that he is open to considering experienced officials for his government post-handover. The outcome of the meeting will be crucial in determining the direction and stability of Hong Kong's political and economic systems in the post-handover era.
