The British government has published a draft legislation for consideration, although concerns arise that there may not be enough time before the upcoming general election for it to be fully passed.
The legislation, formally named as the Domestic Abuse Bill, aims to offer greater protection for victims and survivors of domestic abuse, and to prevent more individuals from suffering in silence.
The bill has been in the works for two years and proposes new measures including placing a duty on local authorities to provide support to domestic abuse victims in safe accommodation, creating new court orders and bail conditions to reduce offenders’ actions and to put an end to the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in court.
Home Secretary Priti Patel said that the bill’s proposals “will transform the response to domestic abuse, providing more protection for victims, and prosecuting the worst offenders.”
Human rights organizations welcome the legislation as a step forward to protect those affected by domestic abuse, while emphasizing the need for its prompt enactment before the general election.
However, with Parliament suspended for five weeks up to October 14, and a possible general election to be called soon after, many are concerned that there will be limited time for MPs to pass the vital legislation.
The current Parliament has seen several key bills fail to pass due to the Brexit-dominated agenda, and with the possibility of an election ahead, it remains unclear how much more legislation can yet be pushed through before the end of the year.
Crucially, the Domestic Abuse Bill also outlines an enormous increase in funding for refuges, offering financial support to those who need a safe space to escape abusive partners, as well as providing further training to frontline staff and law enforcement agencies.
Conservative MP Maria Miller, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, said the proposed reforms could be "life-saving" for some abuse survivors, and therefore any delay in enacting the legislation could put lives at risk.
Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott has also expressed concern that the legislation may not be carried on by a possible new government. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, she said, "The real question here is whether the government is committed to this bill, to passing it in a normal parliamentary session at a time when we're not in a pre-election period."
Many campaigners for domestic violence victims consider that the proposals in the bill could help save lives, ensure protection and support, prevent future abuse, and hold the perpetrators accountable; therefore, they urge that the legislation is passed as soon as possible.
This has been echoed by MPs who have pushed for its passage, including women’s groups and members across all parties.
Overall, the legislation is viewed by many as critical in the UK's fight against domestic violence. It seeks to enhance the law and introduce particular measures to ‘transform’ how domestic violence is reported and tackled.
While it is certainly welcome that the UK government is introducing the Domestic Abuse Bill, we must ensure that there is enough parliamentary time and cross-party support to push for its enactment before the upcoming General Election. Anything less would be a massive betrayal for the countless victims of domestic violence, as well as an unacceptable delay in protecting those who may be experiencing it right now.
