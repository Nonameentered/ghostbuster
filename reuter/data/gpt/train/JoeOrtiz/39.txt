Nicola Horlick, a former fund manager at the Magna Global Asset Management (MGAM), has been battling her ex-employer for her reinstatement for months now. However, according to sources close to the matter, Horlick is unlikely to get her job back, despite her efforts.
Horlick's battle against MGAM began when she was fired from her position of CEO of the company in October 2020. The company cited her "poor performance" as the reason for her dismissal. Horlick, however, contested the dismissal and said that it was unlawful and unfair. She argued that the company had not followed the correct procedures and that her reputation had been damaged as a result.
Soon after her dismissal, Horlick launched a campaign to get her job back. She created a website called "Justice for Nic" and began a social media campaign to get public support for her reinstatement. However, despite her efforts, it seems that Horlick's campaign has been unsuccessful.
According to sources close to the matter, MGAM has no intention of reinstating Horlick. The company maintains that her dismissal was justified and that her poor performance had a negative impact on the company's business. Additionally, it is reported that Horlick's behavior during her time at MGAM had strained relationships with both employees and clients.
In response to MGAM's stance, Horlick has said that she intends to continue her battle for reinstatement. She has enlisted the help of a legal team and has lodged a claim with the Employment Tribunal. Horlick has also accused MGAM of discrimination, harassment, and victimization, although the company has denied these allegations.
The case has attracted a lot of attention from the media, with many experts weighing in on the matter. Some have suggested that Horlick's campaign for reinstatement is unlikely to succeed, given the circumstances of her dismissal. Others have praised her for standing up for her rights and fighting against what she sees as an injustice.
Horlick's case highlights the thorny issue of employee dismissal and the role of employers in such situations. While employers have the right to dismiss employees for poor performance or misconduct, they must follow correct procedures and ensure that the dismissal is justified. If an employee feels that their dismissal was unlawful or unfair, they have the right to challenge it through the courts.
In Horlick's case, it remains to be seen what the outcome of the Employment Tribunal hearing will be. However, it is clear that her battle for reinstatement is far from over. Whatever the final decision, the case serves as a reminder to employers and employees alike of the importance of proper procedures and fairness in the workplace.
