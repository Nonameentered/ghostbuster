In a major consolidation move, Barclays has agreed to sell its global custody business to Morgan Stanley for a confidential sum. The deal is said to be a part of Barclays' strategy to focus on its core business and streamline operations.
As part of the transaction, Morgan Stanley will acquire Barclays' global custody platform, which provides asset servicing and settlement services to institutional investors across the world, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and asset managers. The platform is expected to complement Morgan Stanley's existing business, which provides investment banking, wealth management, and trading services.
The deal is seen as a win-win for both the companies. For Barclays, it means freeing up capital and resources that can be directed to its core businesses, such as investment banking and retail banking. Moreover, the sale is expected to improve the bank's profitability and return on equity. For Morgan Stanley, the acquisition will help the bank to expand its asset servicing business and increase its market share.
The global custody business has been a cornerstone of Barclays' operations for several decades. However, in recent years, the bank has been under pressure to divest non-core businesses and focus on its strengths. The sale of the global custody business is the latest in a long line of divestitures by the bank in recent years.
Commenting on the transaction, Jes Staley, CEO of Barclays said, "This transaction is another example of Barclays executing on its strategy to focus on our core businesses and generate sustainable returns for our shareholders. While the global custody business has been an important part of our history, we believe that this transaction represents the best outcome for our clients, employees, and shareholders."
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals. Barclays said that it will work closely with Morgan Stanley to ensure a smooth transition for its clients and employees.
Overall, the sale of its global custody business is a significant step for Barclays as it looks to simplify its operations and improve profitability. The deal is also expected to benefit Morgan Stanley by expanding its asset servicing capabilities.
