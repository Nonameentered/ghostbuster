The Northern Rock Building Society has announced that it has seen a 14% increase in profits for the first half of the year, which could boost investor confidence ahead of the company's planned autumn IPO.
The company, which operates in the North East of England, reported a pre-tax profit of £50.1m for the first six months of 2021, up from £44m over the same period in 2020. This was largely driven by strong mortgage lending, with the building society writing £1.33bn worth of new mortgages in the first half of the year, up from £1.04bn in 2020.
The building society's CEO, Andrew Haigh, said that the results were a "strong indication of the resilience of our business and of the confidence customers have in us".
"Our robust performance in the first half of the year demonstrates that we are delivering on our strategic priorities, and we are confident that we can continue to do so, even in these uncertain times," he said.
Haigh also confirmed that the company remained on track to float on the London Stock Exchange later this year, in what will be one of the most significant IPOs of 2021.
"The IPO is an important next step for us as we look to build on the progress we have made in recent years and continue to grow the business," he said. "We are confident that our strong financial position and our focus on delivering outstanding customer service will be attractive to investors."
The Northern Rock Building Society was formed in 1965 and has more than 60 branches across the North East of England. It was nationalised during the financial crisis of 2008, when it became one of the biggest victims of the credit crunch. The company was eventually sold to Virgin Money in 2012, but it still operates under the Northern Rock brand.
The IPO is seen as an opportunity for Northern Rock to raise significant funds, which could be used to support further growth and investment in the business.
However, some analysts have questioned whether the company will be able to maintain its recent growth trajectory in the face of challenges such as the ongoing pandemic and the end of government-backed mortgage support schemes such as the Help to Buy scheme.
"Northern Rock will need to prove that it can continue to deliver strong growth in the face of these challenges," said Ben Yearsley, investment director at Shore Financial Planning. "Investors will be looking for evidence that the company has a clear strategy in place and that it is well positioned to weather any storms that may lie ahead."
Despite these concerns, Northern Rock's strong financial performance in the first half of 2021 is likely to be seen as a positive sign by investors. The company's shares are expected to be priced at between 170p and 200p when the IPO takes place, which would value the company at around £1.5bn.
The IPO is also expected to be a significant moment for the North East, which has seen relatively few major listings in recent years.
"This is a real opportunity for the North East to showcase what it has to offer and to attract investment to the region," said Susan Bell, regional director of the Confederation of British Industry in the North East.
"If Northern Rock can deliver a successful IPO, it will send a strong signal that the North East is a great place to do business, and that there are some really exciting growth opportunities in the region."
