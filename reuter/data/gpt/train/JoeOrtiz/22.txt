Ernst & Young, one of the largest professional services firms in the world, has reported a profit of £75.2 million in its first financial disclosure of the year. The announcement comes as a positive sign for the company, which has been under immense pressure to navigate the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company's financial report shows that its revenue increased by 7.7% to £3.1 billion in the year to June 30, 2020. Its net profit, which is the amount left after deducting taxes and other expenses from revenue, also rose by 3.4% during the same period. The company attributed its success to its diversified portfolio, which allowed it to weather the storm better than many of its competitors.
Ernst & Young has been able to maintain its solid financial position despite the pandemic due to the resilience of its client base. The company's clients include many of the largest companies in the world, which have been able to withstand the economic shock that has impacted many other businesses. The firm's consulting and advisory businesses have also performed well, making up for any declines in its audit and tax services.
The company's UK chairman, Hywel Ball, said: "This has been a difficult year for everyone, and we are proud to have been able to support our clients when they needed us most. We have seen tremendous resilience and innovation from our clients, who have been adapting to the pandemic and finding new ways to operate."
Despite the positive news, Ernst & Young has not been immune to the effects of the pandemic. The company was forced to reduce staff in some areas, including its transaction advisory services, where demand for its services has declined. The firm also canceled its summer internship program, which is typically an important pipeline for new hires.
In addition, Ernst & Young has faced scrutiny from regulators over its audit work. The company was fined £2.75 million earlier this year by the UK accounting watchdog for its failure to properly audit the financial statements of a company called Tech Data. This followed a £1.8 million fine in 2019 for similar issues with the audit of Thomas Cook Group.
The company has also faced public criticism for its role in the Wirecard scandal, which involved the collapse of the German fintech company. Ernst & Young signed off on Wirecard's financial statements, despite persistent allegations of fraud and irregularities. The company has since launched an internal investigation into the matter.
Overall, Ernst & Young's strong financial performance in the face of the pandemic is a testament to its resilience and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The company will continue to face challenges in the coming months, but its diversified portfolio and commitment to supporting its clients should see it through any future disruptions.
