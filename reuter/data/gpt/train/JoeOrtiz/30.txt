London, UK - After months of suspension, Morgan Grenfell Asset Management has announced that it will resume trading in its suspended European funds. The decision was made following the completion of the fund's internal investigation and the satisfaction of the regulator's requirements.
In June, Morgan Grenfell was forced to suspend their European fund after it was discovered that the fund's manager, Dennis Weber, had made significant bets on small-cap companies that had gone sour. At the time, it was estimated that the fund had lost over Â£400 million.
The suspension of the fund led to significant losses for Morgan Grenfell, with investors questioning the firm's risk management practices. In the months since the suspension, Morgan Grenfell has been conducting an internal investigation into the fund's activities and has been working with regulators to ensure that the fund meets all necessary requirements for resuming trading.
In a statement, Morgan Grenfell CEO, James Fairweather, said: "We are pleased to announce that we will be resuming trading in our European funds. We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the fund meets all regulatory requirements, and we have implemented new risk management controls to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future."
The resumption of trading in the fund is expected to provide some relief for investors who have been waiting for an opportunity to withdraw their funds. However, some analysts have expressed concern that the fund's performance may be slow to recover, given the impact of the suspension on investor confidence.
Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: "While the resumption of trading in the fund is positive news, it remains to be seen whether investors will be willing to invest once again. The suspension has undoubtedly damaged the fund's reputation, and it may take some time for investors to regain confidence."
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the resumption of trading, Morgan Grenfell is focused on moving forward and ensuring that the fund is managed effectively. "We are committed to working closely with our investors and regulators to ensure that the fund delivers on its objectives and meets their expectations," added James Fairweather.
The resumption of trading in the fund is expected to take place in the coming weeks, with investors being given the opportunity to withdraw their funds if they choose to do so. While the road to recovery may be challenging, Morgan Grenfell is determined to regain the trust of its investors and emerge from the situation stronger than before.
