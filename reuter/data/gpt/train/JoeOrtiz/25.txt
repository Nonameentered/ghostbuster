Barclays announced on Wednesday that it has sold its global custody business to Morgan Stanley as part of a consolidation move to focus on core businesses and cut costs. The sale is expected to be completed in the second half of the year, subject to regulatory approvals.
The global custody business is responsible for storing and safeguarding assets for institutional clients such as pension funds, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds. The sale includes all of Barclays' existing global custody clients, its personnel, technology and infrastructure, while Morgan Stanley will take on existing contracts and clients. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
The move comes as Barclays seeks to streamline its operations and cut costs after posting a 30% drop in profits in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The bank has set a target of cutting Â£1.7bn ($2.4bn) in costs over the next three years, and is looking to exit non-core businesses such as its global custody unit.
"Barclays remains committed to providing outstanding investment banking, corporate banking and wealth management services to our clients around the world," said Jes Staley, CEO of Barclays. "This transaction will allow us to focus our resources on these core businesses while ensuring our clients' continued access to high-quality global custody services."
Morgan Stanley's acquisition of Barclays' global custody business will enhance its existing suite of services, which includes securities lending, cash management and fund administration. The move is also part of the bank's strategy to expand its wealth management unit and boost fee-based revenues.
"We are pleased to announce this acquisition, which will significantly enhance our capabilities in global custody and increase our scale in servicing institutional clients," said Dan Simkowitz, Head of Investment Management at Morgan Stanley. "We look forward to bringing our expanded offering to existing and future clients."
The deal is the latest in a series of consolidation moves in the banking industry, as firms seek to cut costs, boost profits and better compete with larger rivals. Morgan Stanley has been particularly active in this space, acquiring Eaton Vance for $7bn in October 2020 and E*TRADE Financial for $13bn in 2019.
Barclays' global custody business has approximately $600bn in assets under custody, according to the bank's 2020 annual report. The sale is expected to have a minimal impact on Barclays' financial results.
