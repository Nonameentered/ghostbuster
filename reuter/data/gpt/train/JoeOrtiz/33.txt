London, UK - British banks got off to a strong start in 1997, boosted by buoyant share prices and analysts' confidence in continued growth.
Barclays, Lloyds, RBS and HSBC all saw their shares rise in the first week of trading in January, with many investors optimistic about the sector's prospects.
Analysts have credited the strong start to several factors, including a generally positive economic outlook in the UK, an increase in M&A activity, and record levels of mortgage lending.
"We've seen a lot of positive indicators in the past few months that suggest that the UK economy is on very stable ground, which is good news for banks," said James Wilmot, an analyst at financial services firm, Barclays Bank.
He added that the increased M&A activity is also a positive sign for the industry, as it suggests that investors and companies are willing to take risks, which usually means good news for banks.
Meanwhile, record levels of mortgage lending are also helping to drive growth in the sector. According to the Bank of England, mortgage approvals rose to their highest level in over a year in December, with lenders approving 66,700 mortgages for home purchases.
"This is a very encouraging sign for the banks, as it suggests that the housing market is still very strong and that demand for mortgages remains high," said Wilmot.
The strong performance of the banking sector mirrors the broader UK equity market, which has also seen a strong start to the year. The FTSE 100 index rose by 3.4% in the first week of trading, buoyed by a number of factors, including a weaker pound, rising oil prices and optimism over US-China trade talks.
However, some analysts have warned that the good times may not last forever, with concerns over Brexit and slowing global growth still weighing on investor sentiment.
"Brexit remains a big unknown for the UK economy, and there is still a lot of uncertainty over what the final outcome will be," said Wilmot.
He added that while the UK economy is still in good shape, there are signs that growth is starting to slow down, which could impact the banking sector in the months to come.
Despite these concerns, many analysts remain optimistic about the prospects for the sector in 2019.
"Overall, we are feeling quite positive about the outlook for the banking sector this year," said Wilmot. "While there are certainly some challenges ahead, we believe that the underlying fundamentals of the UK economy are strong enough to support continued growth in the sector."
This positive outlook is reflected in the share prices of many of the major banks, which have all seen gains in the first few weeks of 2019.
Barclays, for example, saw its share price rise by more than 4% in the first week of trading, while Lloyds and RBS both gained around 2.5%. HSBC, meanwhile, saw its share price rise by 1.5% over the same period.
Overall, it seems that 2019 is off to a good start for the British banking sector, with investors feeling optimistic and analysts confident in continued growth. While there are certainly challenges ahead, such as Brexit and slowing global growth, it appears that the industry is in a good position to weather these challenges and continue to thrive in the years to come.
