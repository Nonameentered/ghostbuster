The former aide of tycoon Asil Nadir, Mr. Sahin Kebab, has been freed from prison after winning an appeal against his conviction for handling stolen money. Kebab, who was serving a six-year sentence for his involvement in the multi-million Pound fraud, walked out of prison on bail on Thursday after a successful appeal in the London Court of Appeal.
The case stems from the investigation into the collapse of the Polly Peck group, a British conglomerate run by Asil Nadir in the 1980s. Nadir fled to Northern Cyprus in 1993, but in 2010 he returned to the UK to face trial. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for stealing £28 million from Polly Peck, but was released on bail in 2013 after spending two and a half years in jail.
Kebab, who worked as Nadir's personal assistant, was jailed for six years in 2012 for his role in the fraud. He was convicted of handling £1.3 million of stolen money. However, he has always maintained his innocence, and his lawyers have argued that he was not aware that the money was stolen.
The Court of Appeal ruled that the judge who sentenced Kebab had failed to give adequate directions to the jury on the issue of Kebab's knowledge or belief about the stolen money. The Court of Appeal also found that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kebab knew or believed that the money was stolen.
After the ruling, Kebab's lawyer, Mr. Michael Wolkind QC, said that Kebab was "relieved and grateful" for the Court of Appeal's decision. He added that Kebab had always maintained that he was not involved in any wrongdoing and that he had been "unjustly and unfairly" convicted.
Reacting to the ruling, the Crown Prosecution Service said that it was "disappointed" by the decision, but respected the court's judgment. A spokesperson for the CPS said that they would be considering whether to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.
The case has been one of the most high-profile white-collar crime cases in the UK in recent years. The collapse of Polly Peck, once a FTSE 100 company, led to the loss of thousands of jobs and left long-term investors with losses of millions of pounds. Asil Nadir, who was once one of the UK's richest men, is now in his seventies and has been living in Northern Cyprus since his release from prison.
The ruling will be seen as a blow to the prosecution's efforts to bring justice to the victims of the Polly Peck fraud, but it also raises questions about the role of personal assistants and other employees of wealthy individuals who may unwittingly become caught up in illegal activities. The case shows that the courts are willing to scrutinize the knowledge and involvement of such employees more closely in order to ensure that justice is served.
