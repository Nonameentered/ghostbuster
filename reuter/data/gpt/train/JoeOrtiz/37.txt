Halifax Building Society has unveiled plans for a flotation that could see the UK’s largest share ownership extension in history. The mutual lender is said to be valued at £14 billion ($20 billion) and has confirmed that it will be issuing shares to its members later this year. It will be the first time in more than 20 years that a building society has gone public.
Members of the Halifax Building Society have been notified of the plans in a letter that was sent out last week. The company, which transformed into a bank in 1997, has now submitted a prospectus to the UK financial watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
The decision to go public comes after months of rumours and speculation. But the management claims that the move is being made in order to provide the members with an alternative to what they see as a stagnating market.
“We want our members to be part of our success, and that’s exactly what this flotation will do,” said Giles Rundle, Chief Executive of the Halifax Building Society. “The fact that we can provide our members with access to a publicly traded stock is a key part of our strategy.”
The move will be the largest share ownership extension in the history of the United Kingdoms. Such an effort to encourage share ownership has had mixed success in the past. But, the Halifax is confident that their members will take up shares, as they have a vested interest in maintaining the company’s success.
The Halifax Building Society is the largest of six mutual lenders in the UK. The process of transforming from a mutual to a public company has been carried out by several others in recent years, including the Nationwide Building Society.
However, some industry experts have warned that this move may not be so popular with the customers of the former building society. They say it could discourage customers who are attracted to the company's friendly, traditional image.
“Building societies are supposed to be different — there’s a lot of goodwill in the name Halifax, and customers may start to feel like they’re just another corporate,” said Adam Smith, Head of Corporate Ownership at the Institute of Directors.
The company has responded to this criticism by insisting that it will maintain its culture and values, and that its customers will remain at the heart of everything that it does.
The flotation appears to have gone down well with investors, however. Shares in the newly public Halifax Building Society are expected to be listed on the London Stock Exchange in the coming weeks. It will be one of the largest share offerings of the year and a significant step in the company's history.
“The fact that it’s gone this smoothly is a real testament to the quality of the management team and the strength of the company's financial position,” said Mark Yeomans, Director of Finance at Halifax Building Society.
Overall, the move to go public is being widely seen as the latest sign that the UK financial industry is looking to regain momentum after a tough few years. The Halifax Building Society is said to be well positioned to succeed in the coming years and remains one of the UK's largest and most successful lenders.
