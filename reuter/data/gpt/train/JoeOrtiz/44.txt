London, UK - Former Asil Nadir, a Polly Peck International PLC executive, has won the appeal against his five-year conviction for defrauding the company and walked free from court. Asil Nadir, who was once a prominent British business tycoon, was convicted in 2012 on ten counts of theft and false accounting. He was sentenced to five years which he began serving at the Belmarsh prison before turning himself in after more than a decade on the run in Northern Cyprus.
Today, the appeal court ruled that the conviction was flawed due to the introduction of inadmissible evidence and misleading statements made by the prosecution during the trial. Asil Nadir was jubilant as the verdict was given, and he was hugged by his family, supporters, and former colleagues.
Asil Nadir became a household name in the 1980s when he transformed textile company Polly Peck International PLC into a multinational. It was the biggest criminal case of its time, and Nadir's empire collapsed in 1990, leaving debts running to millions.
The prosecution had claimed that during the company's collapse, Asil Nadir had taken Â£28.5m from its accounts and used it to fund his lifestyle and buy personal assets. However, the defense had argued that the businessman had been set up by those who wanted to bring him down. And the appeal court agreed.
Outside the Old Bailey, Asil Nadir spoke to reporters and said, "I feel delighted, I feel vindicated, and I feel very, very grateful to the British justice system for giving me my freedom back." He added, "I'm going to go and have a good meal with my family and celebrate. And that's what life is all about, just enjoying precious moments like this."
Asil Nadir had been fighting for his release since he was sentenced in 2012 for stealing from the company that he had built. The businessman had always maintained his innocence and said that he was "hung out to dry" by the authorities.
The former aide of Polly Peck head has been on bail since he received permission to challenge his conviction in 2019. And today, he's finally a free man. However, the prosecution has indicated that they may take the case to the Supreme Court.
Regarding the possibility of an appeal, Asil Nadir's solicitor, Ismail Ugan, said, "We'll have to wait and see, but we are confident that we have a strong case." He added, "Asil Nadir has already lost 30 years of his life in exile and in prison. He deserves to be left alone. We hope that this is the end of it."
In conclusion, Asil Nadir's appeal victory means he can finally put his time in prison behind him, leave the UK that he has called his home for so many years but only after paying off creditors. While his business empire crumbled in the 1990s, the fight to clear his name will remain in the history books.
