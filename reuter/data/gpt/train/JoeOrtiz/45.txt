A former Barings executive has been banned from holding any directorships in the City, after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found him guilty of misconduct.
Head of Treasury and Risk at the bank, Kevin Rodgers, has been hit with a five-year ban after an FCA investigation found he created a "favourable impression" of his trading book’s valuation practices ahead of an inspection by the bank's regulators.
The investigation found that Rodgers had undervalued the bank's book in an attempt to show larger profits, which is in violation of the FCA's rules on honesty and integrity. The regulator says that his behavior "undermined the system of controls and compliance policies" in relation to risk reporting at Barings.
Rodgers has been banned from holding any senior management positions in any financial institution within the UK, but can continue working in a non-executive capacity.
The FCA's decision comes after it fined Barings £2.5m last year for "serious failings" in its risk management procedures. The regulator stated that the bank had failed to properly supervise and monitor its trading operations, leading to significant losses and an increased risk of financial instability.
Barings was famously brought down in 1995 by rogue trader Nick Leeson, who managed to conceal large losses from unauthorized trading, ultimately leading to the bank's collapse.
The ban on Rodgers comes as part of the City watchdog's efforts to clamp down on misconduct in the banking industry. It has already imposed a lifetime ban on several individuals, including former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers and former HSBC currency trader Mark Johnson.
The FCA has made it clear that it will continue to take a strong approach to wrongdoing in the financial sector, stating that it "will not tolerate misconduct in any form".
The regulator has also recently launched a new campaign to encourage whistleblowers to come forward with information about wrongdoing within banks, in a bid to increase transparency and accountability in the sector.
The ban on Rodgers serves as a stark reminder that the FCA will not hesitate to take action against those who breach its rules and regulations, and highlights the importance of maintaining the highest standards of conduct and integrity in the financial industry.
