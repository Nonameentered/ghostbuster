The London High Court has adjourned a hearing to decide on whether to hand over documents related to former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's business affairs to Italy. The hearing was scheduled for Monday but has been postponed to a later date.
The documents in question relate to Berlusconi's ownership of a television company in Italy. Italian authorities are investigating allegations that he fraudulently inflated the price of broadcasting rights, which resulted in a loss to the Italian state.
Berlusconi, who was forced to resign as Prime Minister in 2011 due to a financial scandal, has denied any wrongdoing. He has been convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to jail multiple times in Italy, but those convictions were later either overturned or expired under the statute of limitations.
The High Court's decision to adjourn the hearing was based on the need to hear further submissions from both Berlusconi's legal team and the Italian authorities. The Italian authorities had requested access to the documents as part of their ongoing investigation.
Berlusconi's lawyers argued that the Italian authorities had not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the documents were relevant to their investigation. They also claimed that the request violated Berlusconi's rights to privacy and a fair trial.
However, the Italian authorities maintain that the documents are crucial to their case against Berlusconi. They argue that the documents will help them establish whether Berlusconi played a role in the alleged fraud, and whether he benefited from it financially.
Berlusconi's legal troubles have been ongoing for many years, and this latest development is unlikely to be the last chapter in the saga. The decision by the London High Court to adjourn the hearing will allow both sides more time to gather evidence and make their case.
For now, the fate of the documents remains uncertain, and the Italian authorities will have to wait to see if they will finally gain access to them.
