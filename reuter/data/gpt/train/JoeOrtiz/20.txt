Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has announced a 15% rise in full-year profits, in a sign that the bank is rebounding from the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis. The bank has also revealed that it is considering options for expansion, including the possibility of acquisitions or partnering with other businesses.
The bank said that its profit for the year ending December 31, 2020, came in at £1.34 billion ($1.86 billion), up from £1.16 billion the previous year. This was largely due to a strong performance in its retail banking and lending divisions, which saw underlying profits rise by 14% to £3.5 billion.
RBS also benefited from lower costs, which were down by 4% to £12.6 billion, and a reduction in bad debt charges. The bank's total loan loss provisions for the year were £3.2 billion, down from £4.2 billion in 2019.
The bank's CEO, Alison Rose, said that the strong performance was testament to the bank's focus on serving its customers and supporting the economy during the pandemic.
"We have shown resilience and agility in our response to the pandemic, supporting our customers and colleagues whilst delivering a strong performance in the face of challenging market conditions," she said.
Rose also said that the bank was looking at opportunities for growth, including the possibility of acquisitions or partnering with other businesses.
"We will continue to explore opportunities to invest in the business to support our customers and create value for our shareholders, including exploring potential acquisitions or partnerships where they make strategic and financial sense," she said.
The bank's shares were up by as much as 4% in early trading following the announcement.
RBS, which is still majority-owned by the UK government, has undergone a radical transformation since the financial crisis, shedding billions of pounds of assets and refocusing on its core businesses. The bank has also been working to improve its reputation and restore trust with its customers, following a number of scandals in recent years.
The bank has set itself a number of targets for the coming years, including a commitment to become a net-zero carbon business by 2050 and to support 10,000 new businesses in the UK by 2025.
RBS's strong performance comes as other UK banks also report their full-year results. Last week, Barclays reported a 30% rise in profits, while Lloyds Banking Group said that it had returned to profitability following a loss in 2019.
However, the banking sector is still facing significant challenges, including the ongoing economic impact of the pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
RBS has said that it will continue to support its customers and the economy during this difficult time, including by participating in the UK government's coronavirus loan schemes and providing financial support to businesses affected by Brexit.
"We remain committed to supporting our customers during this difficult time, and we will continue to work closely with the government to ensure that we are doing all we can to support the UK economy," said Rose.
Overall, RBS's strong performance and plans for expansion are a positive sign for the UK economy, which is still struggling with the fallout from the pandemic. As the banking sector continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how RBS positions itself to achieve its long-term goals and deliver value for its shareholders.
