The British High Court has rejected the $1.8bn claim made by the liquidators of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) against the auditing firm, Ernst & Young. The court ruled that Ernst & Young was not liable for the losses suffered by the bank which was shut down in the early 1990s.
BCCI was one of the world's largest banks with a presence in over 70 countries before it collapsed in 1991 due to fraud and mismanagement. The bank's liquidators had sued Ernst & Young for failing to spot the fraud and warning about it in their audits. The liquidators had claimed that if Ernst & Young had detected the fraud, BCCI could have been saved from failure, and the bank's creditors could have been indemified for their losses.
Ernst & Young, on the other hand, had argued that it had acted professionally and diligently during its audits of BCCI and had no reason to suspect any fraud. The auditing firm also pointed out that its audits were limited in scope and could not have detected the extensive fraud carried out by senior executives of BCCI.
After a lengthy legal battle stretching over several years, the British High Court agreed with Ernst & Young's argument and ruled that the auditing firm was not liable for the losses suffered by BCCI's creditors. The court also noted that Ernst & Young had acted in accordance with the profession's standards and had not breached any duty of care owed to BCCI or its stakeholders.
Reacting to the judgment, a spokesperson for Ernst & Young said, "We are pleased that the court has confirmed our position and found that we were not responsible for the losses suffered by BCCI's creditors. We have always maintained that we acted professionally and diligently in carrying out our audits of BCCI."
The liquidators of BCCI, however, expressed disappointment at the ruling and said they would consider their options regarding a possible appeal. "We are disappointed with the court's decision and will be reviewing it carefully with our legal team. We will be considering all options, including a possible appeal, in consultation with our stakeholders," said a spokesperson for the liquidators.
The ruling is likely to have significant implications for the auditing profession as it clarifies the extent of auditors' liability for fraud and mismanagement by their clients. It also highlights the need for stakeholders to be vigilant and proactive in detecting and preventing fraud in financial institutions.
