Leading flight attendants have initiated a broad class-action lawsuit against cigarette companies to seek compensation and accountability for the long-term exposure to second-hand smoke while on duty. This groundbreaking legal action is targeting various tobacco companies, claiming that they knew the dangers of tobacco smoke, yet failed to warn individuals who were exposed to secondhand smoke risks.
The lawsuit alleges that airline attendants were constantly subjected to secondhand smoke while working, dating back to the 1950s, when smoking cigarettes was widely prevalent on commercial flights. These dedicated workers, who were exposed to smoke from tobacco products, have been left suffering from a series of severe, chronic respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, emphysema, and bronchitis.
Flight attendants have long suffered from health problems directly linked to exposure to tobacco smoke, which has led to premature deaths of many within this profession. The plaintiffs argue that tobacco firms had a fiduciary duty to notify employees of the health risks from smoking, and they failed to do so, posing an imminent danger to thousands of flight attendants who suffered from secondhand smoke exposure.
As airlines struggled to offer smoking and non-smoking sections on flights, a dangerous level of detachment exposed the cabin staff to cigarette smoke on prolonged transatlantic flights, leading to extensive health consequences. This liability case has a deep-reaching significance for the aviation industry, and will determine if tobacco companies are answerable for the longstanding effects of secondhand smoke exposure suffered by flight crew and their families.
In a 400-page research report on second-hand smoke published by Surgeon General in 1986, it was highlighted that second-hand smoke contained more than 30 chemicals that were identified as carcinogens, leading to severe damage to an individual's cardiovascular system. The lawsuit states that tobacco firms, including Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and others, knew about the harmful effects of tobacco and further ignored scientific studies highlighting the potentially dangerous health risks to those working on planes.
Despite numerous campaigns to inform and educate individuals about the health hazards of smoking, the lawsuit argues that companies failed to educate the public, including airlines and flight attendants about these risks. As a direct result, many flight attendants were diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a direct result of inhaling secondhand smoke while on duty.
The number of health problems that flight attendants and airline employees have faced due to tobacco smoke exposure is well documented and poses a significant public health risk. Apart from the individual suffering experienced, prolonged secondhand smoke exposure may compromise cabin air quality and lead to dangerous repercussions to all passengers on board over time.
The escalating number of lawsuits against tobacco companies could usher a progressive maneuver away from cigarette smoking, with more public health care policies implemented to educate people on the dangers of passive smoking. As a result, airlines banned smoking altogether in 2000, subsequently enhancing working conditions for employees.
The flight attendants' lawsuit follows other legal undertakings against major tobacco companies, including lawsuits by smokers and cities seeking reimbursement and damages for smoking-related healthcare expenses. These legal campaigns are intended to force tobacco companies to take accountability for their products and prioritize public health and safety ahead of profit. 
In a statement released on Tuesday, the plaintiffs, who represent over hundreds of thousands of flight attendants, airline crew, and their families, stated that they are "pursuing justice for everyone who has been affected by secondhand smoke for years on end. We hope that the tobacco industry, finally, takes responsibility and compensates us for the medical treatment that we will need for the rest of our lives,". 
The class-action lawsuit against the leading tobacco companies indicates a vital threat to the tobacco industry's interests, propelling them to own up to their actions for the protection of public health. It will not only offer compensation and justice to those who have suffered due to companies' negligence but may initiate necessary measures to curb tobacco smoking and encourage public education.
