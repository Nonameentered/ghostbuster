Republic Industries Inc. has acquired National Car Rental for $600 million, providing the company with a boost in inventory. However, the acquisition will not provide any extra buying power in Detroit. National Car Rental was previously owned by a group of investors, including Marriott International and Hewlett-Packard Co. , and is the third-largest car rental company in the United States. Republic Industries also owns AutoNation Inc., the country's largest automotive retail chain. The acquisition of National Car Rental will allow Republic to expand its rental car business and provide a greater selection of vehicles to its customers.
