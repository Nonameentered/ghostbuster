Major cigarette companies have dropped their pre-trial oppositions and are now facing potential losses in a multi-billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuit. The lawsuit, which dates back to 1999, has been spearheaded by the US Department of Justice, along with a number of American states and territories. It alleges that tobacco companies engaged in fraudulent advertising, marketing, and minimizing of the health risks associated with smoking, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans.
Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris USA, and British American Tobacco have announced that they will no longer oppose the opening of the trial, slated for September 2021. In a statement, Altria stated their belief that "smoking is addictive and causes serious health effects" and they are "committed to addressing this public health crisis and working collaboratively to reduce the harm caused by tobacco use."
The decision comes after over two decades of legal wrangling. The initial lawsuit, which began in 1999, accused the major tobacco companies of conspiracy to deceive the American public about the dangers of smoking, as well as violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act by engaging in racketeering activity.
The RICO Act, which was initially designed to combat organized crime, provides for extended penalties for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. In the case of the tobacco companies, it was alleged that they worked together to suppress information about the health risks of smoking, obstructed scientific research, and targeted children in their advertising campaigns.
The case has already had significant consequences for the tobacco companies, with a federal judge ruling in 2014 that they had engaged in a decades-long conspiracy to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking. The judge ordered the companies to pay $15 billion in penalties and fund anti-smoking campaigns.
However, in 2018, an appeals court overturned the judgement, stating that the evidence did not conclusively prove that the companies had acted together in a racketeering enterprise. The case was remanded to a lower court, where it has been languishing since.
The opening of the trial in September is expected to be a major event, with the plaintiffs seeking billions of dollars in damages from the tobacco companies. In a joint statement, some of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs expressed their hope that "the trial will uncover the truth about how the tobacco companies worked together to deceive the American public about the dangers of smoking."
The tobacco companies, for their part, have stated that they will "vigorously defend" themselves against the charges. In its statement, Altria noted that it has "always operated with integrity and in compliance with the law."
However, the potential consequences of the trial are significant. In addition to the financial penalties, the trial could also bring to light new evidence about the tobacco companies' activities, which could further damage their reputations and influence public opinion about smoking.
It remains to be seen whether the trial will result in a decisive victory for the plaintiffs, but one thing is clear: the tobacco companies' decision to drop their opposition to the proceedings is a major milestone in a long-running legal battle that has shaped public perception of the tobacco industry.
