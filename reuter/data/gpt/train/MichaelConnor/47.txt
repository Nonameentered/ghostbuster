Kodak has agreed to sell its copier-marketing and service operations to Danka Business Systems Plc for $684 million dollars in what the company is calling a partial exit from the copier wars. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Danka will acquire Kodak's global copier-marketing and service operations, which includes approximately 200 customer service centers, as well as Kodak's extensive sales force and distribution network. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
Kodak has been battling larger competitors such as Xerox and Canon in the copier industry for years, but has struggled to gain market share. The company's decision to sell its copier operations is seen as a strategic move to focus on its core businesses, such as printing and digital imaging services.
In a statement, Kodak CEO Jim Continenza said, "We are proud of our copier-marketing and service team and their dedication to our customers and the business. This sale is the result of our ongoing review of our portfolio and strategic focus on areas where we can best deliver value for our stakeholders.‚Äù
Danka Business Systems Plc, which is based in London, UK, is a leading provider of office imaging equipment and services. The company has been expanding its presence in the United States over the past few years and the acquisition of Kodak's copier operations is seen as a major step in that direction.
"This acquisition is a great fit for Danka Business Systems Plc and supports our growth strategy in the United States," said Danka CEO Tim Loomer. "Kodak has a strong reputation for quality and innovation in the copier industry and this acquisition will allow us to further expand our product offerings and customer base."
While Kodak is exiting the copier wars with this sale, the company has stated that it plans to continue to support its existing customer base and honor all existing service agreements. The company will also work closely with Danka to ensure a smooth transition for all customers.
The sale of Kodak's copier operations will provide the company with a significant cash infusion, which it plans to use to invest in its core business areas and explore new opportunities.
Overall, the sale of Kodak's copier-marketing and service operations is a strategic move that will allow the company to shift its focus to areas where it can best deliver value to its stakeholders. The acquisition by Danka is expected to be a positive development for both companies and their customers.
