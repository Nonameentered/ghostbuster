Dublin, Ireland - Tony O'Reilly, the seasoned international businessman, has announced that he plans to slow down acquisitions in 2021. O'Reilly is the founder and CEO of Providence Resources, a Dublin-based exploration and production company, and former CEO and chairman of Waterford Wedgwood.
In an interview with The Irish Times, O'Reilly said that he anticipates 2021 to be a year of consolidation for his company. This is a strategic move to focus on the growth and development of current assets rather than accumulating new ones.
The decision to slow down the acquisition spree does not come as a surprise to experts in the industry, as the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the global market. Most companies are evaluating their priorities in the face of uncertainty and anticipating the changes that will come with Brexit.
Despite the pandemic's impact on the business world, O'Reilly's company has seen comparatively fewer negative effects. The Providence Resources team adapted successfully to remote working and continued to deliver results in their operations. O'Reilly now wants to build on this resilience by maximizing the potential of its current assets.
O'Reilly has a history of high-profile acquisitions, such as the purchase of Wedgwood and Waterford Crystal. In recent years, he has continued this trend with acquisitions of offshore oil and gas fields in Ireland, the UK, and Norway. His company's assets include a 40% operating stake in the Barryroe oil and gas field off the coast of Cork.
Cutting back on acquisitions does not mean that Providence Resources will become a dormant company. As the world looks to find ways to combat climate change, O'Reilly believes that the petroleum industry has a vital role to play in developing sustainable energy solutions. In line with this, the company will reposition its business strategy to align with emerging energy demands.
In conclusion, O'Reilly's decelerated acquisition plan for 2021 will help Providence Resources concentrate on the most effective use of current assets while also discovering new business opportunities that adhere to the company's objectives.
