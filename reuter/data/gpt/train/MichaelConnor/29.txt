Republic Industries, the renowned automobile dealer in Florida, is set to expand their auto rental services to cater to an increased demand for rental services with the acquisition of National Car Rental System for $600 million in stock. The acquisition is set to see Republic Industries, who also owns Alamo Rent-A-Car, become the second-largest car rental chain in the United States, after Enterprise Rent-A-Car.
The acquisition aims to leverage the combined strengths, expertise, and resources of Republic Industries and National Car Rental System to provide customers with better value, service, and convenience. National Car Rental System, the main acquisition target, has a reputation for providing premium car rental services across the United States, with a fleet of over 650,000 vehicles, catering to individuals and corporate clients.
"We are thrilled to acquire National Car Rental System, a business synonymous with premium car rental services, expanding the Republic Industries footprint across the United States," said Wayne Huizenga, Chairman of Republic Industries. "National's customer-focused reputation perfectly complements our values and objectives, and we are thrilled to provide them with better value, service, and convenience."
The acquisition is set to boost the profile of Republic Industries by providing customers with access to a broader range of rental vehicles and services, including one-way rentals to different locations, and automated rental systems to reduce waiting times at rental desks. With the acquisition, Republic Industries' customers will now have access to over 4,500 locations in the United States, with over 20,000 employees, providing more convenience to customers.
Furthermore, the acquisition is set to provide the platform for greater innovation in rental services with Republic Industries looking to simplify the rental process for customers. The company plans to launch an integrated rental platform that would allow customers to book, pay, and pick up rental cars using a mobile device. The company also plans to invest in high-end luxury vehicles and electric car rental services, aligning with changing consumer preferences towards environmentally-friendly vehicles.
The acquisition is also set to boost Republic Industries financials, with National Car Rental System generating revenue of over $3 billion annually and a profit margin of 4.3%, adding to the $2.9 billion in revenue that Republic Industries generated in the previous financial year. The acquisition is expected to increase overall revenue, boost profitability and build shareholder value.
Republic Industries has a history of successful acquisitions in the automotive industry, having acquired the Alamo Rent-A-Car chain in 1996 and AutoNation in 1997, which has since become one of the largest auto retailer chains in the United States. The acquisition of National Car Rental System fits with Republic Industries' strategy of acquiring successful businesses with the potential for growth and expansion.
The acquisition is still subject to regulatory filings and approval, following which it is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021. Republic Industries has said that they are optimistic about the regulatory proceedings and confident that the acquisition will be completed without disruption.
In conclusion, the acquisition of National Car Rental System by Republic Industries marks a significant move in the car rental services industry, creating a formidable player in the market. The acquisition is set to provide customers with greater value, access to a broader range of rental vehicles, and better service. The acquisition is also expected to boost Republic Industries' financials, leading to greater profits and increased shareholder value. The move reaffirms Republic Industries' position as a major player in the automotive industry and sets them up for future growth and expansion.
