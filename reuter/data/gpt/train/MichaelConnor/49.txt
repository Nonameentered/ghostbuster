Florida Panthers Holdings Inc narrows cash flow losses with strong hockey revenues and new leisure properties acquisition
Florida Panthers Holdings Inc, the holding company of the Florida Panthers NHL team, announced it has narrowed its cash flow losses thanks to strong revenues generated by the hockey team and the acquisition of new leisure properties.
According to company data, Florida Panthers Holdings reported a net loss of $15.8 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021. However, the company said that the loss was lower than what it expected due to the strong performance of its hockey operations and the acquisition of two new properties: the Transformative Institute in Boca Raton, and the Mall at University Town Center in Sarasota.
"The past year has been challenging for everyone, but we are pleased to see that our investments in our hockey team and new leisure properties are starting to pay off," said Vincent Viola, Chairman of Florida Panthers Holdings Inc. "We are optimistic about the future and the potential for growth in the coming years."
In terms of hockey operations, the Florida Panthers have had a strong year on the ice, finishing the regular season with a record of 37 wins, 14 losses and 5 overtime losses, and securing a playoff spot for the first time in five years. The team's success on the ice translated into strong revenues, as ticket sales and merchandise sales both increased significantly compared to the previous year.
"Having a winning hockey team is great for the fans, but it is also great for our bottom line," said Matt Caldwell, President & CEO of Florida Panthers Holdings Inc. "We have always believed that investing in our hockey team is the key to building a successful business, and our results this past year show that we are on the right track."
In addition to its hockey operations, Florida Panthers Holdings also invested in two new leisure properties this past year. The Transformative Institute, a wellness center located in Boca Raton, was acquired in January 2021, and the Mall at University Town Center, a retail center in Sarasota, was acquired in March 2021. The company said that both properties are expected to generate significant revenue in the coming years.
"We are excited to have added two new properties to our portfolio that align with our mission of providing high-quality experiences to our guests," said Caldwell. "We believe that the Transformative Institute and the Mall at University Town Center both have huge potential, and we have already seen strong initial results."
Looking ahead, Florida Panthers Holdings said that it will continue to invest in its hockey operations and leisure properties, with the goal of driving revenue growth in the coming years.
"We have a clear vision for the future of our business, and we are committed to executing on that vision," said Viola. "We believe that Florida Panthers Holdings has enormous potential, and we are confident that we can deliver strong results for our shareholders and stakeholders."
