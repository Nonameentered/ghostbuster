Ryder System Inc is currently in discussions with various banks in order to create securitized truck leases. This move is aimed at diversifying Ryder's funding sources, thereby reducing the company's dependence on traditional borrowing and also lowering the costs associated with such financing.
Securitized truck leases work by packaging the leases on Ryder's fleet of vehicles into asset-backed securities, which are then sold to investors. The cash inflows generated from the sale of these securities would then be used to fund the leasing operation, while investors would receive regular payments as the underlying leases are paid off over time.
This financing method has been used for a variety of assets, including mortgages, car loans and credit card debt. However, it is a relatively new development in the truck leasing market, with Ryder being one of the first companies to explore this option.
According to Ryder's Chief Financial Officer, Art Garcia, "the beauty of securitization is that it allows us to fund our leasing business with lower-cost debt, while at the same time providing investors with a stable, recurring stream of cash flows."
The move towards securitized leases comes as Ryder has seen increased demand for its services, particularly in the e-commerce and home delivery sectors. By diversifying its funding sources, Ryder hopes to continue to grow its business in these areas, while also minimizing financial risk.
The discussions with banks are ongoing, with no official announcement yet of a finalized agreement. However, Garcia remains optimistic about the potential of securitized leases, stating that "we believe this is a very attractive financing option that could help us maintain our competitive edge in the market."
Ryder is one of the largest providers of truck leasing, rental and fleet management services in the world, with operations in North America, Europe, and Asia. The company reported revenue of $8.4 billion in 2019, and operates a fleet of over 230,000 vehicles.
