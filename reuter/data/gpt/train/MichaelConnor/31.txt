Butterworth, who was at the forefront of the landmark 1990s lawsuit against tobacco companies, criticized the manufacturers for delaying the release of key information about the health consequences of cigarette smoking.
The lawsuit was filed by several US states, including Florida, against cigarette makers, including Phillip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and British American Tobacco. The suit alleged that the companies knowingly deceived the public about the dangers of smoking.
The suit resulted in the largest civil settlement in US history, with tobacco companies agreeing to pay $206 billion over 25 years to compensate the states for smoking-related healthcare costs. The settlement also included provisions to restrict tobacco marketing and advertising and promote smoking cessation programs.
But Butterworth, who served as Florida's attorney general from 1987 to 2002, recently told a group of law students that the lawsuit was "all about the truth." He accused the cigarette makers of withholding important information about the health risks of smoking.
"They suborned false scientists and spent billions of dollars to keep from the public the true dangers of smoking," Butterworth said. "They delayed the truth, delayed the truth, delayed the truth."
Butterworth pointed to documents uncovered during the lawsuit's discovery process that showed cigarette makers had evidence of the link between smoking and cancer as early as the 1950s. However, the companies chose not to disclose the information to the public and instead continued to market and sell their products.
"What they had done is taken their own documents and destroyed them so that we couldn't see what was really happening," Butterworth said.
He also criticized the tobacco companies for using their considerable financial resources to drag out the lawsuit for years, hoping that the states would run out of money or lose interest. It took nearly a decade for the case to finally come to trial, and the settlement was not reached until 1998.
Butterworth's comments come at a time when public opinion of cigarette smoking is at an all-time low. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smoking is responsible for one in five deaths in the United States, making it the leading cause of preventable death.
The CDC also reports that smoking-related illnesses cost the US healthcare system $170 billion per year, with a further $150 billion in lost productivity and other economic costs.
Despite these grim statistics, Butterworth believes that the anti-tobacco lawsuit was a turning point in the fight against smoking.
"We showed the world that if you stay with it and you're courageous, you can make a major impact," he said. "It takes time, it takes money, it takes perseverance, but it was worth it."
Butterworth's comments are a reminder of the importance of holding corporations accountable for their actions. The anti-tobacco lawsuit showed that even the most powerful companies can be brought to justice, and that the truth will eventually come to light.
