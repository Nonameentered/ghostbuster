Documents from the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) have revealed that the company considered adding new ingredients to cigarettes that would boost the nicotine kick for smokers. While the proposed ingredients were not ultimately included in the cigarettes, the revelation has led to concerns about the company's dedication to public health.
The documents were uncovered as part of an ongoing lawsuit against RJR and other tobacco companies by the state of Minnesota. The lawsuit seeks to recover funds spent on treating smoking-related illnesses in the state. Over 1,200 documents were released as part of the lawsuit, detailing the tobacco company's research and development process.
One of the documents, dated from 1983, describes the testing of "flavors that can be added to the tobacco blend to enhance the taste and/or mouthfeel of the product." The document goes on to suggest that some of the flavorings could "enhance the nicotine impact" of the cigarette.
Another document from 1985 discusses the addition of nicotine salts to cigarettes, which could make the nicotine more potent and easier to absorb into the body. The document suggests that the salts would be "desirable from a consumer standpoint in terms of obtaining a more satisfying experience."
It is not clear whether either of these proposed additives were ever added to RJR's cigarettes. However, the company's willingness to consider enhancing the nicotine kick of its products raises concerns about its priorities.
"This is yet another example of tobacco companies putting profits over people's health," said Dan Radly, director of the American Lung Association's tobacco control program. "RJR clearly knew that these additives would increase addiction and harm to smokers, but they didn't care as long as it meant more sales. It's a shameful legacy that continues to this day."
RJR declined to comment specifically on the documents, citing ongoing litigation. However, the company did release a statement reiterating its commitment to public health.
"We have always been committed to providing our consumers with accurate information about our products, and we take seriously our responsibilities for the health and well-being of our customers," the statement read. "We will continue to work with regulators and public health officials to ensure that our products are safe and effective."
Many public health experts remain skeptical of the tobacco industry's commitments to public health. While smoking rates have declined in recent years, tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, responsible for over 7 million deaths annually.
"Big Tobacco has a long history of downplaying the risks of smoking and marketing their products to youth and vulnerable populations," said Dr. Nathaniel Hupert, a public health expert at Weill Cornell Medicine. "We need to hold these companies accountable for the harm they've caused and continue to cause."
The documents from RJR are just the latest in a series of revelations about the tobacco industry's practices. In recent years, tobacco companies have faced criticism for targeting young people with flavored e-cigarettes, hiding evidence of the harms of smoking, and lobbying against public health policies.
Despite this, the tobacco industry remains a powerful force in the global economy, with over $700 billion in revenue in 2019. However, public health advocates are hopeful that increased awareness of the industry's practices will help to push for greater regulation and accountability.
"We need to keep exposing the tobacco industry's dirty secrets and fighting for policies that will reduce smoking and protect public health," said Radly. "It won't be easy, but we have the science and the moral high ground on our side."
