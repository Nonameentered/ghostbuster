In a major victory for class-action lawyers, a federal judge in New York has granted the right to videotape tobacco executives in a lawsuit alleging a conspiracy to hide the dangers of smoking from the public. The decision is expected to have wide-ranging implications for similar lawsuits against the tobacco industry.
The lawsuit in question was brought by a group of smokers who claim that cigarette manufacturers concealed the health risks associated with smoking for decades, while continuing to promote the products through deceptive marketing campaigns. The smokers are seeking damages for medical expenses, lost wages, pain, and suffering, as well as punitive damages against the tobacco companies.
The lawsuit has been working its way through the courts for several years. Earlier this year, the plaintiffs' lawyers filed a motion seeking to videotape depositions of top executives from several tobacco companies, including Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and British American Tobacco. The lawyers argued that videotaping would help to establish the veracity of the executives' testimony, and prevent them from evading difficult questions.
In a written decision on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff granted the motion, citing the importance of the case and the public interest in uncovering the truth about the tobacco industry's actions. Rakoff noted that tobacco companies have a long history of denying the health risks of smoking, and that their executives have been trained to deflect questions about the topic.
"The Court finds that the plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that the testimony of the deponents will be of significant interest to the public and that the proposed videotaping of such testimony is a reasonable means of preserving that interest," Rakoff wrote.
The decision was immediately hailed by attorneys representing the plaintiffs, who said that it represented a significant step forward in their efforts to hold the tobacco industry accountable for its actions. "This ruling is a major victory for the plaintiffs and for anyone who is concerned about the health effects of smoking," said attorney John Coale.
Representatives from the tobacco companies involved in the lawsuit declined to comment on the decision. However, it is widely expected that they will appeal the ruling to a higher court in an attempt to block the videotaping of their executives' depositions.
