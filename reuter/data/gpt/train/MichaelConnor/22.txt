Carnival Corp, the world's largest cruise company, is seeking acquisitions and partnerships to boost the number of passengers on its ships. The company has said that it is looking to expand its fleet and to increase the number of passengers it can accommodate across its brands.
The move comes as the cruise industry recovers from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which caused widespread cancellations and a sharp fall in bookings. Carnival Corp, which owns brands such as Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises and Holland America Line, saw its revenues plunge by over 90% in the first quarter of this year.
However, the company is confident that the demand for cruising will return, and is now looking to position itself for growth. In a recent call with investors, CEO Arnold Donald said that Carnival Corp is "actively searching for strategic acquisitions and partnerships" that would boost its passenger numbers.
"We believe there is significant opportunity for industry consolidation, and we intend to be a major force in that regard," he said. "We want to make sure that we have the right mix of hardware and software to give our guests the best possible experience."
Donald also highlighted the importance of investing in new technology and innovation, to offer passengers more personalized and immersive experiences. Carnival Corp has already made strides in this area, with the launch of its Ocean Medallion wearable technology, which enables guests to access a range of services and amenities throughout their cruise.
In addition to seeking acquisitions and partnerships, Carnival Corp is also focusing on growing its existing brands. The company recently announced plans to add new ships to its Princess Cruises and Holland America Line fleets, and is also investing in upgrades and renovations across its existing vessels.
Despite the challenges of the past year, Donald remains positive about the future of the cruise industry. "We've weathered many storms over the years, and this one is no different. We will emerge from this stronger, and better equipped to meet the needs of our guests and provide the best possible cruising experience," he said.
