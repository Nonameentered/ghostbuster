R.J. Reynolds Executives Considered Adding Additives to Boost Nicotine Kick and Wooing Teenagers
A recent bombshell report revealed that executives at R.J. Reynolds, one of the world's largest tobacco companies, considered adding chemicals to its cigarettes to boost the addictive effects of nicotine, thereby hooking more young people to its products.
According to the report from the New York Times on 26 September 2021, citing internal company documents made public as part of a landmark case in Minnesota, the executives had also gone as far as to brainstorm ways of targeting "underaged or borderline" smokers with advertisements.
This bombshell claim has added to longtime fears regarding the tobacco industry targeting young people, with R.J. Reynolds being named in the public eye as one of the companies that most effectively do this.
Reynolds has long marketed cigarettes and other tobacco products to young people, even continuing to sell candy flavored cigarettes after most other brands withdrew these products from the market under pressure from anti-smoking activists and activists. Cigarettes with fruity or candy flavors have been shown to be particularly attractive to young people.
The company's tactics in pursuit of youth smokers were shocking and aggressive in nature. The reports also revealed that the company had conducted various sampling programs, through partnerships with concert venues, sports leagues, and other youth-orientated events, and even made supplies of its cigarettes available in neighborhood stores as part of what was dubbed "Project SCUM" (Sub Culture Urban Marketing).
The documents also revealed that some employees at RJ Reynolds had named the company's fortified cigarette variety "Kiddie Kandy".
For more than three decades, RJ Reynolds and other tobacco companies told government regulators and the public that they do not purposely use additives to enhance the impact of nicotine. But the documents that were disclosed in court reveal a different story. Some of the cigarette additives that the internal documents showed were considered by RJ Reynolds executives reportedly included caffeine and chocolate.
Thompson Coburn, the law firm representing RJ Reynolds in the Minnesota case, told the New York Times that the company did not use any additives to make cigarettes more addictive and argued that it conducted business in a legal and ethical manner.
However, it is clear that RJ Reynolds has historically involved itself in a number of questionable business practices to appeal to teenage consumers. The scandal over Camel No. 9 cigarettes, marketed to young women with a pink and gold color scheme, is one example. The US Federal Trade Commission also found back in 2008 that RJ Reynolds had deceived customers by advertising its Eclipse line of cigarettes falsely as "risk-free".
RJ Reynolds is one of the largest tobacco firms in the world, marketing brands such as Camel, Winston, and Newport cigarettes. It has faced massive lawsuits in the United States, with 46 states and the District of Columbia coming together to sue the company and four others in the late 1990s. The firms ultimately paid out a multi-billion dollar settlement to the states over the next two decades.
The Minnesota case itself is one of a large number of so-called private company lawsuits targeting the tobacco industry, with plaintiffs arguing that they are bearing the consequences of health problems caused by years of smoking.
The company's history of targeting and attempting to seduce younger smokers is just one more instance of how tobacco companies continue to operate. Despite much progress made worldwide, the industry manipulates the public, hides the truth about its products, and actively encourages young people to smoke. The revelations about RJ Reynolds' internal discussions over additives and targeting of youth are just the latest example of this. The issue highlights the urgent need for governments everywhere to strengthen tobacco control measures, such as advertising restrictions and public health information campaigns, if they are serious about putting an end to the global health problem of tobacco use.
