MCI and British Telecom merger to create powerhouse in international calling and consulting
In a move that is set to revolutionize the telecoms industries on both sides of the Atlantic, MCI and British Telecom (BT) have announced their merger. The two companies will create a powerhouse in international calling and consulting in what is seen as one of the largest and most significant telecommunications deals in history.
The announcement of the merger comes at a time when both companies are facing significant challenges in their respective markets. MCI, formerly known as Worldcom, has struggled to recover from its 2002 accounting scandal, while BT has struggled to maintain its market share in the international calling and consulting sector.
Both companies have a long history in the telecommunications industry, with MCI dating back to the 1960s and BT to the 1980s. The merger of these two telecommunications giants is expected to create a company that is capable of taking on other industry heavyweights such as Verizon and AT&T.
The new company, which will be called MCI-BT, is expected to have a combined revenue of over $70 billion and will employ over 250,000 people worldwide. The merger will also create a number of synergies that will enable the new company to offer a wider range of services at a more competitive price.
Speaking at a press conference to announce the merger, MCI CEO John Sidgmore said: "This is a great day for MCI and BT. We are confident that this merger will create a powerhouse in international calling and consulting that will set new standards in the telecommunications industry."
The merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval in both the US and the UK.
Industry analysts have welcomed the merger, saying that it is a strategic move by both companies to remain competitive in an increasingly crowded and challenging market. The merger will enable MCI-BT to leverage their combined expertise and resources to offer a wider range of services to their customers.
The merger is also expected to have a positive impact on the job market, creating new employment opportunities in the telecommunications sector. The new company is expected to invest in research and development, as well as in expanding its customer base.
However, the merger is not without its challenges. The biggest challenge for MCI-BT will be integrating their two different cultures and management styles. The companies have very different styles of doing business, and it will be important for the new company to find a way to integrate these two styles to ensure the success of the merger.
In addition, the regulatory approval process is likely to be lengthy and complex, given the size and complexity of the deal. The merger will also face significant competition from other industry players, who will be looking to take advantage of any weaknesses that MCI-BT may have.
Despite these challenges, MCI-BT is confident that the merger will be successful. The company has already begun planning for the integration process, and is committed to ensuring that the transition is as smooth as possible for both customers and employees.
The merger of MCI and British Telecom marks a new chapter in the telecoms industry, and is expected to have a significant impact on the sector for years to come. The creation of a new telecommunications powerhouse will enable MCI-BT to compete more effectively in the international calling and consulting sector, and will create new jobs and investment opportunities. The merger is expected to be completed later this year, subject to regulatory approval.
