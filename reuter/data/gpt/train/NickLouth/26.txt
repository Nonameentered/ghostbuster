WorldCom Inc., a US-based telecommunications company, has announced its acquisition of MFS Communications Co Inc for a staggering $14 billion. This acquisition is momentous due to the fact that it makes WorldCom the first company in the United States with end-to-end service in business telecommunications. 
MFS Communications Co Inc was one of the largest and most successful independent telecommunications companies in the United States before the acquisition. The company was founded in 1990 and has been providing telecommunications services to businesses across the country for over a decade. This acquisition by WorldCom, a company founded in 1983, marks a new chapter in their expansion strategy.
According to the CEO of WorldCom, Bernard Ebbers: "This acquisition cements WorldCom's position as the undisputed leader in the US business telecommunications market. Our business customers can now enjoy the convenience and efficiency of end-to-end services available on a single network. With MFS, we get the added advantage of their extensive fiber-optic network infrastructure, which will help us provide a higher level of service to our customers."
WorldCom has been on an expansion spree in the last decade, acquiring a number of companies in the telecommunications space, including MCI Communications, UUNET Technologies and CompuServe. These acquisitions have helped WorldCom become one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, with operations reaching across the United States and beyond.
With this most recent acquisition, WorldCom now has the ability to deliver a complete telecommunications service portfolio to its business customers. This includes local and long-distance voice services, Internet connectivity, data services and colocation services. This will allow WorldCom to better compete with other large telecommunications providers such as AT&T and Sprint, who have also been expanding their services in recent years.
The acquisition of MFS Communications Co Inc will also allow WorldCom to expand its footprint in the United States. MFS's extensive fiber-optic network covers over 40 metropolitan areas across the United States, providing high-speed data and voice services. This network will provide a strong foundation for WorldCom as it expands its services portfolio in the coming years.
WorldCom's acquisition of MFS Communications Co Inc is a clear indication of the company's commitment to expanding its services, and becoming a leader in the telecommunications market. It also shows the importance of having a complete end-to-end service portfolio in the business telecommunications industry.
The acquisition has been met with mixed reactions from the business community. While some have praised WorldCom for its expansion strategy and commitment to providing a complete service portfolio, others have expressed concerns about the impact this acquisition may have on competition within the industry.
Despite the concerns, WorldCom remains committed to ensuring that its customers receive the highest level of service possible. With this acquisition, it is now in a position to deliver a complete end-to-end service portfolio to US-based businesses, making it a major player in the telecommunications market.
