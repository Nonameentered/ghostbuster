London - British Telecom (BT) and MCI Communications (MCI) have agreed to merge in a $20 billion deal that will create a new global telecom giant. In a joint announcement yesterday, the companies said the merger will result in a combined company with the scale and scope to compete effectively in an increasingly global industry.
The merger is also seen as a sign of the growing importance of the telecommunications industry in global commerce, as businesses rely increasingly on telecom services to connect with customers and partners around the world.
"The combination of BT and MCI creates a powerful force in the industry," said Peter Bonfield, BTâ€™s chief executive officer. "It will enable us to deliver breakthrough solutions to meet the growing needs of our customers and the ever-changing landscape of the communications marketplace."
BT and MCI have been in talks for several months, and the announcement was widely expected. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval and is not expected to be completed until late next year.
Under the terms of the deal, BT's shareholders will own 70% of the new company, while MCI's shareholders will own 30%. The new company will be called BT-MCI and will be based in London. WorldCom, MCI's parent company, will retain a 7% stake in the new company.
The merger will create a company with about 180,000 employees, serving customers in more than 100 countries. BT-MCI will offer a full range of services, including local and long-distance telephone service, data transmission, Internet services, and videoconferencing.
The new company will also have a significant presence in the United States, which has become a key market for BT following its acquisition of the wireless provider EE last year. MCI, which was once the second-largest long-distance provider in the US, also has a strong presence in the country.
The merger represents a significant strategic move for BT, which has been investing heavily in expanding its telecom services beyond its traditional core business of fixed-line telephone and broadband services. The company has been looking to expand its wireless and mobile services, as well as its cloud computing and cybersecurity offerings, in order to keep pace with changes in the industry.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Bonfield said that the merger with MCI would "allow us to realise our full potential by creating a new champion in the global telecom market."
BT has also been facing challenges from new competitors, such as Virgin Media and TalkTalk, as well as from traditional rivals like Vodafone, which has been aggressively expanding its own telecom services.
For MCI, the merger with BT represents a chance to recover from a tumultuous few years. The company was once the largest long-distance provider in the US, but it struggled financially in the late 1990s and was eventually acquired by WorldCom. In 2002, WorldCom itself filed for bankruptcy amid a scandal involving accounting fraud.
Since then, MCI has undergone a significant restructuring, shedding assets and rebuilding its business. The company's CEO, Bernard Ebbers, was also convicted in 2005 of securities fraud related to the accounting scandal, although his conviction was later overturned on appeal.
In a statement, Ebbers praised the merger with BT as "a tremendous opportunity for MCI to continue to grow and develop its businesses on a global basis." He also said that the merger would help to "reinvent the possibilities of cross-border communication and collaboration."
The merger is likely to face some regulatory hurdles, particularly in the US, where regulators have expressed concerns about the concentration of telecom services into fewer hands. However, analysts expect that the deal will ultimately be approved, given the strong strategic rationale for the merger.
"We believe that the combination of BT and MCI is a logical and strategically compelling move," said Michael Holland, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. "It creates a formidable global player with a broad range of services and capabilities, and should be well-positioned to compete in an increasingly dynamic and competitive market."
