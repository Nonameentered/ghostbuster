In a move that could have far-reaching implications for the telecom industry, MFS Communications has announced its merger with WorldCom, a giant player in the market, creating a new entity that will cover a much wider range of services and products. While this development is sure to trigger a wave of consolidation in the industry, it may open doors for small resellers to enter the market, driving competition and offering improved services.
The new entity, called MFS WorldCom, will have a significant edge in the market, with over 600,000 customers in 150 countries, employing over 50,000 people. This will make it one of the biggest telecom companies in the world, with a comprehensive range of services, from voice and data communications to value-added services such as e-commerce and content provision.
The merger is expected to provide significant synergies, allowing the new entity to streamline operations and lower costs. This, in turn, will allow the company to offer better services to their customers, creating a robust competitive edge. But the merger also creates an opportunity for small resellers to enter the market and compete with the large telecom companies, offering innovative and niche services and products.
One of the critical drivers of this development is the move towards deregulation in the telecom industry. With many countries opening up their markets to competition, the traditional barriers to entry are breaking down. This is providing an opportunity for small players to enter the market, using their expertise and knowledge to offer specialized services.
For example, there are opportunities for niche service providers that cater to specific industries or types of customers. With more data being generated than ever before, companies that specialize in data management and analysis can find a valuable niche in the market. Similarly, providers that focus on unified communications or video conferencing services can carve out a space for themselves by offering services that are customized and tailored to the needs of their customers.
Another area of opportunity is the provision of local services in regional markets. While MFS WorldCom has a significant global footprint, it may not have the same level of expertise or familiarity with local markets as smaller resellers. This creates an opportunity for local players to offer customized services that cater to the specific needs of customers in their region.
The key to success for small resellers lies in their ability to offer innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of their customers. This means investing in cutting-edge technology that enables them to provide secure, reliable, and scalable solutions that can grow with their customers' requirements.
One advantage that small resellers have over larger players is their ability to respond quickly to emerging trends and technologies. With a smaller organization, they can pivot more quickly to meet the needs of their customers, enabling them to stay ahead of the curve and maintain their competitive edge.
The merger between MFS Communications and WorldCom is a significant development in the telecom industry, creating a formidable player that will drive consolidation and competition. But it also provides an opportunity for small resellers to enter the market and offer specialized services that meet the specific needs of their customers. With the right approach and a focus on innovation and customer centricity, small resellers can carve out a space for themselves in the industry, driving competition and creating value for their customers.
