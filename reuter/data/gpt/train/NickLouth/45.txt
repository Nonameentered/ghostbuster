In a historic move, British Telecom (BT) and MCI Communications (MCI) announced their merger to create a global telecommunications powerhouse valued at $54 billion. The merger plans were announced in a joint statement by the two companies on Tuesday, 2nd September, 1997. The new company, to be called Concert Communications Services, would provide a comprehensive range of voice, data, and internet services to customers in more than 200 countries across the globe.
The merger would bring together two of the world's largest telecommunications companies, with BT being the biggest provider of telecom services in the UK and MCI being one of the largest long-distance carriers in the United States. The deal would also create the world's second-largest multinational telecommunications giant, only slightly behind the US-based AT&T.
The announcement comes as no surprise, as the two companies have been in negotiations for several months. Both companies have been looking to expand their international reach and compete more effectively with other global telecommunications players such as AT&T, Cable and Wireless, and Deutsche Telecom.
The new company would have a total of 2,500 employees and an annual revenue of around $20 billion. It would offer customers a wide range of services, including voice and data services, internet access, and managed network services. The merger would also enable Concert to offer its customers advanced network solutions, such as virtual private networks, multimedia applications, and e-commerce services.
The merger would provide MCI with much-needed access to BT's extensive international network, which covers more than 150 countries. For BT, the merger would provide access to MCI's long-distance network in the US, which covers more than 200 metropolitan areas.
The merger would also enable both companies to achieve cost savings of more than $600 million per year by the year 2001. The cost savings would be achieved through the consolidation of networks, the reduction of duplicate functions, and the elimination of overlapping services. The companies expect to complete the merger by the end of the first quarter of 1998, subject to approval from regulatory authorities in the US and Europe.
The merger would bring significant benefits to customers of both BT and MCI. Concert would be able to offer customers seamless connectivity, improved network reliability, and enhanced service levels. The company would also be better placed to provide global solutions to multinational companies and expand its presence in emerging markets such as Asia and Latin America.
The merger would also provide benefits to shareholders of both companies. The new company would be publicly traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. BT shareholders would receive 74% of the new company, while MCI shareholders would receive 26%.
BT Chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, said "This is a bold and strategic move for BT. By joining forces with MCI, we are creating a powerful global player that can compete with the best in the world. The new company will have unparalleled access to the world's major business centers, providing customers with a seamless range of services that will enhance their productivity and competitiveness."
MCI Chairman, Bert C. Roberts Jr., said, "This is a significant step forward for MCI. By combining our complementary strengths, we are creating a company that will be able to serve the needs of customers around the world. The new company will have the scale and scope to deliver true global solutions, enabling customers to improve their business performance and realize new opportunities."
Industry analysts have welcomed the merger as a significant development in the global telecommunications market. The merged company would be well placed to compete with other global telecommunications giants and would be able to offer customers a comprehensive range of international solutions.
However, some concerns have been raised about potential regulatory hurdles, particularly in the US market, where the merger would create a dominant player in the long-distance telecommunications market. Some experts have suggested that the merger may be subject to conditions imposed by regulatory authorities to ensure fair competition.
Nevertheless, the merger between BT and MCI is seen as a positive step towards creating a truly global telecommunications market. The new company would be well placed to offer customers innovative solutions that would enhance their business performance and provide new opportunities for growth. With the merger expected to be completed by early 1998, the new company is set for an exciting future in the fast-paced world of telecommunications.
