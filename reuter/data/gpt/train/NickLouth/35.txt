BT and MCI Communications Corp have announced that they have agreed on a $22 billion merger in what is being described as a historic move that will create an international business giant. The deal is set to see BT acquire MCI in what will be one of the largest telecoms mergers in history.
The move is expected to create a powerful force in the international telecoms market. The merger is set to strengthen BT's position in the US market, where MCI is currently one of the leading players. It also gives BT the opportunity to expand its global reach, with access to MCI's extensive network and expertise in international voice and data services.
BT and MCI's decision to merge has been seen as a response to the changing nature of the telecoms industry. The market has seen a shift away from traditional voice services towards data-based services such as cloud computing and mobile connectivity. The merger is set to enable the two companies to pool their resources and expertise in order to better compete in this evolving market.
The deal was initially announced in March 1997, with the two companies agreeing on a share exchange that valued MCI at $41.50 a share. However, the completion of the merger was delayed by a number of regulatory hurdles and legal challenges.
The merger process was also complicated by the involvement of WorldCom, who made a rival bid for MCI in July 1997. WorldCom's bid was initially rejected, but the company eventually won out after a protracted and acrimonious battle.
Despite the challenges, BT and MCI have remained committed to completing the merger. The two companies have worked closely together over the past several months to overcome any obstacles and ensure that the deal goes ahead.
Commenting on the announcement, BT's CEO, Sir Peter Bonfield, said: "This is a historic moment for BT. The merger with MCI will create a formidable force in the international telecoms market, with the ability to offer our customers a truly global service."
He added: "We are excited about the opportunities that this merger will bring. With MCI's expertise in international voice and data services, combined with our own strengths in network infrastructure and customer service, we believe that we will be well positioned to provide our customers with the innovative and high-quality services they demand."
The merger is also being welcomed by the industry as a whole. Analysts have noted that the deal is a testament to the growing importance of both the US and the global telecoms market, and demonstrate the potential for further consolidation in the industry.
The merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. However, both companies have expressed confidence that the deal will go ahead as planned.
The news of the merger has already had an impact on the stock markets, with both BT and MCI's share prices rising following the announcement. The deal is also expected to have a broader impact on the telecoms industry, with other companies likely to take note of the potential benefits of closer collaboration and consolidation.
Overall, the merger between BT and MCI is being hailed as a significant move that will create a major player in the international telecoms market. With the two companies combining their strengths and expertise, there is likely to be a renewed focus on innovation and customer service, delivering benefits to customers across the globe.
