Today, AT&T announced that it has elected John Walter as its new president and Chief Operating Officer (COO), making him the heir apparent to Chairman Robert Allen. Walter's appointment comes amid a period of transformation for the telecommunications giant, as it seeks to expand beyond traditional phone services and into digital media and entertainment.
"I am thrilled to welcome John to our team," said Allen in a statement. "He brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of success to AT&T. I am confident that he will help us continue to drive innovation, growth, and value for our customers, shareholders, and employees."
Walter, who previously served as CEO of American Standard Companies, a global manufacturer of plumbing and building products, is no stranger to large-scale corporate transformations. During his tenure at American Standard, he streamlined operations, divested non-core businesses, and developed new growth opportunities, positioning the company for long-term success.
"I am honored to join AT&T, a company with a rich history of innovation and a bright future ahead," said Walter. "I look forward to working alongside the talented team here to drive growth and build on the great work that has already been done."
As president and COO, Walter will be responsible for overseeing AT&T's day-to-day operations, including its mobile, broadband, and video businesses, as well as its corporate strategy and technology development. He will also serve as the company's second-in-command, reporting directly to Allen and working closely with AT&T's other senior leaders.
"John's leadership, strategic vision, and operational expertise make him the ideal person to lead our company forward," said Allen. "He has a deep understanding of the telecommunications industry and a proven ability to drive transformational change. I am confident that he will help us navigate the opportunities and challenges ahead as we continue to grow and evolve."
Walter's appointment comes at a pivotal time for AT&T, which has been undergoing a major transformation in recent years. The company has been investing heavily in digital media and entertainment, acquiring media conglomerate Time Warner in 2018 and launching its streaming platform, HBO Max, last year.
These moves have positioned AT&T as a major player in the streaming space, but they have also caused the company's debt to soar. As of the end of 2020, AT&T had a total debt load of over $169 billion, making it one of the most indebted companies in the world.
In response, the company has been taking steps to streamline operations, reduce costs, and pay down debt. Last year, it announced plans to sell off non-core assets, including its DirecTV satellite television business, and to cut thousands of jobs.
Walter's appointment is seen as a continuation of these efforts, as he brings a wealth of experience in restructuring and streamlining businesses. During his tenure at American Standard, he oversaw a major restructuring that resulted in the sale of several non-core brands and the elimination of thousands of jobs.
"I think John is an excellent choice for the job," said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in an interview with CNBC. "He has experience in a variety of industries, he has experience transforming businesses, and he has experience creating value for shareholders."
Walter's appointment has also been praised by industry experts and investors, who see it as a sign of stability and continuity at the top of AT&T's leadership team. Since Allen announced his plans to retire in 2022, there has been speculation about who would succeed him as chairman and CEO.
With Walter now in place as the heir apparent, investors are likely to be more confident in AT&T's long-term prospects. The company's stock price rose slightly in early trading following the announcement of Walter's appointment.
Overall, Walter's appointment as president and COO is a positive development for AT&T and its shareholders. His experience and leadership skills are likely to be instrumental in driving the company's growth and navigating the challenges ahead. With his appointment, AT&T is well-positioned to continue its transformation into a leading player in the digital media and entertainment space.
