MCI Communications Corp. has announced that it is severing ties with media magnate Rupert Murdoch and is seeking new partnerships in the Asian telecommunications market.
The decision comes after a long-standing relationship between MCI and Murdoch's News Corporation, which first began when MCI provided telecom services to Murdoch's media empire. However, recent events have caused MCI to rethink its partnership with News Corp.
In particular, there have been concerns about the reputational damage caused by the ongoing phone-hacking scandal in the UK that implicates News Corp's subsidiary, News International. MCI's decision to cut ties with News Corp is seen as a way of distancing itself from any negative fallout from the scandal.
Speaking about the decision, MCI CEO Tom Casey said, "We have enjoyed a fruitful partnership with News Corp over the years, but recent events have caused us to re-examine that relationship. Our focus now is on building new partnerships in Asia, which we see as a growth market for telecommunications and related services."
Casey went on to say that MCI was already in talks with several potential partners in the Asian market, including several large telecoms operators based in China and India. "We are confident that we can find the right partners who share our vision for growth and innovation in this exciting and rapidly expanding market," he said.
The move is seen as a strategic shift for MCI, which has been focused primarily on the North American market for many years. However, with the growth of emerging markets such as China and India, and the increasing importance of the Asian region to the global economy, MCI sees this as a crucial area for expansion.
The decision to cut ties with News Corp is also seen as a reflection of the changing media landscape, where traditional media companies are increasingly being eclipsed by new digital players. MCI sees this as an opportunity to partner with companies that are at the forefront of technological innovation, and that can help it to build new products and services that meet the needs of a rapidly evolving market.
Meanwhile, the announcement has been met with mixed reactions from industry analysts. Some have praised MCI's move as a smart strategy that will help it to diversify its revenue streams and expand into new markets. Others, however, have criticized the decision as short-sighted, arguing that News Corp's media assets could have provided valuable cross-promotion opportunities for MCI.
It remains to be seen how the decision will affect News Corp, which has been struggling with declining revenues in recent years. The company has been under pressure from investors to find new sources of growth, and the loss of its partnership with MCI could be a blow to its plans.
However, News Corp has also been making its own moves into the telecommunications market, with the recent acquisition of UK-based telecoms provider Sky. This move could help to offset the loss of its relationship with MCI, and could even lead to new opportunities for cooperation in the future.
Overall, the decision by MCI to cut ties with Rupert Murdoch and seek new partnerships in the Asian telecommunications market is a bold move that reflects the rapidly changing landscape of media and technology. While there are risks associated with any major shift in strategy, the potential rewards of tapping into the fast-growing Asian market are clear. As MCI continues its search for new partners, the telecoms industry will be watching closely to see who it chooses to team up with.
