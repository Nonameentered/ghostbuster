AT&T Recruits Relative Unknown to Turn Company Around
AT&T, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, has announced the hiring of a new CEO. John Stankey, a relatively unknown executive who has spent more than three decades at the company, will take over as CEO effective July 1, 2020. 
The decision to hire Stankey came after a long search for a new CEO by the AT&T board of directors. The company has been facing increasing pressure from investors to turn things around and improve its performance. AT&T has been struggling to compete with rivals like Verizon and T-Mobile, and has faced criticism for its handling of its recent acquisition of Time Warner. 
Stankey, who has been with the company since 1985, has held a number of different positions over the years. He most recently served as the CEO of WarnerMedia, the entertainment and media division of AT&T that includes brands like HBO, CNN, and Warner Bros. Under his leadership, WarnerMedia launched its streaming service, HBO Max, which has been well-received by consumers and industry experts. 
Despite his success at WarnerMedia, Stankey will face significant challenges as the new CEO of AT&T. The company has struggled with declining revenue and profits in recent years. It has also faced criticism for its spending on acquisitions, including the $85 billion purchase of Time Warner in 2018. 
In a statement, Stankey acknowledged the company's challenges and said he is focused on turning things around. "AT&T is a great company with a rich history and a strong commitment to innovation and customer service," he said. "I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this extraordinary organization and to work with our talented team to deliver value to our customers and shareholders." 
Stankey's appointment has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts and analysts. Some have praised the move as a bold and decisive move by the company to shake things up and bring in fresh leadership. Others have been more skeptical, questioning whether Stankey has the experience and expertise needed to turn around such a large and complex organization. 
"John Stankey is an excellent executive, but he has a tough job ahead of him," said Craig Moffett, an analyst at research firm MoffettNathanson. "AT&T is one of the largest and most complex companies in the world, with a lot of moving parts and a difficult competitive environment. It's not going to be easy to turn things around." 
Despite the challenges, there are some signs of hope for AT&T. The company still has a large and loyal customer base, and it has been investing heavily in new technologies and services like 5G wireless and streaming video. It also has a strong balance sheet and cash flow, which should give Stankey some flexibility to make strategic investments and acquisitions. 
One area where Stankey may focus his attention is AT&T's wireless business, which has been under pressure from rivals like Verizon and T-Mobile. The company has been losing subscribers in recent years, and its network has been criticized for its reliability and speed. 
To address these issues, AT&T has been investing in upgrading its network and expanding its coverage. It has also been rolling out new services like unlimited data plans and 5G wireless. These efforts have helped to stop the bleeding when it comes to subscriber losses, but there is still a long way to go before the company can regain its position as the leader in wireless. 
Another area where Stankey may focus his attention is AT&T's streaming video business. The company has invested heavily in the space, but it has faced stiff competition from established players like Netflix and new entrants like Disney+. AT&T's streaming service, HBO Max, has seen strong initial growth, but it still lags behind competitors in terms of subscribers. 
To boost its streaming business, AT&T may need to invest in original content and exclusive deals with content providers. It could also look to bundle its streaming service with other services like wireless and home broadband, in an effort to create a more compelling offering for consumers. 
Overall, the appointment of John Stankey as CEO of AT&T comes at a critical time for the company. He will need to move quickly to address the company's challenges and demonstrate his ability to lead such a large and complex organization. AT&T investors and customers will be watching closely to see if he can deliver the results they are looking for.
