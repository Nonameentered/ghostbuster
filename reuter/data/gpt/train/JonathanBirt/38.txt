Budgens Plc, a leading British supermarket chain, has announced its plans to expand its presence on petrol station forecourts by opening 10 new stores in 1997. The move is aimed at increasing their reach and competitiveness in the retail market. 
According to the company, the new petrol station stores will be opened in strategic locations across the country, creating over 200 new jobs. The expansion will also allow Budgens to explore new markets and attract more customers.
Budgens is known for offering quality products at affordable prices. The company has been operating for over 150 years and has built a loyal customer base. With this expansion, they are set to further strengthen their brand and reputation.
The CEO of Budgens, John Doe, said, “We are excited to be opening 10 new stores and expanding our reach on petrol station forecourts. We are committed to providing high-quality products and excellent customer service. This move will allow us to reach even more customers and continue to grow our business.”
The expansion will see Budgens compete with other leading supermarket chains like Tesco and Sainsbury’s, which have also established a presence on petrol station forecourts. The move is expected to provide stiff competition in the market, ultimately benefitting customers with better value and more choices.
