Milumil baby milk powder has been withdrawn from sale in the UK's stores and clinics after a Salmonella scare. The move came after a baby who was fed Milumil Formula milk was diagnosed with salmonella infection in France.
Milumil's parent company, Danone has taken the decision to withdraw the product as a "precautionary measure" following a warning from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which said that there was a "possible link" between the baby's illness and the formula.
The EFSA has also said that there have been two other cases of salmonella infections that could be linked to Milumil products.
Danone said it was "working closely with local authorities and stakeholders to investigate the issue and will inform our customers and consumers of any developments."
The company said it had also taken the decision to withdraw the product voluntarily as a "precautionary measure."
"We would like to reassure our customers that the quality and safety of all of our products is our top priority and we are doing everything we can to ensure the highest standard of safety and quality," the company said in a statement.
The Milumil brand is widely available in the UK, including at major retailers such as Tesco and Boots. The product comes in a range of powdered formulas.
Parents have been urged to check their cupboards for any Milumil baby milk powder products and to stop using them if they have any.
Salmonella is a bacterial infection that can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. It can be particularly dangerous for babies and young children.
According to the NHS, parents should seek medical advice if their child has symptoms of salmonella, such as fever and diarrhea.
The recall is the latest in a series of food-safety scares in the UK, including a recall of pork and poultry products in November 2019 because of salmonella contamination.
Danone has said that it will reimburse customers who have bought Milumil products, and that it is working to ensure that the product will be available again as soon as possible."We will keep our customers informed of any developments," the company said.
