London- Celltech Group Plc, a British multinational biopharmaceutical company, is set to launch two lead drugs as it plans to turn a profit in 1998.
According to the company's annual report published on Friday, the two drugs, CDP870 and CDP571, have entered the late-stage trial phase and are expected to receive regulatory approvals in the coming months.
CDP870, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, has shown positive results in Phase III trials and has been granted fast-track status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The drug is expected to generate $500 million in annual sales.
CDP571, a treatment for Crohn's disease, has also shown promising results in Phase III clinical trials, with a potential market size of $1 billion per year.
"We are excited to bring these two drugs to market, and we expect them to be game-changers in their respective disease areas," said Peter Fellner, CEO of Celltech Group Plc.
The company has invested heavily in research and development in recent years, with a focus on developing innovative drugs for unmet medical needs. The investment seems to have yielded positive results, with the company now poised for a profitable year.
"We have a strong pipeline of products, and we are confident that we can continue to deliver growth and value to our shareholders," Fellner added.
Analysts have welcomed the news, with many predicting that the launch of the two lead drugs could increase the company's stock value by 20% in 1998.
"This is a very positive development for Celltech Group Plc. The company has been investing heavily in research and development, and it's good to see that their efforts are paying off," said John Smith, an analyst at Barclay's Capital.
"The launch of CDP870 and CDP571 will provide a significant boost to the company's revenue and profits, and we expect to see a strong performance in the coming years," he added.
Celltech Group Plc has a strong presence in the European and US markets, with a portfolio of innovative products in several therapeutic areas, including oncology, immunology, and neurology.
The company has also recently acquired several small biotech firms to complement its existing product portfolio and enhance its R&D capabilities.
"We are committed to improving the lives of patients around the world, and we believe that our innovative products will make a significant impact in the healthcare industry," said Fellner.
The launch of the two lead drugs is expected to be a major milestone for Celltech Group Plc, as the company continues to expand its footprint in the global biopharmaceutical market.
