Imperial Tobacco has made a major acquisition by purchasing Rizla International BV, the world's largest handrolling tobacco papers maker, for a reported Â£168m. This acquisition will bring together two of the most recognizable names in the smoking industry, and is expected to strengthen Imperial's position in the tobacco market.
Rizla International BV, based in Amsterdam, has been producing high-quality rolling papers for over 400 years. The company's papers are used by smokers worldwide, and are known for their consistent quality and easy rolling characteristics.
Imperial Tobacco, one of the largest tobacco producers in the world, will gain access to Rizla's extensive distribution network and customer base. The acquisition will also provide Imperial with greater control over the production of its tobacco products, and the ability to create new and innovative smoking products.
In a statement, Imperial Tobacco CEO Alison Cooper said, "This acquisition is an excellent strategic fit for Imperial Tobacco. Rizla International BV is a highly respected brand with a loyal customer base, and their rolling papers are widely regarded as the best in the world."
The acquisition is expected to be completed in the coming months, subject to regulatory approval. Once completed, Imperial Tobacco will assume control of Rizla International BV's operations, including manufacturing facilities and distribution channels.
This acquisition comes at a time when the tobacco industry is evolving rapidly. Regulatory pressures have increased, and companies are working to adapt to changing consumer preferences. Imperial's move to purchase Rizla is seen by many as a sign of the company's commitment to staying relevant and competitive in a rapidly changing market.
Industry experts are eager to see what new products Imperial Tobacco will develop using Rizla's handrolling papers. With the acquisition, Imperial will have access to one of the most respected and well-known brands in the industry, and will be able to leverage Rizla's expertise in rolling paper production to develop innovative new smoking products.
Despite the challenges facing the tobacco industry, Imperial Tobacco's acquisition of Rizla International BV is a clear sign that the company is committed to maintaining its position as a leader in the market. With this acquisition, Imperial is poised to take advantage of new opportunities and ensure its continued growth and success.
