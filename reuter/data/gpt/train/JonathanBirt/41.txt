Milumil Babymilk Powder Withdrawn in UK and Ireland Over Salmonella Scare
Milupa, the manufacturer of Milumil babymilk powder, has announced that it is voluntarily recalling all of its products in the UK and Ireland following concerns that they may be contaminated with salmonella.
The recall affects all batches of Milumil babymilk powder that are currently on the market in the UK and Ireland. The company has advised consumers to stop using the product immediately and return any unused packets to the store where they purchased them. Retailers have also been instructed to remove all Milumil products from their shelves.
The recall was initiated after tests carried out by Milupa revealed the presence of salmonella in the product. Salmonella is a bacteria that can cause food poisoning in humans, and can be particularly dangerous to young children and babies, whose immune systems are still developing.
In a statement, Milupa apologised to parents for any inconvenience caused by the recall, and advised that parents who are concerned about their baby's health should contact a healthcare professional.
"We apologise to parents for any inconvenience caused by this recall, but the safety of our customers is our top priority. We are conducting a full investigation into the cause of the contamination, and working closely with the relevant authorities to ensure that all necessary action is taken. We advise parents not to use any Milumil babymilk powder that they may have purchased, and to return it to the store for a full refund."
Milupa has also set up a helpline for concerned parents, which can be reached at 0800 977 8888.
The recall has been welcomed by parent groups, who have praised the company for taking swift action to protect the health of young children.
"We are pleased to see that Milupa is taking this issue seriously, and has acted quickly to withdraw its products from the market," said a spokesperson for the National Childbirth Trust. "Parents can be reassured that the company is doing everything it can to ensure that its products are safe to use."
The recall is a reminder of the importance of food safety, particularly when it comes to products that are intended for young children and babies. Parents are advised to check the packaging of any babymilk powder they have purchased, and to discontinue use immediately if they suspect that it may be contaminated.
