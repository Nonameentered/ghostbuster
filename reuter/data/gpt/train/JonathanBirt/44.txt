Cambridge, UK — The biotech industry in Cambridge is set to receive a major boost, as two of its leading firms — Cambridge Antibody Technology Group and Bioscience Innovation Centre — have announced plans to go public.
Cambridge Antibody Technology Group, a pioneer in the development of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic applications, said it would file an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange, hoping to raise £200 million ($267.4 million). The company has been backed by investors for years, but intends to use the IPO to fund further growth.
"We have an exciting pipeline of new products that we believe will transform the lives of many patients around the world," said Jane Osbourn, the company's CEO. "Going public will allow us to invest in our research and development and bring our innovations to market faster."
Meanwhile, Bioscience Innovation Centre, a startup that specializes in developing gene therapies for rare diseases, plans to go public on the Nasdaq exchange in the US. The company hopes to raise $150 million through the IPO, which it will use to fund clinical trials for its therapies.
"We have made significant progress in our research and have shown promising results in preclinical studies," said Sarah Jackson, the CEO of Bioscience Innovation Centre. "Going public will allow us to take our therapies to the next level and bring hope to patients suffering from rare genetic diseases."
The two firms are part of the vibrant biotech industry in Cambridge, which has become a hub for innovation in the life sciences. The city is home to a number of top research institutions, including the University of Cambridge, and has attracted a growing number of investors in recent years.
The announcement of the IPOs has been welcomed by industry experts, who say it is an indication of the strength and potential of the biotech industry in Cambridge.
"The fact that both Cambridge Antibody Technology Group and Bioscience Innovation Centre are going public is a clear sign that there is a lot of optimism in the industry," said Andrew MacDonald, an analyst at Investec. "These are two of the top companies in their fields, and their success will encourage others to invest in the sector."
The IPOs are expected to take place in the coming months, subject to regulatory approvals.
