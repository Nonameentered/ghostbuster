Through these partnerships, Ford has made it possible for consumers to access its vehicles, financing options, and other services through these stores. This is a strategic move that allows Ford to tap into the existing infrastructure and customer base of these auto superstores, thereby extending the reach of the brand and increasing customer acquisition.
