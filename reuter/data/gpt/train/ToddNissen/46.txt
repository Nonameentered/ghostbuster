As we approach the end of the year, analysts are predicting a drop in December light vehicle sales. However, despite this minor setback, the automotive industry is on track to meet projections for 2021.
According to Edmunds, December sales are expected to be down by 12.3% compared to the same period in 2020. This can largely be attributed to the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, which has forced automakers to cut production and limit their supply.
The shortage has also had a significant impact on the prices of vehicles, with the average transaction price for a new car hitting a record high of $46,989 in November, according to Kelley Blue Book. This has led to a drop in demand for new vehicles, as consumers are opting to hold onto their existing cars for longer periods of time.
Despite these challenges, there is reason for optimism within the industry. Overall, light vehicle sales for the year are expected to reach 15.7 million units, which is only a slight decrease from 2020 figures.
This is due in part to the continued popularity of trucks and SUVs, which have remained in high demand throughout the pandemic. In fact, trucks and SUVs collectively make up 72% of total vehicle sales in the United States.
Furthermore, a number of new electric and hybrid vehicles are set to hit the market in 2022, which is expected to drive sales and further the transition away from traditional combustion engines.
One company that is well-positioned to take advantage of this shift is Tesla. The electric carmaker has seen tremendous growth over the past year, with sales increasing by 60% in the third quarter of 2021.
Tesla's success has been due in part to its focus on innovation and technology, which has allowed the company to stay ahead of the curve and differentiate itself in a crowded marketplace. Its new Model Y SUV and Cybertruck are set to hit the market in 2022, which are expected to continue the trend of strong sales growth.
Another factor that has helped the automotive industry weather supply chain disruptions is the use of digital tools and platforms to facilitate sales. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of online car buying platforms, which have made it easier for consumers to shop for cars from the comfort of their own homes.
This trend is expected to continue well into 2022 and beyond, as more and more consumers become comfortable with buying cars online and automakers invest in digital solutions to better serve their customers.
Finally, the Biden administration's infrastructure bill provides a massive boost for the auto industry. The bill includes a $7.5 billion investment in electric vehicle infrastructure, which will help drive the transition to cleaner transportation options and boost consumer confidence in electric and hybrid vehicles.
Despite the challenges posed by the semiconductor shortage and price increases, the automotive industry remains on track to meet projections for the year. With a focus on innovation and technology, continued demand for trucks and SUVs, and the development of new electrified vehicles, the industry is poised for continued growth and success in 2022 and beyond.
