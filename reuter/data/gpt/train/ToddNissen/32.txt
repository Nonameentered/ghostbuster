Chrysler has appealed the California Department of Motor Vehicles' (DMV) ban on shipping new vehicles to the state for alleged violations of the "lemon law," which requires manufacturers to replace or refund defective vehicles.
The ban, which was issued in October 2021, prevents Chrysler from delivering new vehicles to California until the automaker complies with the state's regulations. The California DMV claimed that Chrysler failed to meet the lemon law's requirements, particularly with regard to replacing or refunding defective cars.
The automaker, however, has denied any wrongdoing and believes that it has complied with the state's regulations. According to a statement released by Chrysler, "We strongly believe that our actions have been in compliance with state law, and we are committed to resolving this issue."
Chrysler argues that the DMV's ban could harm both the automaker and its customers. The company claims that the ban could lead to delays in delivering new vehicles and could cause customers to shop elsewhere for cars, ultimately hurting Chrysler's business in California.
The ban also affects other vehicle manufacturers as well, as the state's DMV regulated all manufacturers that did not meet the lemon law requirements. This list includes 32 automakers that must comply with the state's regulations and prove that they have replaced or refunded defective vehicles before delivering them to California.
California has some of the most stringent lemon laws in the country, which allows consumers to seek replacement or refunds for new vehicles that have substantial defects or malfunctions. The laws also provide safeguards that ensure that consumers receive adequate compensation, which has overall led to less consumer complaints and increased customer satisfaction.
However, some automakers have argued that stricter lemon laws hurt their businesses and force them to take more time and money to replace or refund defective vehicles. Some have called for a federal unified lemon law to replace state-by-state regulations.
Chrysler's appeal will likely go before a judge, who will determine if the DMV's ban stands. The automaker claims that it is committed to resolving the issue and delivering high-quality vehicles to its customers in California and around the country. "We remain committed to providing high-quality vehicles to our customers in California and beyond," the company said in a statement.
