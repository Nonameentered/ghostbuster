Chrysler Considering Extension of Car Production Agreement with Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
Detroit, Michigan – Chrysler is reportedly considering extending its car production agreement with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. The two companies currently have a joint venture in which Chrysler manufactures Mitsubishi-branded vehicles in the US.
According to sources familiar with the matter, the companies are in negotiations to extend the agreement beyond its current end date in 2021. There have been no official announcements yet, but insiders say that the talks have been positive so far.
The joint venture began in 2014 when Mitsubishi was struggling with sales in the US market. Chrysler offered to build vehicles for Mitsubishi at its factory in Illinois, which had excess capacity at the time. The agreement allowed Mitsubishi to enter the US market with its Outlander Sport SUV, which was produced at the Illinois plant.
Since then, the joint venture has been a success for both companies. Mitsubishi’s US sales have steadily risen since 2014, thanks in part to the Outlander Sport’s popularity. The vehicle has been a strong performer in the small SUV segment, and has helped Mitsubishi gain market share against its competitors.
Meanwhile, Chrysler has benefited from the production of the Outlander Sport. The vehicle has helped the Illinois plant maintain high utilization rates, increasing efficiency and reducing costs for the automaker. The joint venture has been a win-win for both companies, and an extension of the agreement would be beneficial for all parties involved.
The extension talks come at a time when both companies are facing challenges in the US market. Chrysler’s sales have been declining in recent years, as consumers shift towards SUVs and crossovers. Mitsubishi, on the other hand, is facing increased competition in the small SUV segment, with rivals such as Honda, Toyota, and Ford all vying for market share.
An extension of the joint venture could help both companies overcome these challenges. Mitsubishi could continue to benefit from Chrysler’s production capabilities, while Chrysler could use the joint venture to expand its product lineup with more SUVs and crossovers. A continued partnership could also help both companies reduce costs by sharing development and manufacturing expenses.
The extension talks are also a sign of the growing partnership between Chrysler’s parent company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), and Mitsubishi’s parent company, Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Alliance. FCA and Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi have been collaborating on several projects, including the development of electric cars and autonomous vehicles. An extension of the joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi would further strengthen this partnership, and could result in more joint projects down the line.
Overall, an extension of the car production agreement between Chrysler and Mitsubishi would be a positive development for both companies. The joint venture has been successful thus far, and an extension would allow both companies to continue to benefit from each other’s strengths. As negotiations continue, industry insiders will be watching closely to see what comes out of the talks.
