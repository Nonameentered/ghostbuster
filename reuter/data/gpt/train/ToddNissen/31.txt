Detroit, Michigan - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched an investigation into Chrysler minivans after a number of reports of sudden rear hatch closures and flying side doors.
The investigation covers around 1.2 million Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans manufactured between 2013 and 2017. The agency has received 45 complaints about rear hatch closures and 58 reports of side doors suddenly opening while the vehicles were in motion.
“The sudden closure of the rear hatch or opening of the side door could result in serious injury or even death,” the NHTSA said in its report.
The agency said it is “evaluating the scope, frequency, and safety consequences” of the issue, and has yet to determine whether a recall will be issued. Chrysler has not yet released a statement on the investigation.
The issue has long been a concern for Chrysler minivan owners. One such owner, Tammy Parks of Tyler, Texas, said her 2015 Dodge Grand Caravan’s rear hatch suddenly closed while she was loading groceries into the back of the vehicle.
“I was standing right there when it happened,” Parks said. “The hatch just came down on its own. If I had been inside the car, it could have hit me on the head and caused serious injury.”
Another owner, Chris Martinez of Phoenix, Arizona, said his wife was driving their 2016 Chrysler Town & Country when the side door suddenly opened while they were on the highway.
“It was pretty scary,” Martinez said. “We were driving and all of a sudden the door just flew open. We had to pull over and close it.”
The issue is not unique to Chrysler minivans. In 2016, Ford issued a recall for 830,000 vehicles after reports that their side doors could open while the vehicle was in motion. The recall covered vehicles including the Ford C-Max, Escape, Focus, and Transit Connect.
The NHTSA advises owners of affected Chrysler minivans to be cautious when closing the rear hatch or side doors, and to have their vehicles inspected by a Chrysler dealership if they experience any issues.
Although the investigation is still ongoing, the potential consequences of this issue are significant and could result in serious injury or death. It is important for Chrysler to act quickly and proactively address any issues to ensure the safety of their customers.
