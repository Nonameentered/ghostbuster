Haworth, a leading furniture manufacturer, has won a $211.5 million patent infringement award against rival Steelcase Inc. after a lengthy legal battle lasting 17 years.
The dispute began in 2004 when Haworth accused Steelcase of violating one of its patents for office furniture. Specifically, Haworth had claimed that Steelcase's Leap and Think chairs contained seating mechanisms that infringed on its patent.
The case was initially heard in a federal district court in Michigan, where Haworth is based. However, after a jury found in favor of the company, Steelcase appealed the decision. The case was subsequently heard by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, where Steelcase continued to contest the infringement claims.
After years of legal wrangling, a final decision was reached earlier this week. The Federal Circuit upheld the original jury verdict and awarded Haworth the massive sum of $211.5 million in damages.
In a statement, Haworth CEO Franco Bianchi praised the court's decision. He said that the company was "pleased to have prevailed in this long-standing litigation and to have our intellectual property rights affirmed."
Bianchi went on to add that the outcome was a testament to the company's commitment to innovation and to protecting its intellectual property. "We will continue to invest in creating innovative and differentiated products to meet the diverse needs of our customers," he said.
Meanwhile, Steelcase expressed disappointment with the court's decision. In a statement, the company said that it was still reviewing the ruling and considering its options.
"We believe the verdict is not supported by the evidence presented at trial," the company said in the statement. "We remain committed to creating innovative products and respecting the intellectual property rights of others."
The hefty damages award is likely to have a significant impact on Steelcase's financial performance. The company reported revenues of $3.5 billion in its most recent fiscal year, but it is not clear how much of that revenue is linked to the Leap and Think chairs at the center of the lawsuit.
For Haworth, the victory is a major milestone in its ongoing battle to protect its intellectual property. The company has been vocal about its belief that the design features in question are crucial to the functionality and comfort of its office chairs.
The dispute between the two companies has also highlighted the legal complexities of patent infringement cases, which can be notoriously difficult to prove and can involve years of costly litigation. Nevertheless, Haworth's victory is likely to serve as a cautionary tale to other companies considering whether to infringe on its patents in the future.
