General Motors Corp. (GM) has reportedly found a potential buyer for four of its parts plants. The sale of the plants could help GM streamline its operations and focus on the production of electric vehicles.
According to sources familiar with the matter, holding company, The Firm, has submitted a bid for the four plants. The Firm, which is owned by a wealthy investor, has been acquiring distressed companies in the automotive and aerospace industries with the goal of turning them into profitable businesses.
The four parts plants involved in the potential sale are all located in the United States. The facilities manufacture a range of components, including steering systems, transmission parts, and fuel modules.
GM has been looking to unload the plants as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts. The automaker has been streamlining its operations and cutting costs in order to invest more in electric and autonomous vehicle technology.
The sale of the parts plants would help GM focus on key strategic areas while also generating cash that could be used to pay down debt or finance other investments.
If the sale goes through, The Firm would acquire all four plants and their assets. It's unclear how much the firm bid for the assets or what the terms of the deal would be.
The sale of the plants could impact thousands of workers. The facilities employ around 3,600 workers in total, with the largest plant employing around 1,600 workers.
GM has already announced plans to shutter several other plants in the U.S. as part of its restructuring efforts. The facilities being closed are mostly focused on the production of traditional gas-powered vehicles, which GM is moving away from as it focuses more on electric and self-driving cars.
The potential sale of the parts plants is just one part of GM's broader restructuring efforts. The automaker is also investing heavily in electric and autonomous vehicle technology, with plans to launch around 30 new electric vehicles by 2025.
If the sale goes through, it would be a major milestone for The Firm and its owner, who has been steadily acquiring distressed businesses in the automotive and aerospace industries. The bid also gives hope to GM that it is well poised to spark tremendous growth by divesting itself of some of its assets.
