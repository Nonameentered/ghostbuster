A gunman opened fire in a Ford plant in the city of Detroit, leaving one person dead and two others injured. The incident occurred on Friday morning, causing chaos and panic among workers at the facility.
According to the police, the shooter was a 45-year-old man who entered the plant armed with a pistol and began firing at random. He targeted several individuals before being subdued by vengeful co-workers.
The police arrived soon after and arrested the shooter, who was later identified as a former Ford employee. Motives for the attack remain unclear, with some speculations pointing to possible disgruntlement with his employment situation.
The shooting spree took place on the plant's assembly line, where workers were busy building cars. The gunman reportedly shot at three people before being tackled by co-workers. The aftershocks of the event were felt throughout the facility, with some workers taking cover under the stalled assembly line equipment.
Police and emergency services arrived on the scene to find a chaotic setting with several people injured. The gunman was subdued and taken into police custody, but not before seriously injured two other people.
Authorities have confirmed that one of the victims, also a former employee at the plant, died of their injuries. The other two were rushed to the hospital with gunshot wounds to their legs. All three victims are said to have been in their mid-30s.
