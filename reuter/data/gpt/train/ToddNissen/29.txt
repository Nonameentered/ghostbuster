Detroit, Michigan - The Chrysler Corporation recently found itself in hot water again as safety regulators launched an investigation into potential issues with the automaker's popular minivans. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has received complaints from consumers alleging that the hatch and sliding doors on Chrysler minivans can spontaneously open while the vehicle is in motion.
The NHTSA has received at least 45 complaints about the issue so far, with some alleging that the doors opened while the vehicle was on the highway. The regulator has also received reports of injuries and near-misses caused by the malfunctioning doors.
Chrysler, now part of the Stellantis NV automaker group, previously faced similar safety issues with its minivans in the past, such as when a recall was initiated back in 2018 over mechanical issues with the sliding doors on certain models.
The current investigation is now focused on the 2017-2019 Chrysler Pacifica model years, covering approximately 1.8 million minivans sold in the United States. The NHTSA has stated that it will work with Chrysler to collect all necessary information and data to determine the root cause of the issue and evaluate whether a recall is necessary.
As the investigation continues, some owners of Chrysler minivans are already speaking out about their experiences with the doors. One Pennsylvania mother, who did not want to be named, reported that while driving on the highway with her child in the back seat, the sliding door suddenly opened on her 2018 Pacifica.
"It just flew open. My daughter was in the back seat, she could've fallen out. We were lucky to get over to the side of the road safely," the mother shared. "I had no indication whatsoever that the door was going to open - no light, no warning beeps. It just happened."
Other Pacifica owners reported similar stories. "The hatch has popped open a couple of times on its own while driving in the city. Once while driving, the slider opened and at a time I had the kids in the back seat," said one owner from Michigan.
The NHTSA has also identified a potential issue with the Pacifica's hatch door, which can reportedly fail to latch properly. Affected minivans could potentially experience an unintended opening of the hatch while driving, or the door could fly open during a rear-end collision.
Chrysler stated that it is cooperating fully with the NHTSA on the investigation and urges customers who experience any issues with their vehicles to contact their local dealership or Chrysler customer service.
"While we don't comment on specific complaints, we take all feedback seriously and are working with the NHTSA to investigate the matter," said an official statement from the automaker.
The ongoing investigation could have serious ramifications for Chrysler, depending on the outcome. The company is already facing increasing competition in the minivan market, with customers opting for SUVs and crossover vehicles instead of traditional family haulers. If a recall is necessary, it could hurt sales and damage the automaker's reputation for safety.
In the meantime, the NHTSA is advising Pacifica owners to exercise caution while driving and to pay close attention to any warning signs or indications of a malfunctioning door.
"Our top priority is safety. We are fully dedicated to investigating this matter and will take the necessary action to ensure the safety of the motoring public," said the NHTSA in a statement. "We encourage Chrysler Pacifica owners to stay alert and report any potential issues to us as soon as possible."
