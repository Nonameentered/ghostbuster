Chrysler Expects Strong December Sales to Cap off Record Year, Industry Volume Predicted to Fall
As the end of the year approaches, Chrysler is preparing for strong sales numbers in December to cap off what has been a record year for the company. However, while Chrysler is expecting to finish the year on a high note, there are concerns about the overall health of the automotive industry, with volume predicted to fall in the coming year.
Chrysler has had an impressive year in terms of sales, with the company reporting increased sales figures month after month. In November, Chrysler sold over 140,000 vehicles, an increase of 17 percent from the same period in the previous year. The company credits the success to robust demand for its Jeep and Ram brands, as well as strong performances from the Chrysler and Dodge brands.
"We are finishing the year very strong, and we expect December to be no different," said Timothy Kuniskis, Global Head of Alfa Romeo and Head of Passenger Cars – Dodge, SRT, Chrysler and FIAT, FCA – North America. "Our products continue to resonate with consumers, and we are excited about what the future holds."
Chrysler's strong sales performance comes despite the wider automotive industry facing declining sales figures in recent months. There are concerns that this trend will continue into 2020, with industry analysts predicting that overall volume will fall next year.
There are several factors contributing to the decline in the industry. One is the shift towards electric vehicles, which is causing disruption in the market and leading to reduced demand for traditional fuel-powered cars. Another is the continued uncertainty around global trade, which is leading to reduced consumer confidence and making it more difficult for companies to make long-term investment decisions.
Despite the challenges facing the industry, Kuniskis is confident that Chrysler is well-positioned to weather any storm. "Our sales figures speak for themselves – we are doing something right," he said. "We have a strong portfolio of brands and products, and we are always looking for ways to innovate and stay ahead of the curve."
One way that Chrysler is adapting to changing market conditions is by investing in its electric vehicle offerings. The company recently announced plans to introduce new hybrid and electric models across its brands, with the goal of having electrified options available for all of its vehicles. This move is in response to growing demand from consumers for electric cars, as well as government regulations around emissions.
Chrysler is not alone in its decision to pivot towards electric vehicles. Other automakers, such as Ford and General Motors, are also investing heavily in this area. However, the shift towards electric cars is not without its challenges, as consumers are still wary of the technology due to concerns around range anxiety and infrastructure.
Despite these concerns, Kuniskis is confident that Chrysler's electric vehicles will be well-received by consumers. "We are committed to making electric cars that are both accessible and desirable," he said. "We believe that electric cars are the future, and we want to be at the forefront of that change."
As Chrysler looks ahead to the coming year, the company remains cautiously optimistic about its prospects. While the industry as a whole is facing challenges, the company's strong sales performance this year and its investments in new technology suggest that it is well-positioned to navigate any bumps in the road.
"We know that the automotive industry is in a period of transition, but we are confident that we can adapt and thrive in this new landscape," said Kuniskis. "We are excited about what the future holds for Chrysler, and we look forward to continuing to deliver exceptional products and services to our customers."
