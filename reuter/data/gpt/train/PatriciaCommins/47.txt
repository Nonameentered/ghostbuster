Morton International Inc., the global chemical company, has announced its expansion in Europe with the acquisition of key businesses in the powder coatings and salt sectors. This move reflects the company's commitment to diversifying its portfolio and expanding its global reach.
The acquisition of the powder coatings business is particularly significant as it marks Morton's entry into this growing market. The business, which will be fully integrated into Morton's existing coatings segment, specializes in developing and manufacturing powder coatings for heavy-duty industrial and commercial applications.
This deal means that Morton's customers will have access to a broader range of coatings solutions, including powder coatings products which offer superior durability and corrosion resistance in challenging environments. The acquisition also provides opportunities for research and development, with access to new technologies and expertise, enhancing Morton's innovation capabilities.
The second acquisition is in the salt sector. Morton has acquired a leading salt manufacturer, known for producing high-quality salt products for a range of industries, including food, agriculture, and water treatment. The purchase of this operation will enable Morton to expand its salt offerings in the European market and support the company's global growth.
Salt is a fundamental component in a range of industries, including food and beverage, chemical processing, and water treatment. Morton's acquisition of the salt manufacturer demonstrates a strategic move to strengthen their portfolio with a key product that has limitless global demand.
The acquisition of both these businesses has taken a significant investment, with backing from Morton's existing investors, and is in line with their strategic roadmap for future growth.
Richard Reese, CEO of Morton International Inc., said, "These acquisitions reflect Morton's continued commitment to expanding our portfolio and our global footprint. Our new subsidiaries provide us with strategic entry points into growing markets and a solid foundation for future growth."
Reese added, "Powder coatings are rapidly becoming the coating of choice for industrial and commercial applications, and the acquisition of this business brings new capabilities to our coatings segment. The acquisition also bolsters our Salt segment with a leading manufacturer of high-quality salt products."
The acquisitions are part of Morton's strategy to expand into new markets and complement its existing portfolio. Morton has a strong presence in the Americas and Asia, with the latest deals enabling the company to broaden its reach in Europe.
