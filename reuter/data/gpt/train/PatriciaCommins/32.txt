Former Archer Daniels Midland executive, Mark Whitacre, has filed a lawsuit seeking back wages and punitive damages from the company he once worked for. Whitacre served as a whistleblower for the company, but now alleges that he was unfairly terminated and not properly compensated for his years of service.
Whitacre's story gained national attention in the late 1990s when he went public with allegations of price fixing at ADM. The company, which is one of the largest producers of corn-based products in the world, was accused of conspiring with other industry leaders to artificially inflate prices and stifle competition.
Whitacre's cooperation with federal investigators was instrumental in the resulting criminal case against ADM, which resulted in a $100 million fine and the convictions of several top executives. In exchange for his assistance, Whitacre was portrayed as something of a hero in the media, with his story eventually inspiring a Hollywood movie.
However, Whitacre's relationship with ADM soured in the years following the investigation. The company fired him in 2001, citing his involvement in embezzlement and other financial irregularities. Whitacre, for his part, maintains that he was the victim of a smear campaign meant to discredit him as a whistleblower.
Now, nearly two decades later, Whitacre is seeking compensation for what he claims was wrongful termination and a breach of his employment contract. Specifically, his lawsuit argues that ADM failed to properly compensate him for six months of work he performed as part of the criminal investigation, as well as for bonuses and other incentives he was promised.
The lawsuit also alleges that ADM acted in bad faith, and that the company was aware of the potential for negative publicity surrounding Whitacre's whistleblowing but did little to protect him from retaliation. As a result, he is seeking additional punitive damages to be awarded to him in court.
It remains to be seen how this lawsuit will be resolved, and what impact it may have on Whitacre's future prospects. However, for many, his case is a sobering reminder of the often-complicated nature of whistleblowing and the risks that individuals sometimes take to expose corporate wrongdoing. As for Whitacre himself, he appears determined to see this through to the end, saying that he feels "strongly" about seeking justice in this case.
