Kellogg and Ralcorp are experiencing a tough time due to the cut-throat competition in the US cereal market. Despite their long-standing presence in the industry, these companies have struggled to maintain their earnings and market share amidst changing consumer preferences and the emergence of new players in the market.
Kellogg, a 115-year-old company known for popular brands such as Frosted Flakes, Special K, and Pop-Tarts, reported a decline in its earnings in the first quarter of 2021. The company's net sales also fell by 3.5% compared to the same period last year. The decline was attributed to the changing consumer landscape which has led to a shift towards healthier breakfast options such as yoghurt and fruit.
Similarly, Ralcorp, a St. Louis-based private label food company with a portfolio of cereals, snacks and frozen foods, has also seen a decline in its earnings. The company's CEO, John C. Beck, cited pricing pressures and increased competition as the reasons for the decline. Ralcorp has been facing challenges in its private label business as well with major retailers such as Walmart and Kroger working on building their own brands that can compete with Ralcorp's offerings.
The US breakfast cereal market has been facing intense competition from a host of new players that have entered the market. Health-conscious consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the sugar content in traditional cereal brands. These consumers are shifting towards healthier options such as whole-grain cereals, Greek yoghurt, and granola bars. Other new entrants in the market include snack bar companies, meal kit companies, and even coffee chains, which have introduced cereal-based breakfast options on their menus.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted the cereal industry with breakfast occasions shifting from in-home to out-of-home. This shift has affected brands that are strongly associated with in-home breakfast consumption such as Kelloggâ€™s, which has been struggling to compete with other brands that are more popular in cafes and restaurants.
However, Kellogg and Ralcorp are not taking their challenges lying down. Kellogg has been investing in healthier breakfast options such as Kashi, a whole-grain cereal brand, and RXBAR, a protein bar company. The company has also been expanding its product line to include snack bars, frozen waffles, and plant-based protein products.
On the other hand, Ralcorp has been focusing on innovation and new product development. The company recently launched a line of frozen breakfast sandwiches that are aimed at tapping into the breakfast sandwich market. The launch was successful, and the company reported a 5% increase in net sales in the frozen foods segment.
In conclusion, the cereal market in the US is experiencing tough times, and established brands such as Kellogg and Ralcorp are facing challenges due to increased competition and changing consumer preferences. However, these companies are not sitting idle and are innovating and expanding their product lines to stay relevant in the market. Only time will tell if these efforts will pay off and enable them to stay ahead of the competition.
