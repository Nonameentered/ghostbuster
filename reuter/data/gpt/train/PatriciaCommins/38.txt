Oneok and Western Resources Agree on $660 Million Deal to Combine Natural Gas Assets, Prepare for Deregulation
Oneok Inc. and Western Resources announced on Monday that they reached a $660 million deal, where Oneok will acquire the natural gas liquids assets of Western Resources. The combination of these assets will create a premier energy company, with a strong position in key North American natural gas liquids markets.
The deal will allow Oneok to expand its natural gas liquids infrastructure needs and create a comprehensive network of gathering, processing, storage, transportation, and marketing assets in key natural gas liquids regions. Western Resources’ assets include a fractionation facility in Kansas, a pipeline system connecting Kansas and Colorado, and natural gas liquids reserves in the Hugoton Basin, one of the largest natural gas fields in North America.
“Our objective is to be a leading natural gas liquids company, and this transaction is an important step toward achieving that goal,” said Terry Spencer, Oneok’s CEO. “This combination will create a premier natural gas liquids system that will be well-positioned to capture value in the changing energy market.”
The agreement comes as the Trump administration aims to deregulate the energy industry, removing environmental restrictions and promoting the domestic production of oil, gas, and coal. A shift towards cheaper and more abundant natural gas is expected to boost industry profits, as well as benefiting consumers with lower utility bills.
“With the U.S. regulatory environment for energy companies in flux, it’s important for us to position ourselves for success,” said Grant E. Greeley, Chairman and CEO of Western Resources. “By combining forces with Oneok, we’ll be able to capitalize on opportunities in the natural gas liquids markets.”
Oneok and Western Resources’ agreement also follows a $20 billion merger between Chevron and Texaco announced last week. The deal will create one of the largest energy companies in the world, with significant operations in the U.S. and Europe.
“This merger and acquisition activity is indicative of the growing industry consolidation as companies seek to strengthen their positions in the changing energy markets,” said Scott Peterson, a spokesman for the Western Energy Alliance.
Oneok and Western Resources’ transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, pending regulatory approval. Once approved, Oneok will own and operate about 2,750 miles of natural gas liquids pipelines and more than 4.8 million barrels of natural gas liquids storage capacity.
“These assets complement our existing portfolio and will enhance our ability to serve customers in key areas,” said Spencer. “We’re excited about the potential to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders, customers, and communities.”
Oneok, based in Tulsa, Okla., is a diversified energy company that operates two business segments: natural gas liquids gathering, processing, and marketing; and natural gas gathering and processing. Western Resources, based in Topeka, Kan., is a holding company that operates three major subsidiaries: Westar Energy for electric utility service, Kansas Gas and Electric for natural gas distribution, and Kansas City Power and Light for electric transmission and distribution.
The announcement of Oneok and Western Resources’ acquisition comes amid a wave of deals in the oil and gas industry. Last week, Royal Dutch Shell announced that it was acquiring BG Group in a $70 billion deal that will give the combined company a larger presence in the liquefied natural gas market. Additionally, Kinder Morgan, Energy Transfer Partners, and Williams have all announced multi-billion-dollar acquisitions in recent months.
The low oil price environment, coupled with a surge in natural gas production, has spurred a flurry of deal-making in the U.S. energy industry. As companies look to consolidate and expand their operations, experts believe that energy mergers and acquisitions will continue to dominate headlines in the coming months and years.
