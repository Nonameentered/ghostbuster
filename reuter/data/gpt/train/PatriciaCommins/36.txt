Former Archer Daniels Midland Co. Executive Mark Whitacre was once a key figure in the U.S. government's investigation into price-fixing, but now it seems that he has ceased to cooperate with authorities. The news has added a fresh hurdle to the antitrust case, which was already facing challenges. Whitacre's decision comes on the eve of a trial that may put five former executives behind bars for conspiring to set prices for lysine and other animal feed ingredients.
The 63-year-old businessman was instrumental in the government's investigation and cooperation with authorities earned him a reduced sentence in a 1998 antitrust case. He spent nine years serving a sentence that was commuted by President Barack Obama in 2009. Whitacre was also depicted in the Steven Soderbergh film "The Informant!" -a comedy about his collaboration with the FBI.
Recent court filings show that Whitacre is no longer cooperating in any capacity with the U.S. government in the ongoing probe. The filings indicate that he hasn't responded to requests for information, appeared for interviews, or testified in any proceedings.
The government has asked the court to allow a deposition from a witness who has information about the role Whitacre played in the price-fixing scheme. The information has become important since Whitacre's actions may reflect adversely on the government's case.
The former executive has since transitioned to business consulting and has been deemed by investigators as someone with an unreliable memory. He has spoken extensively about his past, however, Whitacre's statements have varied in different accounts.
The government's case against the former executives has been overshadowed by a recent bribery investigation focused on former Senator Carl Levin's report on offshore tax havens. The Levin report outlined patterns of aggressive offshore tax avoidance by 20 large American multinationals, including ADM. The case is the result of a long-standing government investigation, which led to indictments against executives of the company in 1996.
The trial has been postponed several times, with the most recent delay announced in late January this year. The trial, which was initially scheduled to take place in February 2020, is now set to start in May 2021.
The Archer Daniels Midland case has been considered over the years as one of the largest antitrust cases in U.S. history, involving a "largely undocumented conspiracy" to manipulate prices of certain animal feed ingredients. It alleged that the company and other leading lysine producers globally colluded to fix the price of lysine to maintain market share and charge customers a higher price.
The U.S. government claims that the conspiracy existed from the early 1990s. The investigation gained momentum when the company's former executives began cooperating with authorities. The executives were instrumental in providing information to the government, which led to the successful prosecution of the company.
In 2006, Archer Daniels Midland agreed to pay $400 million in fines as part of a plea agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The company also paid $54 million to settle a related class-action lawsuit. The firm's former CEO, Dwayne Andreas, reportedly gave over $200,000 in campaign contributions to politicians in an attempt to sway the investigation.
Archer Daniels Midland has been under scrutiny for several years. Besides the price-fixing scandal, the company has faced lawsuits and investigations related to issues such as food safety, pollution, and bribery. The company's business practices and its impact on the environment have also faced criticism from environmental activists.
According to the court filings, Whitacre has not responded to requests from the government for information since late 2019. The filings indicate that the government is struggling to understand the reasons for Whitacre's unreliability and believes that the former executive's decision to cease cooperating implies a lack of interest or willingness to testify in the trial.
Whitacre's decision not to cooperate with authorities could encourage other witnesses not to testify, as it may signal to them that they can opt-out without facing any consequences. The antitrust case will be weakened if the government is unable to secure majority testimony from witnesses.
The case against Archer Daniels Midland and its former executives is a pivotal one for the government, and it's unclear what effect Whitacre's decision will have on the trial's outcome. As both credibility and cooperation are integral to legal proceedings, the former executive's actions may impact the decades-long antitrust case significantly.
