Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM), one of the world's largest agricultural commodity companies, has announced a significant reorganization of its leadership, following a price-fixing scandal that resulted in a guilty plea and substantial criticism from shareholders.
The company has appointed several new executives to key positions, including Alan B. Boeckmann as non-executive chairman of the board, Juan Luciano as president and CEO, and Ray Young as executive vice president and chief financial officer. The new leadership team replaces former CEO Patricia Woertz, who retired in December 2014, and former chairman John Daniels, who retired in May 2015.
The changes come after ADM pled guilty in December 2013 to conspiring to fix prices for lysine and other animal feed additives between 1992 and 1995. The company agreed to pay a $100 million fine and cooperate with federal authorities in their investigation of other price-fixing schemes.
ADM's guilty plea, along with a lawsuit filed by shareholders alleging that the company misled investors about the extent of its antitrust violations, drew criticism from investors, who called for greater accountability and transparency from the company's leadership.
In response to the criticism, ADM announced a comprehensive restructuring of its governance, compensation, and compliance policies. The company also agreed to appoint a new independent director to its board and to provide additional disclosure about its lobbying activities and political contributions.
Many investors welcomed the changes, saying they were a positive step towards restoring trust and accountability in the company's leadership.
"We believe the appointments of Juan Luciano and Alan Boeckmann, combined with strong board oversight and enhanced transparency and accountability, will help ensure that ADM is well-positioned to continue delivering long-term value to shareholders," said J. Patrick Doyle, CEO of Domino's Pizza and a member of ADM's board of directors.
But others remained skeptical, questioning whether the changes went far enough to address the company's underlying problems.
"We're disappointed that the board did not go further in its efforts to improve corporate governance and accountability," said Michael Garland, assistant comptroller for corporate governance and responsible investment at the New York City Pension Funds, which owns approximately $26 million worth of ADM shares.
Garland and other critics noted that the company had not committed to separating the roles of CEO and chairman, which some believe is necessary to ensure effective oversight of company operations.
They also questioned whether the company's compliance policies were adequate to prevent future antitrust violations, particularly in light of recent allegations of price-fixing in the soybean industry.
ADM has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the soybean investigation, but the allegations have raised concerns among investors and prompted calls for greater transparency into the company's business practices.
Despite the criticism, ADM's new leadership team remains optimistic about the company's prospects, saying they are committed to building a stronger, more transparent organization that delivers value for shareholders.
"We have a great opportunity to build on ADM's strengths and create new ones," Luciano said in a statement. "Our focus will be on operational excellence, creating shareholder value, and being the partner of choice for our customers and suppliers."
Boeckmann added that the company's restructuring would help ensure it remained competitive in a rapidly changing agricultural marketplace.
"We're confident that the changes we're making will help position ADM for long-term success," he said. "We're committed to doing everything we can to ensure that the company remains a global leader in the years ahead."
