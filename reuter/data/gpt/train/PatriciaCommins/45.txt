Fast-food chains in the 1990s were in a constant battle for customers, with companies constantly striving to create new recipes and promotions to entice patrons into their establishments. In 1997, the competition was fierce, with big-name chains like McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, and Taco Bell all vying for a piece of the lucrative fast-food market.
One of the most significant promotions that year was McDonald's introduction of the "McFlurry." This new dessert item quickly became a fan favorite, with customers able to customize their McFlurry with a variety of different toppings and flavors. It was a hit with the public, and within the first year, McDonald's sold more than 100 million units of the product.
Burger King responded to the McFlurry's success by launching its own dessert item, the "Shake'em Up Fries." This innovative product included a bag of french fries with a side of seasoning that customers could add to the fries and then "shake up" to mix. While the Shake'em Up Fries didn't quite reach the same level of popularity as the McFlurry, it was still a unique addition to the Burger King menu.
KFC also made waves in 1997 by introducing their "Rotisserie Gold" chicken. This new recipe featured slow-cooked, roasted chicken with a variety of herbs and spices, creating a more flavorful and tender chicken than their traditional fried offerings. While it was a departure from KFC's signature fried chicken, the Rotisserie Gold was well-received by customers and helped to boost sales.
In addition to new recipes, fast-food chains also competed fiercely on promotions and deals. One of the most notable promotions of 1997 came from Taco Bell, who introduced their "5 Buck Box." This deal included a variety of menu items, including tacos, burritos, and a soft drink, all for just $5. This promotion was a hit with customers, and Taco Bell saw a significant increase in sales as a result.
Not to be outdone, McDonald's launched their own value menu in 1997, titled the "Dollar Menu." This menu featured a variety of items, all priced at just $1, making it an affordable option for budget-conscious customers. The Dollar Menu was a major success and remains a staple of the McDonald's menu to this day.
In addition to these major promotions, fast-food chains also invested in marketing campaigns throughout 1997. One notable advertising campaign came from Burger King, who launched their "Have it Your Way" campaign. This promotion focused on the customization options available at Burger King, emphasizing the idea that customers could have their burgers exactly how they wanted them.
Overall, 1997 was a year of intense competition among fast-food chains, with companies constantly striving to create new recipes, promotions, and advertising campaigns to attract customers. While some promotions and products were more successful than others, it's clear that the fast-food industry was as competitive as ever in the late 90s.
