Mark Whitacre, a former executive of the global food processing company Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), has filed a lawsuit against the company for back wages and punitive damages. Whitacre, who had served as a whistleblower in a high-profile price-fixing case against ADM, claims that the company violated a settlement agreement by refusing to pay him the agreed-upon compensation.
In his lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Illinois, Whitacre alleges that ADM reneged on its promise to pay him $3.5 million in back wages and benefits as part of a 2010 settlement. Under the terms of the agreement, ADM had agreed to compensate Whitacre for his assistance in the case, which had resulted in the company paying a $100 million fine to the U.S. government.
Whitacre’s role as a whistleblower in the ADM case was widely publicized, thanks in part to the 2009 movie “The Informant!”, which was based on his experiences. In the 1990s, Whitacre had worked as an executive at ADM and had helped expose a price-fixing scheme that involved the company and several of its competitors. The scandal had rocked the food industry and led to criminal charges against several executives.
As part of his cooperation with authorities, Whitacre had worn a hidden recorder and gathered evidence against his colleagues. His testimony had been crucial in securing convictions against ADM and its co-conspirators. However, Whitacre’s actions had also brought him under suspicion, and he had eventually been caught embezzling money from ADM.
Whitacre had pleaded guilty to the charges and had served nine years in prison. He had also agreed to pay restitution to ADM. However, he had also sued the company for wrongful termination, claiming that he had been fired as retaliation for his whistleblowing.
The lawsuit had been settled in 2010, with ADM agreeing to pay Whitacre the $3.5 million in compensation. However, according to Whitacre’s current lawsuit, the company has refused to pay him the full amount, citing tax issues.
Whitacre’s attorney, Matt Topic, argues that ADM’s refusal to pay his client is a breach of the settlement agreement and a violation of Illinois law. “Mark fulfilled his obligations under the agreement, and ADM should do the same,” Topic said in a statement.
In addition to the back wages, Whitacre is seeking punitive damages of $36 million, citing ADM’s “willful and wanton conduct”. The lawsuit alleges that ADM has acted in bad faith and has engaged in “unjust enrichment” by not paying Whitacre the agreed-upon amount.
ADM has not yet commented on the lawsuit. The company has faced multiple legal challenges in recent years, including lawsuits related to price-fixing, antitrust violations, and environmental pollution.
