Western Resources Inc. has announced a strategic alliance with ONEOK Inc. that could potentially boost earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 a share in the first full year of operations. Both companies have agreed to combine their respective utilities, which means that Western Resources will be providing gas and electric utilities to more than one million customers across several states.
The benefits of the alliance include increased operational efficiency, cost savings, and a broader customer base for both companies. Moreover, it will enable Western Resources to provide natural gas to customers in Missouri, which they could not do previously. The alliance will also enable the company to increase its renewable energy production.
ONEOK Inc. is one of the largest energy midstream service providers in the United States and has strong capabilities in gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. Combining these capabilities with Western Resources’ energy-related infrastructure and customer base creates an excellent opportunity to drive growth and profits.
Western Resources’ CEO, Stacy Locke, said, “We’re excited about the alliance with ONEOK because it will provide us with a tremendous opportunity to generate significant benefits for both companies’ shareholders. The market for natural gas and other energy products is growing rapidly, and this alliance will put us in a strong position to take advantage of this growth.”
Locke also noted that the alliance would not only be beneficial in the short-term but also help the companies to achieve long-term growth. Additionally, it will also be a boost for the environment as Western Resources plans to continue its transition to renewable energy sources.
ONEOK’s President and CEO, Terry K. Spencer, said, “We are pleased to be working with Western Resources to combine our respective utilities. This alliance will provide a platform for both companies to leverage their strengths and achieve growth in a rapidly changing energy landscape. We’re confident that this partnership will be beneficial for our customers, our employees, and our shareholders.”
The two companies plan to finalize the transaction in the coming months and expect to close the deal early next year. The alliance is projected to generate significant cost savings and create new opportunities for growth and expansion in the energy industry, providing value to shareholders and creating a sustainable future for the companies.
