Kansas City Southern Industries Inc, the transportation holding company based in Kansas City, is reportedly considering financing options for a $1.4 billion joint venture, which aims to control Mexico's fourth largest rail line, Ferrocarril del Istmo de Tehuantepec (FIT). The decision comes after the Mexican government approved Kansas City Southern's request to form the joint venture with Grupo Mexico, one of Mexico's largest mining companies.
The joint venture is expected to enhance the transportation infrastructure in Mexico, further promoting trade between Mexico, the United States, and Asia, through the rail network that connects the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. The project includes building a new rail bridge across the Gulf of Mexico, providing a more direct link between the two oceans, and increasing the capacity of the existing rail lines.
The project's cost is expected to be shared between the two companies, with Kansas City Southern paying $700 million for the purchase of a 50% stake in FIT, and Grupo Mexico contributing the remaining $700 million for infrastructure and modernization investments.
To finance the joint venture, Kansas City Southern has said it may consider issuing senior notes, bank facilities, or private equity to raise the necessary capital. The company's CEO, Patrick J. Ottensmeyer, said: “We have a variety of financing options available to us, and we will pursue the most cost-effective option for our shareholders.”
While a decision on the financing method has not been made yet, the company is expected to make an announcement in the coming weeks. Analysts suggest that senior notes or bank facilities may be the preferred option, as they are more flexible and offer better interest rates than private equity. However, the company's debt load will have to be taken into account, as it currently sits at around $2 billion.
The joint venture is expected to provide a significant boost to Kansas City Southern's revenue streams, as it continues to expand its reach in the world's largest rail market, with a focus on Mexico. The company's cross-border operations account for around 40% of its revenue, and the joint venture is expected to further increase that figure.
Despite the potential benefits, some concerns have been raised about the joint venture's impact on existing rail lines and its potential to disrupt other transport industries in the region. Critics argue that the project could lead to overcapacity in the rail sector and result in the displacement of trucking companies that currently serve the region.
However, supporters of the joint venture say that it will result in more efficient transportation, lower costs, and more sustainable transport modes. Kansas City Southern has also spoken about its commitment to working with other transportation stakeholders in the region to ensure that there is no disruption to other sectors.
If the financing for the joint venture is successful, the project is expected to commence in the first half of 2022, with completion expected within four years. The joint venture is seen as a significant step forward for the transportation industry in the region and is expected to have far-reaching effects on the North American logistics network.
