Kellogg Co. Hoping for Competitors to Cut Back Promotions, May Be Forced to Increase Costly Marketing Efforts in 1997
Kellogg Co., the largest cereal manufacturer in the world, is hoping that their competitors will cut back on promotions in 1997 so they too can scale back their marketing efforts, which have become increasingly expensive over the years.
The company posted a solid fourth-quarter profit of $168 million in 1996, up from $155 million in 1995. However, competition in the breakfast cereal market has increased in recent years, driving up advertising costs and putting pressure on Kellogg's profit margins.
Kellogg's Chairman, Arnold Langbo, expressed concern in a recent interview that the company's competitors may continue their aggressive promotion activity in 1997, forcing Kellogg to ramp up their marketing efforts to remain competitive.
"We're hoping that our competitors will scale back on promotions in 1997, given the state of the market and the costs associated with marketing," said Langbo. "If that doesn't happen, we may be forced to increase our marketing spend in order to maintain our market share."
Langbo added that while Kellogg is committed to investing in marketing, it is also exploring ways to reduce costs, including by using more cost-effective channels such as digital media.
Kellogg's biggest competitor, General Mills, has been stepping up its promotion activity in recent months, launching new cereal products and running aggressive promotions targeted at children. Kellogg's has responded with its own promotional campaigns, such as offering free toys with selected cereal boxes.
The increase in promotion activity has also intensified competition for shelf space in supermarkets, a critical factor in determining the success of a cereal product.
Industry analysts say that Kellogg's market leadership in the breakfast cereal segment is secure for now, but that the company needs to remain vigilant and adapt to changes in the market.
"Kellogg's has a strong brand and a loyal customer base, but it needs to continue to invest in innovation and marketing to stay ahead of the game," said Richard Straub, a market analyst with Merrill Lynch.
Kellogg's has also been expanding its product range beyond traditional cereal products, with the recent launch of a range of snacks and muesli bars. The company is looking at ways to diversify its product range and reduce its dependence on the mature breakfast cereal market.
"We're constantly exploring new product lines and markets, and we're optimistic about the growth opportunities that exist beyond cereal," said Langbo.
Despite the challenges facing the breakfast cereal market, Kellogg's remains optimistic about the future and is committed to maintaining its position as the world's leading cereal manufacturer.
"We're in a strong position, and we're confident that we can continue to grow and thrive in the years ahead," said Langbo. "But we're also aware that we need to adapt and evolve as the market changes, and we're committed to doing just that."
