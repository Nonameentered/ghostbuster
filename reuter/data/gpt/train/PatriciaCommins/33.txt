In the wake of missing out on major aircraft deals, McDonnell Douglas' stock has remained steady near its 52-week high thanks to the company's strong balance sheet and potential for acquisitions.
Earlier this year, the aerospace company lost out on two major contracts for aircrafts: the U.S. Air Force's T-X trainer jet and the U.S. Navy's MQ-25 aerial refueling drone. These losses were disappointing for McDonnell Douglas, as it had invested significant time and resources into developing competitive bids. However, the company's financial position and growth prospects have buoyed investor confidence.
One significant factor contributing to McDonnell Douglas' stock performance is its strong balance sheet. The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.37, indicating a low level of debt relative to equity. This is particularly impressive considering the capital-intensive nature of the aerospace industry, where companies often take on significant debt to fund development and production projects.
In addition to its favorable debt position, McDonnell Douglas has a healthy cash position. As of the end of the first quarter of 2018, the company had $3.7 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, providing financial flexibility for strategic investments.
One avenue for potential growth is through acquisitions. In late 2017, McDonnell Douglas completed its acquisition of helicopter manufacturer Bell Helicopter, which has contributed to the company's diversified product portfolio and bolstered its position in the defense and commercial markets.
In a recent earnings call, McDonnell Douglas CEO Doug Parker hinted at potential future acquisitions: "We're always looking for strategic opportunities, whether that's expanding our presence in new markets, adding complementary technologies or capabilities, or accelerating our innovation initiatives."
Investors have responded positively to this growth-oriented stance, as well as to the company's commitment to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2018, McDonnell Douglas returned nearly $700 million to shareholders, or 4.7% of its market capitalization.
Despite the recent contract losses, McDonnell Douglas' pipeline of business remains robust. The company has stated that it is pursuing a number of international opportunities, including potential sales of its F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets and AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. Additionally, McDonnell Douglas is investing heavily in research and development, with a focus on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and electric-powered aircraft.
Overall, while the recent aircraft contract losses have been a setback for McDonnell Douglas, the company's strong balance sheet and potential for growth through acquisitions and emerging technologies have kept investor sentiment positive. As of mid-May 2018, the company's stock was trading just below its 52-week high, a testament to the market's confidence in its long-term prospects.
