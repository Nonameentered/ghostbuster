Monsanto, the American multinational agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology company, is set to make a major decision about the future of its chemical business at a board meeting on Friday.
The decision comes after years of controversy and lawsuits regarding the safety of Monsanto's flagship product, the herbicide Roundup. The company has been accused of covering up the cancer-causing properties of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, resulting in billions of dollars in legal settlements.
According to insiders, the board of Monsanto is considering selling off its chemical business entirely, or creating a separate entity for it. The chemical business generates over $2 billion in revenue each year but has come under intense scrutiny in recent years due to the health and environmental concerns surrounding its products.
Many investors have expressed concerns that the chemical business is damaging the company's reputation and hindering its future growth prospects. In addition to Roundup, the chemical business also produces other controversial products like dicamba, which has been linked to crop damage and lawsuits.
While some analysts say that a sale or spin-off of the chemical business could benefit Monsanto's bottom line and reputation, others warn that it could also create significant challenges.
"The chemical business is a big part of Monsanto's revenue stream, and selling it off or separating it could have significant financial implications for the company," said Jeffrey Kimball, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets.
Kimball also noted that creating a separate entity for the chemical business could create some legal liability issues, as Monsanto would still be responsible for any legal settlements or fines related to its past actions.
Despite the potential challenges, many investors and environmental groups are calling on Monsanto to divest from its chemical business entirely. A recent campaign by the environmental organization Friends of the Earth called on the company to "ditch Roundup and toxic chemicals for good."
"By selling off its chemical business, Monsanto could start to address the environmental and health concerns that it has helped to create," said Jim Thomas, co-director of the ETC Group, an environmental advocacy organization.
Friday's board meeting will mark a crucial turning point for Monsanto and could have significant implications for the future of its business. The decision will also be closely watched by investors, environmental groups, and consumers around the world.
