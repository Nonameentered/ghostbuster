Conseco Inc, a leading life insurance and financial services provider, announced today its plans to acquire Pioneer Financial Services Inc for $477 million. The deal, which is expected to close at the end of the year, will expand Conseco's product offerings for senior citizens.
Pioneer Financial Services Inc, a specialist in providing retirement products and services, has been in operation since 1982 and has a strong reputation with its customers. The acquisition will enable Conseco to expand its offerings in the senior market, which is one of the fastest-growing demographic groups in the US.
“This acquisition is a strategic move as we continue to focus on expanding our offerings to the senior market,” said Jim Prieur, CEO of Conseco Inc. “Pioneer Financial Services brings a wealth of experience and expertise, and we are excited to welcome their team to our organization.”
The acquisition will enable Conseco to offer a complete range of retirement products, including annuities, life insurance, and long-term care insurance. It will also provide a significant boost to the company's distribution network, as Pioneer Financial Services has a network of over 7,000 independent financial advisors.
“We are thrilled to be joining forces with Conseco and to have the opportunity to further serve the senior market,” said John Wight, CEO of Pioneer Financial Services Inc. “We share a common vision of providing the best possible retirement solutions to our customers, and this acquisition will enable us to do that on a larger scale.”
The transaction is expected to close at the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. Following the acquisition, Pioneer Financial Services will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Conseco Inc and will maintain its existing headquarters in Madison, Wisconsin.
The acquisition of Pioneer Financial Services is the latest in a series of acquisitions made by Conseco in recent years as the company seeks to expand its offerings to the senior market. The company has made several strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of Bankers Life and Casualty Company in 2008, which enabled it to become a leading provider of Medicare supplement insurance.
In conclusion, the acquisition of Pioneer Financial Services by Conseco is a strategic move that will enable the company to expand its offerings to the senior market. The acquisition will enable Conseco to offer a complete range of retirement products, including annuities, life insurance, and long-term care insurance, and will provide a significant boost to the company's distribution network. With the acquisition expected to close at the end of the year, Conseco looks set to significantly increase its presence in the senior market.
