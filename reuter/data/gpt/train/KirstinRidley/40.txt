LONDON: UK-based software company Misys has announced that it is planning to expand its presence globally through international acquisitions worth $30 million each.
The London-listed company, which provides software solutions to the financial services sector, said it is now focused on acquiring businesses in the US, Asia, and Europe, as it looks to grow its customer base and diversify its business portfolio.
Misys, which was acquired by US private equity firm Vista Equity Partners in 2012, has a market valuation of around $4 billion and has been aggressively expanding its business through acquisitions since its takeover.
Speaking about the company's plans, CEO Nadeem Syed said, "We are looking at acquisitions that are going to be strategically beneficial for the business and make us more competitive in the marketplace."
"We have a healthy balance sheet, so we are definitely focused on finding companies that can help us expand our offering in different geographies and verticals," he added.
The company has a range of software products for financial institutions, including digital banking and lending solutions, treasury and capital markets systems, and risk management and compliance solutions.
Misys has a strong presence in the US, where it has partnered with several large financial institutions, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase, among others.
However, the company has been looking to expand its presence in other regions, particularly in Asia where there has been a growing demand for digital banking solutions and financial technology services.
"We see a lot of opportunity in Asia, particularly in countries like India, where digital banking is really taking off," Syed said.
The company has been investing heavily in R&D and has also been partnering with fintech startups to develop new products. Through its acquisition strategy, Misys hopes to accelerate its growth and strengthen its overall business offering.
Misys is not the only company eyeing international acquisitions to expand its business. Several other tech firms, including Oracle and IBM, have also been making acquisitions to grow their presence in different regions.
The company has not yet disclosed any specific acquisition targets, but Syed said that the firm is "actively looking" for acquisition opportunities and expects to make announcements in the near future.
