Hanson's Energy Group (HEG) is set to become a separate entity from its parent company, Hanson Limited, after shareholders approved the final demerger plank. The move is expected to unlock value for Hanson shareholders, as HEG will be able to attract a wider range of investors, focus on energy-related projects, and pursue growth opportunities more aggressively.
The demerger was first announced in April 2020 after a strategic review of Hanson's operations. The review concluded that the energy business had different growth prospects and capital requirements compared to the rest of the company, which included building materials, brick-making, and concrete products. As a result, Hanson decided to separate its energy business, creating a pure-play energy company.
The demerger process began in November 2020, with the board of Hanson proposing a scheme of arrangement to separate HEG from Hanson. The scheme received approval from the High Court of Justice in January 2021, and shareholders of Hanson and HEG voted overwhelmingly in favor of the separation at their respective general meetings on May 21, 2021.
Under the demerger scheme, Hanson shareholders will receive one HEG share for every Hanson share held. The separation is expected to take effect on June 1, 2021, subject to regulatory approvals.
HEG will be listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "HEG." It will have a separate board of directors, with Tim Stone, the former CFO of Tesco, as chairman, and David Richardson, the former CEO of E.ON UK, as CEO. The company will have around 600 employees and will be headquartered in Maidenhead, UK.
HEG's assets include three gas-fired power plants in the UK, with a combined capacity of 1.2 GW, as well as a 50% stake in the Saltend Cogeneration plant in Hull. The company also has a pipeline of development projects, including a new gas-fired power plant in Lincolnshire and a battery storage project in Wales.
David Richardson said in a statement: "We are delighted to have received the approval of shareholders for the demerger of HEG. This marks an important milestone in the creation of a new, independent energy company that will be focused on delivering sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy for customers. We have a talented and experienced team in place, a strong asset base, and a clear strategy for growth."
HEG's CEO added that the company had a clear vision of becoming a leading player in a rapidly evolving energy market. "Our focus will be on decarbonizing the energy system, developing flexible and resilient energy infrastructure, and leveraging emerging technologies to improve the customer experience. We believe our strategy is aligned with the UK's net-zero ambitions and will create long-term value for all stakeholders."
The demerger was welcomed by analysts, who said it would allow HEG to pursue a more aggressive growth strategy and attract a wider range of investors. "By creating a pure-play energy company, Hanson is enabling HEG to realize its full potential," said Andrew Fitchie, head of utilities research at Investec. "HEG has a strong asset portfolio, a proven management team, and a clear growth strategy. It should be an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to invest in the energy sector."
The demerger is the latest in a series of corporate actions aimed at creating more focused, streamlined companies. Demergers, spin-offs, and divestitures have become increasingly popular among CEOs and investors as a way to unlock value and reduce complexity. In the energy sector, demergers have been particularly prevalent as companies seek to adapt to the changing landscape of renewable energy, digitalization, and decentralization.
Hanson's demerger of HEG is expected to be followed by similar moves in the industry, as companies seek to separate their energy businesses and create more focused and agile companies. It is a sign of the continuing evolution of the energy sector and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
