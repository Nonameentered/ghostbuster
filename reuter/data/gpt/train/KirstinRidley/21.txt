Odyssey Telecommunications is reportedly close to reaching its $800 million funding goal to launch its first-ever satellite. The telecommunications company, which is known for offering satellite-based internet and phone services to rural areas with limited access to cellular coverage, announced its intention to enter the space race in late 2020.
The satellite, named ODT-1, is a joint venture with aerospace company Lockheed Martin and will be deployed in geostationary orbit to provide expanded coverage to Odyssey's current service areas and to offer new solutions for internet and phone connectivity in previously underserved regions.
According to sources familiar with the matter, Odyssey has secured investments from a mix of venture capital firms and private equity investors from across the globe. The company has also reportedly received support from strategic partners in the telecommunications industry, including Verizon and AT&T.
The funding will cover the manufacturing, testing, and launch expenses of ODT-1, which is slated to lift off from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station later this year.
Odyssey's CEO, John Smith, expressed his excitement in a statement, saying, "We are thrilled to have achieved this significant milestone in our journey to connect the unconnected. The interest and support from our investors and partners reflect the growing demand for reliable and affordable internet and phone services worldwide."
ODT-1 will be equipped with the latest technology to ensure optimal performance and security. It will provide coverage to North America, Central America, and the Caribbean initially, but Odyssey has plans to expand the satellite's reach globally in the near future.
The satellite will also support Odyssey's plans to launch a new smartphone early next year, which will enable seamless connectivity through ODT-1's satellite network. This move will have a significant impact on people living in remote areas who have limited or no access to existing cellular coverage.
The satellite will also benefit disaster relief efforts, as it will provide emergency communication services to regions affected by natural disasters or other crises.
"The potential benefits of this satellite cannot be overstated, from providing life-saving aid during critical moments to empowering underserved communities worldwide," Smith added.
The demand for satellite-based internet and phone services has surged in recent years, particularly as remote work and online learning have become commonplace. Companies like SpaceX, OneWeb, and Amazon have also entered the space race, promising to revolutionize internet access through satellite networks.
Odyssey is on course to launch ODT-1 later this year, pending final regulatory approvals and successful testing. The company aims to be at the forefront of the satellite telecommunications industry, connecting subscribers worldwide and empowering underserved communities with reliable and affordable internet and phone services.
