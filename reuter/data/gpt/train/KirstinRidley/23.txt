British Telecommunications (BT) and MCI Communications Corp. (MCI) have announced their plans to join forces with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) as part of Concert Plc, a global telecommunications venture.
BT and MCI revealed that they intended to merge their international operations back in 1996, and Concert Plc was formed as a result of the merger in 1997. The joint venture was set up to provide global telecoms services in over 70 countries.
Now the two companies are aiming to expand their scope and reach in Asia by incorporating NTT as a partner in Concert Plc. The new alliance is expected to give Concert access to NTT's cutting-edge technology and extensive network in the region.
Sir Peter Bonfield, Chief Executive of BT, described the agreement as "an important milestone for Concert" and a "win-win situation" for all parties involved.
He added: "NTT is a highly respected company in Asia, and its involvement will further enhance Concertâ€™s capabilities, enabling us to offer our customers the highest quality, most reliable telecoms services in the Asia-Pacific region."
BT, MCI, and NTT have established a joint venture management company to oversee the partnership's operations. The company will be based in the UK and will be responsible for managing the Concert joint venture in Asia.
NTT President Junichiro Miyazu said he was pleased to be partnering with BT and MCI, and believed that the partnership would enhance the competitiveness of the three companies in the global telecoms market.
He noted: "Japan's telecommunications market is undergoing a major transformation, and we believe that this new partnership will help us to stay ahead of the curve. We look forward to working closely with BT and MCI in developing new services and expanding our reach in the Asia-Pacific region."
The three companies are expected to invest up to $1.3 billion in the venture, with BT and MCI contributing $500 million each, and NTT investing $300 million. Concert's revenues are estimated to reach $10 billion by the year 2000, according to the company.
Analysts have called the partnership a "major coup" for BT and MCI, as it gives them a significant presence in Asia, a region that has been difficult to penetrate for Western telecoms companies.
The partnership also highlights the growing trend of global consolidation in the telecoms industry, as companies seek to expand their reach and gain a competitive edge in the market.
The news of the partnership has also been met with positive reactions from industry experts.
Kris Szaniawski, senior research analyst at telecoms consultancy Ovum, said: "The partnership will enable Concert to become a truly global service provider, with a presence in markets that many other service providers have struggled to make headway in. This is a positive move for all the companies involved and for the telecoms industry as a whole."
The partnership is subject to regulatory approval, and it is expected to be finalized by early next year. Once completed, it is expected to have a significant impact on the global telecoms industry, and create new opportunities for businesses and consumers across the world.
