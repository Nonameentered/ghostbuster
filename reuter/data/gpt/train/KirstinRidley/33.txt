Energy company, National Grid, is considering selling a majority stake in its subsidiary telecoms provider, Energis, to strategic investors, according to sources close to the company. The move comes amidst a continent-wide deal to slash the cost of European telephone calls and boost telecoms infrastructure.
Energis currently provides telecoms services to businesses across the UK, including fibre optic connectivity, cloud-based services and data centres. It also has a small presence in Europe, with operations in Ireland and the Netherlands.
The potential sale of a majority stake in Energis, which is valued at around Â£700m, would allow National Grid to focus more on its core energy business and raise capital to invest in new energy infrastructure projects.
The sale would also enable Energis to expand its European operations and invest in new technology, which will be crucial as the continent seeks to boost telecoms infrastructure to support the growing demand for data and the increasing use of cloud-based services.
A source close to National Grid said: "There are a number of potential investors who are interested in Energis and who could help to take the business to the next level. A sale would allow National Grid to focus more on its core energy business and to raise capital to invest in new energy projects."
The source added: "Energis operates in a highly competitive market and needs to invest in new technology, particularly in the areas of data centres and cloud-based services. A sale would give Energis the resources it needs to remain at the forefront of the telecoms industry."
The potential sale comes as part of a larger deal to create a continent-wide telecommunications network that would slash the cost of European telephone calls. The deal will involve telecoms providers across Europe joining forces to create a single network that would allow calls to be made across the continent at a reduced cost.
The move is aimed at supporting the growth of small and medium-sized businesses, which are increasingly dependent on telecoms services to operate effectively. It is also expected to boost the economies of many European countries by increasing trade between them.
The proposed network would also be more secure than existing networks, with higher levels of encryption and improved protection against cyber threats.
National Grid and Energis are expected to play a key role in the creation of the new network, due to their extensive telecoms infrastructure and experience in the industry.
The potential sale of a majority stake in Energis to strategic investors would enable the company to invest more in the new network, making it more competitive and helping to drive down the cost of European telephone calls.
However, the sale of such a large stake in the company could be controversial, particularly if it is sold to a foreign investor. There may also be concerns about the impact on jobs and the potential loss of expertise in the UK telecoms industry.
Despite this, the potential benefits of the sale and the creation of a continent-wide telecoms network are seen as significant, both for Energis and for the wider European economy.
A spokesperson for National Grid said: "We are currently exploring a range of options for Energis, including the potential sale of a majority stake in the business. This is part of our ongoing strategic review of our assets and we will provide an update when appropriate."
They added: "We are also excited to be part of the continent-wide deal to slash the cost of European telephone calls and boost telecoms infrastructure. This is an important initiative that will support businesses across Europe and drive economic growth."
The sale of a majority stake in Energis is still in the early stages of discussion, and it is not yet clear when or if a deal will be finalised. However, the potential benefits for Energis, National Grid and the European telecoms industry make it an option that cannot be ignored.
