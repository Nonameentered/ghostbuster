Human rights activists and the computer industry are calling for better policing of violence and pornography on the internet. The growing concern over the easy availability of violent and pornographic content online has prompted the call for stricter measures to protect internet users.
The call comes after a survey revealed the extent of the problem, with over 90% of young people being exposed to violent or pornographic content online. The survey, conducted by the nonprofit organization Plan International, found that most young people had been exposed to pornography by the time they were 14.
Plan International's CEO, Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen, said: "This is a serious concern. Children and young people are being exposed to harmful content, and we need to do more to protect them."
The situation has prompted calls for stronger measures to prevent such content from being accessible to children and young people. Human rights activists and the computer industry are calling for tighter regulations to prevent violence and pornography from appearing online. They also call for greater education and support for parents in managing their children's internet use.
The computer industry is also under scrutiny for failing to do enough to prevent violent and pornographic content from appearing online. The industry is being urged to implement stricter controls to protect users, with many suggesting that it should adopt similar measures to those applied to other forms of media.
The call for action comes as mounting evidence points to the detrimental effects of exposure to violent and pornographic content. Studies have shown that such exposure can harm children's well-being and development, with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems.
The internet has become an essential part of everyday life for many children and young people, with much of their social interaction and exploration taking place online. However, the availability of violent and pornographic content poses a serious risk to their welfare and development.
It is clear that something needs to be done to prevent the unrestricted access to violent and pornographic content online. The call for stricter regulation and greater education and support for families is vital to protecting children and young people from harm. By working together, human rights activists and the computer industry can ensure a safer online environment for all.
