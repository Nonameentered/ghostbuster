The proposed merger of British Telecom (BT) and MCI Communications has put the spotlight on the potential culture clash between two very different companies. BT is known for its slow, bureaucratic approach to decision-making, while MCI is a nimble, entrepreneurial company that has made a name for itself by taking risks and innovating quickly.
The merger, which was announced in May, is set to create one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, with combined revenues of over $70 billion. Both companies see the merger as a way to gain a foothold in the lucrative US market, which has been dominated by AT&T and Verizon.
However, analysts are warning that the cultures of the two companies may clash, and that this could lead to problems down the line. BT is a traditional, hierarchical company that has been around for over 150 years. MCI, on the other hand, is a relatively young company that was founded in 1963.
One of the main differences between the two companies is their approach to innovation. BT has a reputation for being slow to innovate, while MCI has been at the forefront of many technological advancements in the telecommunications industry.
This was evident in the recent 5G spectrum auction, where MCI was one of the big winners, while BT failed to secure any spectrum at all. This has led some analysts to question whether BT has the agility to keep up with MCI in a fast-moving industry.
Another potential area of conflict is the companies' respective approaches to customer service. BT has a reputation for poor customer service, with long wait times and frustrating call center experiences. MCI, on the other hand, has a reputation for excellent customer service, with a focus on personalized interactions and quick response times.
The merger could also lead to cultural clashes in terms of management styles. BT has a highly centralized management structure, with decisions made at the top and filtered down through the organization. MCI, on the other hand, has a more decentralized structure, with decision-making pushed down to lower levels of the organization.
While the two companies will need to find a way to reconcile their different cultures, there are also opportunities for them to learn from each other. BT could benefit from MCI's approach to innovation and customer service, while MCI could benefit from BT's experience in managing a large, complex organization.
One way to bridge the cultural divide could be through the appointment of a neutral CEO who is not affiliated with either company. This would provide a fresh perspective and help to ensure that the cultural differences between the two companies are addressed in a fair and balanced way.
Another potential solution could be to create a new culture that blends the best of both companies. This would require a lot of effort and investment, but could result in a company that is greater than the sum of its parts.
In any case, it is clear that the merger between BT and MCI is not going to be smooth sailing. The two companies will need to work hard to reconcile their different cultures and find a way to operate together effectively. However, if they can overcome these challenges, the merger could be a game-changer in the telecommunications industry, opening up new opportunities and driving innovation in the sector.
