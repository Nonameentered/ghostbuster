Paris-based technology consulting firm Sema Group is set to focus on telecommunications and business systems for its growth in 1997, as it aims to expand its presence globally. The move comes as the company, which provides IT and management consulting services to clients across the world, seeks to overcome a difficult year for the European IT industry.
"We're expecting strong demand in telecommunications and business management systems, and we see these sectors as being key to our growth in 1997," said Sema Group CEO Philippe Germond, in a recent interview with Reuters. "We're also planning to expand our presence in the United States and Asia, where we see significant opportunity for our services."
Sema Group is one of Europe's largest technology consulting firms, with over 15,000 employees and offices in more than 20 countries. The company provides IT and business management consulting services to clients in a wide range of industries, including finance, manufacturing, and telecommunications.
Despite its size and reach, Sema Group has struggled to maintain growth in recent years, as the European IT industry has faced intense competition and a challenging economic environment. In 1996, the company saw revenues of $3.9 billion, a slight increase from the previous year but still well below its peak of $4.7 billion in 1993.
To overcome these challenges, Sema Group has focused on expanding its offerings in key growth sectors, such as telecommunications and business management systems. In 1996, the company acquired telecom software firm Xiris, which has helped to position Sema Group as a leading provider of telecom software and services.
Sema Group has also invested heavily in research and development, partnering with major technology firms such as IBM and Microsoft to develop next-generation IT solutions. The company has launched several new products and services in recent months, including a range of mobile data services and a cloud-based analytics platform.
Despite these efforts, Sema Group faces stiff competition from other technology consulting firms, both in Europe and beyond. The company must also contend with changing demands from clients, who are increasingly looking for more specialized and cost-effective IT services.
To address these challenges, Sema Group is focusing on building stronger relationships with its clients, by working closely with them to understand their specific needs and tailoring solutions to meet those needs. The company is also investing in training and development for its employees, to ensure they have the skills and knowledge to deliver high-quality services to clients.
"Our goal is to be a trusted partner for our clients, and to help them achieve their business objectives through the use of technology," said Germond. "We're committed to delivering innovative, cost-effective solutions that meet the evolving needs of our clients in today's rapidly changing business environment."
Looking ahead to 1997, Sema Group is optimistic about its prospects for growth, as it continues to expand its services and focus on key growth sectors. The company is also planning to increase its presence in the United States and Asia, where it sees significant opportunity for its services.
"We're confident that our focus on telecommunications and business management systems, combined with our strong global presence and experienced team, will enable us to deliver strong results in 1997 and beyond," said Germond. "We're excited about the future and look forward to continuing to help our clients drive success through the use of technology."
