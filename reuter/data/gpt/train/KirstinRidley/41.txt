Misys looking to acquire international firms worth up to $30 million each
Misys, a London-based financial services software company, is on the hunt for new acquisitions worth up to $30 million each as it seeks to expand its global reach. The company has been on a buying spree in recent years, snapping up firms in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands.
According to a report by the Financial Times, Misys is now seeking to acquire smaller firms in emerging markets such as Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The company's CEO, Nadeem Syed, said that Misys is looking for companies that have a strong product offering, experienced management teams, and a loyal customer base.
"We want to bring in technologies that will complement our existing offerings and allow us to expand our reach into new markets," said Syed. "We believe that there are a number of attractive targets out there that meet our criteria, and we are actively looking at a number of potential acquisitions."
Syed emphasized that Misys is not looking to acquire businesses solely for the sake of growth, but rather to add value to its existing products and services. "We are looking for companies that can help us to strengthen our position in the financial services industry and provide valuable solutions to our customers," he said.
Misys currently offers a wide range of software solutions to banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. Its products include platforms for trading, risk management, and customer engagement. The company is particularly well-known for its core banking system, which is used by many large banks around the world.
The company's expansion plans come as the financial services industry is undergoing significant change, with new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence disrupting traditional business models. Misys is seeking to stay ahead of the curve by acquiring companies that can help it to offer innovative solutions to its customers.
Misys has already made a number of successful acquisitions in recent years, including the Canadian risk management firm Sophis and the US-based lending software provider Custom Credit Systems. The company has also invested heavily in research and development, and has launched several new products in the past year.
Syed said that Misys is well-positioned to weather any uncertainties caused by Brexit, thanks to its diverse customer base and global footprint. "We are a global company with a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and the Americas," he said. "We are confident that we will be able to navigate the changing landscape of the financial services industry and emerge even stronger on the other side."
Misys is expected to announce its next acquisition in the coming months, as it continues its quest to become one of the leading players in the financial services software market.
