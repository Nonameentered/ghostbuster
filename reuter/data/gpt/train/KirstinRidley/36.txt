Businesses across the UK have expressed their dismay over the announcement of another telephone prefix overhaul. The move will force companies to change their contact phone numbers, causing significant disruption to their operations and potentially losing customers.
Ofcom, the UK's telecommunications regulator, plans to introduce a new series of phone numbers starting with '05' to meet the increasing demand for landline and mobile numbers. The change is also in response to the exhaustion of available numbers beginning with '01', '02', and '03'.
However, businesses are concerned that the change will cause further confusion for customers and create extra costs. Companies will have to update their advertising material, websites, and business cards, as well as notifying their suppliers, customers and clients about the new number. This process could take months, and companies will have to bear the cost of the changes themselves.
Experts estimate that the change will cost UK businesses between £200 million and £500 million collectively. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be hit the hardest, as they lack the resources of larger companies to make the changes quickly and effectively.
Many businesses have also expressed their frustration that this is the third time in just over a decade that Ofcom has overhauled telephone prefixes. The last overhaul in 2017 resulted in the introduction of the '03' prefix, which was supposed to offer a long-term solution.
The prospect of changing telephone numbers was met with anger and disbelief on social media. One Twitter user, who runs a small business, called the decision "utter madness", saying that it would take "months and months" to update all the necessary paperwork.
Another Twitter user highlighted the domino effect that the change could have, saying that they would have to update their website, stationery, and business bank accounts all at the same time.
Businesses are calling for more consultation and transparency from Ofcom over the changes. They want to see detailed information on the demand for phone numbers and the likely timescale for the new numbers' introduction. They also want to know why previous overhauls have not provided a long-term solution.
Some business leaders have suggested that Ofcom should introduce a system where businesses can choose their phone numbers, rather than being assigned them randomly. This would mean that companies could retain their existing numbers and avoid the disruption and cost of changing them.
Despite the criticism, Ofcom has defended the changes, saying that they are necessary to meet the increasing demand for phone numbers. A spokesperson said, "We are working to ensure that the introduction of the '05' numbers causes as little disruption as possible. We will be consulting with businesses and other stakeholders as we develop our plans."
The spokesperson also pointed out that companies would have plenty of notice before the new numbers are introduced. They would have at least a year to prepare for the changes, which would be rolled out gradually over a two-year period.
The announcement of the telephone prefix overhaul comes at a challenging time for businesses, many of which are struggling due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The changes will be an additional burden on companies that are already facing financial difficulties.
Overall, businesses are concerned that the telephone prefix overhaul will be a significant disruption with difficult consequences for them and their customers. They are calling for greater transparency and consultation from Ofcom to minimize the impact on UK businesses.
