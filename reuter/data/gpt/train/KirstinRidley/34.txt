National Grid, the British multinational electricity and gas utility company, is reportedly considering selling a majority stake in its subsidiary, Energis, to strategic investors. According to sources familiar with the matter, the move comes as National Grid seeks to focus on its core business of transmitting and distributing gas and electricity.
Energis, a telecoms provider, was acquired by National Grid in 2002 for £390m ($535m). The subsidiary operates an extensive fiber-optic network across the UK, providing connectivity to businesses and public sector organisations. However, Energis has struggled in recent years, facing increased competition and declining revenues.
The sale of a majority stake in Energis is expected to attract interest from a range of strategic investors, including private equity firms and telecoms operators. The move could enable National Grid to unlock value from its investment in Energis, while also providing the subsidiary with the resources and expertise needed to accelerate its growth.
"We are constantly reviewing our portfolio of businesses to ensure they align with our strategic priorities and generate value for shareholders," a National Grid spokesperson said. "As part of this ongoing process, we are considering options for Energis that will enable it to achieve its full potential."
The potential sale of Energis comes as National Grid faces increased scrutiny from regulators over the management of its gas and electricity networks. The company announced in May 2021 that it would invest £10bn ($14bn) in upgrading its networks over the next five years, in order to meet the UK's net zero emissions target by 2050.
The sale of a majority stake in Energis would provide National Grid with additional resources to invest in its core business. The company has been exploring various options for Energis, including a sale or partial flotation, for several months. According to reports, National Grid has already held discussions with potential buyers, although no deal has yet been agreed.
If a sale of Energis goes ahead, it would mark a significant shift for National Grid, which has traditionally focused on its gas and electricity transmission and distribution businesses. The company has been selling off non-core assets in recent years, in order to streamline its operations and focus on delivering reliable and affordable energy to consumers.
As the UK transitions to a low-carbon economy, National Grid will play a critical role in delivering the infrastructure needed to support renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. The sale of Energis could provide the company with increased flexibility to invest in this critical area, while also unlocking value for shareholders.
Overall, the potential sale of a majority stake in Energis reflects National Grid's continued efforts to streamline its operations and focus on its core business. The move could enable the subsidiary to accelerate its growth and compete more effectively in the competitive telecoms market, while also providing National Grid with additional resources to invest in its energy networks.
