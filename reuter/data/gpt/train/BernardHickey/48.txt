News Corp, the multinational mass media corporation owned by Rupert Murdoch, has reported a lower than expected profit for the first half of the year 1996/97. Despite the dip, the company remains optimistic about achieving a 20% profit boost for the entire year.
News Corp released its financial results for the six months ending December 31st, 1996, showing a net income of US$800 million, which was nearly US$150 million less than the same period in 1995. The company's revenue increased by 14%, reaching US$12.8 billion, primarily due to the consolidation of Fox into News Corp's accounts.
The result was largely due to weaker performances by several of the company's major businesses, such as the film division and newspapers. News Corp's filmed entertainment unit, which includes 20th Century Fox, recorded a 22% drop in operating income to US$543 million, which the company blamed on the disappointing box office performance of several films. Meanwhile, News Corp's newspaper operations, including The Times and The Sun in the UK, saw profits decline by 9% as a result of weak advertising revenue.
However, News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch said the company remained confident in its ability to achieve its previously announced 20% profit boost for the whole year, citing an anticipated growth in the company's core broadcasting and cable businesses. "We are pleased with the progress we are making in building our global media businesses," he said. "We expect that earnings in our television and cable businesses will accelerate as we invest further in these high-growth areas, and we are taking steps to improve performance in our other operations."
Murdoch pointed to the success of News Corp's broadcasting division, which includes Fox Broadcasting and BSkyB, as a key driver of future growth. The division recorded a 55% increase in operating income to US$343 million, thanks to increased advertising revenue from the Super Bowl and the World Series.
News Corp also highlighted the future opportunities presented by the rapidly growing digital media landscape. The company recently launched Australia's first free-to-air 24-hour sports channel, which Murdoch said was "the first impact of implementing our vision for broadcast and digital convergence across News Corp's global operations".
Despite the lower than expected profit result, News Corp's share price rose by 3.8% in New York trading to US$22.125, reflecting a general sense of optimism about the company's future prospects. Analysts were generally bullish about the company's long-term outlook, with several noting the strong growth potential of its international broadcasting operations.
However, some expressed concern about the weakness in News Corp's newspaper division, which has traditionally been a key source of revenue for the company. "The newspaper industry is experiencing a structural decline in demand for print advertising, and we expect sluggish advertising growth to weigh on News Corp's print revenue growth," said Daniel Salmon, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.
Overall, the first half profit result represents a minor setback for News Corp, which has recently been focusing on expanding its global media empire. However, the company's aggressive expansion strategy, combined with its strong position in the rapidly growing digital media landscape, means that many analysts expect News Corp to remain a major player in the industry for years to come.
