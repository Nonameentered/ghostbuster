Westpac, one of Australia's largest banks, has warned its shareholders of flat profits for the financial year 2021 due to fierce competition in the banking industry. The bank reported a 12% decline in its half-year net profit to $3.2 billion, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy as well as the intense competition in the market.
In a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange on Monday, Westpac attributed the flat profits to "unrelenting competition," which is putting pressure on margins and lending volumes. The bank's Chief Executive Officer, Peter King, also pointed out that the low interest rate environment is making it more challenging for banks to generate returns, as customers are looking for better deals on loans and deposits.
"Competition is always intense in our industry, but we are seeing the level of competition grow even further, with smaller players' aggressively expanding and new entrants entering the market," said Mr. King. "This puts further pressure on our margins and we need to actively manage our expenses."
In response to the challenging conditions, Westpac has implemented a cost-cutting program that aims to reduce expenses by $2 billion by the end of 2024. The bank has already closed 50 branches and plans to close another 64 by the end of this year. The bank is also reducing its workforce by approximately 1,000 positions by the end of 2021, as part of its efforts to streamline operations and improve efficiency.
Despite the challenging conditions, Westpac remains optimistic about its prospects for the future. The bank is investing in technology to improve its service offerings and attract new customers, with a particular focus on digital banking and mobile app enhancements.
"We are investing in our people, technology, and infrastructure to continue to compete effectively in the market," said Mr. King. "We are confident that our long-term strategy will deliver sustainable growth, generate value for our shareholders, and meet the evolving needs of our customers."
The news of Westpac's warning comes amid growing concerns about the impact of competition on Australia's banking industry. Australia's four major banks – Westpac, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, and National Australia Bank – have dominated the market for decades, but have come under increasing pressure from smaller players and international tech giants such as Amazon and Google.
The rise of buy now, pay later (BNPL) services such as Afterpay and Zip Co has also disrupted the traditional banking industry, as customers are increasingly turning to these services for short-term loans, rather than using their credit cards or personal loans. According to a recent report by KPMG, the BNPL market in Australia is expected to be worth $24 billion by 2023, putting further pressure on the banks' lending volumes and margins.
The intensifying competition in the market has also led to calls for regulatory reform, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) recently launching an inquiry into the BNPL sector. The ACCC is expected to release its findings later this year, with the potential for new regulations or increased oversight of the sector.
In conclusion, the warning from Westpac highlights the challenges facing Australia's banking sector, as traditional players face increasing competition from newer, more agile players. The low interest rate environment is making it more challenging for banks to generate returns, while the rise of BNPL services and international tech giants is disrupting the market. However, Westpac's investment in technology and cost-cutting program demonstrates its commitment to adapting to the changing conditions and remaining competitive in the long term.
