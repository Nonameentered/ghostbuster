In a landmark deal that effectively breaks ties with the British founder of Macquarie Bank, the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA) has acquired a 13.4 percent stake in the Australian bank, becoming its largest individual shareholder.
The sale was announced on Tuesday, with the Brunei Investment Agency purchasing a large chunk of shares from the estate of the late Australian banker, David Clarke. Clarke, who was a co-founder of Macquarie Bank, passed away in 2014.
The BIA is the sovereign wealth fund of Brunei, a small oil-rich nation on the north coast of Borneo. The fund was established in 1983 to invest the country's oil revenue and has since grown into a major player in the world of asset management, with a portfolio valued at more than $30 billion.
The acquisition of a significant stake in Macquarie Bank is a major coup for the BIA, which has been looking to expand its investment portfolio beyond its traditional holdings in real estate, infrastructure, and energy.
In a statement released on Tuesday, the BIA said that the purchase of the stake in Macquarie Bank was part of a broader strategy to diversify its investments. "We see this as a strategic investment opportunity in a leading financial institution and a natural fit for our long-term investment goals," said the statement.
The sale also marks a significant development in the history of Macquarie Bank, which was founded in Sydney in 1969 by a group of Australian entrepreneurs, including David Clarke. The bank has since grown into a global financial services firm with operations in 28 countries and a market capitalization of over $30 billion.
However, despite its success, Macquarie Bank has faced controversy in recent years over its relationship with its British founder and former chairman, Frank Lowy. Lowy, who is now in his nineties, has been accused of using his position at the bank to benefit his other business interests, including the ownership of shopping centers in the UK and US.
The acquisition of a significant stake in Macquarie Bank by the BIA is expected to mark the end of any formal ties between the bank and its British founder, and is likely to strengthen the bank's relationship with its new Brunei-based shareholder.
The BIA has a track record of investing in high-quality assets, and is known for taking a long-term approach to its investments. The acquisition of a significant stake in Macquarie Bank is likely to be viewed as a vote of confidence in the future of the bank, and could prompt other investment funds to take a closer look at the opportunities presented by the Australian financial services sector.
Overall, the sale is expected to be seen as a significant development in the ongoing evolution of the global financial services industry, and could have a lasting impact on the future of banking and investment.
