According to sources, Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate, News Corp, is under immense pressure to achieve its 20% growth target or face dire consequences. The company has been struggling financially for quite some time, with declining advertising revenue and the rise of digital media leaving a significant dent in its profits.
The 20% growth target, which the company set for itself in 2018, is seen as a last-ditch effort to revive News Corp's ailing fortunes. However, with just a few months left to go until the end of the financial year, it seems increasingly unlikely that the company will be able to hit the mark.
If News Corp fails to meet its growth target, the consequences could be severe. Shareholders are likely to be unhappy with the dismal performance and could call for drastic measures to be taken, including a change in leadership.
To avoid such an outcome, News Corp is desperately seeking ways to boost its profits and achieve the targeted growth. One of the strategies being considered is a major restructuring of the company's operations. Reports suggest that News Corp is mulling over a plan to consolidate its various media properties into a single entity, with a focus on digital content delivery.
Another approach being considered is to sell off some of the company's less profitable assets, such as its regional newspapers. One source revealed that News Corp is currently in talks with potential buyers for several of these papers, but it's unclear whether any deals will be struck in time to make a difference to the company's performance this year.
Despite these efforts, the outlook for News Corp remains bleak. Industry experts point out that the media landscape has changed significantly in recent years, with digital media replacing traditional print and TV as the dominant player. News Corp has been slow to adapt to this new reality, and as a result, it is struggling to keep up with its more nimble competitors.
There are also concerns about the company's financial stability. News Corp has been carrying a significant amount of debt for some time, and with revenues continuing to decline, there are fears that it may not be able to service its debt obligations in the long run.
In conclusion, News Corp is under intense pressure to achieve its 20% growth target before the end of the financial year. The consequences of failing to do so could be severe, with shareholders likely to demand a radical change in strategy. While the company is exploring various options to boost its profits, the outlook remains bleak. News Corp needs to act fast and decisively if it hopes to turn its fortunes around and remain relevant in the digital age.
