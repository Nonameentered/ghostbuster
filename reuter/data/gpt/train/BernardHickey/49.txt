News Corp's First Half Profit Below Expectations, But Company Remains Confident in 20% Boost for Full Year
News Corp, the global media company owned by Rupert Murdoch, saw its first-half earnings fall below expectations due to a decline in advertising revenues, but the company remains confident in its ability to achieve a 20% boost in profit for the full year.
According to the company's financial results released on Thursday, News Corp's total revenue for the first half of the 2021 fiscal year was $4.93 billion, down 3% from the same period in the previous year. The company's net income for the period was $261 million, or $0.36 per share, compared with $103 million, or $0.14 per share, in the prior-year period.
The decline in revenue was largely attributed to a drop in advertising revenue across the company's print and digital divisions, including its flagship newspaper, The Wall Street Journal. News Corp's news and information services division, which includes its newspapers and websites, saw revenue decline by 9% to $1.20 billion in the first half of the fiscal year.
However, the company's book publishing division, HarperCollins, reported a 23% increase in revenue to $864 million, driven by strong sales of popular titles such as "A Promised Land" by former President Barack Obama and "Greenlights" by actor Matthew McConaughey.
Despite the downturn in advertising revenue, News Corp remains optimistic about its financial performance for the full year, projecting a 20% increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The company attributes this forecast to a rebound in advertising revenue as the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Our businesses are well positioned to continue to recover as the world slowly moves beyond the pandemic," News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said in a statement. "We remain confident in our ability to accelerate our growth and our focus on digital businesses, which have seen particular success over the past year."
To achieve its anticipated growth, News Corp is focusing on expanding its digital businesses and diversifying its revenue streams. The company plans to launch a news aggregation platform, Knewz, which will allow readers to discover and share articles from a variety of news sources.
In addition, News Corp is exploring new advertising opportunities, such as partnering with Google to allow the search engine to display news content from the company's newspapers. The company is also pursuing investments in growth areas such as digital real estate services and online education.
"We are actively investing in and creating new digital businesses to support our growth trajectory and increase our presence in new markets," Thomson said.
News Corp's performance in the first half of the fiscal year was broadly in line with expectations, although the decline in advertising revenue weighed on the company's earnings. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about the company's prospects for the full year, citing the potential for a rebound in advertising revenue and continued growth in digital businesses.
"So long as they continue to focus on digital and are able to catch up with or even surpass the likes of other media behemoths like Facebook and Google, there's definitely room for them to grow," said Sari Holtz, an analyst at CFRA Research.
News Corp's share price has risen by around 15% since the beginning of the year, outperforming the broader market. The company's stock closed at $23.85 on Thursday, up 2.6% for the day.
In summary, News Corp's first-half profit fell below expectations due to a decline in advertising revenue, but the company is confident in its ability to achieve a 20% boost for the full year. The company is focused on expanding its digital businesses and diversifying its revenue streams to support its growth trajectory. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about News Corp's future prospects, citing the potential for a rebound in advertising revenue and continued growth in digital businesses.
