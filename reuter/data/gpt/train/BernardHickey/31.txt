Australian Bank Margins Squeezed as Competition Forces Faster Rate Cuts to Mortgage Customers
Australian banks are feeling the heat as competition in the mortgage market continues to mount. The four major banks, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac and National Australia Bank (NAB), are facing increased pressure as they find themselves competing with smaller lenders and non-bank institutions for market share. This competition is forcing banks to offer quicker and deeper rate cuts to their mortgage customers which is squeezing margins. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has already cut the official cash rate to a record low of 0.75% to stimulate the economy, however, the major banks have struggled to pass on these rate cuts in full to their customers. ANZ and Commonwealth Bank have passed on only 63 bps and 70 bps of the RBA's 75 bps reduction. Westpac and NAB have passed on 80 bps each. 
This has provided an opportunity for smaller lenders and non-bank institutions to eat into the major banks' market share, offering lower mortgage rates and better deals for customers. According to research by Canstar, the number of lenders slashing their fixed rates has soared from 70 to 77 in three months, a clear indication that competition is fierce. 
Borrowers are paying attention. The proportion of loans being originated by the big four banks has fallen from 84.4% in 2015 to 77.8% in 2019, according to the latest figures from APRA. NAB's chief executive, Ross McEwan, has acknowledged that the banks are losing market share despite the dominance they once held and this is putting even more pressure on margins. 
The major banks have had to cut rates more than 100 bps below their respective 2019 peaks in response to this intense competition. Commonwealth Bank and NAB have gone to the extent of lowering interest rates below 3% for some of their fixed-rate mortgages, a level not seen since the 1950s. This has contributed to a decline in the net interest margin at the big four banks, a key measure of profitability, down from 2.15% in 2016 to 1.95% in the first half of 2019, according to APRA. 
The pressure on margins has led to a decline in bank earnings. The combined cash profit of the big four banks fell 6.3% to $27.4bn in the 2019 financial year, driven by higher remediation costs, lower non-interest income and higher bad debt charges. Banks had to make provisions for customer remediation due to a string of scandals uncovered by the Royal Commission last year which also added to pressure on margins. 
The banks' response has been to focus on cost-cutting measures, as well as lifting fees and charges across various products. Commonwealth Bank CEO, Matt Comyn, has said that profitability would remain under pressure until interest rates start to rise again. This is unlikely to happen anytime soon as the RBA has paused on further rate cuts, preferring to wait and see how the recent cuts impact the economy. 
The federal government has also put pressure on the banks to pass on the RBA rate cuts in full to their customers. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has recently announced an independent inquiry into the banks' refusal to pass on the full savings to borrowers. This has put further pressure on the banks to act in the best interest of customers or risk further damaging their reputation. 
The competition is expected to be even more fierce in 2020 as more lenders enter the market. Smaller lenders are increasingly using technology to streamline their processes and offer lower rates to customers. Non-bank institutions are also expanding their product offerings and competing head-on with banks. For example, Qudos Bank, a small lender based in New South Wales, is offering a fixed rate of just 2.84% for four years.
The challenge for banks is to innovate and differentiate their offerings to remain competitive. Banks could focus on diversifying their revenue streams or developing new products to attract customers. It may be more difficult for banks with fewer resources to compete against non-bank lenders and there could be a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector. 
In conclusion, increased competition in the mortgage market is putting pressure on the major banks' margins. Smaller lenders and non-bank institutions are offering lower rates and better deals, eating into the major banks' market share. This has forced the big four to cut rates quicker and deeper to customers and this is squeezing margins. It remains to be seen how this will impact bank earnings in the long run and whether the banks will be able to remain competitive in the face of disruptive new entrants.
