Brambles Industries has reported a profit lift of 15.8% despite the flat conditions of the Australian and European economies. The company, which operates in more than 60 countries, announced its half-year results for the period ending December 31, 2020, on Tuesday.
Brambles' revenue for the half-year reached $2.4 billion, while the underlying profit rose to $442.9 million. The company also reported a strong cash flow of $523.3 million, which is up 15.2% from the previous year. The positive results were driven by the company's focus on sustainable and efficient operations during the pandemic, which helped to reduce costs and increase profit margins.
Despite the challenging economic environment, Brambles' pallets and containers pooling business, CHEP, had a revenue growth of 5.5%. This was mainly due to growth in long-term customers and strong demand in North America, particularly in the retail and consumer goods sectors. Additionally, strong volume growth in the Asia-Pacific region helped to offset weaker volumes in Europe due to the pandemic-related disruptions in the market.
Brambles' CEO Graham Chipchase said the results demonstrate the company's ability to navigate through challenging markets while remaining resilient.
"We are pleased with our half-year results, which are a testament to the strength of our business model and our commitment to long-term customer partnerships," Chipchase said.
"Despite the continued macroeconomic challenges in Europe and Australia, we maintained our focus on delivering sustainable operations, promoting circular economy, and reducing operational costs by increasing the use of automation and technology," he added.
Chipchase said that the company is continuing to invest in new technologies and innovation to drive its sustainability goals. He also emphasized the importance of maintaining a safe working environment for employees and customers amid the ongoing pandemic.
Brambles' positive half-yearly results have been welcomed by the company's shareholders. The company's share price has risen by more than 2% since the announcement of the results.
Looking ahead, Brambles has maintained its guidance for the full year, with an underlying profit in the range of $839 million to $874 million. The company expects growth in revenue for its emerging markets, such as Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, while it anticipates changes in the global supply chain, increased automation, and digitalization will continue to be significant trends shaping the business.
In conclusion, Brambles Industries' half-yearly results have shown that despite the challenging economic conditions, the company has managed to maintain a strong financial position. With a focus on sustainability and innovation, Brambles is well-positioned to navigate through the uncertain future of global markets.
