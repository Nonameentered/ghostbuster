Goodman Fielder Ltd, the leading food producer in Australia and New Zealand, is expected to report a slightly higher annual net profit despite higher grain costs. The company attributed the increase to solid demand for its products and its cost-cutting measures.
The annual net profit is projected to rise from AUD 64.4 million last year to around AUD 68 million this year. This reflects a growth rate of about 5.6%, which is modest but impressive given the challenging market conditions. The company's revenue is expected to be slightly lower than last year, at AUD 2.3 billion, due to weaker commodity prices for wheat and other grains.
Goodman Fielder has been able to achieve higher profits by implementing several measures to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs. By optimizing its production process, streamlining the supply chain, and reducing the workforce, the company has been able to offset the impact of higher grain prices.
"The success of our business in the current challenging environment is a testament to our resilience and ability to adapt to changing market conditions," said Goodman Fielder CEO, Chris Delaney. "Our focus on cost management, innovation and a strong product portfolio has enabled us to navigate through the tough times and emerge stronger."
Looking ahead, Goodman Fielder expects to continue to face headwinds from higher commodity prices, particularly those relating to grains. However, the company remains confident in its ability to maintain its profitability by leveraging its brand strength, expanding its product range and investing in growth opportunities.
"We remain committed to our strategy of delivering sustainable growth through innovation, investment and deepening customer relationships," added Delaney. "We will continue to focus on developing new products and expanding into new markets while maintaining our operational focus on efficiency and cost management."
Goodman Fielder's annual report is scheduled to be released in the coming weeks, and the company will announce the final results for the year ending 30 June 2021. Investors and analysts will be eagerly waiting to see whether the company has been able to deliver on its promises of sustained profitability amidst higher input costs.
