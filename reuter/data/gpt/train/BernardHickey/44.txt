TNT Ltd, a leading logistics and transportation company, has recently announced its plans to divest itself of non-core businesses as it positions itself for strong profit growth.
The company has stated that it will continue to focus on its core business of providing courier, express and parcel (CEP) services to customers worldwide. This means that several of its unprofitable assets, including its freight forwarding and logistics solutions businesses, will be sold off. TNT Ltd announced the sale of its freight forwarding business last year and has recently signed an agreement to sell its logistics solutions business to XPO Logistics, a global provider of transportation and logistics solutions.
"TNT Ltd is committed to achieving sustainable growth and profitability," said the company's CEO, Ruth Bussey. "We believe that by divesting our non-core businesses, we can better focus on providing our core services to our customers and capture the opportunities in the global CEP market."
This move is expected to result in significant cost savings for TNT Ltd. The company has already achieved impressive results from its ongoing cost-cutting program, which has resulted in a reduction in operating costs and improved earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The divestment of its non-core businesses is expected to further reduce costs and improve profitability.
In addition to these cost-cutting measures, TNT Ltd is also investing in technology and innovation to improve its services and enhance customer experience. The company has recently launched its new CEP platform, which provides customers with a seamless and integrated experience across all of its services. This platform uses advanced logistics technology to optimize deliveries, track shipments and ensure timely and efficient customer service.
"TNT Ltd is committed to providing innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers," said Bussey. "We believe that our investments in technology and innovation, coupled with our renewed focus on our core business, will enable us to continue to grow and strengthen our position in the global CEP market."
Overall, the divestment of non-core businesses and the focus on core services, combined with investments in technology and innovation, position TNT Ltd for strong profit growth in the coming years. The company's management team remains committed to delivering value for shareholders and providing high-quality services to customers around the world.
