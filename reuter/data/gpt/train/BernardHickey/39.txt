“This project will be a game-changer for the market industry in Asia, and we’re excited to be partnering with Modern Home to bring it to fruition,” said Lend Lease Asia CEO, Tony Lombardo. “This complex isn’t just about a physical space, but it’s about creating a platform for economic growth and social development in the region.”
The complex will feature a range of marketplaces including a fresh food market, a fashion market, a technology market, and a lifestyle market. The design of the complex will be sustainable and incorporate eco-friendly features such as solar panels and rainwater harvesting systems.
Modern Home CEO, Pornsak Boonlert, said the complex would be a boon for entrepreneurs and businesses looking to tap into the growing markets in Southeast Asia.
“This complex will be a one-stop-shop for all types of businesses, whether you’re a start-up or an established player in the market industry,” he said. “We’re creating a platform for businesses to thrive and connect with customers within the region.”
Boonlert added that the complex would also enhance Bangkok’s reputation as a regional economic center and attract more foreign investment into the country.
The project is expected to take five years to complete, with construction set to begin in 2022. The Thai government has expressed its support for the project, citing its potential to boost the country’s economy and create jobs for its citizens.
“This project is in line with our vision to make Thailand the hub of ASEAN and connect with other regions of the world,” said Thai Prime Minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha. “We welcome this initiative and hope that it will contribute to the development of our economy.”
The market complex is the latest in a series of high-profile projects undertaken by Lend Lease, which has a strong presence in Asia Pacific. The company has developed several large-scale infrastructure projects in the region, including the Barangaroo South project in Sydney and the Paya Lebar Quarter development in Singapore.
Lombardo said the market complex would be a flagship project for Lend Lease in Asia and demonstrate the company’s commitment to sustainable development and community engagement.
“We’re proud to be associated with this project, which has the potential to transform the market industry in Asia and create lasting economic and social benefits for the region,” he said. “It’s an opportunity for us to showcase our expertise in sustainable construction and demonstrate our commitment to the communities we serve.”
