Australia's second-largest bank, Westpac Banking Corp Ltd, is expected to face a slowdown in its profit growth due to increasing competition in the home loan sector, according to industry analysts.
Westpac's home loan portfolio has been a key driver of the bank's profits in recent years, but it now faces intense competition from smaller lenders and digital disruptors such as online mortgage broker Uno Home Loans and ANZ-backed fintech Athena.
As a result, Westpac's profit growth in the home loan sector is likely to slow down over the next few years, analysts say. In addition, the bank is also facing regulatory pressure in the wake of the Royal Commission into banking misconduct, which has led to increased scrutiny of the sector.
To counter these challenges, Westpac Chief Executive Brian Hartzer has outlined a strategy to boost the bank's digital capabilities and focus more on customer service. The bank has also launched new initiatives, such as a partnership with Airbnb to offer home-sharing insurance, in a bid to diversify its revenue streams.
Despite the headwinds facing Westpac, the bank reported a solid first-half profit of AUD 4.25 billion ($2.9 billion) in May. However, the bank has warned that its full-year profit growth is likely to be at the lower end of its target range of 4 to 7 percent.
