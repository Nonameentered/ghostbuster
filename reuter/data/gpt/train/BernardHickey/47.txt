New York City - News Corp, the global media company, has released its financial results for the fiscal year 1996/97. The company has reported a lower than expected profit, which has taken investors by surprise. However, News Corp remains confident that it will see a 20 percent boost in profits for the full year.
According to the company's financial report, News Corp's net profit for the year ended June 30, 1997, was $1.03 billion, a nine percent increase from the previous year. However, this figure was below analysts' expectations of $1.08 billion.
The company's revenue for the year was $16.7 billion, which was in line with expectations and was a 17 percent increase from the previous year. The revenue growth was driven by strong performances from its cable and television divisions.
News Corp's cable division, which includes Fox News and FX, reported a 41 percent increase in operating income, while its television division, which includes Fox Broadcasting and the Fox Network, reported a 15 percent increase in operating income.
The company's newspaper division, which includes the Wall Street Journal and the Times of London, reported a five percent increase in operating income. However, the division's performance was affected by the stronger U.S. dollar, which hurt the company's overseas operations.
News Corp's film division, which includes 20th Century Fox, reported a 19 percent decrease in operating income. The division's performance was affected by the box-office disappointment of several films, including "The Devil's Own" and "The Edge."
Despite the lower than expected profit for the year, News Corp's CEO Rupert Murdoch remained optimistic about the company's prospects. He said that the company had made significant investments in its businesses, which would lead to increased profits in the future.
"We are confident that the investments we have made in our businesses will continue to pay off," Murdoch said. "We remain focused on our goal of building long-term value for our shareholders."
News Corp's shares fell 3.5 percent following the release of the financial results. However, analysts remained cautious about the company's prospects for the future.
"News Corp is facing significant competition in its core businesses, and it remains to be seen how well the company will be able to navigate these challenges," said David Katz, an analyst at Matrix Asset Management. "While we remain cautiously optimistic about the company's long-term prospects, we will be closely monitoring its performance in the coming quarters."
In conclusion, News Corp has reported a lower than expected profit for the 1996/97 fiscal year, but remains confident of a 20 percent boost in profits for the full year. While the company's revenue growth was strong, some of its divisions, such as the film division, struggled during the year. The company's CEO, Rupert Murdoch, remains optimistic about the company's prospects and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders.
