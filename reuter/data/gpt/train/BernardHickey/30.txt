Wealthy Baby Boomers in Australia are becoming increasingly disillusioned with banks and superannuation funds, with a recent survey showing that more than a third of them are considering moving their investments out of the traditional fund management sector.
The survey was conducted by InvestSMART, a digital investment platform, and aimed to capture the sentiment of wealthy Baby Boomers who have a minimum net worth of AUD 1.5 million.
According to the survey, 38% of wealthy Baby Boomers are considering moving their investments away from traditional superannuation funds and banks, with 46% citing the high fees and lack of transparency as their key reasons for doing so.
The study highlighted a growing trend of wealthy Baby Boomers opting for self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) or investing directly in shares or property. In fact, 36% of the respondents said they already have an SMSF, and almost half of them plan to invest more in property in the next couple of years.
John McMurdo, the CEO of InvestSMART, said that the findings of the study are significant because Baby Boomers represent the largest group of investors in Australia with a total investable wealth of more than AUD 1.6 trillion.
"This growing disillusionment with traditional fund management and banking products represents a significant shift in the way high net worth individuals in Australia are thinking about their investments," McMurdo said.
He added that the traditional model of investing through a financial planner or bank has failed to deliver sufficient value for money for many Baby Boomers who are demanding more flexibility, control and transparency over their investments.
"The wealth management industry has been sitting on its hands, and their lack of innovation has left them vulnerable to disruption by digital investment platforms like InvestSMART," McMurdo said.
The survey also found that Baby Boomers are more concerned about the impact of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on their investments, with 55% stating that they would like their investments to be aligned with their values.
"Baby Boomers are becoming increasingly aware of the social and environmental risks associated with traditional fossil fuel-based investments, and are looking for investment options that align with their values," McMurdo said.
The survey suggests that the wealth management sector needs to adapt to the changing needs and preferences of wealthy Baby Boomers by offering more ESG-aligned investment options and reducing their fees.
"If traditional fund managers want to retain their high net worth clients, they need to reduce their fees and be more transparent about their investment strategies," McMurdo said.
In conclusion, the survey highlights a shift in the investment preferences of wealthy Baby Boomers and suggests that traditional banks and superannuation funds need to adapt to remain relevant in the digital age. The findings also suggest that ESG factors are becoming increasingly important for wealthy investors who are looking for investment options that align with their values.
