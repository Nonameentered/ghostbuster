The Financial System Inquiry (FSI) in Australia is considering changes to the regulations governing bank mergers and foreign takeovers. The inquiry was called by the Australian government in late 2013 to review the country's financial system, and its report was released in late 2014. The report contained 44 recommendations, and the government has been working to implement them ever since.
One of the recommendations made by the FSI was to review the current restrictions on bank mergers and foreign takeovers. Currently, there are restrictions on mergers and takeovers that result in a combined market share of more than 20% in any given market or region. The FSI has suggested that this threshold be raised, which would make it easier for banks to merge or be taken over by foreign firms.
The FSI argues that increasing the threshold would allow for greater competition in the banking sector, which would benefit consumers. Currently, Australia's banking sector is dominated by four major banks: Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ Bank, and National Australia Bank. These four banks control over 80% of the country's banking assets, and there are relatively few smaller banks or non-bank lenders operating in the market.
According to the FSI, increasing the threshold for bank mergers and foreign takeovers would allow smaller banks and new entrants to the market to compete more effectively with the big four. This would help to diversify the banking sector and make it more resilient to financial shocks.
The proposal, however, has received mixed reactions. While some experts have welcomed the proposal, others have expressed concerns about the potential impact on competition and the stability of the banking sector.
Some critics argue that raising the threshold for mergers and takeovers could lead to a decrease in competition, as larger banks would have even more power to dominate the market. This could lead to higher prices for consumers and a reduction in innovation.
Others have raised concerns about the potential risks associated with foreign takeovers. Foreign banks may not have the same level of understanding of the Australian banking sector as local firms, and this could lead to risks in the event of a financial crisis.
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), which regulates the banking sector, has also expressed reservations about the proposal. In a submission to the inquiry, APRA argued that the current regulations have been effective in maintaining competition and stability in the banking sector.
Despite these concerns, the government is reportedly in favour of the proposal and is considering implementing the recommendation. The government has argued that increasing the threshold for mergers and takeovers would help to promote competition and innovation in the banking sector, which would ultimately benefit consumers.
The proposed changes to the regulations governing bank mergers and foreign takeovers have the potential to significantly alter the banking landscape in Australia. While the proposal has received support from some quarters, there are also concerns about the potential risks and negative impacts on competition and stability in the banking sector. Ultimately, it will be up to the government to balance these considerations and determine whether to implement the FSI's recommendations.
