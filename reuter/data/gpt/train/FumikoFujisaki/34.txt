Tokyo, Japan â€“ Nomura Securities Group, one of Japan's largest financial services groups, has announced a merger of its asset management firms in an effort to consolidate its operations and expand its presence in the domestic market. The move is expected to create a top player in the fast-growing asset management industry in Japan.
Nomura Asset Management Co., Ltd. (NAM) and sister brand DIAM Co., Ltd. (DIAM) will merge to form a new firm with a combined assets under management (AUM) of around JPY 51 trillion ($452 billion). The merger is expected to take place on April 1, 2022, subject to regulatory approvals.
Nomura sees the merger as a strategic move aimed at strength in numbers. The merger will allow the new firm to share resources and reduce duplication of processes, resulting in cost savings and improved efficiency.
"Through this integration, we aim to create a top-tier asset management firm in Japan with increased scale, enhanced capabilities, and a stronger competitive position," says Kentaro Okuda, President and CEO of Nomura Holdings, Inc.
Following the merger, NAM and DIAM will maintain their respective branding and continue to operate independently. However, both firms will be united under the newly created shared services entity, which will provide back-office support functions for both companies.
The merger will also create opportunities to leverage the expertise of both firms to expand their product offerings and innovate in ways that benefit their clients. Additionally, the combination of the two firms will increase the scale of the new entity and allow it to target large institutional investors both in Japan and abroad.
"The integration of NAM and DIAM is a significant step forward in our effort to strengthen our asset management business, and we believe it will lead to long-term growth," adds Okuda.
Nomura Securities is one of the leading players in the asset management industry in Japan, offering a broad range of investment products and services to its clients. The firm operates in several regions worldwide and manages AUM worth over JPY 40 trillion ($352 billion).
The merger of NAM and DIAM will further strengthen Nomura's position in the domestic market, where there is significant growth potential for the asset management industry due to increasing investor demand for diverse and innovative investment products.
"Japan's asset management industry is rapidly evolving, and there is an increasing need for sophisticated investment solutions to meet the needs of investors," says Okuda. "By combining our expertise and capabilities, we are well-positioned to meet these demands and capture the opportunities that emerge."
The merger is expected to be a win-win situation for Nomura as well as its clients and investors, as the new entity will be able to provide more comprehensive and diverse offerings while benefiting from improved operational efficiencies.
"At the end of the day, the integration of NAM and DIAM will enable us to better serve our clients and investors and create long-term value for all stakeholders," concludes Okuda.
