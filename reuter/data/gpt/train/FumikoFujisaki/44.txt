Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), one of Japan's largest financial institutions, has denied rumours that it is facing imminent collapse. This followed several days of market turmoil and heightened concerns about the bank's financial health.
In a statement, NCB said it was "strongly committed" to its business and had "ample capital and liquidity to meet its obligations". The bank added that it would continue to conduct its operations as usual and was "fully cooperating" with regulators.
The rumours of NCB's collapse began on Monday, when a local news outlet published a report suggesting that the bank was "on the brink of insolvency". The report cited unnamed sources who claimed that NCB was struggling to maintain its capital levels and was in talks with the government about a potential bailout.
The report triggered a sell-off in NCB's shares, with the stock dropping more than 20% in one day. The bank's bonds also saw heavy selling, pushing up yields and indicating that investors were losing confidence in the bank's creditworthiness.
However, NCB moved quickly to dispel the rumours, issuing a statement on Monday afternoon that said the bank "has been managing its business appropriately, making efforts to improve profitability and strengthen its capital base".
The bank's statement also highlighted its recent achievements, including an upgrade in its credit rating by Moody's Investors Service and the successful completion of a share buyback programme.
Despite NCB's assurances, the rumours have persisted, with some analysts suggesting that the bank's underlying financial position may be weaker than it appears.
One factor that has raised concerns is NCB's exposure to the commercial property market, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. The bank has significant loans to property developers and investors, and some observers fear that a wave of defaults could threaten its stability.
Another factor is the broader economic and financial environment in Japan, which has been beset by challenges in recent years, including the ageing population, slow growth, and deflation.
The Bank of Japan has tried to stimulate the economy through massive monetary easing, but the impact has been limited, and there are concerns that the central bank's balance sheet has become bloated.
Against this backdrop, NCB's denial of collapse rumours may not be enough to restore confidence in the bank. Some investors are likely to remain cautious, and the bank may face pressure to shore up its financial position through measures such as raising capital or selling assets.
At the same time, NCB's situation highlights the broader challenges facing the Japanese financial sector. The country's banks have struggled with low profitability for years, in part due to the low-interest-rate environment and fierce competition from non-bank lenders.
In addition, the sector has been plagued by a series of scandals and regulatory breaches, which have eroded public trust and raised concerns about the banks' risk management practices.
Some analysts argue that NCB's situation could be an opportunity for reform in the sector, as it may prompt regulators and policymakers to take a closer look at the banks' business models and governance structures.
However, any such reform would likely be slow and difficult, given the entrenched interests and complex regulatory framework of the Japanese financial sector.
In the meantime, NCB and its peers will continue to face pressure to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain their financial health in an uncertain environment.
