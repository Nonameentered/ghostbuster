Japan's ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has agreed to lift the ban on holding companies. The move is likely to benefit large corporations in the country and could lead to further consolidation in the industry.
Under the current law, companies in Japan are prohibited from owning more than 5% of the voting rights in other companies. The restriction is aimed at preventing monopolies and protecting shareholders' interests. However, the LDP argues that the rule has become outdated and needs to be reformed to encourage more investment and growth.
The decision was made at a meeting of the LDP's tax commission on Thursday. The party intends to submit a proposal to amend the Commercial Code, which regulates business activities in Japan, in the upcoming parliamentary session. The amendment is likely to receive support from other parties, as well as the business community.
The lifting of the ban is expected to benefit large companies, which often have to resort to complex structures such as cross-shareholdings and special-purpose vehicles to bypass the restrictions. The new rules would allow them to consolidate their businesses more easily and gain more control over their subsidiaries.
The move could also lead to a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the Japanese market. Companies that were previously unable to invest in other firms due to the restrictions will now have greater opportunities to do so. This could create more efficient and competitive businesses, but also raise concerns about the concentration of market power.
The lifting of the ban could also have implications for foreign investors in Japan. Currently, foreign companies are subject to stricter regulations than domestic ones when it comes to investing in other businesses. The new rules could level the playing field and make Japan a more attractive destination for foreign capital.
However, some experts warn that the lifting of the ban could exacerbate income inequality in Japan. Large companies that benefit from the new rules may focus more on maximizing profits and shareholder value, rather than investing in their workers or contributing to the broader economy. Small and medium-sized businesses, which make up the bulk of the Japanese economy, may find it difficult to compete with the power of giant conglomerates.
The move is part of a broader effort by the LDP and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to boost the Japanese economy, which has been struggling in recent years. The pandemic has only made matters worse, with the country's GDP contracting by 4.8% in 2020. The government has launched a massive stimulus package, but many experts believe that structural reforms are needed to achieve sustained growth.
The lifting of the ban is just one of the measures being considered by the government. Other proposals include promoting digitalization, encouraging more foreign investment, and dealing with the country's aging population and workforce. However, many of these reforms are likely to face stiff resistance from vested interests and conservative factions within the LDP.
The lifting of the ban on holding companies is a significant development in Japanese business and politics. While it could lead to more consolidation and competition in the market, it also raises concerns about inequality and market power. The government will need to carefully manage the transition and ensure that all stakeholders benefit from the new rules.
