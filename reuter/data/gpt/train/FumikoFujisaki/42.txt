In a striking move that could spur further deregulation of the Japanese stock market, a small securities house has managed to successfully break open the highly regulated stockbroking commission system in the country.
The company, whose name has not been disclosed, reportedly made the breakthrough by offering commission fees as low as 0.1% on trades, undercutting traditional brokers who charge as much as 1%. This had previously been deemed impossible under Japan's regulatory framework, which is one of the most restrictive in the world.
The highly regulated commission system has been in place since the Tokyo Stock Exchange was founded in 1878, with brokers charging fixed fees of around 1.5% for trades. The fees are split between the broker and the exchange, with the latter taking a cut of around 0.05%. The system has been in place for over a century and has long been seen as a barrier to entry for smaller competitors.
However, this all changed when the unidentified securities house managed to break through the barriers by taking advantage of a loophole in the regulations. Under the rules, brokers are allowed to charge fees of less than 1% if they can prove that their services are more efficient than those of their competitors.
The company was able to demonstrate that its technology and systems were more efficient than those of its competitors, enabling it to offer lower fees without sacrificing quality. This breakthrough could have a significant impact on the Japanese stock market, as it opens up the sector to smaller players who were previously unable to compete.
The regulatory change is consistent with the broader political direction in Japan towards market-led reforms. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has prioritized deregulation as a key component of his economic reform program, which aims to boost growth and attract foreign investment.
The deregulation of the stockbroking industry is just one part of this wider program, which has also seen changes to laws relating to capital gains taxes and investment in infrastructure projects. The government hopes that these measures will attract foreign investors to the Japanese market and spur growth in key sectors of the economy.
The breakthrough is likely to be welcomed by investors, who have long complained about the high costs associated with trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The move could also spur further competition in the sector, leading to greater innovation and more efficient trading practices.
While it remains to be seen how the traditional brokers will respond to this challenge, it is clear that the Japanese market is undergoing a period of significant change. As smaller players enter the fray and competition intensifies, it is likely that the next few years will be a period of rapid evolution for the industry.
