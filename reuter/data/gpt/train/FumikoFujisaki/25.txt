Japan's major banks have returned to profitability during the fiscal year despite recording hefty write-offs of problem loans. This remarkable recovery has been attributed to the country's better handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, a healthy real estate market, and higher revenues from stock and bond trading.
Mizuho Financial Group, one of Japan's three largest banks, announced a net profit of ¥777.9bn ($7.13bn) for the fiscal year that ended in March, an increase of 34% from the same period last year. It's the bank's first earnings increase in three years, and is due to the lower credit costs that occurred due to the improved economy and the measures that were implemented to offset the pandemic's impact.
The bank reported a net loss of ¥223.1bn in the previous fiscal year for marking drastic write-offs of loans to the troubled subprime lender, however, in the latest year, the bank reported ¥150.3bn as net credit-related losses, an 80% decrease from the previous fiscal year.
Meanwhile, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, another of the three major banks, announced ¥712.9bn in the fiscal year's profit, an increase of 34.8%. The bank disclosed relatively minor net credit-related losses of ¥15.8bn, which is not as extreme in comparison to the other two Japanese major banks, despite being hit hard by the pandemic's impact on their business loans from firms.
Nomura Holdings, one of Japan's biggest securities firms, posted a net profit of ¥507.6bn, a 3.8% decline, in the past fiscal year due to the two months of losses incurred from the Archegos Capital Management scandal in the United States. Despite the scandal, the firm disclosed improved income through trading revenue of ¥2.1tn reflecting the surge in commodity prices.
The reason behind the recovery of Japanese banks can be attributed to the government's timely measures and the Bank of Japan's monetary policy. Low-interest rates paved the way for a surge in the real estate market, which helped boost the banks' revenues through loans and mortgage transactions, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's bullish trend in the past fiscal year also helped boost the banks' income from stock trading.
However, the post-pandemic economic scenario and the upcoming Olympics pose a great challenge to Japan's economy and the banking sector. To retain the recovered ground and to navigate the challenges from further outbreak waves, banks' ability to respond according to economic changes and government policies will be of utmost importance.
In conclusion, Japan's major banks' return to profitability despite the hefty write-offs of problem loans is a sign of resilience and strength that the banking sector has shown. It is hoped that the banks continue to overcome future challenges and contribute to Japan's overall economic growth.
