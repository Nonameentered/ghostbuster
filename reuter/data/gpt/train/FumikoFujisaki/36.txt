A Finance Ministry official in Japan has made a bold statement suggesting that Tokyo Stock Exchange share trading could triple with the upcoming deregulation. The official made the comments during an interview on Tuesday, pointing out that deregulation will create a new investment avenue for retail investors and increase participation by foreign investors.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has been undergoing significant changes since the announcement of its integration with the Osaka Exchange (OSE) earlier this year. The integration, which is scheduled to take place next year, is expected to create a more efficient and competitive market, as well as change the way investors can access and invest in Japanese stocks.
However, the integration has raised regulatory concerns. To counter this, the government plans to ease some of the regulations, opening up the market and giving investors more options. For example, the government is considering adopting a rule that would allow listed companies to use English in their financial statements to attract more foreign investors.
According to the Finance Ministry official, the move towards deregulation will encourage more retail investors to participate in the market, as well as increase foreign investment. In fact, the integration of the TSE and OSE alone could see trading volumes triple within the next few years, the official said.
The official also pointed out that the deregulation will allow investors to have more flexibility in their investment options. Currently, investors in Japan are restricted to investing in listed shares through brokerage accounts, but the deregulation will enable them to invest in shares through online platforms and other marketplaces.
The deregulation will help create more competition in the market, as investors will have more options for investment. The official also noted that the Japanese government is planning to ease regulations on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which will make it easier for investors to invest in a diverse range of stocks.
Further, some experts are arguing that the deregulation will help put Japan's equity market on a more equal footing with markets in Europe and the US. The change could help generate new interest in Japanese stocks from foreign investors who have previously been put off by the market's rigid regulations.
While the Finance Ministry official acknowledged that there could be concerns over the deregulation, he stressed that the government would work to ensure that the changes were made in a responsible manner that would not undermine the integrity of the market.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is one of the largest exchanges in the world, with a market capitalization of around $6 trillion. It is a major hub for trading of Japanese equities and is home to more than 3,500 listed companies. Its integration with the Osaka Exchange will create an even larger market for investors to participate in.
The Finance Ministry official's comments come shortly after the resignation of the TSE's top executives, following a technical glitch that halted trading for an entire day earlier this month. The integration with the Osaka Exchange and the upcoming deregulation will present a fresh start for the exchange, as it seeks to restore confidence in the market.
Overall, the move towards deregulation of the Tokyo Stock Exchange is seen as a positive move for the Japanese market. It is hoped that the changes will encourage more retail investors to take an interest in trading, as well as attract more foreign investment. The government's plans to make the changes responsibly should also help to alleviate concerns over the regulation within the market.
