Japan's major commercial banks have returned to profitability in the first half of the current business year, according to their earnings reports released on Friday. This comes as a surprise turnaround after a string of weak earnings reports in recent years, which were largely due to a combination of low interest rates and slow economic growth.
Industry leader Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. reported a net profit of ¥666.1 billion ($6.1 billion) for the six months ended September, compared with a net loss of ¥73.6 billion ($673 million) a year earlier. The bank's operating profit for the period also increased to ¥1.038 trillion ($9.5 billion), up from ¥536 billion ($4.9 billion) in the same period last year.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. reported a net profit of ¥546.5 billion ($5 billion) for the period, up from a net loss of ¥253.6 billion ($2.3 billion) in the same period last year. Its operating profit also more than doubled from ¥278.7 billion ($2.5 billion) to ¥594 billion ($5.4 billion).
Meanwhile, Mizuho Financial Group Inc. reported a net profit of ¥319.5 billion ($2.9 billion), up from ¥196.9 billion ($1.8 billion) a year earlier. Its operating profit also increased to ¥605.5 billion ($5.5 billion), up from ¥452.5 billion ($4.1 billion) in the same period last year.
The chief executive of MUFG, Hironori Kamezawa, credited the bank's strong performance to a shift in strategy away from traditional lending and towards fee-based businesses, such as asset management and investment banking. This has helped the bank to offset the negative impact of low interest rates on its earnings.
"[The] results reflect the steady implementation of our three-year corporate strategy that shifted to a new growth model with a focus on global business," Kamezawa said in a statement.
Similarly, Sumitomo Mitsui's CEO, Jun Ohta, said that the bank's improving results were due to a focus on fee-based businesses, diversification of its portfolio, and cost-cutting measures.
"We made steady progress in executing our strategy, we were able to expand our fee business by promoting digital services and strengthening sales channels," Ohta said in a press conference after the earnings release.
The banks also said that loan demand remained solid in Japan, despite the pandemic, as companies sought to secure funds to weather the economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This, coupled with continued efforts to reduce costs and streamline operations, has helped the banks improve their profitability.
However, the banks warned that the outlook for the rest of the year is uncertain, given the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the risk of further economic disruption. They also noted that low interest rates continue to pose a challenge for their earnings.
"We expect the Covid-19 crisis to continue to have an impact, and the environment surrounding financial institutions to remain severe, with low interest rates and intensifying competition," Mizuho's CEO, Tatsufumi Sakai, said in a statement.
Despite these challenges, the banks remain cautiously optimistic about the future. MUFG's Kamezawa said that the bank's focus on digitization and innovation would help it to remain competitive in the years ahead.
"We will continue with our strategy of accelerating growth-oriented businesses and restructuring our quality-earning asset portfolio," Kamezawa said.
Overall, the banks' return to profitability marks a positive development for the Japanese economy, which has been struggling with low economic growth and lackluster corporate earnings in recent years. While the pandemic has undoubtedly created new challenges for the banks, their strong financial results in the first half of the current business year suggest that they are well-positioned to weather the storm and emerge stronger on the other side.
