Daiwa Bank, one of Japan's largest banks, was expelled from the United States in 1995 for its role in covering up one of the largest financial scandals in history. Since then, the bank has undergone a major restructuring effort, and according to analysts, is now a stronger institution.
In 1995, Daiwa Bank was fined $340 million by US regulators for concealing $1.1 billion in trading losses. The bank's officials had transferred the losses to an off-the-books account to hide them from regulators.
The scandal rocked the Japanese banking industry and led to the expulsion of Daiwa Bank from the US. At the time, it was seen as a severe blow to the bank and to Japan's reputation in the global financial markets.
However, in the years since, analysts say that the expulsion from the US has led to positive restructuring measures at Daiwa Bank. The bank has been forced to focus on its core operations in Japan and has scaled back its overseas operations.
According to a report from Moody's Investors Service, Daiwa Bank has made significant progress in improving its risk management and compliance controls since the scandal. As a result, the bank's credit rating has been upgraded and is now on par with other major Japanese banks.
"Daiwa Bank has made significant strides in improving its governance and risk management framework, as well as its operational efficiency," the Moody's report stated.
One of the key changes at the bank has been a shift in its business model. Prior to the scandal, Daiwa Bank had been aggressively expanding into overseas markets, including the US. But after the expulsion, the bank changed its strategy and refocused on its core domestic business.
According to the bank's 2020 Annual Report, Daiwa Bank has been working to build a "stable business foundation" in Japan by strengthening relationships with its customers and expanding its product offerings. The bank has also sought to improve its digital capabilities to better serve customers in the era of fintech.
In addition to these domestic-focused efforts, Daiwa Bank has also worked to expand its business in Asia. The bank has opened branches in countries including China, Singapore, and Thailand, and has sought to capture opportunities in growing markets across the continent.
According to Hiroshi Tanabe, an analyst at ratings agency S&P Global, Daiwa Bank's focus on its core domestic business has helped it weather the challenges of recent years.
"The bank has been able to navigate the challenging market conditions following the 2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic through its reliance on stable domestic business," Tanabe said in a recent report.
However, the bank's experience in the US has been a cautionary tale for other Japanese financial institutions. In the years since Daiwa Bank's expulsion, Japanese regulators have put in place stricter compliance and risk management requirements to prevent a repeat of the scandal.
The Japanese government has also sought to address broader issues with the country's banking industry, including concerns over excessive risk-taking and weak corporate governance.
According to Jiji Press, the government has proposed new regulations that would require banks to disclose more information about their risk management practices and to set up independent audit committees.
"Daiwa Bank's expulsion from the US was a wake-up call for Japan's banking industry," said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments.
"It highlighted the need for stronger risk management practices and better corporate governance. Japanese banks have made progress in these areas since then, but there is still more work to be done."
Despite the challenges faced by the Japanese banking industry in recent years, analysts remain optimistic about the sector's prospects. The country's banks are seen as having more conservative balance sheets and stronger capital positions than many of their global peers.
In addition, Japan's aging population and changing demographics are seen as presenting opportunities for banks to develop new products and services to meet the needs of elderly customers.
"Daiwa Bank's experience in the US was undoubtedly a low point for the bank and for Japan's banking industry as a whole," said Tatsushi Maeno, chief economist at Okasan Securities.
"But the changes made since then have put Daiwa Bank on a stronger footing, and the sector as a whole has shown resilience in the face of challenges. I'm optimistic about the future of Japan's banking industry."
