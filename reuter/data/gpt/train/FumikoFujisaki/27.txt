A U.S. rating agency has predicted that several Japanese regional banks may go under in the coming years, but it does not foresee any significant damage to the country's financial system.
Moody's Investors Service recently released a report that looked into Japan's regional banking sector. The report highlighted the ongoing challenges facing small and medium-sized banks, including low interest rates, population decline, and competition from larger banks and fintech companies.
Moody's stated that a number of regional banks could face bankruptcy in the next three to five years if they fail to address these challenges. However, the rating agency also noted that the failure of regional banks in Japan is not uncommon, citing past examples such as Ashikaga Bank and North Pacific Bank in 2017.
Despite this, Moody's does not believe that the collapse of regional banks will pose a systemic risk to Japan's financial system. In the report, the rating agency stated that regional banks only account for around 10% of the country's banking assets and liabilities, and are less interconnected than their larger counterparts.
Moody's did acknowledge that the failure of regional banks could have localized impacts, particularly in areas with a high concentration of struggling banks. This could lead to reduced lending and economic activity in those regions.
Overall, Moody's views the outlook for Japan's banking sector as negative, with the ongoing challenges and uncertain economic conditions likely to weigh on the profitability of regional banks in particular. The rating agency noted that consolidation or mergers could be a solution for some banks, as well as a reduced reliance on traditional lending models and a greater focus on digital services.
The report comes at a time when Japan's economy is struggling to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The country was already grappling with the effects of an aging population and a shrinking workforce, with many regions outside of Tokyo struggling to attract investment and generate growth.
The Bank of Japan has kept interest rates at or below zero for several years in an attempt to stimulate lending and investment, but this has created challenges for banks that rely on interest income to generate revenue. Japan's banks have also faced competition from fintech companies and non-bank lenders that offer alternative financing options.
Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has further weakened the economy, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat amid lockdowns and consumer caution. The Japanese government has implemented various stimulus measures to support the economy, including loan programs for small and medium-sized enterprises, but these measures have not been enough to prevent some businesses from going under.
Despite these challenges, Japan has maintained its reputation as one of the world's most stable and reliable financial systems, with a strong regulatory framework and prudent risk management practices. Moody's noted that the country's financial system has weathered numerous crises over the years, including the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
In conclusion, while Moody's predicts that some Japanese regional banks may fail in the coming years, it does not foresee any major damage to the country's financial system. However, the localized impact of bank failures could cause economic challenges in some regions. To address these challenges, consolidation, mergers, and a focus on digital innovation may be necessary for regional banks to survive and thrive.
