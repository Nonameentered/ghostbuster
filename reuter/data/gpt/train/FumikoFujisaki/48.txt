Japan’s top banks have expressed their hopes of seeing a ban on holding companies lifted but skepticism remains regarding the proposal’s impact. The country's banking industry, while facing an uncertain future, has urged regulators to allow the creation of holding firms, a move that could lead to greater structural reforms and a significant shift in how the industry operates.
The move comes as the industry attempts to keep up with other global banks, with similar groups created in the United States and Europe. Holding companies would allow the banks to grow at a faster rate, as they would have the ability to acquire or consolidate with other financial institutions. Yet, some critics argue that the creation of holding companies could lead to weaker financial stability and increased risks.
The idea of lifting the ban has been under discussion for over a decade, however, this year marks the first time that Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) has made concrete steps to consider the proposal.
The FSA held several hearings earlier this year to discuss the potential risks and benefits of the matter. While some bankers pushed for the need of banking groups to create holding companies, others argued that the current system has served Japan well.
“The banking industry in Japan has been successful in the past without holding companies,” said Mizuho Bank’s Chief Executive Officer, Koji Fujiwara at one of the hearings. “We need to look more closely to determine what the benefits and downsides of creating holding companies would be."
The FSA, which is responsible for overseeing Japan's financial system, has said that the decision to allow the creation of holding companies would be made within a few years, subject to discussions and consultations with various stakeholders.
Experts believe that lifting the ban would fundamentally reshape the Japanese banking industry, which is currently dominated by the country's three biggest banks - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group.
These banks, which have relied on their domestic market for growth, have faced increasingly difficult conditions in recent years. Economic stagnation in Japan has meant that they have struggled to generate sufficient returns on their investments, forcing them to expand overseas to look for opportunities.
Supporters of the plan argue that holding companies would give the banks greater market access, which would enable them to compete with international rivals. Critics, however, are unconvinced that lifting the ban is the right idea.
“There are very grave concerns that if we scrap the current system, we will see a rise in the number of non-bank firms entering the banking industry, leading to a dramatic increase in competition and a reduction in financial stability,” said Masashi Nakajima, a professor of finance at Chuo University.
Currently, the operations of Japanese banks remain tightly regulated because of concerns surrounding financial stability, with bank deposits used to fund some of the country's largest corporations, including automakers. Critics of lifting the ban argue that holding companies would only increase risks for depositors whilst resulting in a reduction of capital reserves.
For the time being, banks are likely to invest overseas, with some already planning to increase investment in Southeast Asia, where the market is growing rapidly. However, lifting the ban could create new opportunities for the banks to grow both domestically and internationally.
Only time will tell whether the lifting of the ban on holding companies is the best move for the Japanese banking industry. While supporters of the plan are hopeful that it will bring economic growth, skeptics remain unconvinced that the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
