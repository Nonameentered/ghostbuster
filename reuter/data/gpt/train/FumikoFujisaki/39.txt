In a race against time, weak Japanese regional banks are scrambling to clean up their bad loan problems before new oversight standards come into effect in 1998.
The move comes as the Japanese government seeks to strengthen the financial system and restore confidence in the banking sector following a string of scandals and failures in recent years. This has led to a harsher regulatory environment, with stricter rules on capital adequacy, risk management and disclosure.
The problem, however, is that many regional banks are struggling to meet these new standards. Faced with dwindling profits and mounting bad debts, they are finding it increasingly difficult to raise capital and shore up their balance sheets.
According to a recent report by the Bank of Japan, the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans at regional banks stood at 3.7% as of March 1997, up from 2.7% a year earlier. This compares with an NPL ratio of just 0.9% for major banks.
Furthermore, the report noted that the level of NPLs was likely to rise further in the coming months, as economic conditions continued to deteriorate and the government moved to tighten regulations.
For many regional banks, the situation is becoming increasingly dire. Some are facing bankruptcy or mergers, while others are resorting to radical measures to raise capital, such as selling off assets or issuing subordinated debt.
One such bank is Hokuyo Bank, which recently announced plans to issue up to ¥40bn ($330m) in subordinated bonds to bolster its capital base. The move follows a sharp decline in the bank's profits and a rise in bad loans.
"We are facing a very challenging environment, and we need to take bold steps to ensure our long-term survival," said Hokuyo Bank president Toshio Kojima.
Other banks are looking to sell assets to raise cash. For example, San-in Godo Bank, a regional lender based in western Japan, is reportedly considering selling its stake in a local television station to generate funds.
Meanwhile, some banks are turning to foreign investors for help. In April, Yachiyo Bank, another struggling regional lender, received a ¥21bn ($175m) injection of capital from a consortium of foreign investors, including GE Capital and the Carlyle Group.
However, foreign interest in Japanese banks is limited, as many are seen as over-regulated and uncompetitive. In addition, concerns about the Japanese economy and the banking sector are weighing on investor sentiment.
"Foreign investors are cautious about Japanese regional banks, given the ongoing problems with bad loans and the uncertain economic outlook," said Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan.
Despite the challenges, many regional banks are determined to weather the storm and emerge stronger. They are seeking to restructure their businesses, improve risk management and streamline operations to reduce costs.
Akita Bank, for example, has embarked on a major restructuring program aimed at reducing its overheads and boosting profitability. The bank is closing branches, cutting jobs and shifting to online banking to save costs.
"We need to transform our business model and become more efficient if we are to survive and thrive in this tough environment," said Akita Bank president Masao Kumada.
Other banks are focusing on improving their risk management practices and reducing their exposure to bad loans. Tohoku Bank, a regional lender based in northern Japan, has set up a special unit to handle problem loans and is working to strengthen its credit analysis and monitoring functions.
"We are committed to improving our risk management practices and reducing our reliance on troubled borrowers," said Tohoku Bank president Yoshiaki Takeda.
The road ahead remains challenging for Japanese regional banks. The new oversight standards, which will come into effect in 1998, are likely to increase the pressure on banks to clean up their bad loan problems and improve their financial stability.
However, those banks that succeed in adapting to the new environment and embracing change are likely to emerge stronger and more resilient. The challenges facing the Japanese banking sector are daunting, but they also present an opportunity for renewal and growth.
