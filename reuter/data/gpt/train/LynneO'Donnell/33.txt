China, the world's largest consumer of copper, has decided to increase its copper stocks by 300,000 tonnes, according to sources within the country's central reserve authorities. This move aims to stabilize the country's flipping commodity markets and mitigate the soaring prices of copper.
China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, the National Development and Reform Commission, and other government agencies are reportedly behind the decision to increase copper reserves. These stakeholders intend to accumulate more copper to increase their bargaining power and hedge against the risks associated with increased copper prices.
The news of China's plan to increase copper reserves coincides with the copper prices reaching a record high not seen in almost a decade. The current market price of copper was around $4.84 per pound before the consumers' surge, exceeding the previous record, set in 2011, by nearly 7%. This price hike was chiefly due to the increased demand for copper, resulting from the global economic recovery of major economies that are now looking to invest heavily in infrastructure and green energy projects.
Experts concerned about the surging copper prices have welcomed China's decision to increase copper reserves. They believe that this move will bring stability and encourage investment within the copper market. However, others have warned that if the increasing copper prices persist, the demand for copper might decline, hitting the copper-backed economies' growth negatively.
China's decision to increase copper reserves is a strategic move to achieve its ambitious climate goals. In recent years, the Chinese government has significantly invested in green energy technology as part of its plans to reduce carbon emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy.
To meet this goal, China is investing heavily in electric vehicles (EVs), clean energy, and other green initiatives that require substantial copper supplies. According to experts, EVs require nearly four times more copper than vehicles with internal combustion engines. Similarly, green energy infrastructure projects, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and smart grids, require four to six times more copper per installed unit than traditional power systems.
As such, China's dependence on copper has grown rapidly, increasing the demand for copper and driving prices up. China, with over 40% global copper consumption, has become a crucial player within the copper market. The country's decision to accumulate copper reserves aims to offer stability to the global copper market and protect its access to copper supplies.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also played a significant role in the copper market's dynamics. Initially, the pandemic led to a slump in worldwide copper prices as the global economy witnessed widespread lockdowns and a slow-down. However, the copper market has since rebounded, fueled by the significant economic recovery in China and other major economies gradually returning to pre-pandemic levels.
Furthermore, the pandemic has brought to the fore the importance of copper in healthcare and medical equipment. Copper is increasingly being used in hospitals to help fight the spread of infections, and its demand within the healthcare system is expected to surge.
While the decision to accumulate copper reserves by China's central reserve authorities is intended to mitigate price volatility, it might also act as a proactive move to shield the country from possible US sanctions. Tensions between the US and China have intensified in recent years, leading to a trade war. While the focus has been on the trade of general goods, copper could also become a vulnerable commodity in this tussle.
The US, which is a major copper consumer, might attempt to use its dominance in the copper market to exert political pressure on China. These potential actions by the US highlight the need for China to accumulate copper reserves to mitigate any adverse effects on its economy and green energy plans.
The Chinese government's decision to increase copper reserves to 300 000 tonnes has significant implications for the global economy, specifically, copper-backed economies. By stabilizing copper prices and increasing its bargaining power within the copper market, China can better execute its green agenda, mitigate market risks, and insulate itself from possible economic sanctions. This move comes at a strategic time, as the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for substantial investments in infrastructure and green energy.
