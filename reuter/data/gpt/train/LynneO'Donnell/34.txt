Chinese Traders Take Advantage of Sharp Copper Rally by Selling Back to Market
In a bid to capitalize on the sharp rally in the prices of copper, Chinese traders have been selling back the metal to the market, causing a price correction that has rattled investors globally, according to reports.
Copper prices recently surged to their highest levels since 2011, reaching almost $10,800 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange (LME) earlier this week. This was in part due to bullish sentiment among investors who are banking on copper's significance in the global push for clean energy technology, as well as a potential supply shortage caused by production disruptions in key copper-producing countries.
However, as the rally gathered steam, Chinese traders reportedly began selling back their copper holdings in larger quantities, leading to a correction in prices and sparking fears among investors that the rally may lose steam.
Some experts believe that the surge in copper prices could be short-lived, as the current situation appears to reflect a speculative bubble that is being fueled largely by investor sentiment.
According to Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economic Research at Xiamen University, China's copper industry is largely driven by speculation at the moment, rather than actual demand for the metal in downstream industries. Boqiang notes that China's copper consumption fell significantly last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is unlikely to see a significant uptick in demand this year either.
This speculation-led rally is being supported largely by the global push toward clean energy, which has resulted in significant investment in technologies such as electric vehicles, which rely heavily on copper wiring. However, some experts warn that this may not be enough to sustain a long-term rally in copper prices.
"There is certainly strong demand growth in the short term, but the sustainability of this demand may well be questioned over time," said Neil Hume, commodities editor at the Financial Times. Hume notes that the global push for clean energy may result in greater adoption of other, more cost-efficient metals in place of copper.
There are also concerns that the supply-demand dynamics of the copper market remain uncertain, given the global pandemic and the ongoing trade tensions between major copper-producing nations. This has led some traders to predict that prices could be volatile in the coming months.
Despite these concerns, some investors remain bullish on copper, arguing that the metal is an important indicator of economic health and a key component of the green energy transition.
"Copper is integral to the global economic recovery and the transition to a low-carbon future," said Max Layton, a portfolio manager at Eley Griffiths Group. "We believe that demand will remain strong and that prices will continue to rise over the long term, despite short-term corrections."
For now, the copper market remains a closely-watched barometer of investor sentiment about the global push for clean energy and the health of the global economy overall. While the recent selling by Chinese traders has caused some concern among investors, it remains to be seen whether this will be sustained or if copper prices will continue their upward trajectory in the months ahead.
