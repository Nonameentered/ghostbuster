London, United Kingdom - The London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc price has reached a five-month high, benefiting metal sources in China and the Far East.
As of September 1, 2021, the LME zinc price closed at $3,100 per tonne, its highest level since March 18, 2021. This surge in price can be attributed to several factors, including supply chain disruptions and increased demand from the construction and automobile industries.
China, the world's largest producer and consumer of zinc, is set to benefit greatly from this price increase. As many zinc mines in China remain closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, Chinese zinc producers have turned to the LME to secure their metal supplies. Many companies in China and the Far East also rely on the LME zinc price to set their own prices.
The rising zinc price is also good news for the construction and automobile industries, two sectors that are heavily dependent on this metal. Zinc is used in the production of galvanized steel, which is used for roofing, cladding, and other construction purposes. The automobile industry also uses zinc in the production of car parts such as engines, doors, and hoods.
The increase in zinc prices could lead to higher costs for leading businesses in these sectors. However, some analysts predict that the zinc price spike will not be long-lasting because of the current reduction in demand for steel.
The LME zinc price increase has been driven by supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Zinc production has been significantly impacted as many mines were forced to close operations due to restrictions and safety measures.
Furthermore, the shutdown of the Brunswick Mine in Canada, one of the world's largest zinc suppliers, has further compounded the problem. The mine, owned by Resources Limited, shut down in April 2020 to halt the spread of COVID-19 among the workforce. It is not yet clear when the mine will reopen.
Another factor that has contributed to the rising zinc price is the increase in demand from the construction and automobile industries. The construction sector has experienced a surge in demand as countries have resumed their building projects post-COVID-19.
The automobile industry, on the other hand, has seen an increase in demand as a result of the rise in electric vehicle production. Zinc is used to produce batteries, which are a crucial component in electric vehicles.
The increase in LME zinc prices could also result in an increase in zinc production, as many mining companies now see the opportunity to cash in on the price surge. An increase in zinc production could, in turn, lead to lower prices as the supply increases to meet the demand.
The rise in zinc prices could also have a significant impact on other industries, including the food packaging and pharmaceutical sectors. Zinc is used in the production of metal packaging, which is commonly used to store beverages, food, and pharmaceutical products.
Overall, the LME zinc price increase has benefitted the Chinese and Far East metal sources. The high prices could lead to an increase in production and, in turn, greater availability of zinc to the world market.
However, it is worth noting that the zinc price spike may be short-lived. As supply chains recover from the pandemic and more mines reopen, the demand for zinc may start to decrease. Despite this, the LME zinc price reaching a five-month high is a definite positive for the metal industry and the global economy as a whole.
