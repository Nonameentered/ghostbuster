The United States government is trying to reassure China that American chicken is safe after the country suspended imports of poultry from two states over coronavirus outbreaks. The ban was imposed on June 17 and affected shipments from Tyson Foods facilities located in Arkansas and North Carolina. China is the second-largest market for U.S. chicken exports, totaling more than one billion dollars annually.
The move by China was seen as a blow to Tyson Foods and other American chicken producers, who have been already struggling with lower demand from restaurants and schools due to the pandemic. Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company, has been hit hard by COVID-19, with thousands of workers infected and several plant closures. The company said it had suspended exports to China from the affected sites and was working to comply with Chinese regulations to resume shipments.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Trade Representative's office have been in contact with their Chinese counterparts to clarify the situation and address any concerns about food safety. The officials emphasized that there is no evidence to suggest that chicken is a source of transmission of the coronavirus. The USDA also stated that the infected workers at the Tyson plants were asymptomatic, and there was no evidence that the virus had spread to the products.
"American poultry is safe and wholesome, and we are committed to ensuring that our food exports meet the highest standards of quality and safety," said USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue. "We will continue to work closely with China to resolve any issues related to this matter."
The U.S. industry also defended the safety of its products, noting that the country has some of the most rigorous food safety standards in the world. The National Chicken Council said in a statement that "there is no reason to believe that the coronavirus can be transmitted via food, packaged or unpackaged." The council added that the affected Tyson plants had implemented extensive measures to protect workers and had met or exceeded the government's guidelines for preventing the spread of the virus.
However, some experts believe that the Chinese ban may have been motivated more by politics than by public health concerns. China has been under pressure from the Trump administration to increase imports of American goods and reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. The two countries have been engaged in a bitter trade war for the past two years, with both sides imposing tariffs on each other's exports.
"The suspension of the Tyson shipments could be seen as a retaliatory measure by China, given the worsening trade relations between the two countries," said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. "It is also a reminder of the vulnerabilities of global supply chains, which can be disrupted by geopolitical tensions and health emergencies."
The ban on Tyson's exports to China is not the first time that American meat producers have faced restrictions from the country. In 2013, China banned imports of U.S. poultry after an outbreak of avian flu, but lifted the ban last year. More recently, China has been grappling with its own coronavirus outbreaks in meat processing plants, prompting the suspension of imports from several countries, including Brazil and Germany.
Despite the temporary setback, American chicken producers are hopeful that they can overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic and maintain their market share in China and other countries. The U.S. has been expanding its poultry exports in recent years, driven by rising demand from Asia and Europe. However, the industry is also facing growing competition from other major exporters, such as Brazil and Thailand, which have been able to keep prices lower due to their currency devaluations.
In conclusion, the U.S. government and the American chicken industry are working to reassure China that American chicken is safe and that any concerns about the coronavirus can be addressed through cooperation and dialogue. The ban on Tyson's exports is a reminder of the fragility of global supply chains and the need for resilience in the face of geopolitical and public health risks. Nonetheless, the U.S. remains committed to exporting high-quality and safe food products to customers around the world.
