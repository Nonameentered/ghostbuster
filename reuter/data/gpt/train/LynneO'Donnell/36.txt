Despite the surging prices of copper, China is reportedly stockpiling hundreds of thousands of tonnes of the metal as it attempts to secure its supply chain.
According to recent reports, China has bought and stored more than 800,000 tonnes of copper since the start of the year, with analysts suggesting that the country's appetite for the commodity is growing.
This move comes amid a period of surging demand for copper, which is being driven by China's economic growth and the shift towards renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.
Copper is a key component in the manufacture of electrical products, and as the world switches to greener energy systems, demand for the metal is increasing.
Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, leaving nations scrambling to secure vital commodities, including copper, which has led to a surge in prices and supply chain shocks.
China is the world's largest user of copper, with its demand for the metal increasing by 4% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period the previous year. The country accounted for 60% of global copper consumption in 2020.
Reports suggest that Chinese companies, including state-run firms, have been buying up copper at a rapid pace and storing it in bonded warehouses across the country.
Bonded warehouses are facilities where imported goods are stored without being subjected to customs duties or taxes. They are used by companies as a way to defer paying taxes on goods, such as copper, until they are sold.
Sources suggest that the metal has been stockpiled in bonded warehouses in Shanghai, Tianjin and Qingdao, among other cities.
It is thought that the Chinese government is behind the move, with a desire to secure its copper supply chain and avoid any potential disruption in the future.
The global copper market has been subject to volatility in recent months, with prices soaring to record highs before crashing back down again as concerns over global economic growth and the impact of the pandemic on supply chains took hold.
Analysts have suggested that China's stockpiling of copper could be a way to stabilise prices and protect its own interests in the global market.
However, some experts have also raised concerns over the impact of China's move on the global copper market.
The sheer size of China's copper stockpile could have a significant impact on prices, particularly if the country decides to flood the market with the metal, which could push prices down.
Moreover, if China continues to stockpile copper at such a fast pace, it could exacerbate supply chain issues and lead to shortages of the metal in other parts of the world.
The move could also raise concerns over China's growing influence in the global commodities market, particularly if it is seen to be distorting prices and manipulating the market.
Furthermore, Chinese companies have been accused of hoarding commodities in the past, with reports suggesting that they have done so with iron ore, coal and other metals, leading to higher prices and shortages elsewhere.
While details of China's copper stockpiling are yet to be confirmed, experts have suggested that the move could have significant implications for the global copper market, particularly as demand for the metal continues to grow.
With the world moving towards renewable energy and electrification, copper is likely to become an increasingly vital commodity, and as such, securing a reliable supply chain will be crucial. The stockpiling of copper, however, could also lead to concerns over China's growing economic power and its ability to manipulate markets.
For now, it remains to be seen how China's stockpiling of copper will play out, but it is clear that the move is likely to have far-reaching implications for the global commodities market and the wider economy.
