Shanghai, China - The world copper market is grappling with murky information on ownership of Shanghai copper, a major producer of the metal, which is causing concern among industry insiders.
The opaque ownership structure of Shanghai copper has become a concern for market analysts. On the paper, the China National Mining Corporation or CNMC owns 96% of the company, and the rest is owned by minority shareholders. However, the Chinese government tightly controls the CNMC, and its official ownership has been difficult to ascertain.
Experts said that the opacity of Shanghai copper's ownership could create uncertainty in the world market, given China produces about half of the world's copper and is a leading importer. "It's not clear who owns what and who controls what," said Dan Smith, a metals analyst at Singapore-based consultancy CRU. "Investors are getting nervous, and this could lead to a fall in copper prices."
Shanghai copper is a significant producer of copper, with several mines in different countries. Its operations in Zambia, for instance, produce 220,000 tons of copper concentrate annually, which is equivalent to about 3% of the African country's GDP.
The lack of transparency on ownership has led to concerns that some of Shanghai copper's mines could be controlled by well-connected individuals with questionable backgrounds, leading to corrupt practices and lack of accountability.
Questions over the ownership of Shanghai copper have come to the fore after the arrest of Liu Jianhua, who was the Chairman of China's Daye Non-Ferrous Metals, a major shareholder in the company. Liu was arrested on suspicion of economic crimes in September 2021. His arrest has fueled speculation that the Chinese government could be cracking down on corrupt individuals within the mining industry.
However, the opaque ownership structure of Shanghai copper has made it challenging to determine the extent of Liu's influence on the company's operations. "It raises questions about the government's control over state-owned enterprises," said Smith.
The lack of transparency in Shanghai copper's ownership is not unique to China. Many mining companies in other countries also have opaque ownership, making it difficult to determine who benefits from the wealth generated by the sector.
However, the problem is more acute in China because of the close links between the government and state-owned enterprises. "In China, the state owns the economy. The government controls everything, including the mining sector," said Smith.
Experts said that Shanghai copper should improve its transparency on ownership and management structure to allay concerns among investors. The company has reportedly been working on an initial public offering to raise funds, but the timeline for the IPO has been delayed due to the ongoing uncertainty over China's economic policy.
"The market needs clarity on who owns and controls the company to build trust and confidence," said Paul Gait, a senior analyst at London-based Sanford C. Bernstein. "The lack of transparency is a risk for investors, especially given the Chinese government's track record on interference in the mining sector."
The rise in copper prices in recent months has been driven by strong demand from China, which imports copper concentrate to feed its appetite for infrastructure and construction projects. Copper is also used in electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and consumer electronics, making it a critical metal in the global transition to a low-carbon economy.
However, the opaque ownership structure of Shanghai copper could prevent investors from investing in the sector due to uncertainties over the company's future prospects and Chinese government policies. "It's a risk factor for investors, and it needs to be addressed," said Gait.
The Chinese government has pledged to reform the mining sector to improve transparency and accountability. In March 2021, the National People's Congress passed a new law that aimed to improve the management of mineral rights and encourage more private investment in the mining sector.
Experts said that the government's reform agenda could help address some of the issues in the mining sector, but more needed to be done to create a level playing field for all stakeholders. "The government needs to improve governance and accountability in the sector, and that includes greater transparency on ownership and management," said Gait.
The lack of transparency on ownership of Shanghai copper has become a concern for market analysts, raising questions about the government's control over state-owned enterprises, and the extent of influence of well-connected individuals with questionable backgrounds on the mining industry. The world copper market hopes the company and mining sector as a whole work towards better transparency and governance to encourage investor trust and confidence.
