A new report has exposed serious doubts over China's capacity to meet its goal of grain self-sufficiency. Despite the government's efforts to ramp up agricultural production and investment, concerns linger that China may struggle to ensure food security for its ballooning population.
Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has prioritized agricultural self-sufficiency as a national security imperative. In 2018, China's Agriculture Ministry unveiled its target of producing 550 million tons of grain annually by 2035, representing a 40% increase from current levels. The country has taken several steps to achieve this aim, including increasing investment in modern farming techniques and offering subsidies to farmers.
While China is already the world's largest producer of rice and wheat, experts argue that this self-sufficiency goal is unrealistic given the country's land constraints and environmental challenges. According to a report by US think tank The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, China faces significant obstacles to improving grain yields. The country has just 7% of the world's arable land to feed a population of over 1.4 billion, and much of the land is polluted and degraded. Climate change is exacerbating this issue, with frequent droughts and floods magnifying food insecurity.
"There's only so much you can do with the land you have," says Fred Hu, a former Goldman Sachs executive and founder of investment firm Primavera Capital Group. "If you want to grow more food, you either need to increase yields or acquire more land. Neither of these options is feasible for China."
The Carnegie report highlights that China's intensive farming methods have also led to severe soil degradation and pollution, further undermining the country's food security. The overuse of pesticides and fertilizers, as well as the presence of heavy metals in the soil, has contaminated much of the country's farmland. As a result, China must import a large proportion of its fertilizer, further reducing its capacity to be self-sufficient.
The report also notes that China's water scarcity poses a serious challenge to its agricultural ambitions. Agriculture accounts for around 70% of China's water demand, and the country's rivers and aquifers are facing depletion due to overuse and pollution. In rural areas, many farmers rely on costly and energy-intensive irrigation methods to keep their crops watered.
Despite these challenges, China has remained bullish on its goal of grain self-sufficiency. In recent years, the government has offered subsidies to farmers to encourage the use of high-yield seeds and modern farming technologies, while also investing in irrigation and drainage systems. President Xi has emphasized the need to develop China's rural regions, especially in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, some experts argue that China's focus on self-sufficiency could backfire, particularly if it leads to reductions in food imports. "Agriculture is a global industry, and every country has a role to play in producing the food that everyone needs," says David Beasley, executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme. "If you start cutting off trade, then you're going to see more unstable markets and more food insecurity."
The Carnegie report also suggests that China's emphasis on self-sufficiency could have geopolitical implications, particularly in relation to its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI is a massive infrastructure project that seeks to connect China to Europe and beyond, but many of the countries along the routes are food-insecure and rely heavily on grain imports. By promoting self-sufficiency at home, China may be exporting food insecurity to its BRI partners.
As China continues to grapple with its food security challenges, some experts are calling for a more balanced approach that combines domestic production with trade and investment. "China needs to think more broadly about how it can secure its food supply," says Yukon Huang, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "This might involve investing in agriculture in other countries or promoting innovation to reduce food waste and improve food distribution."
For now, however, China remains committed to its goal of grain self-sufficiency. The government has set a timeline of 2025 to reach 95% self-sufficiency in rice, and is also aiming to boost the output of corn, soybeans, and other key crops. Whether these targets are achievable, however, remains to be seen.
