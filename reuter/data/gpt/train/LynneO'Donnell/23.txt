In recent years, the United States and China have been engaged in a trade dispute over the importation of poultry. The U.S. has accused China of unfair trade practices, including price subsidies and import restrictions, which put American producers at a disadvantage. In turn, China has raised concerns about the safety and quality of American poultry products, leading to a ban on their importation.
The dispute has been going on for several years. However, recently, there has been some good news. Chinese and U.S. scientists have made progress in resolving issues surrounding the ban. Representatives from both countries have been meeting to discuss the safety and health of the chicken they exchange.
The recent meeting between the two countries' representatives was aimed at bridging the gap in standards and policies of testing poultry for public consumption. The Chinese delegation expressed satisfaction with the testing conducted by the United States of America, describing it as satisfactory. They admitted obtaining enlightenment from it and that it would help update their testing procedures and set a world standard for testing poultry.
The meeting follows a recent report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which found the risk of bird flu infecting US commercial poultry is low to very low. The USDA surveillance program detected zero instances of H5N1 and H7N9 strains, which can be highly lethal to humans, in US commercial poultry from February through July 2019.
Additionally, the USDA has certified that all poultry products exported to China meet the country's safety standards. The certification is a critical step towards the resumption of U.S. poultry exports to China, which was halted in 2015.
The Chinese government has also agreed to lift the ban on U.S. poultry products, subject to verification of the certifications by their regulatory authorities. The resumption of U.S. poultry exports is expected to create new market opportunities for American producers. It could also help reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which has been a point of contention in bilateral trade talks between the two countries.
The development has been welcomed by both US and Chinese producers, who have long awaited the conclusion of the trade negotiations. The U.S. National Chicken Council commented that "U.S. poultry has been locked out of the massive Chinese market for more than four years, and we estimate exports could exceed $1 billion annually when the market fully opens". Similarly, a representative of the China's meat association expressed his satisfaction with the development, emphasizing that it would potentially boost Chinese chicken imports which stood at a 15-year fraction.
In conclusion, the recent progress in negotiations between the two countries on the poultry ban is a testament to the potential of diplomacy and dialogue in resolving disputes. Both sides have demonstrated a willingness to engage constructively and find solutions that promote the free and fair exchange of goods. Ultimately, this will be good news for producers, consumers, and the economies of both countries.
