In recent years, China has been making significant strides in promoting domestic agricultural production. One such move has been the setting of minimum selling prices for corn exports, with the aim of safeguarding the interests of Chinese corn farmers by ensuring they receive a fair price for their produce. However, these price floors have had the unintended consequence of stifling demand for Chinese corn on the international market and causing harm to small-scale farmers.
The minimum selling price for corn exports was introduced in 2016 and has been revised several times since then. The current minimum selling price is set at 2,000 yuan ($309) per tonne. This is a substantial increase from the average price of corn in the international market, which stands at about $220 per tonne. While the policy was intended as a protectionist measure, the high minimum price has made Chinese corn uncompetitive compared to corn produced in other countries.
The impact of this policy has been felt most acutely by small-scale farmers, who are often unable to store their crop for extended periods. As a result, they have been forced to sell their corn to local trading firms at prices lower than the minimum selling price. This has led to significant losses for farmers, who have experienced a decline in income and a reduction in the size of their land.
Moreover, the high minimum selling price has made it difficult for China to export corn abroad. The price is simply too high for international buyers, who have turned to other countries such as the United States, Argentina, and Brazil for their corn supplies. The result has been a sharp drop in Chinese corn exports, which have declined from over 5 million tonnes in 2015 to less than 1 million tonnes in 2020.
The minimum selling price policy has affected large-scale farmers as well, who have also struggled to find buyers willing to pay the inflated price. These farmers have resorted to using corn for animal feed, which is less profitable than exporting it. As a result, China now has a surplus of corn, which has further reduced the market price of the crop and caused more losses for farmers.
There are several reasons why the minimum selling price policy has been ineffective. First, Chinese corn production costs are higher than in other countries due to factors such as higher labor and land prices. This means that Chinese corn is already more expensive to produce, making it difficult to compete with corn produced in other countries. Second, the policy has led to a reduction in trade and investment between China and other countries in the agricultural sector. This has stifled innovation and made it more difficult for China to access global agricultural technologies and expertise.
The Chinese government has acknowledged the concerns raised by farmers and other stakeholders and has taken steps to address them. In July 2020, the government announced that it would adjust the minimum selling price system for corn, soybeans, and other farm products to better reflect market demand and supply. The government also announced that it would introduce subsidies to help small-scale farmers comply with the minimum selling price policy.
While these measures are steps in the right direction, some critics argue that they do not go far enough. They argue that the government needs to completely abandon the minimum selling price policy and instead focus on improving the competitiveness of Chinese agriculture through increased investment, improved supply chain management, and the adoption of advanced agricultural technologies.
Despite the challenges faced by farmers, China's agriculture sector continues to show promise. The country has made significant investments in agricultural research and development, and has set ambitious targets for itself in areas such as soil conservation, water efficiency, and sustainable farming. Moreover, the sector has been bolstered by growing demand for high-quality, nutritious food from China's burgeoning middle class.
With its vast resources, rich cultural heritage, and entrepreneurial spirit, China has the potential to become a global leader in the agriculture sector. However, to fully realize this potential, the government needs to adopt a more nuanced and pragmatic approach to agricultural policy, one that balances the interests of farmers with the needs of consumers and the demands of the global market.
