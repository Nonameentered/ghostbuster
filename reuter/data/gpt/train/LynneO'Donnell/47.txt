China’s zinc industry is struggling to keep up with changing economic conditions and reduced exports. Despite producing over 40% of the world’s zinc, China’s zinc smelters are grappling with excess capacity and rising costs of raw materials.
According to data from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG), in 2020, China produced 5.6 million tonnes of zinc, which was a 7.3% decline compared to the previous year. Analysts attribute this decline to the reduction in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic has had a severe impact on several industries, the zinc industry has also been impacted, with lockdowns causing a significant reduction in transportation, construction, and manufacturing.
However, the pandemic is not the only factor impacting the industry. In recent years, the country has been moving away from heavy industry, and China’s shift towards a more service-oriented economy means that zinc smelters no longer stand at the forefront of national importance.
In part, this shift reflects the country’s ongoing environmental concerns. Over the last few years, the Chinese government has introduced stricter environmental regulations, forcing zinc smelters to reduce their emissions and improve their environmental performance.
The challenge for the zinc industry now is to keep up with the changing economic conditions. With the world economy slowly recovering from the pandemic and global demand rising, zinc smelters do not have the same competitive advantage they used to enjoy.
Furthermore, the industry is struggling to gain a foothold in the global market. As the country moves towards a more service-oriented economy, the need to import raw materials has increased significantly, and with zinc production costs in China on the rise, the global price for zinc produced in China is no longer as competitive as it once was.
Another issue for the zinc industry is excess capacity. Chinese zinc smelters have an estimated output capacity of around 10 million tonnes per annum, with annual demand averaging approximately 5.5 million tonnes. As a result, industry analysts estimate that the excess capacity is around 3 million tonnes per year. In essence, the zinc industry is producing more than demanded, leading to increased competition and lower prices for zinc.
China has traditionally been a large exporter of zinc, but with reduced demand and excess capacity, the industry faces a challenging market environment. Furthermore, increased competition from other zinc-producing countries such as Australia and Canada further compounds the problem.
As the industry struggles to maintain profitability, Chinese zinc producers are now looking for ways to reduce costs. One solution proposed by the industry is the introduction of a zinc concentrate purchasing pool, which aims to reduce the competition for raw materials between small and large smelters in China. Such an initiative would enable smaller smelters to purchase raw materials at a lower cost while benefiting from the advantages of larger economies of scale.
The future of China's zinc industry is uncertain, and it is likely to face significant challenges in the coming years. However, the industry is not without hope as it looks towards emerging markets such as India and South America, where demand for zinc continues to rise.
China's smelters have been working to diversify their product portfolios, expanding into other markets such as aluminium and copper production to supplement lost revenues from falling zinc prices.
In conclusion, China's zinc industry is in a state of flux. While the country remains the world's largest producer of zinc, increased international competition and reduced demand mean that Chinese producers are struggling to keep up with market changes. With reduced exports and rising costs, the industry is looking towards new markets and diversification as a way to increase profitability. Only time will tell if this strategy will be enough to keep China's zinc industry competitive on the global stage.
