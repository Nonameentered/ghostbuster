China Bans Poultry Imports from Two US States to Prevent Deadly Epidemic, Not Connected to Politics Says US Official
China has recently banned the importation of poultry from the U.S. states of Georgia and South Carolina amidst fears of a deadly avian flu epidemic. This move was made as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the disease in China. The ban is not, according to a US official, politically motivated.
Zhang Zhongqiu, the director of the Department of Animal Inspection at the General Administration of Customs in China, stated that the ban was put in place because of a recent outbreak of the H7N9 strain of avian flu in the two states. The strain has been identified as highly deadly, with a mortality rate of over 30 percent. Zhang added that "China regards food safety as the utmost priority and will take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of its citizens."
Despite the ban on poultry imports, the US poultry industry remains optimistic about the situation. Georgia and South Carolina are the second and the ninth-largest poultry producers in the United States, respectively. Spokespersons for both states have assured consumers and industry partners that the H7N9 outbreak was "contained and poses no public health threat."
The timing of the ban has raised some eyebrows in the US, with some questioning whether the move is politically motivated. Tensions between the US and China have been high in recent months, with the ongoing trade war and disagreements over the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a US official has defended China's decision, saying the ban was not political.
"The United States values its relationship with China, particularly in trade, and understands the need for measures like a ban on imported poultry in the interest of public health and safety. This is not a political decision, but rather one that is based on scientific evidence," the official said.
The H7N9 strain of avian flu has been rampant in China in recent years, with the country reporting over 1,500 cases and 39 deaths since 2013. The virus is notoriously difficult to contain, and the World Health Organization has labeled it a "serious threat to human health."
The Chinese government has been taking steps to combat the spread of avian flu in the country, including shutting down live poultry markets and culling infected birds. The ban on US imports is just one of many measures aimed at preventing the disease from spreading to China.
In conclusion, the ban on poultry imports from Georgia and South Carolina is a necessary measure to prevent the spread of a deadly avian flu strain. The move is not politically motivated, and the US poultry industry remains confident in the safety of its products. The ban will remain in place until Chinese authorities are satisfied that the situation is under control.
