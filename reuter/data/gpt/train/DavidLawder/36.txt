General Motors' board of directors is reportedly considering delaying a planned dividend increase amid ongoing contract negotiations with autoworkers' union, United Auto Workers (UAW).
According to sources close to the matter, the board is hesitant to make a move that could potentially harm its position in the talks, which are expected to be particularly tough this year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is said to be aiming to reach a deal with UAW that keeps its labor costs competitive while also meeting the union's demands for higher wages and improved benefits.
Discussions between the two sides began earlier this year, with the UAW pushing for a number of changes that would significantly improve the lives of its members. Among the demands are a significant increase in pay, better job security measures, and enhanced healthcare coverage.
In addition to these demands, the union is also eager to address key workplace safety issues, such as the ongoing risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as concerns over the use of temporary workers and the widespread use of data tracking and surveillance technologies.
Despite these challenges, GM CEO Mary Barra has remained optimistic about the process, noting that the company is fully committed to working towards a positive outcome for all parties involved.
"We always come to the table with a sense of urgency but also a sense of collaboration, recognizing that we need to work together to get to an agreement that's good for our employees, our communities, and our shareholders," she said in a recent statement.
Despite this positive outlook, some analysts are skeptical about the prospects of a deal being reached anytime soon. Due to the significant financial pressures facing the industry as a result of the pandemic, many believe that GM will be forced to take a more conservative approach to its finances for the time being.
In particular, the company may be reluctant to increase its dividend before a deal is reached, as doing so could be perceived as a sign of weakness by union negotiators. Ultimately, the outcome of the talks will likely have a significant impact on the industry as a whole, as well as on the livelihoods of thousands of autoworkers across the country.
