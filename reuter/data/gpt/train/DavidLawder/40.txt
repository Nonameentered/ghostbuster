Detroit, Michigan—General Motors and the United Auto Workers (UAW) have reached a tentative agreement to settle negotiations for a new labor contract, potentially ending the longest auto industry strike in the US in 50 years.
The new agreement would add around 9,000 jobs, create a path for temporary workers to become full-time employees, increase wages, and maintain and improve healthcare benefits for the 46,000 union members. The strike, which lasted 40 days, impacted 34 plants across nine states. It cost GM more than $2 billion in losses, and workers were unable to earn pay during that period.
“Today, after five weeks of intense negotiations, the UAW GM National Negotiators and UAW GM Vice President Terry Dittes announced the achievement of a proposed tentative agreement with General Motors for a new national contract, covering 46,000 UAW-represented GM employees,” the UAW stated in a press release on Wednesday.
The UAW-GM Council voted to recommend the contract to its members, but it is up to the rank-and-file members to ratify the agreement. The vote by the union is expected to be completed by Oct. 18, and if the contract is ratified by workers, the strike will end.
GM, in its own statement, noted the agreement provides “a fair and balanced proposal” to address “the priorities of our employees and the company”. The defining issue for the parties was said to be around the topic of temporary workers. The talks had been stalled for weeks due to the issue of the temporary employees, with the union pushing for better job security for temporary employees. The new agreement would provide a path for temporary employees to become full-time employees, but it also entails a cap on the number of temporary workers GM can have at any given time.
“We believe that this agreement can help bring stability to the US auto industry by maintaining American jobs and investing in future products. Our focus remains on working together to produce high-quality vehicles for our customers and providing good-paying jobs,” said GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra.
The proposed deal is a significant win for the union, which was seeking better wages and benefits, as well as more job security for its members. The agreement also addresses concerns over GM's plans to close four factories in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland, a major point of contention in the strike. Under the new contract, the union said GM has agreed to invest $7.7 billion in US facilities, and to reopen one plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which had been closed in March. GM will also invest in two Michigan facilities and in one in Texas.
The strike affected GM’s suppliers as well as the company. Many of the parts that are used to build GM’s vehicles are made by smaller, independent companies that supply the auto giant. The strike caused manufacturing slowdowns and production stoppages throughout the supply chain.
President Donald Trump, who had been critical of GM during the strike, applauded the news on Twitter, saying, “Great news for Ohio! Just spoke to Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, who informed me that, subject to a UAW vote, GM will be selling their beautiful Lordstown Plant to Workhorse, where they plan to build Electric Trucks.”
If the agreement is ratified, it would be the first new labor contract for GM since its 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout. The outcome of the vote remains uncertain, and the UAW has called for its members to stay focused and united to achieve the best results. The proposed contract will give workers better pay, benefits, and job security, while GM will have a more stable workforce and more certainty in its operations.
The end of the strike and the new agreement could also bring an end to uncertainty in the industry. However, it remains to be seen whether the deal will satisfy all the demands of the workers, and how the outcome of the vote will affect the industry as a whole.
