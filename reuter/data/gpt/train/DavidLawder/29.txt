The United Automobile Workers (UAW) union announced on Monday that its members have launched local strikes against General Motors (GM)’s truck operations in protest of the automaker's proposed contract that seeks to cut wages, healthcare, and job security.
Approximately 50,000 GM workers are involved in the nation-wide strike that has shut down production at 33 GM plants across the US, impacting the company's highly profitable truck unit that includes the Flint truck assembly plant in Michigan, Fort Wayne assembly plant in Indiana, and Wentzville assembly plant in Missouri.
“UAW members are standing up for what’s right. We will not allow GM to undercut our wages, benefits, and job security when they are making billions of dollars in profits every year,” said Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president, in a statement.
The strike comes after the UAW’s four-year contract with GM expired on September 14. GM has since rejected UAW’s proposal to increase pay, healthcare, and job security for its members.
Union workers also expressed concern over the automaker's plans to cut healthcare benefits for striking workers in the present contract negotiation. "GM's proposal to eliminate our healthcare benefits while we strike is both heartless and a direct attack on our rights," said Jim Ashley, a UAW member at the Flint plant.
GM, on the other hand, explained that they have made significant offers to the UAW, including wage increases and increased investments in US manufacturing facilities, but claims that UAW has failed to respond to GM's proposals in a timely manner.
“We presented a strong offer that improves wages, benefits, and grows US jobs in substantive ways, and GM is committed to working around the clock to reach a resolution. Our goal remains to build a strong future for our employees and our business,” said Gerald Johnson, GM’s executive vice president of global manufacturing, in a statement.
GM's stock price has fallen during the first two days of the strike. Some analysts believe that the strike could cost GM approximately $50 million a day in lost revenue, impacting the company's fourth-quarter earnings and leading to possible layoffs.
The strike has had a ripple effect on GM’s suppliers, who may also be forced to halt production due to a lack of demand from the automaker. Suppliers are also worried about losing business from other automakers that are not associated with the UAW strike.
“We’re deeply connected to GM, and it’s hard for us to make money if GM is not making money. We’re watching this situation very closely and hoping for a resolution as soon as possible,” said Greg Miller, CEO of Lacks Enterprises, a Michigan-based supplier that provides parts to GM.
The impact of the strike is not limited to the US. Canada's Unifor union, which represents thousands of GM employees in Canada, also sent a letter to GM's management on Monday requesting that GM commit to new investments in their Canadian facilities in exchange for Unifor's support in the US strike.
The letter followed a report on Monday that GM is planning to close one of its manufacturing plants in Oshawa, Canada, by the end of 2019. The move is expected to impact the jobs of approximately 2,500 employees who work at the plant.
“In order to avoid similar plant closures and job losses in Canada, we urge you to immediately invest in your Canadian facilities and return to the bargaining table,” wrote Jerry Dias, Unifor's national president, in the letter.
The UAW strike at GM is the largest US labor stoppage since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The impact of the union's actions on GM, its suppliers, and the overall industry is yet to be seen, but it highlights the ongoing tension between labor and management in the US automotive industry.
