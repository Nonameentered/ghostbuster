Detroit, Michigan - After a week-long break, negotiators for General Motors (GM) and the United Auto Workers (UAW) have resumed discussions to reach an agreement before UAW leaders meet on September 15th.
Negotiations had been ongoing for weeks before breaking last week, with both sides remaining optimistic for a deal to benefit their interests. The UAW represents nearly 50,000 GM workers in North America, including those employed at factories in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, New York, Tennessee and Texas.
Reports indicate that there have been challenges to reach an agreement, including union demands for increased wages and benefits, as well as job security for workers against future company layoffs. The union has also been pushing for the re-opening of factories that have been closed, including the Lordstown, Ohio facility, which previously produced the Chevrolet Cruze sedan.
However, the company has also stated their own concerns and interests, including the need for cost-saving measures to remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry, which has seen a decrease in sales of traditional vehicles such as cars and trucks, as well as a shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles. 
UAW representatives have been measured in their response to the potential for a deal, with President Gary Jones saying in a statement: “Our members have been clear about what they want in this contract and having a meaningful solution to the lowered GM foot print is a must.”
GM also released a statement, echoing their commitment to reaching an agreement that addresses both company and union needs, saying: “We remain committed to continuing discussions until an agreement is reached.”
The ongoing negotiations have garnered attention and support from politicians and other union organizations, including Democratic presidential candidates who have visited the striking workers in recent weeks. Both Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman have expressed their support for a resolution to the UAW-GM strike, with Sen. Portman stating that “[he is] hopeful that the negotiations get back on track and that [GM and UAW] reach a fair agreement for the workers, the company and the communities.”
As talks continue, the eyes of the public and industry will be on Detroit, as the outcome of the negotiations will likely have implications beyond just the GM-UAW relationship, but also for the future of the automotive industry in the United States.
