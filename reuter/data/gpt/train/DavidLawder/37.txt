Detroit, Michigan - The United Auto Workers (UAW) cancelled its meeting with General Motors (GM) chief negotiators on Friday, indicating significant hurdles remain in the labor dispute that has been ongoing since mid-September.
The move comes as a significant setback for the labor union, which has been negotiating with the automaker since mid-July in hopes of securing a new contract for its more than 46,000 members who work at GM. The union has been pressing for higher wages, better benefits, and job security, among other issues.
The cancellation of the meeting signals that the two sides remain far apart on key issues, including wage increases and the future of GM’s plants. The company announced earlier this year that it would be closing several plants in North America, drawing ire from both workers and politicians.
In an official statement, UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said that the union had not been presented with a “solid” proposal from GM in response to the union’s demands.
“Negotiations have been frustratingly slow,” Dittes said. “Our members deserve a fair contract that recognizes their hard work and contributions to the success of this company.”
A spokesperson for GM said that the company remains committed to reaching a fair and equitable agreement with the union.
“We continue to negotiate in good faith with the UAW to reach an agreement that works for both our employees and our company,” the spokesperson said.
While the two sides have been meeting regularly since the negotiations began, progress has been slow, with both sides accusing the other of being unwilling to compromise.
The UAW has criticized GM for failing to offer a concrete proposal on job security, while the company has pushed back against the union’s demand for a larger share of the company’s profits.
The labor dispute has also been complicated by the ongoing federal investigation into corruption among high-ranking UAW officials. The probe has resulted in charges against several individuals, including former UAW Vice President Norwood Jewell, who pleaded guilty earlier this month to accepting illegal gifts and bribes from Fiat Chrysler executives.
The investigation has cast a cloud over the negotiations, with some commentators speculating that the UAW may be reluctant to agree to a contract that does not include significant wage increases and job protections in light of the ongoing scandal.
Despite the challenges, both sides have expressed a willingness to continue negotiating.
A spokesperson for the UAW said that the union remained committed to securing a “strong and fair” agreement with GM, while a spokesperson for the automaker said that the company was hopeful that a deal could still be reached.
Industry analysts say that the protracted negotiations between the UAW and GM reflect broader trends in the auto industry, which is facing significant upheaval as the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles and the increasing popularity of ride-sharing services threaten traditional business models.
“This is a difficult time for the auto industry, and that’s reflected in the negotiations between GM and the UAW,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor, and economics at the Center for Automotive Research. “The industry is facing significant headwinds, and everyone is trying to figure out how navigate through them.”
The ongoing labor dispute has also had ripple effects beyond GM, with workers at other automakers, including Ford and Fiat Chrysler, keeping a close eye on the negotiations.
The UAW is expected to meet with GM negotiators again next week. While the prospects for a deal remain uncertain, both sides say they are committed to continuing the negotiations.
“We remain committed to reaching an agreement that works for everyone,” the GM spokesperson said. “We believe that the best way to achieve this is by continuing to work together at the bargaining table.”
