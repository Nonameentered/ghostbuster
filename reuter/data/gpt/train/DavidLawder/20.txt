DETROIT, MI â€“ With the clock ticking closer to the strike deadline, General Motors and the United Auto Workers returned to the bargaining table today in an effort to reach a new labor agreement before the current contract expires at midnight on Saturday.
This is the latest in a series of tense negotiations between the two sides, which began back in July. While both GM and the UAW have said they are committed to reaching a deal, there are still a number of issues on the table that need to be resolved.
One of the biggest sticking points is the issue of temporary workers. The UAW has been pushing for GM to convert more of its temporary workers to full-time status, arguing that they are doing the same work as regular employees but are paid significantly less and don't receive the same benefits.
GM, on the other hand, has said that it needs the flexibility to hire temporary workers in order to respond to changes in demand. The company has also pointed out that many of its current full-time employees started out as temps and worked their way up the ladder.
Another major issue is the fate of several GM plants that are scheduled to close. The UAW has been fighting to keep these plants open and preserve jobs for its members, but GM says that the plants are no longer viable and need to be closed in order for the company to remain competitive.
Other issues on the table include wages, healthcare benefits, and retirement pensions. The UAW has said that its members deserve a raise after years of wage stagnation, while GM has argued that its labor costs are already higher than many of its competitors and that it needs to keep them under control in order to remain competitive.
Despite these differences, both sides have expressed a willingness to continue negotiating and reach a deal before the deadline. GM CEO Mary Barra and UAW President Gary Jones have both issued statements saying that they are committed to finding a solution that works for everyone.
"We're working hard to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees and helps us remain competitive in an increasingly challenging marketplace," Barra said in a statement released earlier this week. "We know how important this is to our employees, our customers, and our communities, and we're doing everything we can to get there."
Jones echoed that sentiment, saying that the UAW is "committed to working with GM to find solutions that support both our members and the company's long-term success. We believe that a fair and equitable contract is within reach, and we're going to keep working until we get there."
While negotiations are ongoing, both sides are also preparing for the possibility of a strike. The UAW has already authorized a strike if a deal is not reached by the deadline, and it has been holding strike authorization meetings with its members at GM facilities across the country.
GM, for its part, has been working to mitigate the impact of a potential strike. The company has already announced that it is temporarily laying off 1,200 workers at a plant in Canada due to a shortage of parts caused by the strike threat.
If a strike does occur, it would be the first nationwide GM strike in over a decade. The last one occurred back in 2007 and lasted for two days before a deal was reached.
In the meantime, both GM and the UAW say that negotiations are ongoing and that they remain hopeful that a deal can be reached before the deadline. The eyes of the country are on Detroit, as the outcome of these negotiations could have significant implications not just for GM and the UAW, but for the entire American auto industry.
