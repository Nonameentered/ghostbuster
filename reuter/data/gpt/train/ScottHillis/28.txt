As one of the world's largest hydroelectric projects, China's Three Gorges Dam has drawn both admiration and criticism since its completion in 2012. However, another dam project along the Yangtze River's upper reaches has recently been making headlines for a different reason – its funding shortfall.
The Baihetan hydropower project, situated between the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, is being constructed in two phases and is expected to have a total installed capacity of 16 million kilowatts. The first phase, which began in 2017, is estimated to cost around 140 billion yuan ($20.3 billion), while the second phase would cost an additional 50 billion yuan.
According to the project's general manager, Dai Benliang, construction of the first phase is currently about 98 percent complete, with its six generating units scheduled to start operating in July 2021. However, funding for the project's second phase has hit a roadblock, with only one-third of the total amount secured so far.
The reason for this shortfall is the withdrawal of two of the project's major financiers – the Export-Import Bank of China (China Exim Bank) and China Development Bank (CDB). Both had initially offered to provide up to 50 percent of the financing for the second phase but later pulled out due to concerns about the project's economic viability and environmental impact.
While the Baihetan project has faced opposition from environmentalists and local communities concerned about the loss of land and displacement of people, it also represents one of China's most ambitious infrastructure endeavors and a significant part of China's plan to move away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy sources.
The project's main contractor, China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG), has vowed to complete the project by 2022, despite the funding shortfall and other challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking to Xinhua, CTG's chairman, Lu Chun, said that the company would "proactively explore multiple financing channels" to ensure that the project is fully funded.
However, some analysts remain skeptical about the project's prospects, given the current economic climate and the shift towards renewable energy in China's energy mix. "The Baihetan project is a relic of the past when China was actively building large dams to meet its energy needs," said Chen Wenhua, Director of the Energy Policy Research Center at the University of International Business and Economics. "But now, with the costs of renewable energy falling rapidly, there is less of a need for it."
While China is still the world's largest producer and consumer of coal, it has set ambitious targets to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and increase the share of renewables in its energy mix. China aims to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, which will require a substantial increase in clean energy capacity.
Renewable energy accounted for 10.3 percent of China's energy consumption in 2019, up from just 2.7 percent in 2011, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The country has also become the world's largest market for wind and solar power, and its installed capacity of renewable energy has surpassed that of fossil fuels for the first time.
As a result, some experts predict that the Baihetan project may not be as economically viable as it once appeared. "It is becoming harder and harder for large dams to secure financing, as their costs and risks are much higher than smaller, distributed renewable projects," said Christine Shearer, Program Director at the NGO, CoalSwarm.
In addition, hydropower projects – even those touted as "clean" sources of energy – can have significant social and environmental impacts, particularly in developing countries. Dams can displace indigenous communities, threaten endangered species, and alter ecosystem dynamics, among other concerns. In recent years, there has been increasing opposition to large dams globally, including in China.
Moreover, the dam-building spree in China over the past decades has also raised questions about the country's long-term water security, as well as the resilience of its infrastructure to natural disasters such as earthquakes and flooding.
In June 2020, heavy flooding in the Yangtze River Basin caused massive damage to homes, crops, and infrastructure, including the destruction of a dam in the city of Enshi. While the Baihetan project is designed to mitigate flood risks further downstream, some experts have criticized the overall approach to flood control in the region, arguing that it relies too heavily on infrastructure and fails to consider the ecological functions of river basins.
Despite these concerns, Chinese authorities have continued to promote hydropower as an essential component of its energy strategy. President Xi Jinping has called for "green development" as a key feature of China's post-pandemic recovery, and the government has pledged to reach peak coal consumption by 2025. However, it remains to be seen whether large-scale hydropower projects such as Baihetan can still attract sufficient investment and public support.
For now, CTG and other stakeholders are working to secure funding for the Baihetan project's second phase, which would involve the construction of an additional eight generating units. The completion of the entire project is expected to generate more than 60 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, enough to power millions of homes and businesses across China. However, its future remains uncertain amidst growing concerns about the project's environmental and economic impacts.
