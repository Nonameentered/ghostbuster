China has warned the United States to stop selling arms to Taiwan, which will have serious consequences for their relations. The warning comes amid increasing tensions between the two countries over a range of issues.
On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that the United States should stop all arms sales to Taiwan and end its military contacts with the island.
"The US must stop arms sales to Taiwan and stop its routine and wrong military contacts with Taiwan, and cautiously and appropriately handle Taiwan-related issues, so as to avoid seriously damaging China-US relations, peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he told a daily news briefing.
China has long claimed Taiwan as its own territory, and Beijing has been putting increasing pressure on Taipei in recent years. The issue of arms sales to Taiwan has been a particularly contentious one, with the United States being the island's biggest arms supplier.
Last year, the United States approved a $2.2 billion arms deal with Taiwan, which included tanks, missiles, and other military equipment. China immediately denounced the deal, saying it was a violation of its sovereignty.
The issue has become even more heated in recent months, with the US increasing its support for Taiwan. In August, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar became the highest-ranking US official to visit Taiwan in decades, a move that angered China.
In September, the United States also approved a further $1.8 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including drones and other high-tech military equipment. China again condemned the move and threatened to take action.
The warning from China about the arms sales comes at a time when relations between the two countries are already strained. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased tension, with both countries accusing each other of mishandling the outbreak.
The United States has also been critical of China's human rights record, particularly in relation to the treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province.
China has responded by imposing sanctions on US lawmakers and officials who have been critical of its policies, and by threatening to take action against US companies that do business in Taiwan.
The warning about arms sales to Taiwan is likely to further escalate tensions between the two countries. The United States has repeatedly said that it will continue to provide defensive weapons to Taiwan, and the island's government has praised the move as a necessary measure to protect itself from Chinese aggression.
However, China has warned that it will take action if the United States does not stop selling arms to Taiwan. Speaking at the same news briefing on Monday, Zhao Lijian said that China would "take necessary measures to safeguard our national sovereignty and security interests."
The warning is a clear indication that China is willing to take a hard line on the issue of Taiwan, and that it is not willing to back down in the face of US pressure. The coming months are likely to be a crucial period for China-US relations, as the two countries continue to spar over a range of issues, including trade and human rights.
