Beijing, China - A recent documentary about the late paramount leader of China, Deng Xiaoping, has received mixed reviews from both domestic and international audiences.
Titled "Deng Xiaoping: The Last Great Statesman," the three-part series showcases Deng's life and legacy, focusing on his contributions to China's economic development and his diplomatic achievements.
Many Chinese viewers have praised the documentary for its objective portrayal of Deng's achievements, with some even calling it a "must-watch" for younger generations to understand the country's recent history.
"Deng Xiaoping was a great leader who brought China to where it is today. It's important for young people to know his story and learn from his experience," one viewer wrote on the popular video-sharing platform Bilibili.
However, some viewers have criticized the documentary for overlooking Deng's controversial actions, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and his role in the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s.
"The documentary glorifies Deng way too much without mentioning the dark side of his legacy, including the thousands of innocent people killed during the Tiananmen crackdown," another viewer commented on social media platform Weibo.
Outside China, the documentary has also sparked controversy for its portrayal of Deng's legacy and the Chinese government's ongoing efforts to promote his ideas and policies.
"By praising Deng's reform and development policies, the documentary reinforces the Chinese government's narrative that the Communist Party's leadership and ideology are essential to China's success," said Sarah Cook, a senior researcher at the human rights organization Freedom House.
Cook also pointed out that the documentary's coverage of sensitive topics such as the Tiananmen massacre and the crackdown on the student-led democracy movement in 1989 is "very limited and superficial."
The documentary's release comes as China is facing growing scrutiny from the international community over its human rights abuses, particularly in Tibet, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong. Some critics argue that the documentary is part of China's "soft power" campaign to improve its global image and deflect criticism of its actions.
Despite the mixed reviews, the documentary has already attracted millions of viewers in China and abroad, highlighting the continued fascination with Deng Xiaoping's legacy and his role in shaping modern China.
"Deng Xiaoping was a great statesman who changed China's destiny and the world's perception of China. He deserves to be remembered and respected," said Zhang Weiwei, the director of the documentary and a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai. "Our goal with this documentary is to promote a more nuanced and accurate understanding of Deng Xiaoping's contributions and challenges."
