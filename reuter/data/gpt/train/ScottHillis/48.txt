Beijing, China - The Chinese government has defended its proposal to roll back civil liberties in Hong Kong, saying that the move is necessary to maintain national security and stability.
The proposal, which was unveiled last week, would empower the Chinese central government to establish national security agencies in Hong Kong and criminalize acts that are deemed as secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces.
The move has sparked outrage in Hong Kong and around the world, with critics arguing that it would infringe on the city's autonomy and freedom of expression, and that it would undermine the "one country, two systems" policy that has been in place since the former British colony was handed over to China in 1997.
However, Chinese officials insisted that the proposal is aimed at protecting national security and safeguarding Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.
"The proposed legislation is a necessary step to plug the loopholes in Hong Kong's legal system and ensure that the city is not a safe haven for separatists, terrorists, and foreign forces that seek to undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," said Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry.
"The legislation will not affect the rights and freedoms of law-abiding Hong Kong residents, but it will provide a strong deterrent against those who seek to cause chaos and unrest in the city."
Critics of the proposal, however, argue that it would give Beijing sweeping powers to crack down on dissent and silence pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.
"The national security law would be a death knell for Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy," said Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist. "It would allow Beijing to crush dissent and punish those who speak out against the government."
The proposed legislation has also drawn criticism from the international community, with the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada expressing concern that it would erode Hong Kong's autonomy and violate its citizens' rights.
"China's proposed national security legislation for Hong Kong would be in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legally binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration," said the foreign ministers of the four countries in a joint statement.
"We are also extremely concerned that this action would exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society."
Despite the backlash, Chinese officials have shown no signs of backing down on the proposal. In fact, they have accused foreign governments of meddling in China's internal affairs and interfering with its sovereignty.
"The Chinese government has the right and the responsibility to safeguard national security and stability, and to protect the lawful rights and interests of Hong Kong residents," said Geng Shuang, another spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry.
"We urge the relevant foreign governments to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and to respect China's legitimate right to safeguard national security."
The proposed legislation is expected to be passed by China's national legislature later this month, and it is likely to be implemented in Hong Kong by September. The move is likely to further escalate tensions between China and the United States, which has threatened to take action against China if it moves forward with the proposal.
