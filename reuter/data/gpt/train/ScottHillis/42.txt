The United States military has officially paid tribute to its fallen heroes in World War Two through a repatriation ceremony held in China on Thursday. The ceremony was held to honour the six American airmen who were killed in a plane crash in 1945 while they were on a mission to deliver supplies to the Chinese government in the fight against the Japanese.
The aircraft's wreckage had been discovered in a remote part of China in 1998 by a group of Chinese and American historians. But, it wasn't until a team of US Army recovery experts arrived in 2018 that the remains of the six crew members were finally recovered and repatriated to the US for identification.
The ceremony, held in the city of Kunming in Yunnan Province, was attended by US military personnel and officials from the Chinese government. The ceremony began with the opening of a wooden box which contained the remains of the six airmen, draped in the American flag. The six sets of remains were then carried, one by one, by US service members in formal dress uniforms through a long line of Chinese military and civilian officials, who saluted as the caskets passed by.
The US military officials honoured the airmen with a 21-gun salute and the playing of taps. The ceremony ended with the US personnel folding the American flag and presenting it to the families of the airmen as a sign of appreciation for their sacrifice.
"We are here to bring our heroes home...to ensure they are not forgotten and to ensure future generations know of their selfless sacrifice," said Randy Meador, Deputy Director, Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.
This repatriation ceremony marks the end of a long search for the lost airmen, whose families had waited for over 75 years to finally have closure on the fate of their loved ones. The remains will now undergo DNA analysis to be identified and then returned to their families for burial in the US.
The six airmen, from the US Army's 1st Air Transport Group, were on a mission to deliver cargo to the Chinese government in Chongqing when their C-46 aircraft crashed on 17 January 1945. The cause of the crash is still unknown, but it is believed that the crew encountered bad weather or navigational problems.
For families, the ceremony was an emotional and long-awaited moment. "We waited for this day for a long time, and we are very grateful to the American and Chinese governments for their efforts," said Roger Chapman, the nephew of Staff Sgt. James Joseph Reaves.
The US military has said that it will continue to search for the remains of Americans who lost their lives during the war. According to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, there are still over 82,000 Americans missing from past conflicts, including World War II, in which more than 400,000 US soldiers were killed.
The repatriation ceremony in China puts to rest one of the many lingering mysteries of World War II and provides solace for the families of the brave airmen who made the ultimate sacrifice.
