China's top graft-buster, Wei Jianxing, praised the success of the country's anti-corruption efforts in 1996 and urged even greater efforts in the year ahead. Wei's remarks were made at the annual plenary session of the Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) on Wednesday.
Wei, who is also the secretary general of the CCDI, noted that China's anti-corruption campaign had made significant progress in the past year, with a total of 36,618 officials receiving disciplinary actions. This included 10,494 officials who were expelled from the Party, an increase of 14.5% from the previous year.
Wei also highlighted the success of the CCDI's investigation into "tigers and flies," referring to high-ranking officials and low-level bureaucrats, respectively. He noted that the CCDI had investigated 26 centrally administered officials, 118 provincially administered officials, and 2,938 city and county officials. Additionally, the CCDI had also investigated 37,000 grassroots-level officials.
Wei praised the CCDI's work in rooting out corruption and stressed the importance of continuing this momentum into the new year. He also urged officials to tackle corruption at its roots, by strengthening institutional safeguards, streamlining administrative procedures, and promoting transparency and accountability.
Wei also emphasized the importance of integrating anti-corruption work into the overall development strategy of the country. "We should make it our goal to establish a clean government, to build a clean society, and to foster a clean culture," he said.
To achieve this goal, Wei called on officials to promote a culture of integrity and to implement measures to prevent corruption at all levels of government. This includes strengthening supervision and accountability mechanisms, improving public service delivery, and enhancing communication and cooperation between government and the people.
Wei's remarks were well received by many anti-corruption advocates in China. "Wei's speech was very inspiring," said Wang Yukai, a professor at the National School of Administration. "It shows that the Party's leadership is very determined to crack down on corruption and to establish a clean government."
However, some critics argued that Wei's words were more talk than action. "Wei's speech was nothing new," said Hu Xingdou, a professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology. "What we need is concrete action and effective measures to tackle corruption, not just empty words."
Despite the criticisms, Wei's comments reflect the Chinese government's continued commitment to fighting corruption. In recent years, China has launched a massive anti-corruption campaign, targeting both high-profile officials and grassroots-level bureaucrats. The campaign has been accompanied by measures to promote transparency, accountability, and public participation in government decision-making.
As China enters a new year, the challenges of corruption remain enormous. However, Wei and the CCDI are determined to build on the achievements of the past year and to continue making progress in the ongoing fight against corruption. "We must never relax in our efforts to combat corruption," Wei said. "We must continue to be vigilant and to strengthen our resolve in fighting this scourge."
