China Warns Taiwan Against Seeking Independence, Threatens Disaster
The Chinese government has issued a stern warning to Taiwan, cautioning against the pursuit of independence and threatening to use military force against the island nation if it does not back down.
The warning was issued by Chinese President Xi Jinping in a speech commemorating the 40th anniversary of Beijing's "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan," a policy statement that outlined China's stance on reunification with Taiwan.
"I want to emphasize that we must uphold the principle of 'peaceful reunification' and promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations," Xi said, according to state media. "However, we will never allow any form of secessionist activities to take place in Taiwan."
Xi went on to warn that "we make no promise to renounce the use of force, and reserve the option of taking all necessary measures" to prevent Taiwanese independence.
The statement from China comes amid rising tensions between the two countries, with Taiwan increasingly pushing back against what it sees as encroachment on its sovereignty by Beijing.
Taiwan has been self-governing since the end of a civil war in 1949, but China still claims the island as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it back into its fold.
In recent years, China has ramped up its efforts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and economically, persuading a number of countries to cut official ties with Taipei and blocking its participation in international organizations such as the United Nations.
Taiwan, for its part, has sought to boost its international profile and forge closer relationships with like-minded countries, including the United States and Japan.
Last month, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen delivered a New Year's speech in which she vowed to defend the island's democracy and freedom against what she called "threats" from China.
"Our determination to defend our sovereignty and democracy has never wavered," Tsai said. "We will not bow to pressure, nor will we back down."
The Chinese government responded with a series of military drills and flyovers near Taiwan, causing concern among some experts that a clash between the two sides could be imminent.
Many in Taiwan are also worried about Beijing's efforts to influence domestic politics on the island, with allegations of election interference and media manipulation becoming increasingly common.
Taiwanese officials have accused China of using disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks to undermine democracy on the island, while Beijing has accused Taiwan of supporting separatist movements in Hong Kong and Tibet.
The warnings from China have sparked condemnation from the international community, with many countries urging Beijing to refrain from using force against Taiwan and to engage in dialogue with Taipei.
"This kind of saber-rattling and intimidation is not the way to resolve differences between countries," said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. "We urge all parties to resolve their disputes through peaceful means and to respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity."
The United States, which has long maintained unofficial ties with Taiwan and provides military assistance to the island, also issued a statement expressing concern over China's warning.
"We call on China to renounce the use of force, and to engage in constructive dialogue with Taiwan to resolve any differences," said State Department spokesperson Robert Palladino.
Despite the warnings, many in Taiwan remain defiant, with pro-independence groups holding rallies and calling for a referendum on the island's future status.
"It is time for us to decide our own fate, and to reject any attempts by China to dominate and control us," said Lin Fei-fan, a prominent organizer of the pro-independence movement.
But with tensions continuing to rise, the future of Taiwan's relationship with China remains uncertain, with many fearing that disaster could be just around the corner.
