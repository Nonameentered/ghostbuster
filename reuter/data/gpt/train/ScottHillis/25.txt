Beijing, China – Jailed Chinese dissident Wang Dan is reportedly suffering from severe health problems in prison, with little access to medical care in frigid conditions.
Wang Dan, a pro-democracy activist who was one of the leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, was arrested for a fourth time in 2016. He is currently serving a four-year sentence for “inciting subversion of state power.”
According to a report by the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD), Wang Dan is being held in a cold and damp cell in Jiangxi Prison, where temperatures have reportedly dropped to -4 degrees Celsius. The report suggests that Wang Dan has been suffering from respiratory problems and persistent coughing for the past two months, and is barely able to walk.
“Wang Dan’s health is deteriorating rapidly due to the extreme conditions he is being subjected to in the prison,” said Renee Xia, executive director of CHRD. “We urge the Chinese authorities to immediately grant him access to medical care and to ensure that the conditions of his detention comply with international human rights standards.”
Wang Dan’s family members have also expressed concern for his health, as they have been denied visits to him since early 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. His sister, Wang Xiaoping, told CHRD that they have not been able to speak to him and do not know the full extent of his health problems.
“We are very worried about my brother’s health,” she said. “We hope the authorities will allow us to visit him soon and give us more information about his condition.”
Wang Dan has been a vocal critic of the Chinese government for decades, and has spent a total of 11 years in prison for his activism. His case has been cited by international human rights groups as an example of China’s crackdown on political dissent.
This is not the first time that concerns have been raised over the treatment of political prisoners in China. In 2017, Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo died in custody after being denied medical treatment for liver cancer. Earlier this year, another dissident, Xu Zhiyong, was reportedly tortured and forced to take medicine at a detention center in Beijing.
The Chinese government has consistently denied allegations of mistreatment of prisoners and has instead accused foreign countries of interfering in its domestic affairs. However, human rights groups maintain that China’s human rights record remains a cause for concern.
Wang Dan’s case highlights the urgent need for the Chinese government to address the rights of political prisoners and to ensure that they are treated humanely. It is imperative that he is granted immediate access to medical care and that his family is allowed to visit him to ensure that he receives the support he needs.
