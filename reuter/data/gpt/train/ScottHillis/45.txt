Guatemala has affirmed its support for China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, thereby pledging not to back Taiwan's bid for United Nations recognition, China's President, Xi Jinping, announced on Tuesday.
According to reports, Jinping had telephone discussions with Guatemalan President, Alejandro Giammattei. During the call, Giammattei confirmed that his government would continue to adhere to the One-China principle and would oppose any attempts to recognize Taiwan as an independent territory.
China has been engaged in a longstanding dispute with Taiwan over sovereignty and has been actively lobbying against Taiwan's international recognition. Currently, only a handful of countries, including the United States and Japan, officially recognize Taiwan as an independent nation. Other countries that maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan are Belize, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Honduras, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, the Dominican Republic, Palau, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Tuvalu.
Giammattei's pledge to support China was met with praise by the Chinese foreign ministry, which described the move as an "important development". Speaking at a press briefing, the ministry's spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, stated that "China appreciates and welcomes Guatemala's reaffirming adherence to the One-China principle and its firm determination to support China on issues concerning China's core interests. We stand ready to work with Guatemala to steadily advance our comprehensive cooperative partnership."
Critics of China's campaign to marginalize Taiwan's international status argue that the One-China principle violates democratic values of self-determination and aligns with China's desire to dominate the region. These observers point out that Taiwan has significant economic and cultural ties in the international community, while its exclusion from the United Nations deprives it of a platform to represent its positions.
Despite these criticisms, however, China's efforts to isolate Taiwan have been successful in many parts of the world. In recent years, several countries, including the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and São Tomé and Príncipe, have cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China, while other states, such as Uganda and Zambia, have been pressured to downgrade their relations with Taiwan.
The broader international implications of China's influence over Taiwan, particularly as it relates to China's geopolitical ambitions in the Pacific, have been a growing concern in recent years. Experts warn that China's increasing assertiveness in the region and its annexation of territories claimed by other Pacific nations are a serious threat to the existing international order.
In response to such concerns, countries like the United States have been stepping up their support for Taiwan, signing new arms deals and increasing naval patrols in the region to counterbalance China's influence.
The announcement of Guatemala's pledge not to support Taiwan's UN bid is likely to further galvanize opinion on both sides of the Taiwan-Straits. While China continues to insist that Taiwan is an integral part of its territory, Taiwan's leaders maintain that the island is a sovereign nation with the right to self-determination. The ongoing dispute between the two countries is likely to remain a contentious issue for many years to come.
