Moscow â€“ In a thrilling finale to the World Cup series, Russian swimmer Maria Kameneva broke the European record to spoil a clean sweep by the Chinese women. Kameneva competed in the 50m freestyle event, and her time of 23.62 seconds was enough to edge out China's Xiang Liu, who finished second with a time of 23.69 seconds. Kameneva's victory was particularly impressive as this was only her second appearance in the series.
Prior to the event, it appeared that China was set to dominate the World Cup series. The Chinese women had won every event so far, and they looked strong to continue their dominance. However, Kameneva's victory proved that the Russian team was not to be underestimated, and they put up a great performance on home soil.
Speaking after the event, Kameneva said: "I am very happy to have won this race and broken the European record, especially since it was against such a strong field. This has been a great experience for me, and I hope to build on this performance in the future".
Kameneva's success was not the only highlight of the World Cup series finale. Chinese swimmer Yufei Zhang continued her impressive form by winning the 200m butterfly and setting a new World Cup record of 2 minutes 3.45 seconds. This was Zhang's fifth victory in the series, and she was awarded the trophy for the best female swimmer of the World Cup series.
In the men's events, the battle was much closer. Russian swimmer Kliment Kolesnikov won the 50m backstroke and the 100m backstroke events, narrowly beating out his rivals. Meanwhile, Hungarian swimmer Kristof Milak dominated the 200m butterfly event, setting a new World Cup record of 1 minute 51.08 seconds.
The World Cup series finale was held in Moscow's Luzhniki Aquatics Centre, which recently underwent a major renovation ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The event drew thousands of fans, who came to watch some of the world's best swimmers compete against each other.
Speaking about the event, World Cup Series Director Christian Toetzke said: "We are delighted with how this year's World Cup series has gone. We have seen some fantastic performances from the world's best swimmers, and it is always great to see new records set. We look forward to next year's series, where we hope to see even more world-class swimming".
