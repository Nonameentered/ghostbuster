The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit, held in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, ended with conflicting views among political leaders on the direction of trade.
Representatives from the Pacific powers, including the United States, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, pushed for the continuation of free trade and trade liberalization. However, China took a different stance, pushing for the promotion of soft loans to developing countries in the region.
US Vice President Mike Pence used his speech at the Summit to criticize China's trade practices. He accused China of unfair trade policies and intellectual property theft, and urged countries to choose the United States as their trade partner instead.
"We don't drown our partners in a sea of debt," Pence said, referring to China's Belt and Road Initiative, which has involved China offering infrastructure loans to developing countries.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also stressed the importance of free trade and urged countries to work towards a "comprehensive, high standard and TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) 11."
The TPP was a regional free trade agreement negotiations that the United States had originally been a part of, but withdrew from after President Donald Trump took office. The remaining 11 countries, including Japan and Australia, have moved forward with the agreement.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the TPP was a "powerful message of our commitment to the prosperity and growth of our region."
New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also emphasized the benefits of free trade and the TPP, saying it would create a "more prosperous, open and connected region."
However, China's President Xi Jinping used the APEC Summit to promote his government's Belt and Road Initiative and soft loans. He stressed the importance of "inclusive development" and said China was willing to "work with all parties to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world."
China has been accused of using soft loans to gain strategic influence in the region, with some countries falling into debt traps and being forced to give up key assets to China.
Despite the differing views on trade, the APEC Summit did result in some agreements being signed. Leaders agreed to work towards reforming the World Trade Organization (WTO), with a focus on improving transparency and dispute settlement.
They also agreed to work towards achieving a "comprehensive, high quality and mutually beneficial" Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) by next year. The RCEP is a free trade agreement being negotiated between the 10 member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and six other countries, including China and Japan.
However, the APEC Summit did not result in a joint communique, with Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill saying the leaders were unable to reach agreement on certain issues.
"We couldn't reach consensus on certain language that reflects our different visions," he said.
The lack of a joint communique highlights the difficultly in achieving consensus among the APEC countries. The tensions between the United States and China on trade have been a major issue, with the two countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods.
Overall, the APEC Summit demonstrated the conflicting views among the Pacific powers and China on the direction of trade. While the United States and Japan pushed for free trade and liberalization, China promoted soft loans and its Belt and Road Initiative. With tensions between the United States and China continuing to rise, it remains to be seen what the future of trade in the Asia-Pacific region holds.
