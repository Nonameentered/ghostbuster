Beijing, China - A team of 20 forensics specialists from the United States has arrived in China to recover the remains of a World War Two bomber crew that crashed during a mission in the country.
According to reports, the B-24 aircraft crashed in China's southwestern province of Yunnan on December 17, 1944, while en route to a bombing raid in Burma. All 10 crew members on board died in the crash, and their remains have never been found.
The team of investigators, led by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), is set to begin a month-long search at the crash site on Sunday. The agency's mission is to recover the remains of missing U.S. military personnel from past conflicts, and bring closure to their families.
The DPAA says that the site has been identified as the crash location thanks to information provided by the Chinese government, as well as research conducted by the U.S. Army Air Forces during the war.
"We know where the crash site is, we have been working with the Chinese government to get permissions to excavate the site, and we have the right team of experts to carry out the mission," Rear Adm. Jon Kreitz, the DPAA's director, said in a statement.
The team includes forensic anthropologists, archaeologists, a photographer, a document specialist, and a historian. They will be working alongside Chinese officials and a team from the Yunnan Province Cultural Relics and Archaeology Institute.
"We are grateful for the support we have received from the Chinese government and the people of Yunnan Province," Kreitz said. "This mission is an important step in our continued efforts to bring home our missing service members."
The team will be using ground-penetrating radar equipment, metal detectors, and other technology to locate and recover any remains. The excavation is expected to be challenging, as the site is located in rugged and remote terrain at an altitude of over 9,000 feet.
The DPAA says that it will take several months to identify any remains that are recovered. The identification process will involve DNA analysis, dental records, and other forensic means.
According to the agency, there are still over 82,000 U.S. service members who are unaccounted for from World War Two, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The DPAA has identified and repatriated more than 200 remains over the past year.
The recovery mission in China is just one example of the work being done by the agency to bring closure to the families of missing service members. It also highlights the importance of cooperation between the U.S. and foreign governments in locating and identifying remains.
"We will never forget our service members who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country," Kreitz said. "We owe it to them and to their families to do everything we can to bring them home."
