Beijing - Chinese President Jiang Zemin has called for views and suggestions from the Taiwanese people on the reunification with mainland China, setting a positive tone for the enduring dilemma between the two sides.
During an event held on Wednesday, Mr. Jiang spoke to a group of Taiwanese businessmen and officials about the future of Taiwan and its place in the world and how they are looking for ways to help them understand the Chinese government policies on reuniting with Taiwan.
Mr. Jiang asserted that the Chinese government respects Taiwanese independence, self-management, and democracy. He emphasized his desire to listen to the voice of the Taiwanese people and receive any suggestions or views they have.
China has long held the belief that the island of Taiwan is part of its territory and has routinely expressed the intention to unify the two sides, even though Taiwan operates as a separate, democratic, and autonomous region.
However, the Taiwanese government and people have resisted the Chinese administration's attempts to reunite with them, citing a desire to maintain their democratic way of life and rule of law.
The president acknowledged the existing disagreements between the two sides and said the Chinese government would see Taiwan as merely an internal matter to maintain peace and stability if it is willing to accept what he called the "1992 consensus," which is the idea that there is only one China encompassing the mainland and Taiwan, even though the two sides can interpret its meaning in different ways.
This statement is significant because it indicates Beijing is open to hearing the views of Taiwanese citizens, underscoring progress in the relationship between the two sides, which have been periodically hostile over the past few years.
Mr. Jiang further stated that closer economic ties between Taiwan and the mainland would lead to better opportunities for both sides. He highlighted China's progress in the field of science and technology, and praised Taiwan's entrepreneurial spirit and innovation. He mentioned joint ventures between Taiwan and the mainland as an excellent example of cooperation and collaboration.
With China's invigorated focus on reunification with Taiwan, tensions have soared in recent years. The US has been firmly supporting Taiwan's democratic government and has cautioned China against taking any military action against the island. The US under President Trump's leadership increased its support to Taipei, with controversial moves such as visits by high-level US officials, arms deals, and dropping restrictions on Taiwan-US contacts.
The January inauguration of President Biden has moderated the US's approach towards Taiwan, emphasizing cooperative rather than confrontational measures. Biden's policymakers have proposed working with US allies and partners to shape Beijing policy, rather than claiming that they will isolate China.
In Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen has said she would be willing to engage in talks with China, but only if Beijing respected Taiwan's independence, democracy, and sovereignty.
Mr. Jiang's speech on Wednesday could be seen as a hopeful sign that both sides remain committed to resolving their differences peacefully and through dialogue, potentially ushering in a new era of cooperation and understanding.
