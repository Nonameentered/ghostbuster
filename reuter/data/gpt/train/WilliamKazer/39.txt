In a move seen as a snub to China's Premier Li Peng, the United States has sidestepped him by declining his invitation to attend the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The US has instead sent a lower-level delegation, citing concerns over human rights abuses in China.
The massacre that took place in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, is one of the defining moments of China's modern history. Thousands of unarmed pro-democracy protesters were killed by Chinese soldiers in a brutal crackdown that shocked the world. China has since censored all discussions of the incident and labeled it a "counter-revolutionary riot."
Chinese Premier Li Peng was widely seen as the architect of the crackdown, and his attendance at the anniversary ceremony was expected to create controversy. The Chinese government has been accused of ignoring human rights and suppressing dissent, and Li Peng's presence was seen as a symbol of this repression.
The US has been an outspoken critic of China's human rights record, and the decision to send a lower-level delegation was seen as a clear message to China's leaders. The delegation was led by David Stilwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and included officials from the State Department and the US embassy in Beijing.
Stilwell met with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng on Monday, where the two discussed a range of issues, including trade, security, and human rights. According to a statement from the State Department, Stilwell "candidly and constructively" raised concerns over the ongoing human rights abuses in China.
"The United States believes that an open and inclusive society, with respect for human rights and the rule of law, is vital to the stability and prosperity of any country," the statement said. "We urge China to respect the rights and freedoms of all its citizens and to uphold its international obligations."
The decision to send a lower-level delegation was not unexpected, given the tensions between the US and China in recent years. The two countries have been engaged in an escalating trade war, and there have been concerns over China's territorial ambitions in the South China Sea.
However, the US has been increasingly vocal in its criticism of China's human rights record, particularly with regards to its treatment of minority groups like the Uighurs in Xinjiang. The US has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials and entities involved in the detention and persecution of Uighurs, and has also been critical of China's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
China, for its part, has responded with hostility to US criticism, accusing the US of interfering in its internal affairs. The Chinese government has also stepped up its own propaganda efforts, seeking to portray itself as a force for stability in the world and a defender of globalism against the rising tide of populism.
The decision to snub Li Peng was therefore seen as a significant statement by the US, sending a clear message that it will not tolerate China's human rights abuses. It remains to be seen how China will respond, but the US is likely to continue to put pressure on China over human rights issues.
The US has a long history of promoting human rights and democracy around the world, and this latest move is in keeping with that tradition. However, it is also a sign of the growing tensions between the US and China, and of the risks inherent in a world where two superpowers are vying for dominance.
As the US looks towards the 2020 presidential election, it will be interesting to see how the relationship with China evolves. Both President Trump and his likely challenger, Joe Biden, have been critical of China's human rights record, but they differ on how to approach China more broadly.
For now, however, the US has sent a clear message to China's leaders that it will not tolerate human rights abuses, and that it will continue to hold them accountable for their actions. It remains to be seen whether China will listen.
