China vehemently opposed Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu's ongoing visit to Jordan, accusing the self-ruled island of continually disrupting diplomatic ties between the two countries. Beijing's statement comes as a blow to Taipei, which had hoped to boost its diplomatic stature through the trip.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Thursday said that China firmly opposes Taiwan's attempts to carry out any form of official or unofficial activities with other countries. The move goes against the one-China principle, which China maintains to be the foundation of its foreign policy.
Wang added that Taiwan's actions not only violate the international law and norms of international relations but also threaten regional peace and stability. He urged all countries to follow the "One China" principle and handle Taiwan-related issues appropriately to avoid any complications that could arise.
Joseph Wu, while speaking to reporters, said that Jordan has always been a friendly country to Taiwan. He added that he would discuss bilateral cooperation, including trade, culture, and COVID-19, with Jordan's leadership during his visit.
However, Taiwan's efforts to expand its diplomatic presence have been overshadowed by the long-standing dispute with China over sovereignty. China considers Taiwan to be a renegade province that it aims to reunify, by force if necessary. 
China has increasingly imposed diplomatic and economic isolation on Taiwan and pressured other countries to switch allegiance from Taipei to Beijing. In recent years, Taiwan has lost several diplomatic allies to Beijing, including formerly staunch supporters like the Solomon Islands and Kiribati.
Underlining China's influence, Wu's visit to Jordan coincides with a trip by a high-level political delegation from China. Beijing and Amman, the capital of Jordan, enjoy close economic and diplomatic ties, which have more recently focused on cooperating in China's Belt and Road Initiative.
Taiwan has only existed as a separate political entity for over seven decades, initially as a refuge for the defeated nationalist forces after its civil war with pro-communist forces in China. In recent years, Taiwan has gained recognition from the international community in sports, academia, and public health areas, often under the name "Chinese Taipei."
However, the continued political and sometimes even military provocations between Taiwan and China make it challenging for Taiwan to assert itself internationally. The trip by its foreign minister to Jordan serves yet another reminder of the problems Taiwan faces in the diplomatic sphere.
