Beijing, China – The trade war between the United States and China has taken a fresh turn as China announces a temporary ban on select U.S. imports. The move comes in response to Washington's decision to impose fresh tariffs on Chinese goods worth $200 billion.
Under the new restrictions, China will stop importing American goods such as crude oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal. The move is expected to hurt U.S. energy companies who have been banking on increased sales to China's rapidly growing economy.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated on Friday that the ban on specific U.S. imports will come into effect on September 24th. The move was made in an attempt to counterbalance Washington’s latest efforts, as it believes that they have "violated the principles of free trade".
Furthermore, the Ministry stated that "an additional 10% tariff will be levied on the remaining list of U.S. products such as chemicals, rubber, and PC components." This decision would affect more than 5,000 products imported from the United States and is likely to spur further retaliatory measures.
The ongoing trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies has led to a fierce rivalry between Beijing and Washington. According to experts, the next round of tariffs could have more severe implications for the global economy.
"The temporary ban on select U.S. imports will only escalate the ongoing trade dispute between both sides. China is showing that it's not going to back down, and it's willing to fight this to the end," said an expert at the University of Beijing.
The U.S. President has repeatedly accused China of unfair trade practices, which he claims have cost American jobs and hurt the American economy. Furthermore, he imposed tariffs on Chinese goods worth $50 billion earlier this year, followed by an additional $200 billion last week.
In response, China has threatened to retaliate with countermeasures on U.S. goods, including cars, chemical fiber, and farming products. Beijing has also announced that it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products.
Ever since the trade dispute between China and the United States began, global markets have been volatile. Although many experts predict that a full-blown trade war between the two giants would have far-reaching consequences, both sides appear to be digging in their heels and unwilling to back down.
The United States claims that China has been using unfair trade practices, such as intellectual property theft, to gain economic advantage over the United States. However, China disputes these accusations and argues that its economy has been scaling up on innovation and therefore isn't responsible for the alleged theft of intellectual property.
The new restrictions imposed by China will undoubtedly have an impact on multiple American industries. The U.S. energy markets are expected to face the brunt of the ban, with companies such as Chevron and ExxonMobil having to look for new markets to sell their energy products.
As tensions continue to escalate between the two countries, the impact of the ongoing trade dispute is likely to be felt across several industries and economies. The question now is how long both sides will continue to take turns wielding retaliatory tariffs and if negotiations will be called to the table.
