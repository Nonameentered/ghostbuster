In a bid to bolster its trading in a Hong Kong-listed firm, Chinese technology company Stone Group is planning to inject assets into the firm, according to sources familiar with the matter.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Stone Group is looking to acquire the assets through a share swap deal that would see it take a controlling stake in the Hong Kong-listed firm.
Stone Group is one of China's leading technology companies, with a focus on the development and production of high-tech products such as smartphones, tablet computers, and digital televisions. The company has experienced significant growth in recent years, with revenues of over $6 billion in 2020, up from just $1 billion in 2015.
The move to inject assets into the Hong Kong-listed firm is seen as a strategic one by Stone Group, which is looking to expand its presence in the country's tech market. The firm has already made significant investments in Chinese companies in recent years, including gaming giant Tencent and online retailer JD.com.
Hong Kong has become a key market for technology companies in recent years, with the city's stock exchange attracting a growing number of tech firms looking to raise capital and expand their operations in the region.
According to data from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the total market capitalization of technology companies listed on the exchange stood at HKD 4.2 trillion ($544 billion) at the end of 2020, up from HKD 1.5 trillion ($194 billion) at the end of 2015.
Stone Group's move to inject assets into the Hong Kong-listed firm is part of a broader trend of Chinese tech companies looking to expand their presence in the city. Earlier this year, e-commerce giant Alibaba listed its shares in Hong Kong, raising $11.3 billion in what was the largest initial public offering of 2019.
The move by Stone Group is also expected to further boost the company's financial performance, which has been on a strong upward trajectory in recent years. In addition to its growing revenues, the company's net profit margin has also been steadily increasing, from 4.1% in 2015 to 8.3% in 2020.
Stone Group's growth has been driven by a combination of factors, including its cutting-edge technology, innovative product development, and strong partnerships with key players in the industry.
In a statement, Stone Group said that it was committed to "continuing to invest in its growth trajectory, through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, and by continuing to innovate and develop new products that meet the changing needs of its customers."
The move by Stone Group is also expected to benefit the Hong Kong-listed firm, which has struggled to keep up with its competitors in the crowded and increasingly competitive tech market.
By injecting assets into the firm, Stone Group will be able to offer it access to the latest technology, as well as the financial resources to expand its operations and increase its market share.
The deal is also likely to attract the attention of other investors in the tech market, who are likely to view Stone Group's investment in the Hong Kong-listed firm as a sign of their confidence in the company's future growth potential.
Overall, the move by Stone Group to inject assets into the Hong Kong-listed firm is expected to provide a boost to both companies, as well as the wider tech market in the region. With Chinese tech companies continuing to expand their presence in Hong Kong and other key markets, the stage is set for further growth and innovation in the industry in the years ahead.
