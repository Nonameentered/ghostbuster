China Accuses U.S. of Trying to Contain Them and Calls for Policy Shift
Beijing has accused Washington of trying to contain its rising power and influence in the world. Amid escalating tensions between the two countries over trade, technology, and territorial disputes in the South China Sea, China's top diplomat has called for a policy shift to avoid a head-on collision between the world's two largest economies.
China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, spoke at a diplomatic forum in Beijing on Monday, where he accused the US of attempting to contain China's growth and development. He argued that the US was trying to maintain its global supremacy and prevent other countries from challenging its dominance, thus engaging in a "Cold War mentality" towards China.
"The US should give up its wishful thinking of changing China and stopping 1.4 billion people in their march toward modernization," said Wang Yi. "China is not interested in replacing the US or changing its system, nor will it become another US. It is time for the US to give up its arrogance and prejudice and adopt a truly objective and fair attitude toward China's development."
Wang Yi's comments came shortly after the US announced its plan to sell military equipment worth $2 billion to Taiwan, which Beijing sees as part of its territory. China has complained about the deal, calling it a violation of its sovereignty and a return to "Cold War thinking." China also claims that Taiwan is a "core interest" of its own, and has warned the US not to meddle in its affairs.
The US has also taken a tough stance on trade with China, imposing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods in an attempt to reduce the US trade deficit and force China to change its economic policies. The two countries have been engaged in a trade war for over a year, with no resolution in sight.
The US has also targeted Chinese technology companies, including Huawei and ZTE, over concerns that their equipment could be used for spying and other malicious purposes. The US has banned these companies from selling their products to US government agencies and has encouraged other countries to follow its lead.
China has responded by accusing the US of protectionism and attempting to stifle Chinese innovation and technological development. Wang Yi called on the US to "treat Chinese companies fairly and avoid politicizing economic and trade issues."
China has also been involved in a dispute with several Southeast Asian countries over territorial claims in the South China Sea. The US has been supporting these countries in their claims, conducting freedom of navigation patrols in the region and urging China to adhere to international law.
As tensions between the US and China continue to rise, it remains to be seen whether the two countries can find a way to cooperate and avoid a full-blown conflict. Wang Yi's call for a policy shift may be a sign that China is willing to engage in dialogue and find a peaceful resolution to their differences. However, it will take more than just words to ease the tensions between these two economic giants.
