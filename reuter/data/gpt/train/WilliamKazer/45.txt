China's Central Bank Chief, Yi Gang, projected a modest seven-percent inflation rate while criticizing companies for exploiting the current tight money policies. Speaking at the International Finance Forum in Beijing on Saturday, Yi attributed the rising inflation rate to supply-side factors such as shortages of certain goods and logistics issues.
"Currently, the inflation rate is mainly driven by global commodity prices, with some domestic factors, so we expect it to be a moderate seven percent," Yi said. "We are closely monitoring the situation and have a full range of policy tools to ensure it stays within a reasonable range."
Yi further expressed concerns on the negative effects of some companies exploiting the current financial policies, referring to their hoarding of cash to benefit from the attractive interest rates for short-term lending. He implored banks to exercise caution and better regulate their lending policies, which could lead to financial instability.
"The tight financial policies we've implemented are necessary to tackle some of the lingering issues we face, such as excessive borrowing, asset bubbles, and high leverage in some sectors," Yi noted. "However, we've noticed that some companies have taken advantage of the situation, hoarding up cash for short-term borrowing. This is unhealthy and puts pressure on the financial system."
Yi's remarks come as China has been grappling with a surge in commodity prices and supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19. The country has also been dealing with a slowdown in consumer spending and a sharp decline in fixed-asset investments, leading to a moderate slowdown in economic growth.
Despite the challenges, China's central bank has taken steps to reign in inflation by increasing short-term interest rates on a number of occasions to discourage speculative investments and excessive borrowing. Yi also added that the bank has been advising major companies to reduce the risks associated with their operations, emphasizing the importance of responsible financial decision-making.
"China's economy has remained stable and continues to recover from the pandemic's impact. Our financial markets are robust and resilient, and we will continue to provide the necessary support to businesses and individuals," Yi concluded.
The central bank's efforts to manage inflation and ensure financial stability will be crucial to China's economic recovery. With global inflation rates on the rise, the country will need to balance economic growth along with prudent financial regulation to limit the risk of financial instability.
