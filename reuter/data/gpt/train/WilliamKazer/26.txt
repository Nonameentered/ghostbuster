U.S. Secretary of State, William Christopher, has indicated that the United States is open to cooperating with China on peaceful nuclear projects before the full implementation of the arms control accord between the two nations.
The statement was made during a joint press conference held by Christopher and his Chinese counterpart, Zhou Zhen, at the State Department, Washington, D.C.
The 2015 agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was designed to limit and ultimately reduce Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment activities and submit to international inspections in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions against the country.
However, former U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018, causing widespread international condemnation.
The current administration of President Joe Biden has expressed its intention to rejoin the JCPOA, but negotiations have been slow due to disagreements over the timing and sequencing of steps to be taken by both sides.
During the press conference, Christopher emphasized the importance of arms control and nonproliferation efforts in the context of U.S.-China relations. He acknowledged that while the two nations have areas of disagreement, there is also potential for cooperation, particularly in the area of peaceful nuclear energy.
"We believe that peaceful nuclear cooperation can provide significant benefits to both the United States and China. It can help to address our mutual energy needs, promote economic development, and advance our shared interests in nonproliferation and global security," he said.
Christopher noted that there are already existing areas of cooperation, including the U.S.-China Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation Agreement, signed in 2015. The agreement provides a framework for collaboration in areas such as safety, security, and nonproliferation of nuclear materials.
However, he emphasized that any future cooperation must be conducted in accordance with international law and standards, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Zhen echoed this sentiment, stating that China is committed to promoting cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to upholding the nonproliferation regime.
"We support the peaceful development of nuclear energy and the safe, secure, and transparent use of nuclear technology. We are willing to work with the United States and other countries to this end," he said.
The statement signals a potential thaw in U.S.-China relations on the issue of nuclear energy and nonproliferation, which have been strained in recent years. The two nations remain at odds on a range of other issues, including trade, human rights, and territorial disputes.
As negotiations continue over the JCPOA, the U.S. and China may find that cooperation on peaceful nuclear energy can play a role in advancing their mutual interests.
