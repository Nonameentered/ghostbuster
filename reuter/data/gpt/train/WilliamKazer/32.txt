Singapore - China has expressed its interest in joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) at a meeting held in Singapore on Wednesday. The meeting was attended by officials from the WTO and the Chinese government, who made a strong case for China to be granted full membership in the organization.
China has been an observer at the WTO since 1986, but has faced opposition from some members who have raised concerns over China's trade practices, particularly with regard to intellectual property and human rights. Despite this, China has become the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer, making it a critical player in global trade.
Speaking at the meeting, China's Commerce Minister, Wang Wentao, said that China has made significant progress in opening up its economy and adopting internationally recognized trade rules in recent years. He added that the government is committed to further reforms that will align the country's trade policies with international norms.
"China has made tremendous efforts to promote trade liberalization and facilitation, and actively participated in the rule-making process of the multilateral trading system," said Minister Wang. "We are on a road of deepening reforms and opening up, and we are willing to work with all WTO members to push for the progress of free trade and multilateralism."
The WTO Director-General, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, praised China's commitment to other initiatives aimed at promoting free and fair trade, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Belt and Road Initiative.
However, some WTO members remain cautious about China's accession, citing concerns over market access, subsidies, and unfair trade practices. The United States in particular has been critical of China's trade policies, citing its massive trade surplus with the US and allegations of theft of intellectual property.
In a statement released after the meeting, the US Trade Representative's office said that it welcomed China's interest in joining the WTO, but added that "any country, including China, seeking to join the WTO must be fully committed to upholding the rules of the organization and adhering to WTO Agreements."
China's application for full membership will need to be approved by the WTO's General Council, which is made up of representatives from all member countries. It will also need to negotiate terms and concessions with other members, a process that could take several years.
However, some experts believe that China's accession would be a significant boost for the global trading system, particularly at a time when protectionist measures and trade tensions have increased.
"China's participation in the WTO would contribute to a more open, transparent, and predictable trading system," said the WTO's Director-General. "This is especially important as the world seeks to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and work towards inclusive and sustainable growth."
