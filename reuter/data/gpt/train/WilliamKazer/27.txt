BEIJING â€“ In the highest-level visit between China and the United States in two years, President Joe Biden's new climate envoy John Kerry worked with Chinese officials to discuss ways to push Sino-American ties forward.
The visit comes as relations between the two powers have deteriorated in recent years, with trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and the Covid-19 pandemic all contributing to the strained relationship.
Kerry, who has previously served as Secretary of State and as the architect of the Paris climate accord, was appointed earlier this year as the first-ever Presidential Envoy for Climate.
In this role, Kerry is tasked with bridging the gap between the United States and China on climate issues, as well as fostering greater cooperation and collaboration on environmental matters.
During his visit to China, Kerry met with his counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, who is the Special Envoy for Climate Change Affairs. The two officials discussed a range of topics related to climate change, including the Paris accord, carbon neutrality, and emissions reduction targets.
Both Kerry and Xie hailed the meeting as a positive step forward in Sino-American relations, with Kerry acknowledging that there are "areas of difference" between the two countries but emphasizing the shared commitment to tackling climate change.
"We're not saying we trust one another completely," Kerry said. "But we're taking some steps to try to move things in a way that benefits everybody."
For his part, Xie echoed these sentiments, noting that China and the United States have a "responsibility to work together" and that "climate change cannot be addressed by any one country alone."
Kerry's visit to China comes ahead of a major climate summit being held by the Biden administration in April, which will see leaders from around the world gather to discuss ways to address the crisis.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to attend the summit, which could provide a further opportunity for the two countries to work together on climate issues.
Despite the positive tone of Kerry's visit, however, it remains to be seen whether the United States and China will be able to make significant progress on this front.
Relations between the two countries are notoriously complex, and there are a number of long-standing issues that continue to raise tensions, including the ongoing trade war, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
Still, Kerry's trip to China represents a significant step forward in rebuilding the Sino-American relationship, and could provide a glimmer of hope for those who hope to see greater cooperation between the two powers on issues of global importance.
