Brussels – European Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen urged China to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and adhere to its rules-based system of international trade. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Friday, Katainen emphasized the importance of a level playing field and fair competition in global commerce.
“China is a major player in the global economy and should be a member of the WTO,” Katainen said. “We believe that its inclusion would help strengthen the organization and ensure that all members follow the same rules and regulations.”
However, Beijing has remained skeptical of the WTO and its effectiveness in promoting free trade. China joined the organization in 2001 and has been a vocal critic of what it sees as Western bias in its policies and procedures.
“We have reservations about the WTO and its ability to address the concerns of developing countries,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang in a statement. “China believes in the principles of free trade and open markets, but we also believe that the WTO needs to be reformed to better reflect the diversity and needs of its members.”
Katainen acknowledged China’s concerns but reiterated the importance of multilateralism and cooperation in resolving trade disputes and ensuring mutual benefits for all parties.
“We understand that there are disagreements and differences of opinion on certain issues, but the WTO provides a framework for resolving those issues through dialogue and negotiation,” Katainen said. “We urge China to engage constructively with the WTO and work towards a more inclusive and equitable global trading system.”
The European Union (EU) has been a vocal proponent of free trade and has pushed for the removal of trade barriers and tariffs between members. The EU is also currently negotiating a new investment agreement with China, which would provide greater access to each other’s markets and boost economic ties.
“China is a key strategic partner for the European Union, and we are committed to deepening our cooperation and strengthening our relationship,” Katainen said. “By working together, we can promote a more open and prosperous global economy that benefits everyone.”
The EU-China investment agreement has been under negotiation since 2013 and has faced criticism from some member states and human rights groups for its potential impact on labor and environmental standards.
“We are aware of the concerns raised by civil society and some member states, and we are taking them into account in our negotiations,” Katainen said. “We believe that any agreement must be based on mutual respect and must uphold high standards of transparency, human rights, and environmental protection.”
Despite the challenges, Katainen expressed optimism about the potential for deeper EU-China cooperation and the role that China could play in the WTO.
“We believe that China can be a constructive partner in the WTO and a leader in promoting free trade and open markets,” Katainen said. “We look forward to continuing our dialogue with China and working together to create a better future for all our citizens.”
