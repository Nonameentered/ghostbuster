Beijing, China â€“ The Chinese government has issued a warning to stock market investors, echoing Alan Greenspan's famous phrase "irrational exuberance" that he used to describe the US stock market in 1996. The warning comes as the Chinese stock market has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent months, with wild swings and sudden drops taking investors by surprise.
In a statement released on Tuesday, China's top financial regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), urged investors to exercise caution amid rising volatility and soaring valuations in the stock market. The CSRC said that investor sentiment has become overly optimistic, leading to irrational buying and excessive risk-taking.
"The market is currently displaying signs of rising irrational exuberance, as investors across the board are chasing after a limited number of high-flying stocks, driving up their valuations to unsustainable levels," said the CSRC in its statement.
The regulator also warned of the risks of margin trading, a practice that allows investors to borrow money to buy stocks, amplifying both gains and losses. Margin trading has become increasingly popular in China in recent years, with some investors using borrowed funds to invest in high-risk stocks.
"We urge investors to be cautious with margin trading, which can be a double-edged sword that magnifies both profits and losses," the CSRC said.
The warning comes as China's stock market has been on a volatile rollercoaster ride in recent months. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the performance of all A-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, has soared over 20% this year, fueled by a surge of retail investor enthusiasm.
The rally has been driven by a number of factors, including China's economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, a flood of liquidity from the central bank, and a flurry of initial public offerings (IPOs) by tech firms.
However, the market's rise has also been fueled by rampant speculation and excessive risk-taking by retail investors, many of whom are new to the stock market and may not fully understand the risks involved.
The CSRC's warning echoes similar cautionary statements by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), which has repeatedly warned of a possible bubble forming in the stock market. Last month, PBOC Governor Yi Gang warned of the risks of excessive leverage in the financial system and urged financial institutions to strengthen risk management.
The Chinese government has also taken steps to cool down the market in recent weeks, including a crackdown on excessive speculation and tighter regulation of IPOs. Last week, the CSRC announced new rules that require companies applying for IPOs to disclose more information about their financial and operating risks.
Despite these efforts, the market remains highly volatile, with sudden drops and wild swings taking many investors by surprise. Some analysts have warned that the market may be due for a correction, as valuations for many stocks have reached levels that are hard to justify based on their fundamentals.
The CSRC's warning is likely to have a sobering effect on some investors, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to cool down the market and prevent a crash. With the global economy still reeling from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and China's own economic recovery still fragile, the stakes are high for investors and regulators alike.
