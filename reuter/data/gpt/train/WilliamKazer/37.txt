In response to an outbreak of a deadly disease among poultry, China has announced that it will ban imports of poultry products from two U.S. states. The move comes after the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed the presence of the H7N9 virus, also known as avian influenza, in poultry flocks in both states.
The ban will affect all shipments of live poultry and poultry products from the states of Arkansas and Missouri, two major poultry producers in the U.S. that export to China. The decision was announced by the Chinese government's General Administration of Customs on Friday.
"China has always placed great importance on food safety and animal disease prevention and control," the agency said in a statement. "In order to safeguard the health and safety of Chinese consumers, we have decided to suspend imports of poultry products from the two American states."
The H7N9 virus is a strain of bird flu that has been present in China since 2013, and has caused more than 1,000 human infections and over 300 deaths. While the virus is not commonly transmitted from birds to humans, at least 23 people have been infected with the virus in the U.S. since 2017.
The USDA has responded to the outbreak by implementing enhanced surveillance measures in affected areas, and quarantining and euthanizing infected birds. The agency has also stated that the virus does not pose a significant threat to public health, as it rarely passes from birds to humans.
However, China's decision to ban poultry imports from the two states has sparked concern among U.S. poultry farmers and traders, who fear that the move could lead to a significant loss of business. The U.S. is one of the world's largest poultry producers, and exports over $4 billion worth of poultry products to China each year.
"It is always concerning when a major trading partner like China takes action to restrict imports of U.S. poultry products," said Tom Super, spokesperson for the National Chicken Council. "However, we are confident that the USDA's efforts to contain the outbreak will be successful and that exports to China will resume soon."
The ban comes at a time of heightened tension between the U.S. and China over trade issues. The two countries have been embroiled in a trade war since 2018, with both sides imposing tariffs on each other's goods in an effort to balance trade deficits. The move to ban imports of poultry products is seen by some as another tactic in China's efforts to retaliate against U.S. trade policies.
However, officials from both countries have denied that the ban is politically motivated, and have stated that it is solely a matter of food safety and disease control.
"China has always been a responsible and reliable trading partner, and our actions are in line with international practices for food safety and disease control," said a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington. "We hope that the situation in the U.S. improves soon, and that exports can resume as soon as possible."
The ban is set to take effect on June 30, and will remain in place until the USDA confirms that the outbreak has been contained. The agency has stated that it is working closely with poultry producers and exporters to ensure that the ban has a minimal impact on both farmers and consumers.
