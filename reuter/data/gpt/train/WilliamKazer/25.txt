US Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to China this week provided an opportunity for both countries to repair strained ties amid mixed signals from both sides. The two countries have been in a trade war since 2018, with tensions also flaring up over issues like the South China Sea, Taiwan, and human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
The visit comes as both sides have made some positive moves towards improving relations. China has reportedly stepped up its purchases of US agricultural products, and the US has refrained from imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods.
However, there are still major differences between the two countries on a number of issues, as well as lingering mistrust and suspicion. The US has accused China of unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft, while China has criticized the US for meddling in its internal affairs.
During his visit, Christopher met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other officials to discuss a range of issues, including the possibility of restarting trade talks and addressing human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
In a joint statement after their meeting, Christopher and Wang said they had "candid and in-depth exchanges" on a number of issues, but did not provide any details on specific agreements or progress made.
Some analysts believe that the visit could set the stage for a larger meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year. However, others caution that broader tensions between the two countries are unlikely to dissipate anytime soon.
"This is not a reset of the relationship, it's a recalibration," said Ely Ratner, a China expert at the Center for a New American Security. "There are still fundamental differences that need to be addressed."
One major hurdle to improving relations between the two countries is the issue of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The US has accused China of committing genocide against Uighur Muslims in the region, and has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials and companies implicated in the abuses.
China, meanwhile, has denied the accusations and accused the US of interfering in its internal affairs.
During his visit, Christopher met with family members of Uighur Muslims who have been detained in Xinjiang, and publicly called on China to allow independent access to the region to investigate the allegations.
"The United States and our allies will continue to speak out in defense of human rights and the rule of law, and we call on the PRC [People's Republic of China] to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all its citizens," Christopher said in a speech at the US embassy in Beijing.
The issue of Taiwan, which China considers part of its territory, is another source of tension between the two countries. China has increased military activity around Taiwan in recent months, and has threatened to use force to bring the island back under its control.
The US, which is Taiwan's largest weapons supplier, has stepped up its support for the island, including high-level visits by officials like Christopher and a recent arms deal worth over $6 billion.
During his visit, Christopher emphasized the US's commitment to Taiwan, saying that the island's security is "non-negotiable." He also called on China to refrain from using force against Taiwan and to engage in peaceful dialogue.
Despite these challenges, some analysts remain hopeful that the US and China can find a way to cooperate on issues of mutual concern, such as climate change and global health.
"We have no choice but to work together on these issues," said Yuan Peng, Vice President of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. "The question is how we can do it, and that's where we need to find common ground."
Overall, Christopher's visit to China served as a reminder of both the potential for conflict and the possibility of cooperation between the world's two largest economies. The road ahead will be challenging, but there are glimmers of hope that the US and China can find a way to manage their differences and work together for the greater good.
