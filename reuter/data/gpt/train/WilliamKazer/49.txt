Beijing, China - Communist Party Chief Jiang Zemin has recently paid tribute to the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping via a television series. Experts say this move is aimed at building his own political legacy and gaining popular support.
The television series titled "Deng Xiaoping," which features 48 episodes, began airing last month. The show highlights Deng's life and achievements, including his role in transforming China's economy, modernizing the country, and opening it up to the world.
In the show's opening credits, Jiang's name appears as the executive producer, which has led to speculation about his motivations for producing the series. Many experts believe that the show is an attempt by Jiang to position himself as the rightful heir to Deng's legacy and to build his own image as a strong Communist Party leader.
"Deng Xiaoping was the great architect of China's reform and opening up policy, and anyone who can align his or her name with that of Deng has a chance to gain popular support," said Zhang Lifan, a Beijing-based political commentator.
Jiang, who served as China's president from 1993 to 2003, has been trying to establish himself as a key figure in Chinese politics despite having no official position. His latest move to produce the television series is seen as an attempt to further cement his status.
"The series is clearly designed to associate Jiang Zemin with Deng Xiaoping and their common goals, which are economic development, modernization, and world influence," said Wang Zhengxu, a professor of political science at the University of Nottingham.
Jiang's move to produce the series also comes at a time when China is facing a difficult economic situation. The country's GDP growth rate has slowed down, and many experts believe that the Communist Party needs to embark on another round of economic reforms to ensure China's continued growth and global influence.
"Deng's economic policies set the stage for China's rapid growth over the past few decades, and Jiang is trying to use this show to remind people of this legacy," said Wang.
However, some analysts are skeptical of Jiang's motives. They argue that the series is more of a propaganda stunt aimed at building support for the Communist Party rather than a genuine tribute to Deng's legacy.
"The show is clearly designed to promote the Communist Party's achievements in economic development and to showcase its role in shaping modern China," said Fu King-wa, a professor of media studies at the University of Hong Kong.
Critics also point out that the television series glosses over some of the more controversial aspects of Deng's career, such as the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 and Deng's role in the crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement in the late 1990s.
"By presenting a sanitized version of Deng's legacy, Jiang is trying to rewrite history and present himself as the rightful successor to Deng's political and economic vision," said Zhang Qi, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan.
Despite the criticisms, the show has been very popular with Chinese audiences, with millions of viewers tuning in each week. Many viewers say that they are impressed by its high production values and historical accuracy.
"I think the show is a great tribute to Deng Xiaoping and his contribution to China's economic development," said Li Xiaohua, a resident of Beijing. "It reminds us of how far China has come and how much more we can achieve in the future."
Others, however, remain skeptical. "I think Jiang's motives are clear - he wants to build his own political legacy and boost his standing within the Communist Party," said Li Meng, a professor of Chinese history at Harvard University.
As China continues to navigate a changing political and economic landscape, the legacy of Deng Xiaoping remains a major topic of discussion. Jiang Zemin's recent tribute to Deng through the television series is just the latest chapter in this ongoing story. Whether his motives are genuine or not, one thing is clear - his actions have stirred up a lot of interest and debate in China and abroad.
