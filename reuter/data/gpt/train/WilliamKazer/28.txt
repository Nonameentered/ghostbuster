China Urges US to End Curbs on Technology Exports to Balance Trade
China has urged the United States to end its curbs on technology exports, citing the need to balance the trade between the two countries. The call from China's Ministry of Commerce comes amid the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries, which has seen both sides slap tariffs on each other's goods.
Speaking at a press briefing on Thursday, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said that the curbs on high-tech exports were one of the main barriers to balanced trade between China and the US. The spokesperson said that China would like to see the US lift the restrictions as soon as possible, so that companies in both countries can benefit from the transfer of technology and innovation.
"China has always been committed to promoting the balanced development of trade with the United States, but the unilateral restrictions on high-tech exports have seriously hindered the normal exchange and cooperation between China and the United States in science and technology," the spokesperson said. "We urge the United States to immediately remove these restrictions, especially those concerning Chinese companies and individuals, and stop unilaterally creating barriers to science and technology cooperation between the two countries."
The spokesperson also said that China is willing to enhance cooperation with the US in fields such as artificial intelligence, big data, and the internet of things, and hopes that the two countries can work together to promote the healthy development of the global economy.
The call for the removal of technology export restrictions from China comes at a time when the US government is taking an increasingly tough stance on Chinese technology companies, such as Huawei, which it accuses of being a national security threat. The US has also placed restrictions on exports of high-tech components to Huawei, which the company has said could threaten its ability to compete in the global market.
China, for its part, has accused the US of trying to contain its rise by limiting its access to technology and innovation. The Chinese government has also said that the restrictions on technology exports are not only harmful to China, but also to US companies that rely on Chinese suppliers for components and technology.
The call from China's Ministry of Commerce comes as the two countries are preparing for a new round of trade talks, which are scheduled for later this month. The talks are expected to focus on a wide range of issues, including intellectual property rights, trade in goods and services, and the role of state-owned enterprises in the Chinese economy.
Despite the ongoing trade dispute between China and the US, both countries have indicated that they are willing to continue the talks and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, there are still many obstacles to overcome before a deal can be reached, including the thorny issue of technology transfers and the role of Chinese state-owned enterprises in the economy.
In conclusion, the call from China's Ministry of Commerce for the removal of technology export restrictions highlights the importance of technology and innovation in the global economy, and the need for countries to work together to promote the healthy development of these sectors. It remains to be seen whether the US will heed China's call, or whether the trade dispute between the two countries will deepen further in the coming months.
