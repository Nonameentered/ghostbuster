Beijing, China - A new documentary celebrating the role of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in regaining Hong Kong after more than a century of British rule was released on Monday, sparking renewed interest in the controversial leader and his legacy.
Titled "The Long March of Reunification: A Tribute to Deng Xiaoping," the 90-minute documentary focuses on Deng's efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s to resolve the Hong Kong issue, which was seen as his greatest diplomatic achievement. The documentary, made with the support of the Chinese government, includes rare footage of Deng, interviews with his colleagues and political leaders, and archive materials.
In an interview with the state-run China Daily, the director of the documentary, Zhang Kai, said that "Deng Xiaoping is the chief architect of the one country-two systems policy, which ensured Hong Kong's return to the motherland with peace, stability, and prosperity."
The documentary highlights Deng's famous statement that the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 was not the result of force, but of peaceful negotiations. It also shows Deng's efforts to establish a framework for governing Hong Kong post-handover, including the creation of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government.
The film has been released just ahead of the 24th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China on July 1st.
The documentary's release comes amid growing tensions between China and the West over Hong Kong, with China facing criticism over its alleged violations of the "one country-two systems" framework, which promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. Critics say that China's imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong last year has undermined Hong Kong's freedoms, and led to the arrest and imprisonment of opposition figures.
The documentary, however, portrays Deng's vision as a model for resolving complex international issues. In a statement, the Chinese foreign ministry said that "Deng Xiaoping's contribution to resolving the Hong Kong issue will be remembered by history," and added that "the one country-two systems policy has proved to be an effective solution for resolving similar problems in other parts of the world."
Deng Xiaoping is one of China's most important leaders of the 20th century, known for his economic reforms and his role in restoring China's international standing. He was also a controversial figure, seen by some as a hardliner who ordered the use of force to crush the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.
The documentary's release comes as China celebrates the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on July 1st, a milestone that has been marked with a number of events and celebrations across the country.
The film has received mixed reactions online, with some viewers praising it as a tribute to a great leader, while others criticized it as propaganda. Some also questioned the timing of the documentary's release, suggesting that it was a deliberate attempt by the Chinese government to distract attention from the political crisis in Hong Kong.
Critics say that China's efforts to suppress dissent in Hong Kong have led to a crackdown on human rights, including freedom of speech and assembly, and have damaged the city's reputation as a global financial center.
The documentary's portrayal of Deng as a key figure in resolving the Hong Kong issue has also been controversial, with some arguing that it overlooks the contributions of other leaders, including former Chinese Premier Li Peng, who played a key role in the negotiations with the British government.
However, the film's makers say that Deng's leadership was crucial to the success of the negotiations. "Deng Xiaoping was not just a leader, he was a statesman, a diplomat, and a strategist," said Zhang Kai. "His vision and determination made it possible for Hong Kong to return to China with dignity and grace."
The documentary has been widely promoted by state media in China, with many commentators describing it as a "must-watch" for anyone interested in modern Chinese history.
The film's release is part of a wider campaign by the Chinese government to promote patriotic education and reinforce its grip on power. In recent years, China has been promoting new narratives about its history, focusing on the achievements of the CPC and its leaders, and emphasizing China's role as a global power.
The release of the documentary also coincides with the growing influence of China's culture and media industries, which have been expanding rapidly in recent years, attracting a global audience with blockbuster films, popular TV dramas, and viral social media content.
