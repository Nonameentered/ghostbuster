China Urged to Switch to Long-Term Bond Fundraising Amid Easing Inflation
The Chinese government has been urged to shift its fundraising strategy from short-term bonds to long-term bonds, especially as the country's economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. This call comes amid easing inflation rates, which experts say are ideal for long-term debt issuance.
According to a recent report by the Financial Times, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is considering a proposal to allow local governments to issue long-term bonds. The move is expected to promote infrastructure spending and bolster the country's economic recovery.
The NDRC's proposal has garnered support from Chinese financial regulators. In a recent meeting, Yi Gang, the governor of the People's Bank of China, emphasized the importance of long-term bond issuance in providing stable funding for infrastructure projects and encouraging private investments.
China has long relied on short-term bonds to finance its projects, with the majority of its debt due within one year. Experts say that this approach has limited the funding options for infrastructure projects, as well as the country's overall economic growth.
The recent easing of inflation has opened up an opportunity for China to switch to long-term bond issuance. This move would allow the government to finance projects with more stable and long-term funding, rather than relying on short-term loans that are sensitive to market volatility.
Moreover, long-term bonds are an attractive option for investors seeking safe and stable investment opportunities. By tapping into this pool of capital, the Chinese government can finance infrastructure projects with lower borrowing costs, and thus, reducing its debt burden.
The easing of inflation rates is also beneficial for China's bond market. Inflation is a primary driver of interest rates, and as it falls, it may lead to lower borrowing costs for the government, thus making long-term bond issuance more attractive.
Additionally, the Chinese government has been looking to support green financing and sustainable infrastructure projects, which require long-term funding. Long-term bond issuance provides a predictable and stable source of funding for projects with longer timelines and risk profiles.
In conclusion, China's shift towards long-term bond fundraising is a welcome move that would provide stable funding for infrastructure projects and promote economic growth. The recent easing of inflation rates presents an opportune time for China to adopt this approach, and it is hoped that such a move would enhance the country's economic resilience in the long run.
