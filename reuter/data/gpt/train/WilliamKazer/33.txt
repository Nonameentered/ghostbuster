Asia Cautiously Welcomes Clinton's Appointments for Key Cabinet Posts 
Hillary Clinton's appointment as the 45th president of the United States has been met with mixed reactions from world leaders. Her choices for cabinet posts, though, have received mostly positive responses, particularly in Asia.
Clinton wasted no time in filling out her cabinet picks, with notable Asian Americans occupying key slots. For the post of secretary of commerce, Clinton chose Gary Locke, who previously served as both the governor of Washington and the United States ambassador to China. This is a significant appointment, as Locke's appointment highlights the importance of the US-China trade relationship. He is highly respected in the region and has played a key role in building closer ties between the two countries.
For the position of Treasury secretary, Clinton chose Ajay Banga, the CEO of Mastercard and a native of India. Banga brings significant experience to the position, particularly in the realm of financial regulation, and his appointment signals a continued focus on maintaining strong economic ties with India. Additionally, he is expected to play a key role in implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade agreement that could have significant implications for the US and Asia.
Perhaps the most significant appointment for the region is that of secretary of state, which was given to Susan Rice. Rice, who served as the US ambassador to the United Nations under the Obama administration, has been a strong advocate for US engagement in Asia. Under a Clinton administration, she is expected to continue that focus, with a renewed emphasis on promoting human rights and democracy in the region. With Rice at the helm, the US is likely to remain actively involved in issues such as the Philippinesâ€™ territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea and North Korea's nuclear program.
These appointments have been met with cautious optimism across Asian nations. Experts have noted that the picks signal a continued focus on the region, which was a key policy priority for the Obama administration. They also highlight the importance of maintaining strong economic ties with Asian countries, particularly China and India.
China, in particular, has welcomed the appointments. Following the announcement, the foreign ministry stated that the country looks forward to working with Locke in his new role. This is a positive sign for US-China relations, which have been strained in recent years due to issues such as the South China Sea territorial dispute and accusations of Chinese hacking.
India has also responded positively to the appointments. The Indian government tweeted its congratulations to Banga, stating that it is a "proud moment for India." His appointment is seen as a significant milestone for Indian Americans, who have traditionally been underrepresented in government roles.
The Philippines, another key Asian nation, has also responded positively to the picks. The government has praised Rice's appointment, stating that they are confident she will continue the Obama administration's policy of supporting democratic institutions in the country. Additionally, the appointment of Locke is seen as a positive sign for the ongoing territorial dispute with China.
Despite the positive response, there is some caution among Asian leaders. The most notable concern is the future of the TPP, which was a key policy priority of the Obama administration. Clinton's stance on the agreement has been unclear, with some experts suggesting that she may seek to renegotiate the deal. This could create uncertainty in the region, particularly for countries that have signed on to the agreement, such as Japan and Vietnam.
Overall, Asia's response to Clinton's cabinet picks has been positive, with leaders noting that the appointments signal a continued focus on Asia and a commitment to maintaining strong economic and political ties with the region. While there are concerns about the future of the TPP, experts note that these appointments bode well for the region, particularly in terms of US-China relations. It remains to be seen how these appointments will shape US policy towards Asia, but for now, there is cautious optimism throughout the region.
