South Africa, one of the major economies in Africa, is set to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China by the end of 1997. The decision was made by the South African government in a bid to strengthen economic ties with China and make it the country's preferred partner. This move is another step in the road towards diplomatic recognition from other countries.
The decision was announced by the South African Foreign Minister, Alfred Nzo, during a press conference in Pretoria. Nzo stated that the decision to switch diplomatic ties was taken after careful consideration and consultation with the government of Taiwan. He also emphasized that the move would not affect South Africa's friendly relationship with Taiwan, but rather was simply a re-alignment of its diplomatic strategy.
"The South African government is committed to building a strong and mutually beneficial relationship with China," Nzo said. "We believe that this move will enable us to further deepen our economic and political ties with China, which is an increasingly important partner for South Africa."
Taiwan, which operates diplomatically under the name of the Republic of China, is recognized by only a handful of countries worldwide owing to the ‘One China’ policy, which affirms that Taiwan is part of China. Though Taiwan has diplomatic missions in several countries, it is only recognized by a few countries. Up until now, South Africa has been one of the few countries that has maintained formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. But this is set to change, as South Africa is set to follow the global trend in recognizing China's dominant position.
The move comes as South Africa is looking to expand its diplomatic and economic ties globally. The country has been actively seeking to diversify its trade partners, and China has been a key target in this regard. China is currently South Africa's largest trading partner on the African continent, and one of South Africa's largest investors.
The move will also have wider diplomatic implications as it will leave Taiwan with only four formal diplomatic partners in Africa; Burkina Faso, Eswatini, São Tomé and Príncipe and the Kingdom of Eswatini.
Despite this, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs still expressed its gratitude towards South Africa for its past support, and hoped to deepen future partnerships.
“Taiwan has always been committed to promoting peace, stability, and development in the world and will continue to seek the support of other countries for this purpose,” the ministry said in a statement.
However, experts say that the move could trigger other countries, particularly those on the African continent that have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, to re-evaluate their own diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
The South African government's decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China is a major shift in its foreign policy strategy. South Africa's strong ties with China could potentially open up new opportunities for trade and investment, and ultimately boost economic growth in the country. But with tension between China and Taiwan still ongoing, the move could also have wider implications for diplomacy and stability in the region.
