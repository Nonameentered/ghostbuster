Beijing, China - In a move that has sent shockwaves throughout China, a high-ranking defence official has resigned amid a government reshuffle that is believed to be linked to the recent series of satellite failures that have plagued the country's space program.
The official, whose identity has not been confirmed, is said to have been responsible for overseeing China's satellite launches and is believed to have played a significant role in the development and launch of the satellites that failed.
China's space program has been under scrutiny in recent years after a number of high-profile satellite failures. In May 2021, the Long March 5B rocket, which was carrying the core module of China's space station, crashed into the Indian Ocean after re-entry, causing international concern about China's ability to carry out safe space operations.
The official's resignation comes as part of a wider shake-up of China's space program. The country's leader, Xi Jinping, has reportedly been unhappy with the progress of China's space industry and has ordered a review of the country's space program.
The Chinese government has expressed its commitment to continuing its space program and has vowed to correct the issues that have led to the recent satellite failures.
"We will strengthen our space program and take active measures to address the issues that have arisen," said a government spokesperson.
China has made significant strides in its space program in recent years, with several successful manned missions and the launch of a number of satellites. However, the recent failures have raised questions about the country's ability to carry out complex space operations and have prompted calls for a renewed focus on safety and quality control.
The resignation of the senior defence official is a significant development in China's space program and is likely to lead to further changes and reforms. China's leadership will be under pressure to demonstrate that it can address the issues that have led to the recent failures and that it is capable of ensuring the safety and reliability of its space operations.
The future of China's space program is uncertain, but it is clear that the country is committed to continuing its efforts to become a leading player in space exploration and technology. The resignation of the senior defence official may be just the first step in a wider effort to strengthen and improve China's space program.
