Vendome, the luxury goods group, has seen a drop in profits as a result of poor tourist spending in the Far East, leading to hopes of recovery with a stronger yen. The group, which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, and Fendi, reported a decline in sales in the first half of the year.
The decline has been attributed to the decline in tourism from China and other parts of the Far East, where many of Vendome's luxury goods are popular with wealthy tourists. The situation has been worsened by the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, which has led to a drop in global trade and economic growth.
However, the company's CEO, Jean-Marc Duplaix, is hopeful that the situation will improve with the recent rise of the Japanese yen. He believes that the stronger yen will attract more tourists from the Far East, who will be able to get better value for their money and will be more likely to spend on luxury goods.
"We are optimistic that the increase in the value of the yen will help to increase tourism to Japan and the surrounding areas," Duplaix said in a statement. "We believe that this will lead to a recovery in sales of our luxury goods, particularly in the watch and jewellery segments."
Japan has been a popular tourist destination for many years, with many tourists coming to the country to visit its unique cultural sites, shop for luxury goods, and enjoy the country's natural beauty. The increase in the value of the yen is expected to make it even more attractive to tourists, as they will be able to purchase more goods for their money.
In addition, Vendome has been investing in the development of its digital channels, which it hopes will help to boost sales in the coming years. The company has been developing its online presence, making it easier for customers to purchase its luxury goods online.
"We believe that our digital channels will be a key driver of growth in the future," Duplaix said. "We are committed to developing our online presence and making it easier for customers to purchase our luxury goods from anywhere in the world."
Despite the challenges facing Vendome, the company remains optimistic about its future prospects. With the rise of the yen and the development of its digital channels, the company believes that it is well-positioned to weather the current economic storm and emerge stronger on the other side.
