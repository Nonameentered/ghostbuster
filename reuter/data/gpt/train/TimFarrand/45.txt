Imperial Tobacco CEO, Alison Cooper, has announced that the company is struggling to find growth opportunities in the UK and is looking to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Speaking to reporters, Cooper cited declining smoking rates in the UK and increased competition from e-cigarettes as key reasons behind the company’s stagnant growth.
While Imperial Tobacco has already established a strong foothold in Asia-Pacific, Cooper revealed that the company plans to increase investment in the region to fuel its expansion strategy. She also added that Imperial Tobacco is focusing on developing its portfolio of next-generation products, such as vaping and heated tobacco, to cater to changing consumer preferences.
Cooper’s comments come at a time when smoking rates in Asia-Pacific are on the rise, due to growing populations and increasing disposable incomes. Imperial Tobacco is not the only company seeking to take advantage of this trend - its competitors are also investing heavily in the region, creating a highly competitive environment.
However, Cooper remains confident in Imperial Tobacco’s ability to succeed in Asia-Pacific, stating that the company’s strong brand recognition and existing distribution channels will help it to capture market share in the region. It remains to be seen whether this expansion strategy will pay off for the tobacco giant.
