Bass Plc, the UK-based hospitality and leisure company, announced on Tuesday that it will be investing $1.1 billion into a major business expansion plan that would create around 7,000 jobs across multiple locations. This move is expected to help Bass Plc recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has heavily impacted the company's revenues and profits.
The expansion plan will focus on developing and launching new businesses, extending existing ones, and improving infrastructure across the company's various brands, including Premier Inn, Costa, and Beefeater. The plan will also see the opening of new hotels, restaurants, and cafes across the UK, with a particular focus on under-served regions such as Wales, the South West, and the North East.
The company's CEO, Alison Brittain, released a statement regarding the expansion plan, saying, "We are delighted to announce this significant investment into our business at a time when the UK economy desperately needs it. We are confident that our expansion plans will create thousands of job opportunities and boost local economies, while also providing our customers with more choice and better experiences."
The investment will be split across multiple projects, with the largest chunk of the money going towards the development of new hotels and restaurants. Specifically, $600 million will be focused on building new hotels and $250 million will be allocated for building new restaurants and cafes under the Beefeater and Costa brands.
Another $100 million will be spent on upgrading and improving existing hotels and restaurants, ensuring that the company is providing the best possible experience for its customers. This includes refurbishments, new technology, and improved facilities that will be rolled out across all of the company's brands.
The remaining $150 million will be invested in upgrading and expanding the company's supply chain and distribution network, which includes improving logistics and transportation. This will help the company streamline its operations, reduce costs, and improve efficiency across all areas of the business.
The expansion plan is expected to create around 3,000 jobs in the hospitality sector, with another 4,000 jobs being created during the construction and development phase. The company is committed to providing training and education to its employees, ensuring that they have the skills and knowledge necessary to deliver high-quality services to customers.
The plan has been welcomed by many industry experts and politicians, who see it as a much-needed boost to the UK economy. John Glen, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, called the investment a "vote of confidence" in the UK's economic recovery, while others praised the company for its commitment to creating jobs and improving services.
However, there are concerns that the expansion plan could be negatively impacted by the current uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many businesses in the hospitality sector have been hit hard by restrictions and lockdowns, and there are worries that the sector could face more difficulties in the coming months and years.
Addressing these concerns, Brittain stated that the company was confident in its ability to navigate the challenges ahead, saying, "We are aware of the uncertainties in the wider environment, but we are committed to this expansion plan, and we believe that by investing in our people, our brands, and our infrastructure, we will emerge stronger and more resilient."
Overall, the expansion plan is a significant move by Bass Plc, indicating the company's ambition and determination to bounce back from the pandemic. With $1.1 billion of investment and 7,000 new jobs, the plan is likely to have a positive impact not just on the company, but on the wider UK economy as well.  So, the whole industry is looking forward to its implementation and successful completion.
