Edinburgh, Scotland - Scottish & Newcastle Plc, the multinational brewing and beverage company, is expected to gain significant benefits from its acquisition of the Courage brands. However, analysts believe that the company's Center Parcs resorts are holding the company back from realizing its full potential.
Scottish & Newcastle Plc acquired the Courage brand in 2006 when it merged with Heineken, the Dutch brewing company. The Courage brand, which includes Courage Best Bitter and Courage Directors, has been a staple of the British brewing industry for over two centuries. Since merging with Heineken, Scottish & Newcastle Plc has invested heavily in promoting the brand, including introducing new packaging and advertising campaigns.
Analysts believe that Scottish & Newcastle Plc's investment in the Courage brand is paying off, with sales of Courage Best Bitter up by 10% in the last year. The beer is particularly popular in London, where it has gained a cult following among hipsters and craft beer enthusiasts.
However, while the Courage brand is thriving, analysts believe that Scottish & Newcastle Plc's investment in Center Parcs is a mistake. The company owns five Center Parcs resorts throughout the UK, which offer guests a variety of activities, including swimming, cycling, and spa treatments. While the resorts have been popular with families, analysts believe that they are a drag on the company's profitability.
"Scottish & Newcastle Plc should sell its Center Parcs resorts and focus on its core business of brewing and beverage production," said John Smith, a partner at the consultancy firm Porter & Stanhope. "The resorts may be popular with families, but they are a low-margin business and distract the company from its more profitable areas."
Smith's view is shared by many analysts, who believe that the company's investment in Center Parcs is a distraction from its core business. "Scottish & Newcastle Plc is a brewing and beverage company, not a leisure company," said Sarah Brown, an analyst at investment bank Goldman Sachs. "While the resorts may be successful, they are not the company's core business and do not fit with its long-term strategy."
Scottish & Newcastle Plc has not disclosed how much revenue its Center Parcs resorts generate, but some analysts believe that it is a small percentage of the company's overall revenue. According to the company's annual report, its beer brands, including Foster's and Kronenbourg 1664, generated Â£3.3 billion in revenue in 2020.
Despite the calls for the company to divest from its leisure business, Scottish & Newcastle Plc is unlikely to sell its Center Parcs resorts in the near future. The company's CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, has previously stated that he sees the resorts as an important part of the company's overall business strategy.
"Center Parcs is a key part of our portfolio and offers an attractive proposition to families looking for a high-quality, all-inclusive holiday experience," Mackenzie said in a statement last year. "While the resorts may not be as profitable as our brewing business, they are an important part of our overall strategy and we remain committed to investing in them."
Mackenzie's stance has been supported by some analysts, who believe that the resorts offer a unique and valuable addition to the company's overall business. "While the resorts may not generate as much revenue as the brewing business, they offer a unique and valuable addition to Scottish & Newcastle Plc," said Emma Johnson, an analyst at investment consultancy firm Stevens & Co. "The resorts attract a different demographic than the beer brands and offer a more stable source of revenue."
Despite the differences in opinion, most analysts agree that Scottish & Newcastle Plc is a strong and well-managed company. The company's investment in the Courage brand has paid off, and its beer portfolio remains one of the most successful in the industry. Whether or not the company chooses to divest from its leisure business, it seems certain that Scottish & Newcastle Plc will continue to thrive and remain a major player in the global brewing industry.
