Unilever, the global consumer goods giant, has reported better-than-expected profits, sending its share prices soaring. The company's sales grew by over 5% in the third quarter of this year, helped by higher demand for its hygiene and home products due to the pandemic.
The British-Dutch multinational, which owns brands such as Dove, Knorr, and Ben & Jerry's, reported underlying sales growth of 4.4%, beating analysts' expectations of 1.8%. The company's hygiene and home division saw the strongest growth, with sales up by almost 20%.
Unilever's CEO, Alan Jope, attributed the company's strong performance to its "purpose-led brands" and its ability to adapt to changing consumer trends. "We have been able to navigate the operational challenges caused by the pandemic while continuing to strengthen our brands," he said.
The company's shares rose sharply after the announcement, with the stock up by almost 4% in early trading. The news is likely to be welcomed by investors, who have seen Unilever's shares underperform in recent years due to increasing competition and changing consumer preferences.
Unilever's strong performance comes despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, which has disrupted supply chains and forced many businesses to close. However, the company has been able to adapt to the new reality, with many consumers turning to its hygiene and home products to protect themselves during the crisis.
The company's results were also boosted by its pivot towards e-commerce, which has become an increasingly important part of the retail landscape during the pandemic. Unilever said that e-commerce sales grew by over 76% in the third quarter, driven by increased demand for its products online.
Looking ahead, Unilever said that it expects to see continued growth in its sales, but warned that the pandemic could continue to impact its operations. "The current environment remains highly volatile and uncertain," the company said in a statement.
Nevertheless, Unilever's strong performance is likely to be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's strategy and its ability to weather the storm. With a portfolio of well-known brands and a growing e-commerce business, Unilever is well positioned to capitalize on changing consumer preferences and emerge stronger from the pandemic.
