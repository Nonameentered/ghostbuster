Bass Plc's chairman has expressed confidence that the acquisition of Carlsberg-Tetley will boost competition in the UK beer market. The deal, which was announced earlier this week, will see Bass take control of the Carlsberg-Tetley brewery in Northampton, as well as its brands. The move is set to increase Bass' market share in the UK beer market, which has been dominated by a small number of large players in recent years. Commenting on the acquisition, the chairman said that he believed it would create "significant opportunities" for Bass to grow its business and better serve its customers.
