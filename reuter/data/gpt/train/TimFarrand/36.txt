Grand Metropolitan Plc, the multinational conglomerate based in London, is expected to report strong growth in its upcoming financial results driven by its Pillsbury brand. However, the company is also facing a huge loss on disposals.
According to analysts, Grand Metropolitan's Pillsbury brand, which includes baking mixes, frostings, and ready-to-bake products, has been performing exceptionally well in the US market. The pandemic-induced baking frenzy has led to a surge in demand for Pillsbury products, resulting in an increase in sales and revenue for Grand Metropolitan.
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the company's other brands, including Smirnoff Vodka and Guinness, have also seen growth in certain markets. However, the company is expected to report a huge loss on disposals, mainly due to the sale of its US packaged food business to General Mills last year.
The sale of the US packaged food business, which included the Green Giant and Le Sueur brands, was part of Grand Metropolitan's strategy to focus on its core brands and exit less profitable businesses. However, the company incurred a loss of around Â£1.8 billion ($2.5 billion) on the sale, which is likely to impact its financial results.
In addition, the company is also facing challenges in the UK market due to the ongoing impact of Brexit and Covid-19. The hospitality industry, which is a key market for Grand Metropolitan's drinks business, has been severely impacted by the pandemic, leading to a decline in sales.
Despite these challenges, Grand Metropolitan's CEO, Simon Litherland, remains optimistic about the company's future. He recently announced a new sustainability strategy, which includes a commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and a target of sourcing 50% of its ingredients from sustainable sources by 2030.
"Our strong performance in the US and our commitment to sustainability give us confidence in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders," Litherland said in a statement.
In conclusion, Grand Metropolitan Plc is expected to report strong growth driven by its Pillsbury brand, but the impact of disposals will result in a huge loss for the company. Despite these challenges, the company remains focused on its strategy of investing in core brands and sustainability, which it believes will drive its future growth.
