Northern Foods Plc, a leading UK food manufacturer, has reported virtually flat profits for the first half of the year, blaming a dairy collapse on world prices. The company said that while it saw solid growth in some of its core categories, the dairy market remained a challenging environment, with prices falling to multi-year lows.
The company's half-year results, which were released on Wednesday, showed pre-tax profit of £45.3m, up just 0.4% from the same period last year. Total revenue for the period was £733.2m, a 1.2% increase from the previous year.
Northern Foods had warned earlier this year that the dairy industry was facing a difficult period as world markets struggled with oversupply. The global glut of milk and dairy products has led to a sharp fall in prices, hitting the profits of farmers and processors alike.
The company, which makes popular brands such as Goodfella's pizza and Fox's biscuits, said it had felt the impact of the dairy downturn, although it had been able to offset some of the effects by focusing on cost-cutting and operating efficiency.
"The challenging dairy conditions have continued into the first half of the year, with global oversupply putting downward pressure on prices," said Northern Foods CEO, Peter Hindley. "We have therefore seen a reduction in our dairy revenues, as well as lower contributions from our other business segments where dairy is a key ingredient."
Despite the difficult conditions, Northern Foods said it had seen strong performances in some of its other categories, including pizza, ready meals and sandwiches. The company said it had also benefited from the recent launch of new products, such as its recently launched plant-based pizza range.
However, analysts said they were disappointed that the company had failed to show more significant growth in its core categories, particularly given the apparent resilience of the wider food industry.
"Northern Foods has been hit hard by the dairy downturn, but it's concerning that they haven't been able to make more progress in their other categories," said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club. "The wider food industry is still performing well despite the challenge of Brexit uncertainty and rising food prices, so it's clear that Northern Foods has some work to do to improve its competitive position."
Northern Foods said it would continue to focus on cost-cutting and operating efficiency in order to mitigate the effects of the dairy collapse. It also said it would look to explore new growth opportunities, such as expanding its range of plant-based products.
"We remain committed to delivering sustainable growth for our shareholders, and we believe that the actions we are taking will put us in a strong position to weather the challenging market conditions," said Hindley.
The company's shares, which had seen a dip earlier in the day, recovered slightly following the release of the results. However, analysts said they would be looking closely at the company's future performance in order to assess its ability to navigate the tough economic climate in the coming months.
Northern Foods is one of the largest food manufacturers in the UK, with a diverse portfolio of products that includes pizza, biscuits, sandwiches, and ready meals. The company has seen strong growth in recent years, driven by its focus on high-quality, convenient products that appeal to consumers' changing tastes and lifestyles. However, with the dairy market still facing significant challenges, analysts say the company will need to continue to adapt in order to remain competitive.
