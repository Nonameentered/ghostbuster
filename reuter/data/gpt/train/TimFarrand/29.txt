Independent Brewers Call for Excise Duty Cut Ahead of UK Budget Statement
Independent brewers from across the UK are calling on the government to cut excise duty on beer ahead of the Budget Statement in March. The industry, which employs over 40,000 people in the country, has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many small businesses struggling to survive.
Excise duty is a tax levied on alcohol products in the UK, and the beer industry pays one of the highest rates in Europe. The tax is levied on the volume of beer produced, meaning that small breweries are hit particularly hard. The cost of producing a pint of beer has been rising steadily over the past few years, with excise duty accounting for a significant proportion of the overall cost.
In a joint statement, a group of independent brewers said: “We are calling on the government to reduce excise duty on beer to help support small businesses in the brewing industry. The pandemic has hit us hard, and many small breweries are struggling to survive. A cut in excise duty would help to reduce the cost of producing beer and enable us to invest in our businesses and create new jobs.”
The group, which includes over 50 independent breweries from across the UK, has outlined a number of measures that it believes the government should take to support the industry. These include a reduction in the rate of excise duty on beer, a freeze on beer duty for the next two years, and an extension of the temporary reduction in VAT for hospitality and tourism businesses.
According to the group, a cut in excise duty on beer would have a significant impact on the industry, with the potential to create thousands of new jobs and inject millions of pounds into the economy. The group also argues that the government should do more to support small businesses in the brewing industry, including providing access to funding and training, and promoting the sector domestically and internationally.
The calls for a cut in excise duty on beer come at a time when the government is facing pressure from a range of industries to provide support in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospitality industry, which includes pubs and breweries, has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, with many businesses forced to close for long periods of time.
The government has introduced a range of measures to support the hospitality industry, including the temporary reduction in VAT, the furlough scheme, and grants for businesses affected by the pandemic. However, many in the industry argue that more needs to be done to support small businesses and ensure that they are able to survive in the long term.
The UK beer industry is one of the largest and most diverse in the world, with over 2,000 breweries producing a vast array of beers. The industry is also a significant contributor to the UK economy, generating billions of pounds in revenue and supporting thousands of jobs. However, the industry faces a number of challenges, including increasing competition from large multinational breweries and the high cost of producing beer in the UK.
The calls for a cut in excise duty on beer come at a time when the UK is facing a number of economic challenges, including the uncertainty caused by Brexit, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to transition to a low-carbon economy. The government has a difficult balancing act ahead as it seeks to support businesses while also ensuring that the UK’s public finances are on a sustainable path.
Despite the challenges facing the industry, independent brewers remain optimistic about the future of beer in the UK. Many brewers are experimenting with new recipes and ingredients, and there is a growing interest in craft beer among consumers both in the UK and internationally.
In conclusion, the UK independent brewing industry has called for a cut in excise duty on beer ahead of the Budget Statement in March. The industry has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and many small businesses are struggling to survive. A reduction in excise duty on beer would help to reduce the cost of producing beer and enable small businesses to invest in their businesses and create new jobs. The government faces a difficult decision as it seeks to balance the needs of businesses with the need to ensure the UK’s public finances are on a sustainable path. However, there is a growing optimism in the industry about the future of beer in the UK, and the potential for small businesses to thrive in the years ahead.
