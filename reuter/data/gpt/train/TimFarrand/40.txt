Marston's Pedigree, the famous beer brand in the UK, has been experiencing a decline in sales recently. This can be attributed to the rising popularity of nitrokegs, which are becoming an increasingly popular choice among beer drinkers.
Nitrokegs, also known as nitrogen-infused beers, have become increasingly popular over the past few years. They are created by replacing the carbon dioxide used in beer with nitrogen, which leads to a creamier and smoother finish. This innovative feature has led to the rise in popularity of nitrokegs among beer enthusiasts.
As a result of this trend, Marston's Pedigree has seen a decline in sales in recent years. According to industry experts, this trend is likely to continue as more and more beer lovers prefer nitrokegs over traditional beers.
Despite the decline in sales for Marston's Pedigree, the company has still seen an overall increase in market share. This is thanks to their recent merger with Carlsberg, which has boosted their presence in the UK beer market significantly.
Marston's Pedigree has been operating in the UK for over 170 years, and remains one of the leading beer brands in the country. The company has a rich history and a loyal customer base, but it remains to be seen how the rise in nitrokegs will affect their future sales.
Commenting on the situation, a spokesperson for Marston's Pedigree said, "While we have seen a decline in sales due to the rising popularity of nitrokegs, we remain committed to providing our customers with the highest quality beer possible. We believe that our loyal customer base will continue to support us as we navigate this changing market."
The beer industry in the UK is constantly evolving, and the rise in popularity of nitrokegs is just one example of this. As traditional beer brands like Marston's Pedigree adapt to these changes, it will be interesting to see how they continue to carve out a place in the market among the newer, trendier options.
