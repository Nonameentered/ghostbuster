Scottish and Newcastle Plc (S&N), the UK-based brewer and pubs operator, has reported a 26 percent increase in half-year profits, driven by strong sales across its key brands.
The company's pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose to £48m ($63m), up from £38m ($50m) in the same period last year. Revenue rose 6 percent to £1.17bn ($1.54bn).
S&N, which owns brands including Newcastle Brown Ale, Foster's and Strongbow, said its underlying operating profit rose 6 percent to £147m ($193m) over the period.
The company said it had benefitted from strong sales growth across all of its key brands in the UK, as well as growth in its international business.
"Our half-year results demonstrate that we continue to build momentum in our business," said CEO Tony Froggatt. "This is a reflection of the hard work and dedication of our teams across the business, as well as the strength of our brands and our strategic focus on delivering value to our customers."
Froggatt said the company was continuing to investing in its brands and infrastructure, and was "well-positioned" to capture growth in the beer and pub sectors.
"We remain confident in the long-term prospects for our business, and the potential for our brands to continue to grow and succeed,” he added.
S&N's results come as the UK beer and pub sectors face a number of challenges, including declining beer sales, rising costs, and increasing competition from other drinks categories.
However, S&N has been able to maintain its market share through a combination of product innovation, marketing investment, and a focus on delivering value to its customers.
In particular, its focus on the premium beer segment has enabled it to differentiate itself from the competition and generate growth in a challenging market.
The company's flagship brand, Newcastle Brown Ale, has seen strong growth in the UK in recent months, driven by the launch of new packaging and the introduction of new variants such as Newcastle Brown Ale Light.
In addition, S&N's international business has continued to show strong growth, with sales up 14 percent over the half-year period.
The company has expanded its presence in key markets such as the US, Canada, and Australia, while also investing in emerging beer markets such as China.
S&N's strong financial performance has also enabled it to invest in its pub estate, which comprises over 1,500 pubs across the UK.
The company has introduced a number of initiatives to improve the quality and consistency of its pub offering, including a new menu and a focus on customer service.
S&N's results were welcomed by investors, with shares in the company rising over 2 percent in early trading.
Analysts said the results were a clear sign of the company's resilience in a challenging market, and would likely lead to an upgrade in earnings forecasts for the full year.
"The strength of S&N's brands and its strategic focus on delivering value to customers is clearly paying off," said Mark Williams, an analyst at investment bank HSBC. "We expect the company to continue to outperform the market and deliver strong returns for investors."
