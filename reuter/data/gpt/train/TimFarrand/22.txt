Consumer goods company Unilever reported a 5% rise in its Q3 profits on Thursday, sending shares jumping up by 4% during morning trading. The strong performance was driven by higher sales volumes and price increases in markets such as China and India.
Unilever, the maker of popular household products such as Dove soap and Lipton tea, reported a net profit of €2.4bn ($2.8bn) for the third quarter of the year, up from €2.3bn ($2.7bn) in the same period last year. The company's underlying sales growth, which is a key metric for the company's performance, rose by 4.4%, beating analysts' expectations of 3.9%.
The company's sales in emerging markets, including China and India, increased by double-digits, helping to offset slower sales in developed markets such as Europe and North America.
Alan Jope, Unilever's CEO, said in a statement that the company's performance reflected the strength of its portfolio and its focused execution. He also cited the "resilience" of the company's business in the face of "ongoing volatility and uncertainty" in the global economy.
Unilever's strong Q3 performance comes at a time when the global consumer goods industry is facing challenges from rising commodity and transportation costs, as well as changing consumer preferences. In response, the company has been cutting costs and investing in new products and technologies to stay competitive.
The company's growth has been driven in part by its focus on sustainability, with products such as its plant-based meat substitutes and recyclable packaging resonating well with consumers. Unilever has also been actively working to reduce its carbon footprint, with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2030.
Investors have responded positively to Unilever's Q3 performance, with shares up 4% in morning trading on Thursday. The company's stock has been on an upward trend in recent months, with shares up nearly 20% so far this year.
Looking ahead, Unilever is cautiously optimistic about its prospects for the remainder of the year, given the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy. The company has reiterated its target of achieving mid-single digit underlying sales growth for the full year, and expects to deliver another quarter of positive volume growth in Q4.
In summary, Unilever's strong Q3 performance is a testament to the company's focus on sustainability and innovation, as well as its ability to navigate the challenges of a volatile global economy. With a solid foundation in place, the company is well-positioned to continue driving growth and creating value for shareholders in the years ahead.
