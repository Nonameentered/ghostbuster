Northern Foods Offset Impact of Low World Dairy Prices with Improved Margins on Prepared Foods
Northern Foods, the British company that produces ready-made meals and baked goods for supermarkets, has been able to offset the impact of low world dairy prices with improved margins on prepared foods.
The company, which reported its half-year results on Monday, said it had managed to maintain profitability in its food business despite the challenging market environment.
The food sector has been hit hard by falling dairy prices caused by oversupply, which has resulted in a decline in prices for dairy products such as cheese, butter and milk.
However, Northern Foods has managed to weather this storm by diversifying its product portfolio and focusing on prepared meals, which has allowed it to increase margins and maintain profitability.
According to the company's CEO, Steve Holyoake, "Our focus on prepared foods has allowed us to offset the impact of low world dairy prices, which has been a challenging issue for the industry as a whole."
"We have been able to improve our margins on prepared meals by increasing efficiency and reducing waste in our production processes. This has allowed us to maintain profitability and continue to invest in our business," he added.
The company reported that revenue from its food business had increased by 5.6% to £526m, driven by strong sales of prepared meals. Operating profit in the food business was £26.4m, up from £25.9m in the same period last year.
The company's performance in its food business was in contrast to its performance in the bakery business, which saw declining revenue and operating profit.
Mr Holyoake said the decline in the bakery business was due to increased competition in the market and higher commodity prices.
"We are working to address these issues by investing in new product development and increasing efficiency in our bakery operations. We believe these measures will help us to improve our performance in the bakery business over the coming year," he added.
Overall, the company reported a 1.4% increase in revenue and a 7.1% increase in operating profit to £44.1m for the first half of the year.
The company said it was confident of delivering on its full-year guidance, which includes a 2-4% increase in revenue and a 5-7% increase in operating profit.
Mr Holyoake said the company had a strong position in the market, with a portfolio of well-known brands and a focus on innovation and quality.
"We believe our strong position in the market and our focus on the needs of our customers will enable us to continue to grow our business and deliver value to our shareholders," he added.
The company's results were welcomed by analysts, who said Northern Foods had managed to navigate a challenging market environment by focusing on its strengths and diversifying its product portfolio.
"The company has done well to maintain profitability in a difficult market environment, and its focus on prepared meals has allowed it to offset the impact of low world dairy prices," said Sarah Fleming, analyst at Willbanks & Co.
"The company's investment in new product development and its focus on quality and innovation will help it to continue to grow its business in the coming years," she added.
The company's shares were up by 2% following the announcement of its half-year results.
In conclusion, Northern Foods’ ability to offset the impact of low world dairy prices with improved margins on prepared foods is a testament to its strong position in the market and its focus on innovation and quality. With a diverse product portfolio and a focus on the needs of its customers, the company is well-positioned to continue to grow its business and deliver value to its shareholders.
