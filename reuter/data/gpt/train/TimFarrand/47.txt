Greenalls Plc, the British brewing and leisure company, is set to announce a nearly 20% increase in full year profits, thanks to its acquisition of the famous Boddington brand. The company will unveil its financial results on Monday, and investors are eagerly awaiting the figures after a turbulent year for the industry.
Greenalls Plc declared in March 2020 that it had purchased Boddington from the Belgian brewing giant, Interbrew, for an estimated sum of £180 million. The move was seen as a strategic one for the company, as Boddington was consistently one of the top-selling beers in the UK, with a long and established history going back to the 18th century.
The acquisition allowed Greenalls to diversify its portfolio and gain a foothold in the competitive beer market, which has been facing major challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of craft beers and independent breweries. The company's CEO, Simon Longbottom, said at the time: "This acquisition is a major step forward for Greenalls and a clear signal of our intention to grow our business in the UK beer market."
The figures due to be released on Monday are expected to reflect the success of the move, with Greenalls likely to post a pre-tax profit of £115 million for the year ending September 30, up from the previous year's figure of £96 million. The company's revenues are also expected to have risen, from £850 million in 2019 to around £1 billion in 2020.
Analysts have praised Greenalls' decision to acquire Boddington, describing it as a "smart" move that has helped the company weather the storm of the pandemic. The beer market has been hit hard by the closure of bars and pubs, and the cancellation of events such as sporting fixtures and music festivals, which have traditionally been important sales channels for brewers.
However, Greenalls has been able to offset some of the losses by selling Boddington through supermarkets and online retailers, as well as through its own chain of pubs and bars. The company has also invested in online ordering and delivery services, allowing consumers to order beer and other products directly to their homes.
Longbottom said in a recent interview that the company had been "incredibly agile" in responding to the challenges of the pandemic, and that the acquisition of Boddington had given it a much-needed boost. "We've had to be innovative and find new ways of reaching our customers, and Boddington has been a key part of that," he said.
Looking ahead, Greenalls is bullish about the future, despite ongoing uncertainty in the market. The company recently announced plans to open a new brewery in Manchester, which will produce a range of craft beers and ciders in addition to the Boddington brand. The move is seen as a further indication of the company's commitment to growth and diversification.
Overall, the news of Greenalls' expected profits increase has been welcomed by investors, who have seen the company's share price rise by 20% in the past six months. If the figures are confirmed on Monday, it will be a further boost for the company, which has been steadily growing its presence in the UK's competitive beer and leisure market.
