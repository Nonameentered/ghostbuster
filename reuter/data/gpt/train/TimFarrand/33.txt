The Deputy Chairman of Vendome Luxury Goods, Mr. Takahiro Suzuki, has predicted stabilization and potential improvement for the Japanese yen against the US dollar. He stated that the recent rise in Japanese exports and a decrease in the US trade deficit have had a positive impact on the Japanese currency. Suzuki also mentioned that the Bank of Japan's monetary easing policies could lead to further strengthening of the yen. The prediction comes at a time when Japan is facing economic uncertainty due to a recent increase in coronavirus cases. However, Suzuki believes that the yen's future looks bright.
