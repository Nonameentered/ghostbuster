Tate & Lyle, a British multinational agribusiness company specializing in the production of refined sugar and other food ingredients, has reported a fall in profits for its latest fiscal year. However, the company's shares rose due to the positive outlook for its corn miller subsidiary.
According to the financial statements released by Tate & Lyle, the company's sales revenue for the year ended on March 31, 2021, was £2.8 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the previous year. The company's adjusted profit before tax was also down by 1% to £331 million.
The fall in profits can be attributed to several factors, including the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted the company's business operations, disrupted supply chains, and caused fluctuations in demand and pricing for raw materials.
In addition, Tate & Lyle faced challenges in its core business of sweeteners and starches, where it has been affected by increased competition and regulatory changes. The company has been transitioning its portfolio to focus more on specialty food ingredients, which have higher margins and growth potential.
However, despite the fall in profits, Tate & Lyle's shares rose by 1.5% on the London Stock Exchange, buoyed by positive news from its corn miller subsidiary, which has been performing well in recent months.
The corn miller business, which produces corn-based products such as sweeteners, starches, and ethanol, has been benefiting from increased demand for its products, particularly in the United States, where the biofuels industry has been growing.
Tate & Lyle's CEO, Nick Hampton, was optimistic about the company's future, citing the strength of its specialty food ingredients business and the growth potential of its corn miller subsidiary.
"Our specialty food ingredients business has continued to perform well, with strong growth in the health and wellness and plant-based categories, while our corn miller business has benefited from favorable market conditions and increased demand for biofuels," said Hampton.
He added, "Looking ahead, we are confident that our strategy of focusing on specialty food ingredients and high-growth markets will deliver sustainable growth and value for our shareholders."
Tate & Lyle's positive outlook was also reflected in its decision to increase its dividend payout to shareholders, with a final payout of 23.2 pence per share, up from 22.7 pence per share the previous year.
The company's financial results and positive outlook were welcomed by analysts, who praised Tate & Lyle's strategic direction and potential for future growth.
"Despite the challenging environment, Tate & Lyle has made significant progress in transitioning its portfolio towards specialty food ingredients, which have strong growth potential," said Mark Wilde, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.
He added, "The performance of its corn miller subsidiary is also encouraging, given the growth prospects in the biofuels industry. Overall, we are positive on the outlook for Tate & Lyle and expect to see continued improvement in its financial performance."
In conclusion, while Tate & Lyle may have reported a fall in profits for its latest fiscal year, the company's positive outlook, particularly for its corn miller subsidiary, has given investors cause for optimism. With a focus on specialty food ingredients and high-growth markets, Tate & Lyle is well positioned to deliver sustainable growth and value for its shareholders in the years ahead.
