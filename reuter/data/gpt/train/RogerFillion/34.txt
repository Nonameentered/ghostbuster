Ameritech Corp. announced yesterday that it is seeking federal clearance to offer long-distance telephone service to customers in its five-state region. If approved, Ameritech will be the first of the Baby Bells to provide long-distance service, raising the stakes for its competitors.
Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Baby Bells were required to open their local phone markets to competition in exchange for the ability to offer long-distance service. However, the companies must first obtain approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that they have opened their local markets sufficiently to outside competition in order to offer long-distance service.
Ameritech's application comes after the company has been hit hard by competition in its traditional phone business. The company has lost nearly 20 percent of its local phone lines to competitors in the past year. Company executives believe that offering long-distance service will help Ameritech retain customers and increase revenue.
"Ameritech has never been timid about competing in new markets," said a company spokesperson. "We're taking the same approach with long-distance service. We believe our customers will benefit from the same high-quality service they have come to expect from us, and we're confident we can compete successfully in this market."
However, critics of Ameritech's application argue that the company has not done enough to open its local phone markets to competition. The Telecommunications Act requires the Baby Bells to open their local markets to at least one other local phone provider in order to be eligible to offer long-distance service. Critics say that Ameritech has blocked competition in its local markets, effectively denying customers the choice of a different provider.
"We're concerned that Ameritech is trying to use long-distance service as a smokescreen to maintain its monopoly power in its local markets," said a spokesperson for the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates. "They have not done enough to allow competition, and we believe the FCC should reject their application until they open their markets up to competition."
The FCC will review Ameritech's application and determine whether the company has met the requirements to offer long-distance service. If the application is approved, Ameritech's long-distance service could be available to customers as early as next year.
The other four Baby Bells – Pacific Telesis, Bell Atlantic, NYNEX, and Southwestern Bell – have not yet applied for federal approval to offer long-distance service. However, analysts expect that they will follow Ameritech's lead and seek approval in the coming months.
The competition for long-distance service among the Baby Bells is seen as a key test for the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The act was intended to promote competition and reduce prices in the telecommunications industry, but critics argue that it has not lived up to its promises. The Baby Bells dominated the local phone markets for decades, and many analysts expect that they will try to maintain their monopoly power through their long-distance service offerings.
Ameritech's application is just the beginning of what promises to be a contentious battle for long-distance market share. Investors will be watching closely as the Baby Bells compete for customers and try to establish themselves as major players in the telecommunications industry.
