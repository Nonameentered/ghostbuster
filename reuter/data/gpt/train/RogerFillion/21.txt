Federal Regulators Plan to Slash Rates on Overseas Calls, Potentially Saving Consumers and Companies Billions While Ruffling Feathers of Foreign Governments
Federal regulators in the United States are considering cutting rates on overseas calls in an effort to save consumers and companies billions of dollars. While this move is being applauded by many, it could also cause some friction with foreign governments.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed to lower the rates that U.S. telecommunications companies pay to foreign carriers, which carry international phone calls to and from the United States. With international traffic in the trillions of minutes each year, these fees add up. 
Currently, the FCC sets a rate cap, known as the "benchmark rate," for what U.S. carriers pay to foreign carriers. The benchmark rate, which is based on the costs of a hypothetical efficient carrier, was last revised in 2015 and currently stands at 1.011 cents per minute for calls to most countries.
However, representatives of the FCC said that this rate is no longer accurate as it does not reflect the current cost of providing such services. The FCC plans to reduce this rate, which would not only lower costs for U.S. carriers, but also enable them to pass on savings to consumers.
If the proposal passes, the new rates will apply to calls to over 200 countries, including major trading partners like China, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The FCC estimates that the reduction in rates could save U.S. companies and consumers up to $880 million annually.
On the other hand, foreign governments who receive these payments could see a significant drop in revenue. The FCC's proposal has already received pushback from several countries, including China, which has accused the U.S. of using its position of power to force concessions from other countries.
The proposal has also created tension within the U.S. government. The State Department has reportedly urged the FCC not to proceed, as State Department officials believe that the reduction of the benchmark rate will hurt the United States' ability to bargain with foreign governments.
Consumer advocacy groups, however, have welcomed the proposal. The Consumer Federation of America applauded the FCC's efforts to lower the cost of international calls, which can be a burden for many low-income and elderly Americans who rely on international calls to communicate with family and friends abroad.
The proposal is also seen as a continuation of the FCC's efforts to promote competition and reduce costs for consumers. Under Chairman Ajit Pai, the FCC has placed an emphasis on deregulation and promoting competition in the telecommunications industry. The Commission has already rolled back many of the Obama-era regulations on net neutrality, which critics say favored large internet service providers over smaller competitors.
If the proposal passes, FCC officials have said that they will monitor the effects and adjust the rates accordingly. However, the agency has not established a timeline for implementing the reductions.
Overall, the proposal represents a significant change in policy for the FCC. For decades, the agency has set high international calling rates to help subsidize the expansion of telecommunications infrastructure in the United States. If the proposal is implemented, it will put more emphasis on competition and consumer benefit, at the potential expense of foreign governments.
The proposal will likely face significant pushback from foreign governments, and it remains to be seen whether the FCC will ultimately proceed. Nevertheless, the potential savings for U.S. companies and consumers could be significant, and many will hope that the FCC's efforts to reduce the cost of international calls will succeed.
