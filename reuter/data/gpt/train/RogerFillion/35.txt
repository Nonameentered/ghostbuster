Regulators have set aside a portion of airwaves for local wireless networks. This move will enable communities to develop their own wireless networks without depending on big telecommunication companies.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has announced that it has allocated a portion of the 5.9 GHz band for unlicensed indoor and outdoor use. The FCC said that the allocation of this frequency band will enable local communities to develop their own wireless networks that will facilitate the delivery of advanced services, including broadband. This will also enhance digital equity by giving more Americans access to high-speed internet services.
The 5.9 GHz band has been reserved for vehicle-to-vehicle communications, but the technology has not been widely adopted. The FCC's decision will open up the spectrum to unlicensed use, enabling communities to develop their own wireless networks.
The decision has been welcomed by local governments, who say that the move will enable them to build their own networks and provide access to high-speed internet services to those in their communities who are currently underserved.
"This decision allows counties and municipalities to close the digital divide in their communities, providing equal access to everyone," said Michael O'Rielly, an FCC commissioner. "This should be welcome news for those who support local decision-making and innovation, and those who believe in the power of local communities to make decisions that work best for them."
In addition to enabling local communities to build their own wireless networks, the decision will also promote competition in the telecommunications industry. Telecommunications companies will now have to compete with local wireless networks, which will drive down prices and improve service for consumers.
However, some telecommunication companies have opposed the decision, arguing that unlicensed use of the 5.9 GHz band could interfere with vehicle safety communications. The FCC has said that it has taken steps to minimize this risk.
"This decision represents a major step towards enabling local communities to build their own wireless networks," said Jessica Rosenworcel, an FCC commissioner. "It will drive competition in the telecommunications industry and promote digital equity, giving more Americans access to high-speed internet services. This is a win for consumers and local communities."
