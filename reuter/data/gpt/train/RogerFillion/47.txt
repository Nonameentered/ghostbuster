A conservative media watchdog group has come out against the new TV ratings system, calling for it to be junked. The group, known as the Media Research Center, claims that the new system is biased against conservative programming and unfairly favors liberal shows.
According to the Media Research Center, the new ratings system, which uses a digital meter to track viewership, is designed to favor shows that have a large liberal viewership. The group claims that the new system is biased against conservative shows, which tend to have a more niche audience.
In a statement, the Media Research Center said, "This new ratings system is rigged against conservative programming and is nothing more than an attempt to silence conservative voices. We urge broadcasters to junk this biased system and adopt a fairer system that accurately reflects the viewing habits of all Americans."
The group went on to say that the new system was designed to favor shows that promote liberal values, such as diversity and political correctness, while punishing shows that hold more conservative views, such as traditional values and limited government.
The Media Research Center pointed to several examples of shows that they claim have been unfairly treated by the new ratings system. One of these shows is the conservative talk show, "Hannity," which has seen a significant drop in viewership since the new system was implemented.
The group also criticized the new system for not taking into account the increasing number of viewers who are watching shows online or on streaming services. They claim that this is a major flaw in the system, as it means that the ratings do not accurately reflect the viewing habits of today's consumers.
However, not everyone agrees with the Media Research Center's assessment of the new ratings system. Some critics have pointed out that the new system is actually more accurate than the old system, which relied on paper diaries filled out by viewers.
In addition, some have argued that the Media Research Center's criticism of the new system is simply an attempt to bolster conservative programming by discrediting the ratings of liberal shows.
Despite the criticisms, the new ratings system is likely here to stay. Broadcasters have invested significant resources into implementing the system, and it has been approved by the industry's main trade group, the Television Bureau of Advertising.
So, while the Media Research Center may be calling for the new system to be junked, it is unlikely that their efforts will succeed in getting broadcasters to abandon it. Instead, it seems that they will have to find other ways to promote conservative programming and reach their audience.
