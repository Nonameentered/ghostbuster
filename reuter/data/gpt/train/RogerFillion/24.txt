In an effort to minimize the cost of phone calls to and from other countries, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has launched new measures that are meant to help lower the cost of overseas phone calls for American consumers. The newly issued rules will require long-distance service providers to provide customers with access to more easily found information and will put a stop to expensive charges for phone calls made to other countries.
The FCC’s new rules are motivated by complaints from consumers, particularly those of African and Caribbean backgrounds, who have to pay unnecessarily high fees for international calls to friends and family overseas. These charges are mainly due to the monopolistic control exerted by networks in dozens of countries that make monitoring and regulating the cost of phone calls and access to telecommunications extremely challenging.
The Federal Communications Commission, in charge of regulating companies which operate within the telecommunication industry, has determined to tackle the problem head-on. In a statement released Monday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai stated that the agency faced the daunting task of creating a regulatory regime that would benefit consumers by reducing the burden of soaring international calling costs. According to Pai, "It's unacceptable that poor security, ineffective regulations, and deceptive practices have left millions of Americans paying billions of dollars too much for international calls." Therefore, the FCC has set up a framework to make phone calls to, and from, other countries less expensive and more straightforward for the consumer.
First, the FCC has developed an international calling registry, which will inform consumers of the best deals for making calls, particularly across borders. The site will also display the latest information concerning rules and regulations of international calls to boost transparency for consumers.
Second, long-distance service providers are expected to inform and educate customers about the tariffs and conditions of their services. Service providers are anticipated to do this through the development of a transparency platform that is a one-stop-shop for consumers. The platform will provide consumers with the tools they need to evaluate the pricing plans of different long-distance carriers. Customers will gain information about rates, billing practices, and other primary pricing variables that are necessary for enabling consumers to choose the best value for money when making long-distance calls.
The FCC's new regulations will also end the inordinate amount of tacked-on charges that customers used to experience when making international calls to friends and family. Often, callers are unaware of the actual cost of a call due to an unexplainably length and addition of multiple fees. The solution of the FCC is to make rates more transparent by making providers include the charges associated with making international calls readable and simple for consumers.
With these new regulations in place, the FCC believes that Americans will experience a significant reduction in the cost of making international calls." For far too long, calling other countries has been a complex, confusing and expensive labyrinth that’s sat on the backs of our most disenfranchised communities,” says FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel. “But today, we’re taking strong steps to fix these deep-rooted problems and provide families with the access they deserve.”
The FCC will supervise the new rules to ensure that service providers follow them within the first year. This will assure that people who are calling to other countries are not excessively charged to make a call because of the monopoly of overseas networks, which have prevented the coordination of access, prices, and regulations.
In conclusion, the introduction of the new FCC provisions is a significant transformation, which will hopefully provide consumers with access to lower-cost international calls. To streamline the process, consumers should ensure that they have precise information on the charges discovered while making an international call, as well and remain active in reporting errors that they may encounter. The FCC urges consumers to use the registry and transparency platform to obtain all details on making international calls.
