Washington D.C. - In a move that could revolutionize the way Americans communicate, the Clinton Administration is betting $36 billion on a spectrum auction plan that will allow new communications services to flourish. The money, raised from the auction of airwaves that have been used for years by television broadcasters, will be used to create a nationwide network that will provide wireless broadband access to rural areas and improve the capacity and speed of mobile networks.
The plan, dubbed the Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) auction, could create a new era of digital innovation and provide a major economic boost to the country. The auction, which concluded last week, saw a total of 1,087 spectrum licenses sold to 64 bidders, including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Dish Network.
The FCC, which oversaw the auction, announced that the total bid was $45.5 billion, with the biggest winner being T-Mobile, which spent $8 billion to acquire licenses for 1,525 markets, followed by Verizon, which spent $10.4 billion for 1,066 spectrum licenses. AT&T spent $1.9 billion, while Dish Network spent $6.2 billion.
The AWS-3 auction has been described as the most complex spectrum auction ever, due to the large number of licenses available and the diverse range of uses that they can be put to. The spectrum that was up for auction ranges from 1.7 GHz to 2.1 GHz, and has long been used by television broadcasters to provide their services.
However, with the rise of digital broadcasting, this section of the spectrum was freed up, providing the US government with an opportunity to sell the licenses to other users. The AWS-3 auction was the last of three auctions that raised $44.9 billion to fund the new communications network.
Speaking about the auction, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said, "The AWS-3 auction has been a landmark success. Not only did it generate a record-breaking $45 billion in revenue, but it will also create a new era of mobile broadband services for consumers and businesses across the country."
The funds raised from the auction will be used to finance the construction of a new nationwide network that will provide wireless broadband services to rural areas, where access to high-speed broadband is limited. The network will also help to improve the capacity and speed of existing mobile networks, enabling consumers to stream video and other data-intensive applications more easily.
The new network will be developed by FirstNet, an independent entity that was set up by Congress in 2012 to create a nationwide a broadband network for public safety agencies, which are currently reliant on commercial networks for their communications.
Matt Wood, Policy Director of Free Press, a public interest group, said, "This auction was a huge boon for the Treasury and for the public alike. It will provide much-needed funding for the construction of a nationwide public safety network, while also freeing up valuable spectrum for consumer use. This auction will be a huge boost for digital innovation, making it easier for tech entrepreneurs to develop new services and applications."
The AWS-3 auction was part of an overall effort by the Clinton Administration to promote digital innovation as part of its ambitious plan to boost economic growth and job creation. The administration has made digital innovation a key priority, with President Clinton hosting a summit on the subject last year, which brought together some of the brightest minds in the tech industry.
The administration has also launched a number of initiatives to encourage digital innovation, including efforts to promote the expansion of high-speed broadband access, the development of new technologies like the Internet of Things, and the reform of patent laws to make it easier for startups to develop new products and services. The AWS-3 auction is a major milestone in the administration's efforts to create a more innovative American economy, and could have a profound impact on the way Americans communicate and work.
