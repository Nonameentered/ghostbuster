In a move that will be welcomed by millions of Americans who have family and friends overseas, US regulators have taken steps to reduce the cost of international phone calls. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took the decision after years of complaints from consumers who have been paying excessive amounts for calls to other countries.
The new regulations mean that phone companies will have to lower their rates for international calls. They will also have to provide customers with more information about the rates they charge and the quality of service they offer. The FCC hopes that these measures will encourage competition between phone companies, leading to lower prices for consumers.
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement, "Today's action will help millions of Americans who have friends, family, and business associates overseas stay connected without breaking the bank. We are taking important steps to ensure that consumers can make international calls at reasonable rates and that phone companies compete fairly to provide this service."
The cost of international phone calls has been a contentious issue for many years, with some companies charging up to $4.00 per minute for calls to some countries. This has been a particular problem for low-income families, who rely on international calls to stay in touch with loved ones who live abroad.
Consumer advocacy groups have welcomed the FCC's decision, saying that it is long overdue. "Consumers have been paying too much for international calls for far too long," said Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union. "We commend the FCC for taking action to promote competition, transparency, and lower prices for consumers."
The new regulations will also require phone companies to provide customers with more detailed information about the rates they charge for international calls. This will enable consumers to compare prices between different companies and make more informed choices.
The FCC's decision has been met with resistance from some phone companies, who have argued that it will hurt their revenue streams. However, the FCC has pointed out that the regulations will benefit consumers and encourage competition, which will ultimately benefit the industry as a whole.
The new regulations will come into effect in the coming months. It is hoped that they will lead to lower prices for international calls and greater transparency in the industry.
The cost of international calls is just one of many issues facing consumers in the telecommunications industry. The FCC has been working to address a range of issues, including net neutrality, broadband deployment, and consumer privacy. The regulator has also been working to encourage competition in the industry, which it believes will lead to better services and lower prices for consumers.
In conclusion, the FCC's decision to reduce the cost of international phone calls is a major victory for consumers. The new regulations will help millions of Americans stay connected with loved ones overseas without having to pay exorbitant rates. It is hoped that these measures will encourage competition between phone companies, leading to lower prices and better services for consumers.
