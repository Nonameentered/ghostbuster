Washington D.C. - The interception of Newt Gingrich's phone call has reignited concerns over the lack of privacy protections in the cellular communication space. The former Speaker of the House had his call intercepted by a technology company that specializes in surveillance without his knowledge.
The call was made to a lobbyist, but the exact contents of the conversation are unknown. Last year, the same company intercepted a call made by the Attorney General of California and had been marketing its services to law enforcement agencies and governments worldwide.
This latest breach of privacy has sparked a fresh debate on understanding how data is being acquired and how it is being used, as well as how this issue can be addressed. Experts say that the current state of affairs leaves cell phone users at risk of being tracked, monitored, and intercepted by third parties without any notification.
"I am not surprised that people are intercepting calls in today's age of technology, but what surprises me is that the government does not have measures in place to address this issue," said Eugene Soltes, a professor of business administration at Harvard University.
The consequences of compromised cellular privacy could be dire, according to Soltes. Hackers, state actors, and criminals could use an individual's private information to cause harm, including the theft of intellectual property and personal data, leading to identity theft.
"I think the problem is that the technology moves faster than the law and legislative changes. The government may have passed laws, but this does not mean that private parties are not able to evade them," said Soltes.
President Joe Biden has previously voiced concerns over the lack of protections for cell phone users. In March, he signed an executive order aimed at promoting competition in the technology sector and increasing privacy protections for consumers.
However, there has been little visible progress since the signing of the executive order, and lawmakers have not passed any meaningful legislation to address the issue.
Members of Congress have called for increased regulation of the technology industry, as well as increased funding for agencies tasked with investigating and prosecuting those who engage in unlawful interception of communications.
The National Security Agency was identified as the prime agency tasked with implementing privacy protections in the wake of the Edward Snowden leak. However, NSA's implementation of privacy protections has been criticized by consumer advocates and privacy groups for being too weak.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is responsible for regulating the telecommunications industry, has recently been called upon to put measures in place to protect privacy rights over cellular networks.
"The FCC has the authority and mandate to enforce privacy and cybersecurity obligations," said Jon Peha, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Engineering and Public Policy.
Peha further noted that "the Commission should require providers to notify their customers of any breach that they are aware of and require providers to conduct penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities that these providers can then use to improve their systems."
At the same time, industry experts argue that privacy concerns should not stop innovation in the telecommunications sector. The development of 5G networks and wireless technologies requires the use of personal data by service providers and device makers.
As such, some experts say that the industry needs to collaborate with regulators to find a balance between innovation and privacy.
"The industry must work with policymakers to strike the right balance between innovation and privacy, which will require collaboration, joint investment, and increased consumer education," said Mary Brown, senior director of government affairs at Cisco.
Overall, experts agree that the issue of cellular privacy protections requires immediate attention from policymakers at all levels of government. As technology continues to evolve, the need for effective privacy protections must be a priority.
