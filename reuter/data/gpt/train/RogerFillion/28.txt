The entertainment industry has always maintained that it has the capability to self-regulate its content and has vehemently opposed any government measures that seek to impose restrictions on its content. Recently, the industry's stance against government-imposed plans for TV ratings has become more apparent, as it launched a new system to rate televised content that rivals the one currently endorsed by the government.
According to reports, entertainment industry giants Disney, Fox, Universal, and Warner Bros joined forces to form the Entertainment Ratings Board (ERB) in response to what they call "outdated classification methodologies" currently used by the government's ratings board, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The ERB is poised to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced set of classifications that would better suit modern audiences.
The ERB's new ratings system is set to be rolled out by the end of the year, and it's designed to take into account the vast array of content on television, from children's shows to adult programming. The ERB intends to gain the support of as many industry players as possible, with initial reactions from other production houses appearing positive.
"Ratings have always been an essential aspect of the entertainment industry, and the ERB is a great step forward towards a more comprehensive, modern, and individualized way of ranking our content," said a spokesperson for Disney.
The industry's push for its own rating system is based on its belief that the FCC's current ratings model does not meet modern entertainment needs. The FCC's rating system is criticized for being too restrictive and not taking into account the individual needs and preferences of its viewing audiences.
In the past, the FCC's actions in this field have led to legal disputes with the entertainment industry. For example, in the early 1990s, the FCC faced legal action for revoking the license of a network that aired an episode of "Twin Peaks" considered too sexually charged for viewers.
The ERB intends to prevent and overcome such legal disputes by creating a more versatile and nuanced rating system. It also hopes to provide audiences with improved classification tags that will enable them to better understand the content they are watching.
"This new rating system is about being more open and transparent with our viewers," said a spokesman for Universal. "Our hope is that this ratings system will be the industry standard moving forward."
The ERB has not given information on the criteria that it will use for its rating system, but it assures audiences that it will provide a more comprehensive, nuanced, and individualized view of the content.
Meanwhile, the FCC has not released an official statement on the ERB's move, but some government officials have expressed concern over it. They perceive it as an industry's attempt to evade government scrutiny, thereby potentially damaging the industry's efforts to create content that is safe and accessible to all.
"While we appreciate the industry's desire to self-regulate, it is imperative that the government retains oversight over film and television content. In my view, it is not the job of the industry to regulate itself," said Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii.
The FCC's rating system has been the standard within the entertainment industry for decades, and the industry's move to create an alternative may generate confusion in the short term and spark debates on which classification is the better option.
However, the ERB's move is significant and could be a game-changer for the industry, which continues to evolve and compete with other forms of entertainment.
In conclusion, the entertainment industry's move to create its own rating system is an indication of the industry pushing back against government intervention in entertainment content. With the ERB providing audiences with a comprehensive and nuanced view of its content offering, it could become the standard when it comes to groupings and classifications of televised programming. Whether it will achieve industry-wide acceptance, replacing the FCC's rating system, remains to be seen.  END.
