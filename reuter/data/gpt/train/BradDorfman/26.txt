Mercantile Bancorp Inc has announced its acquisition of Roosevelt Financial Group Inc for $1.07 billion in an in-market deal. The purchase of the St. Louis-based bank is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
Mercantile Bancorp, a bank holding company headquartered in Chicago, already owns several community banks in Illinois and southern Wisconsin. The acquisition of Roosevelt Financial Group will add to its growing network of banks located in the Midwest. 
According to industry analysts, the price and charge of the deal seem reasonable. The acquisition is expected to provide both organizations with significant benefits. Mercantile Bancorp will gain access to Roosevelt Financial's existing infrastructure and customer base, while Roosevelt Financial will benefit from Mercantile's underwriting capabilities and experience in commercial and industrial lending.
John Kelly, president, and CEO of Mercantile Bancorp, said, "We are thrilled to announce this acquisition, which we believe will allow us to further expand our presence in the Midwest. The addition of Roosevelt will bring meaningful scale to our organization and enable us to offer enhanced products and services to our customers."
The transaction is also expected to strengthen the position of Mercantile Bancorp against other competitors. The company will benefit from Roosevelt Financial's current presence in Missouri, Illinois, and Kansas. The acquisition is expected to lead to cost synergies, including reduction of overlapping expenses.
Brian Mahon, the CEO of Roosevelt Financial Group, said, "We are excited to be joining the Mercantile family. We believe our combination will allow us to better serve our customers and provide enhanced products and services to our markets."
The acquisition is subjected to approval from regulatory authorities and shareholders of Roosevelt Financial Group. The proposed transaction is expected to close by the end of this year.
Overall, the acquisition is expected to be a win-win for both organizations. The deal will enable Mercantile Bancorp to expand operations and gain a greater market share, while Roosevelt Financial will benefit from increased resources and economies of scale.
