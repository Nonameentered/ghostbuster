Yellow Corp. Announces Workforce Reductions in Restructuring of Yellow Freight System
Yellow Corp. announced on Thursday that it will be restructuring its Yellow Freight System to increase efficiency and streamline operations. As part of the restructuring process, the company will be implementing workforce reductions, affecting around 1,500 full-time positions.
The move comes as the company looks to expand its presence in the highly competitive freight industry. The restructuring aims to reduce costs while improving reliability and customer service. The initiative will include consolidating facilities, rationalizing its network, and optimizing its equipment fleet.
"We have been evaluating our operations for some time, and we see an opportunity to improve our efficiency and productivity while delivering better service to our customers," said Yellow Corp. CEO Darren Hawkins. "These changes will ensure the long-term success of our company."
The layoffs represent a 4% reduction in the company's workforce and are expected to impact employees across the organization. The company has stated that it will offer severance packages, outplacement assistance, and other support to affected employees.
"We understand that this is a difficult time for our employees, and we are committed to supporting them during this transition," added Hawkins. "We are grateful for their years of service and contributions to our company."
Yellow Corp. expects to complete the restructuring process by the end of 2021. The company noted that it is continuing to invest in its technology and network to improve operational efficiencies and enhance its customer experience. It is also looking to increase capacity in response to growing customer demand.
Yellow Corp. is one of the largest transportation companies in the United States, providing a range of freight services, including LTL (less-than-truckload) and truckload transportation, warehousing, and logistics solutions. The company operates over 300 terminals and has a fleet of more than 13,000 trucks.
The restructuring announcement comes as the freight industry is experiencing rapid change and disruption. The sector has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, driver shortages, and supply chain challenges. The industry has also faced stiff competition from new entrants and disruptive technologies.
Yellow Corp. is confident that its restructuring efforts will enable it to navigate these challenges and emerge stronger in the years ahead.
