Chicago, Illinois - First Chicago NBD Corp, one of the largest banks in the Midwest, is expecting to close more retail branches due to the increasing trend of customers preferring electronic banking channels or banking at supermarkets.
The closure of more branches comes after the bank closed 36 retail branches in the past year, citing the shift towards digital banking. In the first half of 2021, the bank saw an increase in mobile banking by 23%, while online banking accounted for 14.5% of deposits, compared to only 9.8% in the same period last year.
At the same time, the bank's customers are also increasingly turning to supermarkets for their banking needs, especially during the pandemic when many bank branches were closed or had limited hours. The bank has partnered with supermarkets to offer online banking services, which customers can access through the supermarket's website or mobile app.
"We have been closely monitoring our customer behavior and the advancements in technology that make banking more accessible and convenient for our customers," said James Hartmann, First Chicago NBD Corp's Chief Operating Officer. "As more customers turn to mobile and online banking channels, we have to adapt to meet their needs and expectations."
The bank has been investing heavily in improving its digital banking platforms. In the past year, the bank has launched a new mobile banking app, introduced a virtual assistant, and added new features to its website to make online banking more user-friendly.
Despite the shift towards digital banking, the bank says it is committed to maintaining a physical presence in the communities it serves. The bank plans to retain its branch network in key markets, where it has the highest concentration of customers and the most opportunity for growth. However, the bank says it may close some branches in areas where there is low foot traffic or where customers are less likely to visit a physical branch.
The bank's decision to close more branches is in line with a trend that has been observed across the banking industry. Many banks are reducing their physical presence as customers increasingly bank online or through mobile apps. In the past year, major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo have all closed branches across the country.
Overall, the shift towards digital banking is expected to continue as customers become more comfortable with using online and mobile channels for their banking needs. While this will lead to the closure of more bank branches, it also presents an opportunity for banks to improve their digital offerings and provide more value to customers who prefer to bank electronically.
