Intuit, the California-based financial software company, has officially launched BankNOW on America Online. The digital banking platform will provide Intuit's small business customers with faster access to loans and lines of credit, in association with major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citibank.
Intuit's stance on providing better support for small businesses in the wake of the pandemic brought about the creation of BankNOW. With its integration into the leading US internet service provider, America Online, Intuit's easy-to-use digital banking platform will be accessible to over 20 million AOL customers.
The process of obtaining a loan has been streamlined, making it much faster and more accessible for small businesses. BankNOW is designed to make loans available in as little as one business day after approval, and a decision can be made by the banks within minutes.
As Chip McKinley, Intuit's Chief Product Officer explains “We’ve seen how harder it is for small business to get the funding they need, especially in these uncertain economic times, and it’s important to help them find capital quickly and reliably.”
Moreover, the digital banking platform can deliver real-time insights and sophisticated technology to small business owners, which allows them greater control over their finances and enables them to make quick decisions, essential to competing in today's marketplace. 
In association with Intuit, the major banks have signed onto the venture to offer small businesses more financing options and provide quick loans. Customer data is protected while using the platform thanks to Intuit's sophisticated security systems.
The timing of the launch couldn't have been better due to the current economic crisis, providing small businesses with easier access to the much-needed capital at the right time. As such, BankNOW has been eagerly anticipated, not only by small businesses but also by investors, as Intuit sets its sights on becoming a major player in the fintech space.
