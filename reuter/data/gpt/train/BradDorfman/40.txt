The Caterpillar Inc. Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Andrew Bonfield, has steadfastly defended the company's decision to increase its inventory levels, saying it was necessary to meet the growing demand for construction equipment in the face of global supply chain disruptions.
Bonfield made the remarks on Thursday during an interview with CNBC, where he also announced plans to boost the company's research and development (R&D) spending to fuel growth in the future.
"Over the last six months, we've seen demand increase significantly around the world for construction and mining equipment, which has been driven by infrastructure projects and the need to replace aging fleets," Bonfield said. "However, the supply chain has been severely disrupted by a shortage of key components, such as semiconductors and steel, which has made it difficult to meet this increased demand."
Bonfield emphasized that raising inventory levels was a strategic move to ensure the company can continue to meet customer demand during this disruption.
"We've increased our inventory levels to meet the demand and protect our production capabilities. We're doing everything we can to ensure we can continue to deliver quality products to our customers," he said.
He acknowledged that this approach may not be ideal for all investors but insisted that the inventory levels were well managed and within prudent levels.
"We understand some investors may not like the increase in inventory levels, but it's important to ensure that our customers are not left waiting for equipment. It's crucial that we maintain our customer relationships," Bonfield said.
While reassuring investors, Bonfield also announced that Caterpillar plans to boost its research and development spending by 28% over the next three years, investing in new technologies, electric power options, digital and autonomous solutions to meet the changing needs of its customers.
"We're investing in R&D to create new products and technologies, but also to develop the skills and capabilities required to produce them. We want to change the game in the industry and stay ahead of the competition," he said.
Caterpillar has been on a positive trajectory for the last few months, posting impressive earnings growth in 2021 due to the global economic recovery, rising demand for construction equipment, and ongoing cost-cutting measures.
The company's share price surged 2.5% following the announcement, indicating that investors are receptive to the company's plans for increased inventory and R&D spending.
As the construction industry continues to thrive, Bonfield and Caterpillar's efforts to remain competitive, meet customer needs, and push the industry forward are critical for the company's future success.
