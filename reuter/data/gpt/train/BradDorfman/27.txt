Mercantile Bancorp Inc. has acquired Roosevelt Financial Group Inc. in a $1 billion deal to become the largest bank in Missouri.
The deal, which was announced on Friday, marks yet another consolidation in the banking industry. Mercantile Bancorp Inc. is the parent company of Mercantile Bank, while Roosevelt Financial Group Inc. is the parent company of Union Bank.
The two banks have a strong and complementary presence in Missouri. Mercantile Bank is based in St. Louis and has over 100 branches throughout the state. Union Bank, on the other hand, is based in Kansas City and has over 50 branches in Missouri.
The acquisition will help Mercantile Bank expand its presence in Kansas City and other parts of Missouri where Union Bank has a strong presence. It will also enable the bank to enhance its product and service offerings to its customers.
According to Michael S. Price, president and CEO of Mercantile Bancorp Inc., the acquisition is a strategic move that will benefit both banks and their customers.
“By acquiring Roosevelt Financial Group Inc., we will be able to expand our presence in Missouri and enhance our product and service offerings to our customers,” said Price. “We are excited about the possibilities that this acquisition presents and look forward to working with Union Bank to integrate our operations and work together to build a stronger, more competitive bank.”
The acquisition will also result in operational synergies and cost savings for both banks. According to a joint statement released by the two banks, the acquisition is expected to generate pre-tax cost savings of approximately $30 million per year by 2023.
The deal has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Mercantile Bancorp Inc. was advised by Goldman Sachs and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. Roosevelt Financial Group Inc. was advised by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
The acquisition is the latest in a string of consolidation moves in the banking industry. In recent years, many banks have been merging to gain scale and expand their geographic reach. This has been driven by factors such as increasing competition from fintech companies, low interest rates, and the need to invest in technology to stay competitive.
The consolidation trend is likely to continue as banks seek to remain competitive in an increasingly digital world. However, there are also concerns about the impact of consolidation on consumers, particularly in terms of reduced competition and higher fees.
In response to these concerns, regulators have become more vigilant in ensuring that consolidation does not harm consumers. They have also encouraged smaller banks to merge to gain scale and compete more effectively with larger banks.
