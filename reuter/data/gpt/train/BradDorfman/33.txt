The North American International Auto Show, held annually in Detroit, Michigan, is one of the biggest events in the automotive industry. This year, it was no different, as two of the biggest names in American auto manufacturing, Chrysler and Ford, unveiled their latest SUV models to great fanfare and excitement.
Chrysler, part of the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) group, introduced the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The Grand Cherokee has been a popular vehicle among consumers for over 25 years, and the latest model promises to build on that legacy. The new Grand Cherokee is packed with features and upgrades that are sure to appeal to a wide range of buyers.
For starters, the exterior of the 2019 Grand Cherokee has been given a facelift. The grille and headlamps are more aggressive and sleek, giving the vehicle a more stylish and modern look. The new model is also longer than its predecessor, which translates to more interior space for passengers and cargo.
Under the hood, the 2019 Grand Cherokee is powered by either a 3.6-liter V6 engine or a 5.7-liter V8 engine. Both engines provide ample power, with the V8 engine delivering up to 360 horsepower. The new Grand Cherokee also features an eight-speed automatic transmission and a start-stop system that helps to conserve fuel.
Inside the cabin, the Grand Cherokee is just as impressive. The dashboard has been redesigned, and there is a new infotainment system that is both intuitive and easy to use. The vehicle also has a host of safety features, including blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and automatic emergency braking.
Reacting to the launch, Mike Manley, CEO of Jeep, said, "The Jeep Grand Cherokee is the most awarded SUV ever and the vehicle that has long defined what a premium SUV should be. We are confident that the new 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee will continue this tradition."
Not to be outdone, Ford Motor Company also unveiled a new SUV at the North American International Auto Show. The 2019 Ford Edge is a midsize crossover vehicle that Ford hopes will compete head-to-head with other popular SUVs like the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4.
The new Edge features a sleeker, more athletic design that is sure to turn heads. Under the hood, the vehicle is powered by a standard 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine that delivers up to 250 horsepower. There is also an optional 2.7-liter EcoBoost engine that provides even more power, with up to 335 horsepower.
One of the standout features of the 2019 Edge is its safety technology. The vehicle comes equipped with Ford's Co-Pilot360 suite of driver-assist technologies, which includes automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, and lane departure warning.
"The new Edge is our most advanced SUV ever," said Jim Farley, executive vice president and president, global markets, Ford Motor Company. "It is packed with technology that makes life easier, and it's gorgeous too. It's something that we are all very proud of."
Both the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee and the 2019 Ford Edge are expected to go on sale later this year. These new models are sure to be popular among consumers who are looking for a reliable and stylish SUV that is packed with features and advanced technology.
Beyond the excitement of these unveilings, the North American International Auto Show was also a platform for industry-wide discussion about the future of the automotive industry. Experts predict that trends like electric and autonomous vehicles will continue to grow, and that automakers will need to adapt in order to stay competitive.
"Automotive brands of all kinds are talking about changing business models, changing how they interact with customers, and how they create new revenue streams," said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader. "The reality of the industry is changing, and most of the manufacturers are aware of it and are looking at ways to capitalize on that." 
Overall, the North American International Auto Show once again proved to be a showcase for exciting new vehicles and innovative technology. As the automotive industry continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to see what future auto shows will bring and what new trends and technologies will emerge.
