Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc. CFO denies takeover rumors, reaffirms commitment to shareholders
Rawlings Sporting Goods, Inc.'s CFO, John Cashman, denied takeover rumors on Monday and reaffirmed the company's commitment to its shareholders.
The company's shares jumped last week after it was reported that New Balance, which owns a stake in Rawlings, was exploring a sale of the company. However, Cashman said in a statement that there is no truth to the reports.
"Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc. is not for sale and we are not engaged in any discussions that would lead to a sale," Cashman said.
Rawlings, famous for its baseball gloves and balls, was acquired by Newell Brands Inc in 2016 and then sold to private equity firm Seidler Equity Partners in 2018. New Balance owns a minority stake in Rawlings, which has about 1,100 employees.
Cashman reaffirmed the company's commitment to its shareholders, stating that Rawlings continues to invest in its business and products.
"We remain committed to our strategy of building Rawlings into the world's premier sports equipment brand and doing what is best for our shareholders, customers and employees," he said.
Rawlings has been expanding its product line and distribution channels in recent years. In 2019, the company introduced a line of performance apparel and accessories and launched a direct-to-consumer website.
The company also entered into a partnership with the Korean baseball league to become the exclusive supplier of baseballs for the league.
Rawlings has faced some challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the cancellation of sports events and a decrease in demand for sports equipment. However, the company has adapted by focusing on e-commerce and taking measures to ensure the safety of its employees.
"We are confident in our ability to navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic, and we remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders and building Rawlings into an even stronger company," Cashman said.
Rawlings' shares closed at $12.15 per share on Monday, down slightly from last week's high but still up from its pre-rumor level of around $10 per share.
