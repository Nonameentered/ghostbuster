The U.S. holiday shopping season has come to a close, and retailers have reported mixed sales results for December. Some stores saw record-breaking sales, while others struggled to meet expectations.
Online sales were particularly strong this year, with e-commerce giant Amazon reporting its "biggest holiday season to date." Other retailers, such as Walmart and Target, benefited from their increased investments in online sales options, such as curbside pickup and same-day delivery.
However, brick-and-mortar stores faced a tougher time. Foot traffic was down in many malls and department stores, leading to lower sales numbers. Stores that typically cater to holiday shoppers, such as toy and specialty gift shops, were hit the hardest.
Despite the challenges, some stores managed to come out on top. Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus saw a 4.6% increase in sales during the holiday season, boosted by strong sales in jewelry and beauty products. Costco also reported strong sales, with a 9.2% increase compared to the same period last year.
Overall, the results paint a mixed picture for retailers. Increased investments in online sales options appear to have paid off, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores faced difficulties in attracting customers. It remains to be seen what impact this will have on the industry in 2021.
