Jardine Fleming Escapes Further Sanctions After Scandal; Business as Usual  
Jardine Fleming, one of the leading global financial firms, has escaped further sanctions after it was found guilty of paying bribes to officials in a number of countries in Asia. The company's management team, led by CEO Michael Smith, has succeeded in persuading regulators that the firm has taken sufficient action to address the scandal, which was made public in 2012.
The San Francisco-based firm was rocked by the scandal, which saw it paying millions of dollars in bribes to officials in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. The bribes were reportedly paid in order to win business and gain access to sensitive information. The company's reputation was damaged by the scandal, and it faced the possibility of being barred from operating in certain countries.
However, in a statement released yesterday, the company's management team said that it had taken "decisive action" to address the scandal, including firing employees implicated in the bribes and introducing new anti-corruption policies. The statement added that the company had cooperated fully with regulators and had made "significant progress" in addressing the issues raised by the scandal.
Regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, have agreed that the company has taken appropriate action and have declined to impose further sanctions on Jardine Fleming. The company has also agreed to pay a $2.5m penalty to settle charges related to the scandal.
The announcement has been welcomed by investors, who had been concerned that the scandal would damage the company's long-term reputation and impact its ability to do business in Asia. Shares in Jardine Fleming rose 3.5% following the announcement yesterday.
"It's good news for the company and for investors," said Frank Hackett, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "The market has responded positively to the news that Jardine Fleming has taken appropriate action to address the scandal, and investors are now more confident about the company's future prospects in Asia."
However, some critics have argued that Jardine Fleming has escaped lightly and that the company should have faced more severe sanctions for its involvement in the bribery scandal. "The penalties imposed on Jardine Fleming are a slap on the wrist," said John Smith, a spokesman for anti-corruption group Transparency International.
Despite these criticisms, Jardine Fleming is now free to continue doing business in Asia, and the company's management team will be hoping that the scandal is now firmly behind them.
