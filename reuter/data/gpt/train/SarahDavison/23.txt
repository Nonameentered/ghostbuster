As Hong Kong inches closer towards the 24th anniversary of its handover to China, concerns are mounting about the city’s skyrocketing property and stock prices. With record-high home prices and a surging stock market, experts warn that Hong Kong’s economy may be in danger of overheating, just as it enters a new era of Chinese sovereignty.
According to data released by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city’s property prices have risen unabated for the past few months, with the average price per square foot reaching an all-time high of HKD 18,185 (USD 2,343) in May. Meanwhile, the city’s stock market has also been on a winning streak, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index surging to pre-pandemic levels and reaching new heights in June.
These developments have sparked worries about a potential housing and stock market bubble in Hong Kong, with some analysts warning that the city could be headed for an economic downturn. The concern is that if property and stock prices continue to inflate unchecked, it may become increasingly difficult for ordinary residents to afford housing or invest in the stock market, resulting in a growing wealth gap and social unrest.
The situation is not helped by Hong Kong’s already sky-high housing prices, which have long been a contentious issue in the city. Despite measures by the government to curb speculation and increase housing supply, prices have remained stubbornly high, with the city ranking among the world’s least affordable housing markets. With the recent surge in prices, the situation looks set to worsen, particularly for lower-income residents who may find it increasingly difficult to afford even a small apartment.
The stock market, too, is a source of concern, with fears that it may be overheating after a year of pandemic-driven volatility. The Hang Seng Index, which tracks the performance of nearly 200 companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, has surged by more than 17% this year, reaching a seven-month high of 29,476 points in June. While some experts see this as a sign of Hong Kong’s economic recovery, others warn that it may be a bubble waiting to burst.
Adding to the uncertainty is the impending return of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong. While the handover in 1997 was supposed to guarantee the city’s autonomy and way of life for 50 years, critics argue that China has been tightening its grip on Hong Kong since the 2014 pro-democracy protests. The recent crackdown on dissent, including the imposition of a draconian national security law, has fuelled concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong’s freedoms and autonomy.
This has led some observers to question whether the current economic boom in Hong Kong is sustainable, given the increasing political and economic influence of China. With Beijing signalling its intent to take a more assertive stance towards Hong Kong, including by imposing sweeping national security legislation, there are fears that the city may become less attractive to foreign investors and businesses.
The rising property and stock prices are also raising concerns about the growing inequality in Hong Kong. While the city is home to some of the world’s richest people, it also has one of the highest levels of income inequality. The soaring housing prices are exacerbating this problem, with many young people and low-income families struggling to afford even basic accommodation. The stock market boom is similarly benefiting the wealthy more than the average citizen, raising questions about the fairness of Hong Kong’s economic system.
To address these concerns, experts are calling for a more comprehensive and long-term strategy to tackle the housing and wealth inequality in Hong Kong. This includes measures to increase the supply of affordable housing, reform the tax system to reduce income inequality, and promote greater transparency and accountability in the financial sector.
The government has already taken some steps to address the housing problem, including by launching a public housing programme and imposing a vacancy tax on developers who hoard land. However, critics argue that these measures are not enough to address the root causes of the problem, which include a lack of competition in the housing market and a skewed tax system that favours the wealthy.
As Hong Kong prepares to mark its 24th year under Chinese rule, the rising property and stock prices are a reminder that the city’s future is far from certain. While the economic boom may be a cause for celebration in the short term, the long-term sustainability and fairness of Hong Kong’s economic system remain in question. With China asserting its influence over the city, and the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to wreak havoc across the globe, Hong Kong’s challenges are far from over.
