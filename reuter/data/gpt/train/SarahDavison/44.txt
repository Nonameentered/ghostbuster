In the last few years, Hong Kong has become one of the most celebrated cities as far as the global economy is concerned. With steady economic growth and a highly skilled labor force, it's no wonder that bankers from all corners of the world have praised Hong Kong and its leadership. 
Despite Hong Kong's great economic progress, there appears to be growing tensions between Britain and China over the issue of democracy as the city's handover from Britain to China is fast approaching. The World Bank has since lauded Hong Kong's success and has urged officials to maintain the momentum to ensure further economic development as it moves closer to the transition period. 
Speaking to journalists at a conference in Hong Kong, the President of the International Monetary Fund, (IMF) Christine Lagarde, praised Hong Kong's economy, stating that it was one of the most competitive economies in the world. Lagarde also singled out the city's business-friendly behavior as one of the key factors that had seen it rise to become a global economic powerhouse.  
Lagarde's words echoed those of other bankers who praised Hong Kong's economy, which has remained robust despite the global political and economic landscape becoming increasingly complex. With high employment rates, low corruption, and a stable financial sector, it's clear that the city has a lot to offer and is determined to continue maintaining its growth path. 
Only time will tell whether or not Hong Kong will continue to flourish economically after the handover. This is because tensions are running high as Britain and China continue to clash - this time over the issue of democracy.  As Hong Kong transitions, many believe that the city is at a critical point, and how its governance is managed will have a significant impact on its economy and future prospects.
In a recent statement, the British Government called out the Chinese Administration for its lack of political transparency in Hong Kong. The UK officials stated that China had systematically bullied pro-democracy campaigners and other opposition voices. The statement also accused China of flouting the terms of the 1984 agreement that was signed between the two powers, which allowed Hong Kong to remain autonomous from the Chinese Mainland. 
China, on the other hand, has dismissed the recent claims and has accused the UK of trying to interfere with the city's affairs. This issue has highlighted what is a sensitive issue for China, considering that Hong Kong was under British rule for more than 150 years. 
With renewed efforts by the British Government to protect and promote human rights globally, tensions have escalated; however, experts believe such divisions could hurt economic development and harm all parties involved. 
The past few months have seen clashes between protesters and the Hong Kong Police over various issues, including what protesters say is the erosion of democracy in the city. Hong Kong's once vibrant protest movement has seen a decrease in enthusiasm due to a raft of arrests and other measures taken by the police in recent times. 
At the heart of this issue is the concern held by many young people who fear that their future opportunities in the city will be limited by China's increased stranglehold on the territory. With China clamping down on Hong Kong over the past few years, this has led to an increasingly polarized society that has seen the rise of independence groups.
Many believe that this problem has the potential to derail Hong Kong's growth and prosperity if not addressed through diplomatic means. The world is watching as Britain and China grapple over the issue, with experts urging authorities to find a sustainable solution that will guarantee Hong Kong's future and prevent any further losses to the economy. 
In conclusion, Hong Kong's success story is something to be celebrated globally, and bankers have praised the city's achievements in recent years. However, tensions between Britain and China over the issue of democracy in the city serves as a warning to all parties. These divisions could potentially cause harm to the economy if not resolved through peaceful means promptly. The world is watching as Hong Kong transitions, and political decisions made by authorities will significantly impact the city's economy and its future prospects.
