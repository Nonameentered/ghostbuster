Thailand's efforts to boost market confidence with tougher finance sector rules have received mixed reviews from experts.
The new rules, which were announced by the government earlier this year, aim to strengthen the finance sector and prevent irregularities. Among the regulations are stricter requirements for banks and other financial institutions to report their financial statements, as well as requirements for professionals in the sector to undergo training and obtain licenses.
The move comes after a series of high-profile scandals in the country's finance sector, including the collapse of a major bank and allegations of fraud and corruption at several others.
Some experts have praised the government's efforts, saying that the new regulations are a step in the right direction towards improving transparency and accountability in the finance sector.
"The new rules are a positive development. They will help to deter irregularities and improve the overall integrity of the finance sector," said Somsak Tanruengsri, an economist at the University of Bangkok.
However, others have expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the new regulations, arguing that they may not go far enough to address the underlying problems in the finance sector.
"There is still much work to be done to address the root causes of the problems in Thailand's finance sector. The new rules are a good start, but they may not be enough on their own," said Prasart Pongsivapai, a finance expert at Chulalongkorn University.
Critics have also raised concerns about potentially negative effects of the new regulations on the country's economy. Some worry that the stricter reporting requirements and licensing rules may discourage foreign investment and hinder economic growth.
"The new regulations could be seen as overbearing by some foreign investors, and may dissuade them from investing in Thailand's finance sector. This may have negative implications for the broader economy," said Thitapha Soontornwipast, an economist at Kasikorn Research Center.
Despite these concerns, the government has remained committed to implementing the new regulations, arguing that they are necessary to improve the country's financial stability and prevent future crises in the sector.
"We believe that these new regulations will help to improve the safety and soundness of the finance sector, which is critical for the health of the broader economy," said Arkom Termpittayapaisith, Thailand's finance minister.
The government has also emphasized the importance of working with financial institutions to ensure that they are able to comply with the new regulations in a timely and efficient manner.
"Collaboration with the private sector is critical to the successful implementation of these regulations. We will work closely with financial institutions to provide support and guidance as they adjust to the new requirements," Termpittayapaisith added.
As Thailand moves forward with its efforts to strengthen the finance sector, experts say that it will be important to strike a balance between improving transparency and accountability while also fostering economic growth and stability.
"Ultimately, the success of these new regulations will depend on how effectively they are implemented and enforced. It will also require a broader effort to address the underlying challenges facing the finance sector, such as corruption and weak corporate governance," said Pongsivapai.
With mixed reviews on the government's efforts, it is still too early to determine the real impact of these new measures on Thailand's finance sector. Nevertheless, the government remains positive in its view that these measures will ultimately promote further economic stability while shaping a more honest and transparent society.
