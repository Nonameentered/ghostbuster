As Hong Kong prepares to mark the 24th anniversary of its handover from Britain to China, the fate of tens of thousands of Filipina domestic workers employed in the city remains uncertain.
Close to 400,000 foreign domestic helpers work in Hong Kong, with Filipinos comprising the largest group at approximately 200,000. Filipina domestic workers have been an integral part of Hong Kong society for more than four decades, and their employment helps support families back home.
However, with Beijing tightening its grip on Hong Kong and the recent implementation of the National Security Law, Filipina domestic workers are worried about their future in the city.
According to rights groups and labour activists, there has been an increase in reported cases of abuse and discrimination against foreign domestic helpers since the implementation of the security law last year.
Hong Kong's national security law criminalises acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
In an interview with Al Jazeera, Dolores Balladares, chair of the United Filipinos in Hong Kong, said she is concerned about the erosion of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong and how it will affect the Filipino community, including domestic helpers.
"The rights of foreign domestic workers are not protected under Hong Kong laws, and it's even more challenging now with the national security law," she said.
"As Beijing tightens its grip, there is more oppression and suppression of expression and dissent, and the impact could be more severe for foreign domestic workers."
Balladares added that under the security law, foreign domestic workers could be targeted if they are accused of "collaborating with or assisting foreign forces" - a vague and broad term used in the legislation.
Moreover, the city's immigration department has been taking a tough stance on visa and work permit applications by foreign domestic helpers, leading to many being denied the right to work in Hong Kong.
Melisa Roxas, a Filipina domestic worker in Hong Kong, was recently denied a work permit extension due to what immigration officials claimed was "insufficient salary" despite her employer meeting the city's minimum wage requirements.
"The Hong Kong government does not see foreign domestic helpers as workers, but rather as temporary migrants who can be easily replaced, and this makes us more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation," Roxas said.
Indeed, many Filipina domestic workers have experienced abuse and exploitation by their employers, from long working hours and inadequate living conditions to sexual harassment and physical abuse.
In 2019, a survey conducted by the Mission for Migrant Workers found that one in three domestic helpers in Hong Kong had experienced physical abuse, while one in six had been sexually abused.
Despite these challenges, Filipina domestic workers continue to provide vital services to Hong Kong families, taking care of children, the elderly, and households with little or no governmental protection.
Dolores Balladares said that despite this contribution, domestic helpers often face discrimination and prejudices from the wider community and need more support.
"We need better laws to protect domestic workers, including a minimum wage and standard working conditions, as well as cultural training to understand the rights and roles of domestic helpers in Hong Kong," she said.
As the political situation in Hong Kong remains uncertain, there are growing calls to ensure that the rights and freedoms of foreign domestic workers are protected.
On Wednesday, a coalition of international human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, wrote to Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, calling for an end to discriminatory policies against foreign domestic workers and an urgent review of recently rejected visa applications.
The groups also urged the Hong Kong government to engage with domestic workers' rights groups and ensure that their voices are heard in the policymaking process.
In response to these concerns, the Hong Kong government issued a statement on Thursday, reaffirming its commitment to upholding the rights of foreign domestic helpers.
"The Hong Kong government will continue to maintain a level playing field for both foreign domestic helpers and their employers, providing necessary support in terms of labour rights and welfare protection, so that they can work and live in Hong Kong with peaceful and harmonious coexistence," the statement read.
However, with Beijing's influence in the city growing, there are doubts about how much the Hong Kong government's assurances will mean for Filipina domestic workers.
According to Balladares, Filipina domestic workers need more than just words - they need concrete actions to ensure their rights are protected, now and in the future.
"We need assurance from both the Hong Kong and Philippine governments that the rights of domestic workers will be upheld, and there will be no discrimination or exploitation," she said.
"The world is watching, and we hope that our voices are heard and our concerns addressed."
