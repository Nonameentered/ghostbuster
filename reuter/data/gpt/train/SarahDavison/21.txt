California's pension funds have set their sights on Asia as potential long-term investment opportunities. Despite the ongoing trade war between the US and China, the strategic location and potential economic growth in the region, as well as its increasing middle class, are seen as valuable factors for investment.
In a statement released by California's State Treasurer Fiona Ma, she highlighted the importance of diversifying the funds' investments, stating that "we have to invest in strategic assets that appreciate over time, and that includes investing in Asia." Ma added that the treasurer's office had planned to visit China this year to seek out potential investment opportunities, emphasizing the importance of "engaging in meaningful dialogue to further our economic interests."
The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) is one of the state's key pension funds, with assets exceeding $336 billion. CalPERS' investment committee has been exploring opportunities in Asia, with a potential focus on infrastructure investments, specifically the "Belt and Road Initiative." The initiative, which aims to create a network of transportation and logistics infrastructure connecting China with Europe and Asia, has been a high priority for the Chinese government. CalPERS sees the initiative as an opportunity to invest in areas such as energy, transportation, and telecommunications.
CalPERS' Asia portfolio is already valued at $70 billion, with investments in China accounting for approximately $19 billion. The fund has also invested approximately $4 billion in India and $2 billion in Japan. Despite the ongoing trade dispute, CalPERS continues to view Asia as a key area for investment. "Our investment strategy is long term, and we believe that Asia will be critical to our continued growth," said Marcie Frost, CalPERS' CEO.
The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) is also looking to invest more in Asia. The fund recently announced that it aims to increase its exposure to China by investing up to $3.8 billion in Chinese equities over the next three years. The move is part of a broader push by the fund to increase its overall exposure to emerging markets, where it currently has a low allocation of less than 10%.
CalSTRS' head of global equity, Kirsty Jenkinson, said that China is a "growth market", and "you can't ignore China". The fund has also invested in India, Japan, and Southeast Asia, with a focus on sectors such as technology, healthcare, and consumer goods.
The California State Treasurer's office has been actively promoting California as a destination for foreign direct investment, and the state has already established strong ties with many Asian countries. "We are already working with major Asian corporations such as Samsung and LG, and we continue to explore ways to attract more investment into California," said Treasurer Ma.
Investors in California and other parts of the US have also been attracted to Singapore, which has become an increasingly popular destination for investment. Singapore is known for its stable political and economic climate, as well as its strong infrastructure and well-educated workforce. In addition, the country has been encouraging infrastructure investment, particularly its Changi Airport expansion and port development.
With a growing middle class, economic stability, and a strategic location connecting Asia with Europe, Asia is a valuable target for long-term investment. Despite the ongoing trade war and geopolitical uncertainties, California's pension funds appear to be taking a measured approach towards investment in the region, seeking out opportunities that align with their investment strategies and long-term goals. As Treasurer Ma stated, "we need to be patient and strategic, but I believe that working with our Asian partners, we can create mutually beneficial investment opportunities that will strengthen our economies for years to come."
