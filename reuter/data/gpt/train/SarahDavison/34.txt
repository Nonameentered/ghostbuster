Asian Fund Managers See Stock Market Volatility on Rumours of Deng Xiaoping's Ill-Health as Ideal Buying Opportunity
Asian fund managers are heeding the advice of Deng Xiaoping, one of China's leading political figures, who famously once said, "In chaos, there is opportunity." As rumours have emerged about Deng Xiaoping's ill-health and potential political upheaval, Asian fund managers see this as an opportunity to invest in Chinese stocks.
With uncertainty causing stock market volatility, some fund managers are taking advantage of this unusual market situation. Despite the reports of a market downturn, many Asian fund managers believe that the market is undervalued. The rumours about Deng Xiaoping may have caused some instability in the short term, but they present an opportunity for investors to buy stocks at a lower price.
The Chinese stock market has experienced a slump in recent weeks, as investors sell off due to concerns about the economic impact of the Coronavirus outbreak. But since rumours began circulating about Deng Xiaoping's ill-health, shares have been even more volatile.
Investors who have remained optimistic about China's long-term prospects are taking advantage of these fluctuations with the goal of buying stocks at lower prices. Fund managers who have judged the outlook for the Chinese economy to be strong say that they are seeking valuations that have been made more attractive by volatility.
In an interview with a reporter, Wei Li, head of iShares Asia Pacific Investment Strategy, BlackRock said, "Market weakness due to rumours or events is an opportunity for patient long-term investors, especially when the underlying economy is strong and fundamentals are supportive."
Despite the uncertainty caused by the rumours, most fund managers believe that any potential impact on China's economy is unlikely to be severe. In fact, some even see potential positive outcomes from the present situation.
Analysts believe that in the short-term, the Chinese government will need to support the market in order to prevent a slide, similar to the situation they faced during the 2014-2015 downturn in China. The government will likely increase stimulus measures to support the market, such as cutting interest rates and reducing the reserve requirement ratio for banks.
As economic growth slows down across the globe, China's economy is still growing at a steady pace, far outpacing other major economies around the world. During difficult times when uncertainty prevails in the market, investors have the tendency to look for opportunities to invest in solid companies that have good growth potential. China, as one of the largest economies in the world, is a logical candidate for investors who seek long-term returns from the stock market.
The volatility of the Chinese stock market has presented an opportunity for investors to invest in companies that have strong fundamentals. The growth story for China is still intact and the current scenario presents a perfect opportunity for investors to invest in Chinese companies that have a stable revenue stream and good growth prospects. 
In conclusion, the rumours about Deng Xiaoping have caused investors to be cautious about the market in the short term, but they have also presented a unique opportunity for long-term investors. Fund managers who have a positive view on China's economy and who have a long-term investment horizon, see the recent volatility as a perfect opportunity to invest in companies with potential to give solid returns.
 
One thing is certain, those fund managers who have heeded the advice of Deng Xiaoping, and see the opportunities in chaos, could potentially reap the rewards with their investments.
