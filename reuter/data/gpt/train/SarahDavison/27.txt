Hong Kong is bracing itself for another Lunar New Year celebration in the midst of escalating political tensions. With the recent crackdown on pro-democracy activists and increased Chinese influence over the city, many wonder how the festivities will be affected.
Traditionally, the Lunar New Year is marked by colorful parades, fireworks, and visits to family and friends. However, this year’s celebrations will undoubtedly be overshadowed by the ongoing political turmoil. The tensions have been intensifying since the national security law was implemented last year, allowing Chinese authorities to crack down on dissent and further erode the autonomy of the city.
Last year, the protests that had consumed Hong Kong for months came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this year, activists are anticipating that they’ll have increased opportunities to voice their opposition to the Chinese government. In the days leading up to the Lunar New Year, a “yellow economic circle” campaign calling for citizens to support pro-democracy businesses will be launched. The campaign urges locals to boycott pro-Beijing businesses and support those that are sympathetic to the pro-democracy movement.
Furthermore, the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions has called for a strike on the first day of the Lunar New Year to protest against the arrests of activists and the government’s suppression of civil liberties. The strike would coincide with the annual che kung festivals, where locals typically visit temples to seek good luck and fortune for the year ahead.
The political tensions have also affected the traditional celebrations. Some activists have called for a boycott of the fireworks displays, which have been sponsored by pro-Beijing companies. Meanwhile, the government has canceled the annual flower markets due to concerns over COVID-19, depriving families of a beloved tradition.
Despite the challenges, some people are determined to celebrate the Lunar New Year with their loved ones. 34-year-old office worker, Michael Wong, said, “I know there is a lot of political tension and uncertainty, but I still want to celebrate this important festival with my family. It’s a time to come together and show love and support for one another, regardless of our differences.”
The government has also emphasized the importance of the Lunar New Year, encouraging locals to celebrate the festival and support businesses during these difficult times. The Hong Kong Tourism Board has launched a campaign to attract visitors to the city, highlighting the festivities and culinary delights that the city has to offer.
As the Lunar New Year approaches, it remains to be seen how the political tensions will play out. While some are calling for peaceful protests and boycotts, others are determined to celebrate the holiday with their family and friends. The situation has cast a shadow on the festivities, but the spirit of the Ox – which is said to represent diligence, honesty, and determination – may serve as a source of inspiration for Hong Kong residents during these uncertain times.
