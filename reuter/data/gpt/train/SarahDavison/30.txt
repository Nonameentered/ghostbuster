As the population of Hong Kong ages and retirements loom, the government has been developing public pension plans to provide a safety net for the elderly. This has created a new market that Hong Kong's life insurers and fund managers are vying to get a slice of.
The need for public pension provisions has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many people taking early retirement, turning to a second career, or moving into smaller apartments for lifestyle changes. These shifts in consumer behavior have sparked an uptick in demand for proper retirement planning services.
Hong Kong's public pension plan, otherwise known as the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), has grown significantly in the last decade, and the trend is set to continue as people seek medical or long-term care services. This has resulted in an expected increase in MPF assets to HKD 1.06 trillion by 2028, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
The growth of MPF assets has captured the interest of Hong Kong's life insurers and fund managers, who see the market as a lucrative one for their businesses. In recent years, a number of new firms have entered the market with specific retirement planning products. This has created significant competition in the industry and has led to a rise in commissions, with some firms offering up to 50% of the premium paid by clients.
Currently, the MPF program is mandatory, meaning that every employed Hong Kong citizen is automatically enrolled in the program. Both the employer and employee contribute a percentage of the employee's salary to the fund, which they can access upon retirement. However, this mandatory system has its challenges, as self-employed persons and those who are not part of the workforce are not covered by the MPF program. This has created room for insurance companies to offer supplementary retirement products to these groups.
The Hong Kong Federation of Insurers (HKFI) has already proposed a retirement savings scheme that would target those who are self-employed or who have no access to the MPF program. The scheme would offer tax deductions and benefits to consumers, with the HKFI working alongside other stakeholders to design the framework. This could provide an option for those who are not covered, and also offer a better retirement income for those who are not confident in their MPF investments.
Another area that fund managers are looking at is the Managed Portfolio Investment Scheme (MPIS) under the MPF program. The MPIS is a separate investment portfolio that allows fund managers to offer customized investment portfolios for individual clients, with the client choosing the amount of risk they are willing to take. Fund managers are expected to play a larger role in the MPF program in the future, with the government looking to increase regulation and transparency in the program.
As the future of the MPF program continues to develop, insurers and fund managers will play a central role in shaping the market. Some firms have already begun offering innovative products, such as health savings products or products that provide a lump sum payment upon retirement. This has created a more competitive market, with many new entrants vying for market share.
However, the MPF program is not without its challenges. Its investment returns have been criticized in the past, with lower returns compared to other investment options in the region. The government has acknowledged this and has taken steps to improve the program, such as increasing the maximum contribution level and offering more investment choices.
The recent change in the leadership of the MPF Authority has also brought a positive outlook for the future of the program. The new chief executive, Winnie Tang, has expressed her commitment to improving the investment returns of the MPF program and increasing the transparency of fund managers' fees.
The rise in demand for retirement products also provides an opportunity for insurers and fund managers to experiment with new products and services that can differentiate them from their competitors. This may include innovative products such as the use of artificial intelligence to manage investments, or new services that offer personalized retirement planning based on individual needs.
In conclusion, Hong Kong's public pension plan market has become a lucrative one for insurers and fund managers. The rise in demand for retirement planning services and the growth of the MPF program has created a competitive market, with new entrants offering specific products and services. While the MPF program still faces challenges, it presents an opportunity for insurers and fund managers to experiment with new products and services that can differentiate them from their competitors. As the government looks to increase regulation and transparency in the market, the future of the MPF program is promising, and fund managers and insurers are well-positioned to play a central role in shaping it.
