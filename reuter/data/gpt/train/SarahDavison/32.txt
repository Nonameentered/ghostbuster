Asia's rapid economic growth has come with a cost. Across the continent, countries are grappling with how to maintain currency stability in the face of high growth and inflation risks. While some governments have attempted to peg their currency to a stable benchmark, this strategy has proven challenging in practice, and experts warn it could ultimately undermine their economic progress.
The issue of pegged currencies has long been a topic of debate in Asia, where countries have often sought to pursue ambitious growth targets while also keeping inflation in check. In many cases, these goals are in tension with one another, as rapid expansion can exacerbate price pressures. Additionally, the global financial system has become increasingly complex and interconnected, making it more difficult for individual countries to manage their currency rates.
One of the most significant examples of this challenge is China, whose government has long sought to maintain a stable exchange rate with the US dollar. This strategy has involved purchasing large quantities of US debt, which in turn has helped keep Chinese exports competitive by holding down the value of the yuan. However, this policy has also led to concerns about currency manipulation and has hampered China's ability to respond to economic shocks.
Other countries in the region have also experimented with pegged currencies to varying degrees of success. For example, Hong Kong pegs its currency to the US dollar, but this policy has come under strain in recent years due to the city's growing political and economic ties with China. Malaysia and Thailand also peg their currencies to a basket of currencies, but both countries have had to grapple with uncertainty over the benchmark's composition and the difficulty of balancing growth and inflation pressures.
Despite the challenges, many policymakers in Asia continue to see pegging as a key tool for keeping their economies stable and competitive. In an interview with the Financial Times, Thai central bank governor Veerathai Santiprabhob said that a flexible exchange rate could introduce "too much volatility" and that a stable benchmark was necessary for "confidence and predictability."
However, experts warn that pegging is not a panacea for currency stability and that it could ultimately undermine long-term economic progress. In a paper published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, economist Maurice Obstfeld argued that "persistent and significant" efforts to maintain a peg could ultimately harm a country's economic resilience by promoting imbalances, distorting prices, and limiting policy flexibility.
One of the most significant risks associated with pegged currencies is the possibility of a sudden shift in market sentiment or external shocks, which could force a country to abandon its policy abruptly. For example, in 1997, the Thai baht came under pressure due to concerns about the country's high debt levels and weak financial institutions. This led to a run on the currency, which ultimately forced the government to abandon its peg and let the baht float freely. The resulting sharp depreciation of the currency triggered a regional financial crisis that had long-term social and economic consequences across Southeast Asia.
Another risk associated with pegging is the potential for imbalances to develop within an economy. If a country's currency is pegged to a benchmark that does not reflect its economic fundamentals, this can lead to distortions in the prices of goods and services. For example, if a country's benchmark currency is overvalued, this could make its exports less competitive, reducing economic growth. Conversely, if the benchmark currency is undervalued, this could encourage inflation by making imports more expensive.
Furthermore, by prioritizing currency stability over other policy objectives, governments may be limiting their ability to respond to economic shocks or pursue broader development goals. For example, some analysts argue that China's focus on maintaining a stable exchange rate has prevented it from adopting more flexible monetary policies, which could have helped reduce debt levels and boost domestic consumption.
As Asia's economies continue to grow and diversify, policymakers will need to grapple with these challenges and determine the best path forward for maintaining currency stability. While pegging may offer a short-term solution, experts warn that it could ultimately undermine long-term economic progress and resilience. Instead, governments may need to adopt more flexible monetary policies and invest in measures that promote economic diversification and resilience, such as improved education and workforce development, infrastructure investment, and support for small and medium-sized enterprises.
In the end, the perils of pegged currencies underscore the need for a balanced and nuanced approach to economic policymaking. Across Asia, policymakers will need to craft strategies that effectively balance the conflicting demands of growth, inflation, and currency stability in an increasingly complex and uncertain global environment.
