Hong Kong Business Groups Praise Deng Xiaoping, but See Limited Short-Term Impact from His Passing
The death of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on February 19, 1997, has had a profound impact not only on China but also on the world. Deng will always be remembered as one of the most influential leaders in China's modern history. His reforms revolutionized China's economy and society, transforming it from an impoverished, isolated inward-looking nation into a dynamic, prosperous, and globally connected one. Deng's death has been felt deeply in Hong Kong, where he is revered by many as a hero who delivered the territory back to China under the "one country, two systems" policy. 
Hong Kong business groups have praised Deng's legacy, but many have also acknowledged that his passing is unlikely to have a significant short-term impact on Hong Kong's economy and society. "Deng Xiaoping was a true visionary who transformed China into one of the world's major economic powers in just a few decades," said Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong-based trading company Li & Fung. "His legacy has been enormous, and he will always be remembered as the architect of China's economic reform and opening up."
Henry Keswick, chairman of Jardine Matheson Holdings, another major trading company in Hong Kong, said Deng's reforms had led to "remarkable progress" in China and had created many opportunities for Hong Kong businesses. "Deng Xiaoping's vision and determination to modernize and transform China's economy have allowed hundreds of millions of people to rise out of poverty and to enjoy a better standard of living," he said.
Other business leaders in Hong Kong have echoed these sentiments. "Deng Xiaoping's leadership and vision unleashed the entrepreneurial spirit of the Chinese people, leading to an economic miracle that Hong Kong has been a part of since the beginning," said Allan Zeman, the founder of Hong Kong's popular Lan Kwai Fong entertainment district.
Despite the immense impact and importance of Deng's economic reforms, many Hong Kong business groups are not expecting any immediate impact from his passing. "I don't think there will be any immediate impact on Hong Kong's economy or society," said Andrew Leung, president of the Hong Kong-based Industrial & Commercial Bank of China.
Leung added that he expected Hong Kong's strong economic ties with mainland China to continue, regardless of who was in power in Beijing. "Hong Kong's business community will continue to look for opportunities to invest, trade, and do business in China, which is now one of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies," he said.
However, some analysts have warned that Deng's death could have long-term implications for Hong Kong, particularly in terms of political and social stability. "Deng Xiaoping was a master of political strategy who managed to balance the different interests and factions within China's Communist Party," said Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
"I think there's a real danger that his passing could lead to more instability and factionalism within China's leadership, which in turn could have implications for Hong Kong's ability to maintain its autonomy and its unique way of life under the 'one country, two systems' policy," he added.
The passing of Deng Xiaoping has been marked by an outpouring of grief and tribute from Chinese people across the globe, and the Hong Kong business community is no exception. Deng's legacy will undoubtedly continue to shape China's future economic and political developments, and his vision and leadership will be remembered for generations to come. In the meantime, Hong Kong's business community will continue to seek opportunities to grow and thrive, regardless of the challenges and uncertainties they may face in the short and long term.
