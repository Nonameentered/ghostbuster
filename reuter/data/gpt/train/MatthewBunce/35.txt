Abidjan, Ivory Coast â€“ The government of Ivory Coast has announced that it will release its highly-anticipated study on quality and competition liberalisation by January 31. The study, which aims to assess the level of competitiveness in key sectors of the Ivorian economy, is seen as a critical step towards boosting economic growth and attracting foreign investment in the West African nation.
According to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Promotion of SMEs, the study is expected to evaluate the competitive forces shaping the country's market economy, including the level of investment, barriers to entry, and the impact of regulations and policies on the business environment.
The study will assess four major sectors of the economy, namely agriculture, manufacturing, services, and infrastructure. It will focus particularly on identifying bottlenecks and obstacles that impede competition, innovation, and entrepreneurship. The government has said that the report will provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities for companies in these sectors.
The release of the study comes after months of consultations with stakeholders in the business community, including representatives from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), trade associations, and foreign investors. The Ministry of Commerce has noted that feedback from these consultations has been used to shape the direction and scope of the study.
At a recent press briefing, the Minister of Commerce, Souleymane Diarrassouba, stated that the study is an essential tool for the government to assess how the Ivorian economy can become more competitive and dynamic. "We are committed to creating a business-friendly environment that encourages entrepreneurship, investment, and innovation, and we believe that the study will provide us with valuable insights into how to achieve these goals," he said.
The release of the study has been welcomed by the business community, with some trade bodies and investors saying that it will provide a roadmap for future investment decisions. "We are excited about the study and look forward to its release. It will give us a better understanding of the competitive landscape in Ivory Coast and how we can work with stakeholders to create a more level playing field," said Michel Abrogoua, head of the Ivorian Chamber of Commerce.
Industry experts believe that the study will highlight the need for reforms to boost innovation and competition in key sectors of the economy. For example, in the agriculture sector, where Ivory Coast is a leading producer of cocoa and coffee, the study could recommend measures to diversify production and improve the quality of output. Similarly, in the manufacturing sector, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, the study could recommend policies to encourage local production and reduce import dependency.
The government has said that it is committed to implementing the recommendations of the study, which will be used to update policies and regulations governing competition and quality standards in various sectors. However, some analysts have warned that the success of the study will ultimately depend on the political will to enact meaningful reforms.
"Releasing the study is just the beginning. The real test will be whether the government enacts reforms that address the bottlenecks and obstacles identified in the report. That will require a lot of political will and collaboration with stakeholders, but the potential benefits are enormous," said Emma Smith, an economist based in Abidjan.
In conclusion, the release of the study on quality and competition by Ivory Coast is a significant step towards boosting economic growth and attracting foreign investment in the West African nation. The report, which will evaluate the level of competitiveness in key sectors of the economy, will provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities for businesses operating in Ivory Coast. The success of the study will depend on whether the government has the political will to implement meaningful reforms to address the bottlenecks and obstacles identified in the report.
