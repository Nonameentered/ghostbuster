Chad’s foreign minister has defended the country’s policy of summarily executing alleged criminals, saying it is necessary to maintain law and order in the country.
Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mahamat Zene Cherif said that the policy was a “legitimate tool” in the fight against crime and terrorism.
“Chad is a country that is under attack from terrorists and criminals,” Cherif said. “We must take tough measures to protect our citizens and maintain peace and security.”
The comments come after a report last week by Amnesty International accused Chad of carrying out a wave of extrajudicial executions. The report claimed that 44 people were killed in the country between April and June this year after being accused of crimes such as theft and drug trafficking.
The report also alleged that the executions were carried out by security forces and that those killed were not given a fair trial or even the right to defend themselves.
Cherif dismissed the report, saying it was “unfair and biased” and did not take into account the unique circumstances that Chad is facing.
“Amnesty International is an organization that has a political agenda,” he said. “They are trying to discredit Chad and undermine our efforts to fight crime and terrorism.”
Cherif said that the executions were carried out in accordance with Chad’s laws and that the country respected the rule of law.
“We are not a lawless society,” he said. “We have a legal system that is fair and just.”
However, human rights groups have condemned the policy, saying it violates international law and undermines the rights of citizens.
“Summary execution is a gross violation of human rights and is not acceptable under any circumstances,” said Sarah Jackson, deputy regional director for Amnesty International.
“Chad must immediately stop this practice and ensure that those responsible for these extrajudicial killings are brought to justice.”
The United Nations has also raised concerns about the policy, saying that Chad has an obligation to uphold the rights of its citizens and abide by international law.
“We are deeply concerned about the reports of extrajudicial killings in Chad,” said Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
“We urge the government to ensure that all allegations of human rights abuses are thoroughly investigated and that those responsible are held accountable.”
Chad has long been plagued by violence and instability, with various armed groups operating in the country. In recent years, the government has cracked down on these groups, often using harsh tactics to maintain control.
However, critics say that the policy of summary execution only serves to further undermine the rule of law and create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.
“People are living in fear in Chad,” said Jackson. “This policy only serves to drive a wedge between the government and its citizens, and further destabilize an already fragile country.”
Despite the criticism, Cherif said that Chad would continue to use the policy of summary execution to maintain law and order.
“We will do whatever it takes to protect our citizens and maintain stability in Chad,” he said. “We are committed to fighting crime and terrorism, and we will not be deterred by the opinions of outside groups.”
