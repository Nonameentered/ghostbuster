Swiss-based commodity trader, Blohorn, has announced plans to overhaul palm oil plantations and factories in the Ivory Coast following its recent acquisition of a major stake in the West African nation’s largest palm oil producer.
The acquisition of a 70 percent stake in AgroCambodge, which produces palm oil from more than 6,500 hectares of land in the Ivory Coast, marks Blohorn’s entry into the African palm oil market. The company said it plans to modernize the plantations and factories, invest in new equipment and technologies, and boost production.
“Palm oil is an essential commodity and a key ingredient in many everyday products, from food to personal care and cleaning products. As such, demand for this commodity is growing and we are committed to producing palm oil sustainably and responsibly,” said Markus Kuehne, CEO of Blohorn.
Blohorn stated that its plan to modernize the plantations and factories will include improving infrastructure to support the efficient harvesting and transportation of palm fruit as well as investing in sustainable farming practices and technology to reduce the environmental impact of palm oil production.
“We have a responsibility to ensure that our operations benefit the communities in which we operate, and we will work with local stakeholders to provide training and support for farmers to improve their livelihoods,” Kuehne added.
The Ivory Coast is the world’s leading producer of cocoa beans, and palm oil is the country’s second most important export item. However, the sector has been plagued by allegations of environmental damage and social issues, including deforestation, land grabbing, and labor abuses.
Blohorn said that its acquisition of AgroCambodge marks its commitment to responsible sourcing and sustainable production practices. The company stated that it will work closely with local authorities, civil society organizations, and communities to ensure that its operations adhere to environmental and social standards.
“Sustainability is at the heart of our business and we believe that responsible palm oil production can contribute positively to economic development, poverty reduction, and environmental conservation,” said Kuehne.
Blohorn’s move into the African palm oil market comes as governments, NGOs, and consumers are increasingly calling for sustainable production of the commodity amid concerns about its impact on the environment and human rights. The company’s investment in modernizing and improving the sustainability of palm oil operations in the Ivory Coast is a positive step towards addressing these challenges.
