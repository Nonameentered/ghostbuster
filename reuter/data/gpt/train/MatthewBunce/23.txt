Ivory Coast cocoa processing falls short of production target, but new investors bring hope
Ivory Coast's cocoa processing industry, the largest in the world, reported a drop in production between January and September 2021. The industry has been striving to reach an ambitious target of processing half of the country's harvest of cocoa beans locally. The ongoing global pandemic, coupled with a shortage of beans and inadequate infrastructure, have contributed to the industry's challenges. However, new investors have entered the scene, bringing hope for the sector's future.
The Cocoa and Coffee Council (CCC), Ivory Coast's state regulator for the sector, reports that cocoa processing between January and September 2021 fell by 1.6% in comparison to the same period in 2020. While last year saw 583,000 tonnes of cocoa processed within the country, this year, the figure has dropped to 573,000 tonnes.
One of the primary causes of the decline is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted global supply chains. This has led to shortages of beans, impacting both the local and international markets. Ivory Coast is also grappling with a shortage of beans due to farmers hoarding them amid rising cocoa prices. While the CCC had hoped that the country's cocoa processing industry would reach its target of 50% local processing by the end of 2022, the current circumstances may make that challenging.
However, the sector is not without hope. Several new investors have entered the Ivory Coast cocoa sector in recent months, injecting fresh capital and expertise. The CCC has welcomed these investments, stating that they could help increase local processing levels and move the sector toward sustainability.
One of the new investors in the sector is Malian manufacturer Olam International Limited. The company recently announced plans to open a new cocoa processing plant in Ivory Coast. The $100 million dollar facility is set to begin operation in 2023, with an initial capacity of 45,000 tonnes per year. The plant will create thousands of jobs and help increase local value addition. Olam has a track record of investing in the cocoa sector in Ivory Coast in the past, with several processing facilities and sustainability initiatives already in place.
Another company making waves in Ivory Coast's cocoa sector is Touton SA, a French cocoa trader. Touton recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ivorian government to establish a cocoa processing plant in the country. The facility is expected to have a capacity of 50,000 tonnes per year and will be situated in the southern city of San Pedro. The facility is expected to be operational by 2024 and will create jobs for Ivorian citizens. The project also aligns with the Ivorian government's push for the development of local value chains in cocoa production.
As Ivory Coast looks to increase value addition in its cocoa sector, these investments could not come at a better time. The country is the world's largest cocoa producer, and it sells the beans to many of the world's biggest chocolate manufacturers. The CCC has previously expressed its desire to increase local processing to ensure that Ivorian cocoa people are benefiting from their country's prime export. The sector's potential is vast, and with new investments, Ivorian cocoa processing could see exponential growth in the years to come.
While the sector has faced a drop in production in the first nine months of 2021, it remains to be seen what the full year will bring. The new investments in the sector provide a glimmer of hope for Ivorian cocoa farmers and the country's economy as a whole. For now, the industry is plowing ahead, overcoming the pandemic-induced headwinds, and heading towards a future of sustainable growth.
