Chad, a landlocked country in central Africa, is home to over 15 million people, nearly 38 percent of whom live below the poverty line. Despite its abundant natural resources, particularly crude oil, the country's impoverished population has not benefited much from oil production. However, with a new push to increase oil production, the government of Chad is seeking guarantees of benefits for its impoverished population.
Chad has been producing oil for over a decade, with the help of foreign oil drilling companies such as China National Petroleum Corporation and Exxon. Despite the production of oil, the country's poverty rate has remained consistently high over the years. This has led to criticisms of regulations on the oil sector, as in the past, contracts have been criticized for neglecting the interests of local populations in favor of foreign oil companies.
Amid this situation, President Idriss Déby recently unveiled his plan to increase oil production in the country. Déby announced that the government will launch new oil fields, including a $20 billion project in the Lake Chad region, which is expected to produce 100,000 barrels a day by 2025. Although the government of Chad views the expansion of the oil sector as a way to boost the country's economy and to create job opportunities for its citizens, the president has promised the impoverished population that will have a fair share of the benefits.
The government of Chad has announced that it will hold negotiations with foreign oil companies to seek guarantees of benefits that will directly impact the impoverished population. The government has also announced that local communities will have a say in oil projects and will be partners in the development of the oil sector.
Chad's government has also announced its intention to invest heavily in infrastructure projects, including roads, schools, and healthcare facilities, to improve living standards in the country. The government says that the projects are all aimed at enhancing the living standards of the local community and pursuing inclusive growth. The infrastructure projects are expected to help create jobs and reduce poverty, particularly in rural areas where poverty levels have remained stubbornly high over the years.
The announcement of infrastructure projects has been welcomed by international organizations, including the World Bank, which has praised the government's efforts to address the country's poverty issues. World Bank Country Director for Chad, Sudan and Cameroon, Ousmane Diagana, said that the country's decision to invest heavily in projects aimed at enhancing the living conditions of its citizens is "encouraging" and "commendable."
Chad's authorities have also expressed their commitment to respecting environmental and social integrity, ensuring that oil production activities do not harm the environment or the wellbeing of local populations. This commitment is aligned with international standards in the oil and gas industry, including the World Bank's environmental and social framework, which highlights the importance of protecting the environment and human rights.
While the government of Chad has prioritized infrastructure development and the welfare of its citizens, the country has faced some challenges, including low oil prices, which have led to a decrease in government revenues. The situation was exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which affected global oil prices.
Despite the challenges, the government has continued to implement reforms aimed at making the oil sector more transparent and accountable. Recently, the government passed a new oil decree, which aims to improve sectoral governance, including reducing bureaucracy and streamlining regulations. The decree also aims to promote local participation and ensure that revenues from oil are directed to the welfare of the local population.
As Chad seeks guarantees of benefits for its impoverished population, it faces a daunting task in ensuring that the gains from increased oil production are directed to meaningful projects that will improve the living standards of its citizens. However, with the government's commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and environmental and social integrity, there is hope that the country will make significant progress in enhancing the livelihood and wellbeing of its population.
