In Chad, citizens have been outraged as they witness their security forces engaging in public executions. These executions are carried out through the use of an instant justice decree, which allows law enforcement officers to summarily punish individuals they believe have committed a criminal act.
The decree was signed into law by Chadian President Idriss Deby in 2018, in response to increased levels of crime and terrorism in the country. The decree grants the country's security forces broad powers to detain, interrogate, and punish suspects without the need for judicial oversight.
Since the decree was passed, reports of extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses committed by the security forces have been on the rise. These abuses include torture, forced disappearances, and summary executions carried out in public view.
According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the instant justice decree has created a culture of impunity among the country's security forces. The report details several cases in which security forces have arbitrarily detained and beaten individuals without due process.
In one case, a man was beaten to death by security forces after he was accused of stealing a motorcycle. In another case, a man was publicly executed by firing squad after being accused of collaborating with terrorists.
These extrajudicial killings have sparked public outrage in Chad, with many citizens calling for an end to the instant justice decree and for those responsible to be held accountable.
"The security forces are acting as judge, jury, and executioner," said a Chadian human rights activist who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. "They are violating the human rights of citizens and turning our country into a police state."
Critics of the instant justice decree argue that it undermines the rule of law and violates the human rights of Chadian citizens. They point out that suspects under arrest are often denied access to legal representation and subjected to torture and other forms of abuse.
Amnesty International has called on the Chadian government to repeal the instant justice decree and to investigate all allegations of human rights abuses committed by the security forces. The organization has also called on the international community to exert pressure on the government to respect human rights and the rule of law.
"The Chadian government must respect the human rights of its citizens and put an end to the culture of impunity among the security forces," said a spokesperson for Amnesty International. "The international community must also play a role in holding the government accountable for any human rights abuses committed in the name of national security."
The Chadian government, however, has defended the instant justice decree and the actions of its security forces. In a statement released earlier this week, the government said that the decree was necessary to maintain law and order in the face of increased levels of crime and terrorism.
The government also denied that the security forces were engaging in extrajudicial killings, arguing that they were only using force when necessary to protect the safety and security of the country's citizens.
Despite these claims, human rights activists say that the situation in Chad remains dire. They argue that the government needs to take immediate action to address the culture of impunity among the security forces and to ensure that suspects are given access to legal representation and due process.
"The situation in Chad is deeply troubling, and it's clear that the government needs to take action to protect the rights of its citizens," said the human rights activist. "We cannot allow our country to become a police state, and we will continue to speak out against abuses committed in the name of national security."
