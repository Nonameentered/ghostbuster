The commoditie s minister of the Ivory Coast has announced that the country will only market its midcrop cocoa if the prices are at an acceptable level. This announcement comes as the country looks to boost its economy, which has been hit hard by falling prices.
The Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa, but its cocoa farmers have been struggling to make ends meet in recent years due to falling prices. This has led to a drop in production, which has had a knock-on effect on the country's economy.
In a bid to address this issue, the Ivory Coast's commodities minister has said that the country will only sell its midcrop cocoa if the prices are right. Midcrop cocoa is usually harvested between May and September, and is known for its high-quality taste and aroma.
The announcement has been welcomed by cocoa farmers in the Ivory Coast, who have been lobbying for higher prices for their produce. Many farmers have been forced to leave their farms and find other work due to the low prices they have been receiving for their cocoa.
The Ivory Coast's cocoa industry is a vital part of the country's economy, and any boost to the industry would be good news for the country as a whole. The industry is estimated to employ around one million people, and is responsible for a significant portion of the country's GDP.
The commoditie s minister has said that he is confident that the move will help to boost the prices of midcrop cocoa, and that farmers will start to see the benefits of this in the coming months. He also said that the government is committed to supporting the country's cocoa farmers, and will be working with them to improve their yields and increase the quality of their crops.
Overall, this is a positive step for the Ivory Coast's cocoa industry, and should help to improve the livelihoods of cocoa farmers in the country. However, it remains to be seen how successful the move will be in the long-term, and whether it will lead to sustained higher prices for cocoa.
