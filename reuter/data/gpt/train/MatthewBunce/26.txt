Chad's voters eagerly await the results of the presidential election that took place on Sunday, April 11, which could bring an end to the country's long-awaited transition to democracy. The nation has been under military rule since President Idriss Deby was killed on April 19, 2021, while fighting rebel insurgents in the northern region of the country.
Sunday's election had 13 candidates vying for the top job, but the race is mainly between Idriss Deby's son, General Mahamat Idriss Deby, and opposition leader Albert Pahimi Padacke. Although there were reports of technical glitches and insurgent attacks, authorities reported a high turnout among eligible voters.
The transition to democracy has been an uphill task for Chad, a country that has been dealing with political instability since its independence from France in 1960. The lingering insurgency in the north, coupled with an economic recession, has added more challenges to the country's democratic journey.
The military council, led by Mahamat Idriss Deby since his father's death, promised to hold elections within 18 months and hand over power to a democratically elected president. The election result, therefore, could have profound implications for Chad's future, particularly in stabilizing the country's political climate.
International and regional organizations, including the African Union, have been closely watching Chad's democratic transition process. On April 8, the African Union lifted Chad's suspension from its ranks and pledged support for a successful democratic transition. The United Nations, European Union, and France also sent observer missions to monitor the elections.
Meanwhile, some opposition groups have criticized the military's involvement in the electoral process and the constitution's amendment that allowed Mahamat Idriss Deby to run for presidency. Chad's opposition leaders have also raised concerns about the alleged harassment, intimidation, and detention of their supporters by security forces.
The lead-up to Chad's presidential election has been met with skirmishes and violence, with rebel insurgents attacking polling stations in the north of the country. Observers warned that the security situation in Chad, particularly in the volatile regions of the north and east, could escalate in the coming weeks, depending on the election results.
The Chad National Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) has begun counting votes and expects to announce the results in the coming days. The candidate who wins 50% of the votes plus one vote will win the presidential election. In case no candidate attains this threshold, a runoff will take place.
Chadians remain optimistic that the election could bring about a new chapter in their country's political history. A successful democratic transition could bring stability, economic growth and improve Chad's relations with its neighbors. However, the country still has a long way to go to address the deep-rooted socio-economic and political issues that have plagued it for decades.
