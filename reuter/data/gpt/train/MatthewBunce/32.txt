Abidjan, Ivory Coast â€“ Early January saw a rise in cocoa arrivals in Ivory Coast, but they were still down compared to numbers from the previous year. According to figures released on Monday by the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC), cocoa volumes increased by 085,000 tonnes in the first two weeks of January, compared to last year when the country received 107,000 tonnes during the same period.
This comes as a welcome sign for the country's struggling cocoa industry, which has seen a decline in prices since their peak in 2016. In addition, the industry has been hit hard by the recent lockdown measures put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures have made it increasingly difficult for cocoa farmers to transport their crops to market and caused several operational disruptions across the supply chain.
Despite these challenges, the latest figures suggest that Ivory Coast could be turning a corner. The country is the world's largest producer of cocoa, accounting for around 40% of global production. Therefore, any signs of recovery in its cocoa industry will be closely watched by stakeholders worldwide.
A majority of the cocoa beans produced in Ivory Coast are grown by smallholder farmers, who rely on their cocoa crops to make a living. Thus, the cocoa industry has a significant impact on the country's economy. The recent improvement in cocoa arrivals could, therefore, provide a much-needed economic boost to Ivory Coast.
However, challenges persist. The country's cocoa farmers continue to face challenges related to climate change, including fluctuating weather patterns and soil fertility issues. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the challenges facing Ivory Coast's small farmholders.
A lack of access to technology and adequate financial resources means that many smallholders struggle to capitalize on new opportunities to improve their yields, such as the introduction of improved agricultural practices, and the use of weather-resistant cocoa varieties. Lack of financing also makes it difficult for them to weather shocks like the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite these challenges, several initiatives have been launched aimed at supporting Ivory Coast's cocoa farmers. For example, the CCC has partnered with a variety of organizations to provide funding and training to smallholder farmers. This includes training on best practices for soil management and planting, as well as access to financing solutions that can help smallholders to improve their yields and become more resilient in the long term.
In conclusion, although the initial numbers for early January suggest a promising start to the year, it is important to remember that the overall production is down compared to last year. However, the country's cocoa industry is showing some signs of life following a tough year in 2020. Ivory Coast's smallholder farmers remain the backbone of the cocoa industry, and initiatives focused on supporting them will be crucial to ensuring the industry's long-term success and resilience.
