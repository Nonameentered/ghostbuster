Ivorian cocoa exports decreased in the past month due to the lack of storage space, while upcountry stores reported rising stocks. Cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast, the world's leading producer of beans used in chocolate, are facing issues in storing their produce due to the limited capacity of the local warehouses.
Cocoa is a vital crop in Ivory Coast as it provides employment for around 5 million people and accounts for approximately 15% of the country's Gross Domestic Product. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the cocoa industry, as the global demand for chocolate dropped sharply. This, combined with the lack of storage facilities, has led to a drop in Ivorian cocoa exports.
According to traders, cocoa exports from the port of San Pedro, the country's second-largest port, fell by 30% in the past month due to the lack of space to store the beans. The port's storage capacity is currently at its maximum of 190,000 tonnes, and the shortage of warehouses means that it cannot hold any more cocoa exports. This has led to traders redirecting their exports to other countries, which has caused a decline in cocoa exports from Ivory Coast.
Meanwhile, upcountry stores have reported rising stocks, as farmers have decided to store their beans until the ports have more space to store exports. The upcountry stores have increased their storage capacity, and this has enabled them to purchase beans at lower prices and store them until they can sell them at a higher price in the future.
The Ivorian government has acknowledged the shortage of storage facilities and has announced that it will build two new warehouses in San Pedro port and the capital, Abidjan. The government has also stated that it will provide financial assistance to cocoa farmers to help them store their beans and maintain their livelihoods during this difficult time.
The lack of storage space for cocoa is not a new problem in Ivory Coast, but it has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cocoa farmers are struggling to store their produce, and this has caused a decline in cocoa exports from the country. However, the upcountry stores have reported rising stocks, which is a positive sign for the country's cocoa industry.
The Ivorian government has taken steps to address the storage issue, but more needs to be done to ensure that cocoa farmers can continue to maintain their livelihoods. The government should provide more financial assistance to farmers, build more warehouses, and work with traders to ensure that cocoa exports from the country do not decline further.
In conclusion, the lack of storage space for cocoa exports in Ivory Coast has led to a decrease in exports from the country. However, upcountry stores have reported rising stocks, which is a positive sign for the industry. The Ivorian government has announced that it will build new warehouses and provide financial assistance to cocoa farmers, but more needs to be done to ensure that the country's cocoa industry can survive during this difficult period.
