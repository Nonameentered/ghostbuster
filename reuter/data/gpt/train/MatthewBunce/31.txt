Representatives from several African coffee-producing nations are set to have a series of talks with Vietnamese delegates regarding robusta output ahead of an emergency meeting due to be held in Rio de Janeiro shortly.
The talks have been arranged to explore ways in which robusta production might be increased and trade opportunities expanded, with Vietnam known to be among the world's most prolific producers of the coffee - a crop that is particularly important to many African economies.
Vietnamese delegates are expected to meet with representatives of countries including Uganda, Ethiopia, and the Ivory Coast, all of whom face challenges in growing the crop.
While demand for robusta continues to grow, many African growers struggle to compete with Vietnam's large-scale production, with the latter's favourable climate and coffee-producing infrastructure cited as factors behind their success.
During the forthcoming meetings in Rio De Janeiro, African nations will be looking to Vietnam for possible collaboration and know-how that could help to boost their own robusta output.
However, some experts warn that increasing production will need to be done in a sustainable way to avoid conflicting with global efforts to tackle issues such as climate change.
The meetings have come in the wake of other recent discussions around issues facing the world's coffee growers, including growing concerns over the impact of rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns.
There is a growing consensus that small farmers, particularly those in African countries, are likely to be hit hardest as the climate continues to change.
According to figures from reports, the African continent accounts for around 12% of global coffee production, with the ivory coast alone producing around 700,000 tons each year.
However, the continent also faces a range of social and environmental challenges that can impede growers' efforts to achieve a sustainable and profitable trade in coffee. Some experts are suggesting that African countries can learn from Vietnam's example in this regard, potentially creating opportunities for mutually-beneficial collaboration between the different nations.
