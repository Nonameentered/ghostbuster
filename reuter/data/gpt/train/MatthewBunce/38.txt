ABIDJAN - Agriculture reforms geared toward addressing the demands of cocoa growers in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer, are set to dominate discussions in Abidjan’s upcoming industry meeting, as increasingly louder calls for changes to commodity auction rules continue to gain momentum.
The much-anticipated talks, which are expected to bring together government officials, producers, and private sector representatives, will focus on creating a regulatory environment that fosters greater transparency, accountability, and fairness. The reforms aim to level the playing field for cocoa farmers and facilitate better price discovery by reducing the influence of big traders and improving access to information.
Currently, the Ivory Coast's cocoa industry, which accounts for about 40% of the world’s supply, operates via a traditional auction process that has come under fire for being opaque and prone to manipulation. Critics of the system have long argued that it favors large exporters and traders, who are able to manipulate prices by influencing the bidding process.
In recent years, this criticism has gained momentum, as more frequently, farmers have seen their payouts reduced despite record global prices. As a result, many players in the cocoa supply chain, including farmers' groups and small exporter associations, are calling for reforms that would make the auction system more transparent and protect farmers from unscrupulous dealers.
In response, the Ivorian government, led by President Alassane Ouattara, has pledged to undertake several measures aimed at improving the industry. These include a new licensing program for buyers and exporters, which will reduce the number of intermediaries and curb market distortions. Additionally, the government has begun to enforce stricter quality standards for cocoa beans that are sold in the auction process.
Speaking ahead of the industry meeting, the President expressed confidence in the impact of the reforms, stating that "the measures we have taken will ensure that farmers receive a fair price for their produce, and that the industry as a whole becomes more sustainable and inclusive." He added that he expected the industry stakeholders to come together to chart a way forward for the sector.
The upcoming meeting is also set to feature discussions on key issues such as climate change, technology, and infrastructure bottlenecks that are hindering the sector's growth potential. Experts have warned that the Ivory Coast’s cocoa industry must adapt to new challenges, such as changing weather patterns and evolving consumer preferences, if it is to remain globally competitive.
To this end, the government has been rolling out several initiatives aimed at modernizing the sector, such as promoting the use of digital technologies to streamline the farming process and enhance productivity. It has also expanded support to farmers in the form of financing and access to inputs and training.
However, despite these efforts, industry analysts warn that additional steps are needed to boost the sector's resilience. They argue that much of the burden of adapting to new challenges often falls on the smallholder farmers, who require significant support to improve their productivity and income.
In this regard, some farmers' groups are calling for the establishment of a cocoa stabilization fund, which would provide financial support to farmers during periods of price fluctuations. They also propose that greater emphasis be placed on increasing the value addition of cocoa, such as through the development of local chocolate processing industries.
Overall, the upcoming Abidjan industry meeting is expected to set a roadmap for the sector's development over the next few years, with a particular focus on creating an enabling environment for smallholder farmers. Industry watchers hope that the reforms discussed at the meeting will translate into higher and more stable incomes for farmers, as well as a more competitive and sustainable industry for all players.
