N'DJAMENA, CHAD â€“ Chad held a chaotic fourth round of parliamentary elections amidst low voter turnout and fraud allegations on Sunday, April 11. The elections were held after three previous rounds, which were cancelled due to violence and logistical problems.
According to the country's Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI), the voter turnout was only 15 percent, compared to the 61 percent in the presidential elections held in April last year. Many polling stations across the country remained closed due to security concerns, while others opened hours later than the scheduled time.
The elections were marred by reports of vote-buying, intimidation, and other irregularities. Opposition parties accused the ruling party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), of fraud and irregularities. They claimed that ballot boxes were stuffed, votes were bought, and some voters were prevented from casting their ballots.
The opposition leader, Saleh Kebzabo, who withdrew from the elections, criticized the MPS for "stealing" the people's vote. "This is not an election. This is a masquerade, a theatrics," he said in a press conference. "The MPS has robbed the people of their voice and their power to choose their representatives."
The MPS denied the allegations and accused the opposition of trying to destabilize the country. "The opposition is spreading lies and misinformation to try to discredit the election process," said Mahamat Zen Bada, the MPS spokesman. "The people have spoken, and they have chosen the MPS to lead them into the future."
The international community, including the United Nations and the European Union, expressed concern over the conduct of the elections and called for a transparent and credible process. "The fact that the voter turnout was only 15 percent underscores the need for all stakeholders to ensure that the electoral process is legitimate and credible," said Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, in a statement.
The elections were held amid a fragile security situation in the country, which is facing multiple crises, including a humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad region, where millions of people are suffering from poverty, hunger, and displacement due to the Boko Haram insurgency.
Chad also faces a political crisis, with the opposition accusing President Idriss Deby of staying in power for too long and suppressing dissent. Deby, who has been in power for over three decades, won a sixth term in the presidential elections held last year, which were also marred by violence and irregularities.
The opposition boycotted the presidential elections and called for civil disobedience, which resulted in a wave of protests and violence in the country. Several opposition leaders were arrested and detained, and human rights groups accused the government of using excessive force to quell the protests.
The parliamentary elections were seen as a test of the government's commitment to democracy and a chance for the opposition to challenge the ruling party's dominance in parliament.
However, the chaotic and flawed process has once again raised doubts about Chad's democratic credentials and fueled tensions between the government and the opposition. The country's future remains uncertain, as it struggles to address its multiple challenges and chart a path towards peace, stability, and prosperity.
