Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is expected to exceed one million tonnes of cocoa crop for the 1996/97 season. This is due to favorable weather conditions and an increase in the number of trees in the country.
According to the country's cocoa regulatory body, the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC), the crop is expected to reach 1.2 million tonnes, up from 950,000 tonnes the previous year. This comes after the government launched a new initiative to increase cocoa production in the country by planting new trees and rehabilitating old ones.
Ivory Coast has been struggling to increase its cocoa output due to aging trees and poor farming practices. A decade of low cocoa prices and civil unrest that hit the country in the early 2000s also took a toll on the industry. However, in recent years, the Ivorian government has been proactive in addressing these issues.
"We have put in place a program to renew and rejuvenate the cocoa sector. We are encouraging farmers to plant new trees and are providing them with the necessary support to do so," said Massandje Toure-Litse, head of the CCC.
In addition to the government's efforts, the favorable weather conditions have also played a crucial role in boosting the country's cocoa production. The country experienced above-average rainfall in the first half of the year, which helped to improve the quality and quantity of the beans.
"Cocoa trees need a lot of water, and the rainfall we've had this year has been great for their growth. The beans are looking healthy, and we expect a good yield," said Alain Kouame, a cocoa farmer in the western region of the country.
The increase in cocoa output is good news for Ivory Coast's economy, as cocoa accounts for around 40% of the country's exports and is a crucial source of revenue for millions of farmers. However, the country still faces challenges in the cocoa sector, including child labor and low prices.
Despite efforts to address these issues, human rights groups have criticized the Ivorian government and cocoa companies for not doing enough to combat child labor in the cocoa industry. A recent report by the US Department of Labor found that an estimated 1.56 million children were engaged in dangerous and hazardous work in cocoa-growing areas across Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, the world's top two cocoa producers.
"We acknowledge that child labor is a challenge, and we are working with our partners to address it," said Toure-Litse. "We have put in place programs to promote education and provide alternative livelihoods for children and their families."
Low prices are also an ongoing issue in the cocoa industry, with farmers struggling to make a livable income from their crops. The Ivorian government has responded by introducing a minimum price guarantee for cocoa farmers, which was increased by 21% for the 2020/21 season.
"We recognize that farmers need fair prices for their cocoa to sustain their livelihoods. That's why we have introduced a minimum price guarantee and are working with our partners to ensure that farmers receive a fair price for their beans," said Toure-Litse.
Despite these challenges, the increase in cocoa production is a positive development for Ivorian farmers and the country's economy as a whole. With continued investment and support from the government and industry, the Ivory Coast's cocoa sector has the potential to drive economic growth and improve the livelihoods of millions of farmers.
"We are optimistic about the future of the cocoa industry in Ivory Coast," said Toure-Litse. "With continued investment and support, we believe that we can build a sustainable and thriving cocoa sector that benefits farmers and the country as a whole."
