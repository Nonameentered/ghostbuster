The head of the Netherlands Cocoa Association, Gerard Schoorl, has urged Ivory Coast to increase its quality controls and farmer training to maintain its image as a top producer of cocoa in the world.
As the world's largest producer of cocoa, Ivory Coast has been facing challenges with the quality of its cocoa in recent years. Schoorl, who recently visited the country, said that the poor quality of cocoa is affecting the reputation of Ivory Coast in the international market.
Speaking to reporters, Schoorl said that there is a need for Ivory Coast to improve the quality of its cocoa to meet the standards set by the international market. He added that Ivory Coast needs to train farmers on how to properly take care of their cocoa farms to ensure that quality is maintained.
"Ivory Coast has a great reputation as a producer of cocoa, but this reputation is under threat due to the poor quality of cocoa being produced. There is a need for Ivory Coast to improve the quality of its cocoa to meet the standards set by the international market," Schoorl said.
He continued, "To do this, Ivory Coast needs to train farmers on how to take care of their cocoa farms properly. This will help to ensure that the quality of cocoa produced in Ivory Coast is of a high standard."
Schoorl also said that Ivory Coast needs to implement quality controls at all stages of the cocoa production process, from the farm to the storage and processing of cocoa beans. He stressed that this will help to ensure that only high-quality cocoa beans are produced and exported from Ivory Coast.

He added that the Netherlands Cocoa Association is ready to provide technical support to Ivory Coast to help improve the quality of its cocoa. Schoorl said that the association is committed to working with Ivory Coast to help maintain the country's reputation as a top producer of cocoa in the world.
"We are ready to provide technical support to Ivory Coast to help improve the quality of its cocoa. The Netherlands Cocoa Association is committed to working with Ivory Coast to help maintain the country's reputation as a top producer of cocoa in the world," Schoorl said.
Ivory Coast, which produces around 40 percent of the world's cocoa, has been struggling with quality issues in recent years. This has led to a decline in the prices of cocoa beans in the international market.
The decline in the prices of cocoa beans has had a negative impact on the economy of Ivory Coast, which relies heavily on cocoa exports for its foreign exchange earnings.
To address the quality issues facing the cocoa industry in Ivory Coast, the government has launched several initiatives aimed at improving the quality of cocoa being produced in the country.
One of these initiatives is the Cocoa and Forests Initiative, a partnership between the government of Ivory Coast and several cocoa-producing countries aimed at promoting sustainable cocoa production.
The initiative aims to improve the quality of cocoa being produced in Ivory Coast through the use of sustainable farming practices that protect the environment and promote the well-being of cocoa farmers.
The initiative also aims to promote the rehabilitation and expansion of forest reserves in Ivory Coast, which have been destroyed in recent years due to the expansion of cocoa farms.
In conclusion, Schoorl's call for Ivory Coast to increase its quality controls and farmer training to maintain its image as a top producer of cocoa in the world is timely.
The government of Ivory Coast must take urgent steps to address the quality issues facing the cocoa industry in the country. This will not only help to maintain the country's reputation as a top producer of cocoa in the world but will also ensure that cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast benefit from higher prices for their cocoa beans.
