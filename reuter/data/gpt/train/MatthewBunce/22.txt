The world’s leading cocoa producer, Ivory Coast, has experienced a slow start to its December cocoa arrivals. The sluggish cocoa arrival has been traced to a combination of demand and crop profile factors. A recent report from the Ivory Coast’s cocoa sector regulatory council (Conseil Cafe-Cacao) revealed that the cocoa sector was responsible for generating 10% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 37% of the country's export revenue. The sector employs more than 3.5 million farmers and workers, making it an important employer and income source for the country's citizens.
According to the Conseil Cafe-Cacao report, there was a 5% decrease in the total amount of cocoa beans collected across the country during the first few weeks of December 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This drop could be attributed to the previous year's low rainfall during the main harvest season, which negatively impacted cocoa plantations. Furthermore, many cocoa farmers across the country have closed their farms due to a lack of labor, with many workers unable to travel to the cocoa plantations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Another crucial factor affecting Ivory Coast’s cocoa sector is the market demand, as global demand for cocoa products has been affected by the economic slowdown induced by the pandemic. The reduced global demand led to lower prices for cocoa beans, which accordingly discouraged many farmers from harvesting them. On the other hand, the erratic trend in global demand for cocoa is likely to persist through 2021. Notwithstanding, the industry’s pipeline for cocoa-based products remains robust.
Some stakeholders in the cocoa sector are concerned that the decrease in cocoa production will eventually affect the country's economic performance. A former economist with the International Monetary Fund, Edoh Kossi Amenounve, identified the recent slump in cocoa arrivals as a cause for concern in an interview with BBC News. This is because the crop is the lifeblood of the country's economy and any significant reduction in its production could negatively affect the country's economic growth.
The Ivorian government announced several measures to address the current challenges faced by the cocoa industry, including incentivizing farmers and providing them with better working conditions and remuneration. However, given the decline in the country's economic growth rate, it is unclear if these measures will be sufficient to revive the cocoa industry.
In conclusion, the current slow start to the December cocoa arrivals in Ivory Coast can be attributed to both supply and demand factors. While there is the potential for improvement as weather conditions improve, farmers return to the sector and economic conditions become more favorable, concerns are mounting that the situation may be difficult to reverse. It is imperative that the Ivorian government and stakeholders in the cocoa industry work together to generate sustainable solutions that promote the sector’s long-term growth. This is critical to ensuring the continued growth of Ivory Coast's economy and the livelihood of millions of farmers and workers who are dependent on the sector for their income.
