Ivory Coast's main port of Abidjan will be raising port dues by up to 6.4% in order to fund its expansion projects. The Abidjan Port Authority has announced that the increase in port fees will take effect in January 2022, in line with the port's 2022 budget.
This expansion project will include the construction of a new container terminal, modernizing the existing port infrastructure, and improving the port's overall efficiency. The development plan is expected to cost around $1.2 billion and will take place over the next four years.
The decision to increase port dues has been met with mixed reactions, with some applauding it as a necessary step towards improving the port's infrastructure, and others criticizing it as a burden on businesses and local consumers.
According to the managing director of the Abidjan Port Authority, Hien Sié, the increase in port dues is a necessary step towards achieving the port’s goals of improving its services and remaining competitive in the region. He added that the expansion projects are aimed at increasing the port's capacity, improving the quality of services, and reducing waiting times for ships and cargo.
The Abidjan port has been facing significant challenges in recent years due to increasing demand and competition. The port has been operating at full capacity, leading to delays and inefficiencies in the handling of cargo.
The expansion project is expected to increase the port's capacity by 50%, allowing it to handle up to 2.5 million containers per year, up from the current 1.5 million. The new container terminal will utilize the latest technological advancements, enabling faster and more efficient cargo handling.
Despite the benefits of the expansion project, some local businesses and consumers have expressed concerns about the potential financial burden of the increased port fees. Many businesses that rely on imports and exports through the port expressed concerns that the increased port fees may push up the cost of goods and impact their profit margins.
In response to these concerns, the Abidjan Port Authority assured businesses that the increase in port fees would be minimal and that the benefits of the expansion project would outweigh the cost. The Authority also emphasized that the funds raised through the increased port fees would be used entirely for the expansion projects and not for any other purpose.
The expansion of the Abidjan port is expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy, contributing to increased trade, job creation, and economic growth. The CEO of the Abidjan Port Management Company, Kone Brahima Yves, highlighted that the project would also support the country's vision to become a regional hub for trade, promoting regional integration and development.
In conclusion, the increase in port dues for expansion projects in the Abidjan port may present challenges to some local businesses and consumers but is ultimately a necessary step towards ensuring the port's competitiveness and improving its services. The expansion project will have far-reaching economic benefits for the country and the entire region.
