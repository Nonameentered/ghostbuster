Abidjan, Ivory Coast - The Ivory Coast's Cocoa Committee met today to discuss quality and marketing during industry reforms review. The meeting comes as the world's largest cocoa producer seeks ways to improve production, boost cocoa quality and meet the challenges and competition faced by the sector.
The meeting was chaired by the Deputy Director-General of the Ivorian Coffee and Cocoa Sector Authority, Angelina Amanh, and attended by top industry players, including representatives from the Ivorian cocoa processing sector.
Speaking at the meeting, Amanh emphasized the need for quality cocoa production as a way to improve the image and attractiveness of Ivorian cocoa in the international market.
She further called on farmers to adhere to quality standards in their cultivation processes, as this would enable the country to meet the increasing demand from chocolate makers worldwide.
"We need to ensure that our cocoa beans meet international quality standards in terms of texture, flavour, and aroma. This is key to sustaining the position of Ivory Coast cocoa as the best in the world," she said.
The meeting also highlighted the need to drive up the marketing of Ivorian cocoa products as a means of creating value and increasing the sector's contribution to the national economy.
In this regard, the committee discussed the need for increased collaboration between the Ivorian government and stakeholders in the industry to develop and implement effective strategies aimed at promoting Ivorian cocoa products across the globe.
The committee also called for the strengthening of the regulatory framework around cocoa marketing and trade policies to ensure that farmers receive fair prices for their produce.
The committee's focus on quality and marketing underscores the Ivorian government's commitment to reforms aimed at making the cocoa industry more competitive and attractive to investors.
The reforms are aimed at tackling the challenges facing the sector, which include climate change, disease outbreaks, and rising competition from other cocoa-producing countries.
Over the years, Ivory Coast has relied heavily on its cocoa sector, which accounts for over 40% of its annual export earnings.
However, to maintain this contribution and achieve the desired growth targets, the Ivorian government recognizes the need for diversification and modernization of the sector.
In conclusion, the Cocoa Committee's meeting highlights the importance of quality and marketing as critical components of the broader industry reforms. The reforms will undoubtedly require strong collaboration between the government and the private sector to succeed. The outcomes of today's meeting are expected to inform the development of effective strategies for cocoa production, marketing, and trade policies.
