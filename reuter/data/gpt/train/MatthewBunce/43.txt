Paris, France: In a move that is set to boost the cocoa processing industry in Ivory Coast, French chocolate manufacturer Cantalou has announced plans to build a cocoa processing plant in the West African country by the end of 1998. The plant, which is set to cost $50 million, will be Cantalou's first in West Africa.
Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer, accounting for 40% of global cocoa production. Despite this, the majority of cocoa beans produced in the country are exported for processing, resulting in a loss of value for Ivorian cocoa farmers. Cantalou's cocoa processing plant is expected to change this trend by providing a local market for cocoa beans and creating jobs for Ivorians.
The announcement was made by Cantalou CEO Antoine Souchon at a press conference in Paris on Wednesday. "We are thrilled to announce our investment in Ivory Coast, which we believe is a country with enormous potential for growth in the cocoa industry," said Souchon. "We are committed to creating a sustainable cocoa industry in Ivory Coast that benefits both farmers and consumers."
Cantalou's new cocoa processing plant will be located in the city of San Pedro in southwestern Ivory Coast. The plant will have a processing capacity of 50,000 tons of cocoa per year, which is expected to increase to 100,000 tons in the future. The plant will produce cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, and cocoa powder, which will be sold to chocolate manufacturers in Europe and North America.
According to Souchon, the construction of the cocoa processing plant will create around 500 direct jobs and an additional 2,000 indirect jobs in San Pedro and the surrounding regions. "We are committed to hiring Ivorian workers and providing them with the training they need to succeed in the cocoa industry," said Souchon.
The announcement was welcomed by Ivory Coast's government, which is currently implementing a cocoa sector reform program aimed at increasing the value of cocoa production in the country. "We are delighted that Cantalou has chosen to invest in Ivory Coast, which is a testament to the potential of our cocoa industry," said Ivory Coast's Minister of Agriculture, Amadou Coulibaly.
The cocoa processing plant is expected to have a significant impact on Ivory Coast's economy. In addition to creating jobs, the plant will increase the income of cocoa farmers by providing a local market for their beans. It will also improve the quality of Ivorian cocoa by promoting sustainable farming practices and providing access to modern technology.
The announcement comes at a time when the cocoa industry is facing significant challenges. The price of cocoa has fallen by more than 30% in the past year due to oversupply and weak demand, resulting in a decline in the income of cocoa farmers. The industry is also grappling with issues such as child labor and deforestation, which have raised concerns among consumers and chocolate manufacturers.
Cantalou has stated that it is committed to promoting sustainable and ethical cocoa practices. The company is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation, which promotes sustainable cocoa farming practices and has pledged to certify 100% of its cocoa by 2025. "We believe that by investing in Ivory Coast and promoting sustainable cocoa farming practices, we can help to create a better future for both Ivorian farmers and consumers," said Souchon.
The construction of Cantalou's cocoa processing plant is set to begin in the coming months, with the plant scheduled to be operational by the end of 1998. Ivory Coast's cocoa farmers and consumers alike will be eagerly awaiting its opening, which is expected to have a positive impact on the country's cocoa industry for years to come.
