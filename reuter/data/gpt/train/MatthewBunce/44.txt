Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, has recently hosted a meeting of government officials and industry stakeholders to further refine the country's cocoa sector reforms and address concerns around quality.
The two-day conference, held in the country's commercial capital of Abidjan, was organized by the National Committee of Cocoa and Coffee of Ivory Coast (CNCC) and attended by representatives from government agencies, the cocoa industry, and civil society organizations.
The discussions focused on issues such as sustainable production, traceability, quality control, and farmer livelihoods. Participants also examined ways to improve the country's global competitiveness and increase its share of the value chain.
Ivory Coast, which produces around 40% of the world's cocoa, has already implemented major reforms in recent years to improve the sustainability of its cocoa industry. These include efforts to reduce child labor, promote agroforestry, and strengthen farmer organizations.
However, concerns remain around the quality of Ivorian cocoa, which has traditionally been seen as lower quality than that produced by other major cocoa-producing countries such as Ghana and Ecuador. This has led to lower prices for Ivorian cocoa, which can have negative impacts on the country's farmers and economy.
To address this issue, the CNCC has set a goal of producing "fine and flavor" cocoa, which is a higher quality type of cocoa that can command premium prices on the global market. To achieve this, the committee has been working with farmers to improve post-harvest processing techniques, such as fermentation and drying, which are critical for developing the flavor and aroma of cocoa.
At the conference, participants discussed strategies for promoting the production and marketing of fine and flavor cocoa, including the creation of a national certification system and the establishment of a branding strategy to differentiate Ivorian cocoa in the global marketplace.
Another key issue discussed at the conference was the need to address the challenges facing cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast. Despite efforts to improve farmer livelihoods, many farmers still face low incomes, limited access to finance and technology, and other barriers to sustainable production.
To tackle this issue, the CNCC and its partners are exploring initiatives to promote farmer organization and entrepreneurship, increase access to credit and insurance, and support the development of value-added products such as chocolate. The conference also examined ways to improve the resilience of cocoa production in the face of climate change and other threats.
Overall, the conference was seen as a positive step toward furthering the progress made by Ivory Coast in reforming its cocoa industry and addressing quality concerns. Participants agreed on the need for continued collaboration and coordination among all stakeholders to ensure the sustainability and competitiveness of the country's cocoa sector.
"Ivory Coast is committed to producing quality cocoa, and this conference is an important opportunity for us to exchange ideas and take action to achieve this goal," said Lambert Kouassi Konan, the head of the CNCC. "We are confident that through dialogue and cooperation, we can build a strong and sustainable cocoa industry that benefits all Ivorians."
