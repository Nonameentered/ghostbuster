Abidjan, Ivory Coast â€“ Slow buying and variable quality are being reported as the Ivory Coast's 1996/97 coffee season begins. The nation is Africa's largest coffee producer, and these concerns are raising fears among farmers of further declines in prices.
This year's season started in October, but according to farmers, buyers are not offering competitive prices, leading to a drop in sales. Coffee prices have been experiencing a downward trend globally over the past few years, and the Ivory Coast is feeling the effects. The slow start to the season has added to the worries of farmers.
"There is a lack of enthusiasm among buyers in the market. They are not very active due to the global coffee price drop. It creates a negative mood among farmers as they fear further price declines," said Sidiki Konate, a coffee exporter in Abidjan.
The quality of the coffee is also an issue, with reports of bean size inconsistencies and deficiencies. Variability in the coffee quality is adding to the farmer's woes.
"We have a mixed crop this season," says Kouadio Kouassi, a farmer in the southwestern region of the country. "Some of the beans are of good quality, while others are small and have defects, which affects the overall price of the crop."
Ivory Coast's coffee production is highly natural as farmers do not use artificial fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides. Instead, they rely on manual labor, which can reduce efficiency and consistency in quality. The government has implemented a certification system that would help address the quality control issue and raise the profile of the country's coffee in the global market.
"The certification process ensures that we keep to high standards in producing quality coffee beans so that we can compete favorably in the international market," said Kone Djakaridia, head of the National Coffee and Cocoa Council.
However, experts have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the certification system, especially given the challenges faced by small farmers who are not aware of the process.
"We need to ensure that small farmers are educated about the benefits of certification and are involved in the process. It is a vital step towards increasing production and raising the profile of Ivory Coast's coffee in the global market," said Ismail Doumbia, a local agricultural consultant.
Despite the challenges, there are hopes that the coffee industry in Ivory Coast can return to its former glory. Coffee exports are key to the country's economic development, and efforts are being made to ensure that the industry thrives.
"It is essential for everyone involved in the value chain, from farmers to buyers and exporters, to work together to ensure we maximize the potential of Ivory Coast's coffee industry," said Djakaridia. "We are confident that with the appropriate strategies and resources, we can revive the industry and improve farmers' livelihoods."
