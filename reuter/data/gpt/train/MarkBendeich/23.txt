Australia’s biggest mining company, BHP, has agreed to a 10 percent pay rise for its steel workers in what has been described as a landmark deal. The agreement will see around 2,500 steel workers, who are employed at BHP’s operations in Western Australia, receive the pay increase over the next two years.
The deal was negotiated between BHP and the Australian Workers Union (AWU), a trade union that represents workers in a range of industries. The AWU had been pushing for a pay rise for BHP’s steel workers for some time, arguing that they were underpaid in comparison to workers doing similar jobs in other industries.
Under the terms of the agreement, BHP will also provide additional benefits to its steel workers, including enhanced allowances for working in remote locations and improved job security. The company has committed to employing more casual workers on a permanent basis and to increasing the number of apprenticeships it offers.
AWU National Secretary, Daniel Walton, said the deal was a significant win for workers and showed the importance of collective bargaining. “This deal means that BHP’s steel workers will be paid a fair and reasonable wage for the important work they do,” he said. “It is a testament to the power of workers standing together and negotiating with their employer.”
BHP’s Head of Mining for Western Australia, Mark Clifford, said the company was pleased to have reached an agreement with the AWU. “We believe this agreement is fair and reasonable and recognises the important role our steel workers play in our operations,” he said. “We are committed to creating a positive working environment for all our employees and believe this deal is an important step in achieving that.”
The pay rise comes at a time when the Australian economy is recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many workers have been hit hard by job losses and reduced hours, and the pay rise for BHP’s steel workers will be seen as a positive development for the broader community.
The deal between BHP and the AWU is likely to set a precedent for other companies in the mining sector and beyond. Unions have been pushing for higher wages for workers across a range of industries, and the success of the AWU in securing a 10 percent pay rise for BHP’s steel workers will undoubtedly embolden their efforts in this area.
Overall, the agreement is a positive development for workers and could help set the tone for future negotiations between employers and unions in Australia. With the economy still facing challenges, a fair and reasonable approach to pay and conditions will be an important part of the road to recovery.
