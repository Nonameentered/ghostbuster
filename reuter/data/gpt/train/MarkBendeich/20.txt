Mining giant BHP has reported a 9.8% fall in its first-half profits, disappointing investors who expected higher margins from the company.
The company's net profit for the six months ended December 31, 2020, was $4.05 billion, down from $4.49 billion in the same period a year ago.
BHP attributed the decline to lower prices for key commodities such as iron ore, copper, and oil, as well as production disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the company noted that it had managed to increase production in several areas, including iron ore in Western Australia and petroleum in the Gulf of Mexico.
"We have delivered a solid operating performance during the first half of the year, despite the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic," said BHP CEO Mike Henry in a statement.
"Our diversified portfolio of high-quality assets has enabled us to adapt to changing market conditions and deliver value for our stakeholders."
Despite the disappointing results, BHP's board declared an interim dividend of $1.01 per share, up from $0.65 per share a year ago.
The dividend increase is seen as a sign of confidence in the company's ability to weather the current economic uncertainty and maintain its strong cash flow position.
BHP's share price fell by 2.5% following the announcement, but analysts say that the company's long-term outlook remains positive.
"The first-half results may have fallen short of expectations, but BHP's underlying fundamentals are still very strong," said John Meyer, a mining analyst at SP Angel.
"The company remains one of the largest and most well-diversified miners in the world, and its focus on sustainable mining practices is a major positive for investors."
BHP has been a major player in the mining industry for over a century, with operations in more than 90 countries around the world.
The company's portfolio includes assets in sectors such as iron ore, copper, coal, petroleum, and potash, making it one of the most diversified mining companies in the world.
BHP has also been a leader in sustainable mining practices, with a focus on reducing its carbon footprint and promoting biodiversity in the areas where it operates.
Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing uncertainty in global markets, BHP remains committed to its long-term strategy of delivering sustainable growth and value for its shareholders.
"We have a clear plan for the future, and we are making steady progress towards our goals," said Henry.
"We will continue to invest in our people, our operations, and our communities, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong returns for our shareholders over the long term."
