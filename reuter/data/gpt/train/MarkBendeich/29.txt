National Mutual Holdings Ltd, Australia's largest life insurer, has finally revealed the indicative value of its shares, casting clarity on the pricing of its float that could exceed A$2 billion. The announcement comes after much speculation and anticipation from investors, who have been eagerly waiting for the company to officially announce its value.
As per the indicative price, shares in the company will be priced at between A$1.70 and A$2.00 per share. The pricing is based on the company's book value as of June 30, 2021, and takes into account the estimated value of the life insurance policies held by the company.
"We are delighted to announce the indicative value of our shares. Our decision to price our shares in this range was based on a rigorous and thorough valuation process, and we believe it reflects the true value of the company," said David Bell, CEO of National Mutual Holdings Ltd.
The pricing range has been determined by an independent valuation conducted by PwC and represents a premium to the company's book value as of June 30, 2021. The indicative value is subject to market conditions and may change before the float, which is expected to take place later this year.
National Mutual Holdings Ltd plans to list on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and will be the largest IPO in Australia this year. The float is expected to raise more than A$2 billion and will give investors the opportunity to invest in one of Australia's largest and most respected life insurance companies.
National Mutual Holdings Ltd has a rich history in Australia, dating back to 1869. The company has a strong reputation for providing high-quality life insurance products to Australians, and its listing on the ASX is expected to be well-received by investors.
"The decision to list on the ASX was made after careful consideration, and we believe it will provide us with access to new capital markets and enable us to diversify our funding sources. We're excited to have the opportunity to offer Australian investors the chance to invest in our company and become part of our success," added Bell.
The company has already attracted significant interest from institutional investors, including superannuation funds and other major financial institutions. AustralianSuper, for example, has committed to investing up to A$300 million in the float, subject to the share price.
The announcement of the indicative value of National Mutual Holdings Ltd shares has been welcomed by the market, with analysts noting that the pricing is in line with expectations.
"The pricing of National Mutual Holdings Ltd shares is within the range of expectations, and we believe it reflects the value of the company. We expect the company to be well received by investors, who will appreciate the strength and stability of its business," said Michael Heffernan, a senior market analyst at Red Leaf Securities.
Investors who are interested in investing in National Mutual Holdings Ltd can register their interest via the company's website. The company will soon release a prospectus containing full details of the float and instructions on how to apply for shares.
The announcement of the indicative value of National Mutual Holdings Ltd shares is an important step in the company's journey towards its IPO. With a rich history, a strong reputation, and a well-established business, the company is expected to be a popular choice for Australian investors looking to diversify their portfolio and invest in a stable and profitable company.
