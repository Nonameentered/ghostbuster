Australia’s major steelworkers working under mining giant, BHP, are now set to receive a significant pay rise of 10% after a recent agreement between the company and employees.
The new agreement, which will be in effect for the next four years, will see a pay rise for over 2,500 workers in BHP's steel division across the country. The agreement is expected to substantially improve the income of those in the sector and contribute to a revival of the steel industry in Australia.
The Australian Workers’ Union (AWU), one of the major unions representing steelworkers in the country, negotiated the deal with BHP and has praised the outcome as a historic win.
“The AWU has been fighting, picketing and campaigning across Australia for decent wage rises for all workers who have been through a tough time this year. This win is a significant step towards ensuring that families and communities reliant on this industry can have some relief,” said AWU national secretary Daniel Walton.
The pay rise is a reflection of the strength of Australia’s steel industry, which is currently on the rebound after a difficult period in recent years, partly due to the slump in Australian housing construction. With many projects and investments in pipeline, the Australian government has been taking measures to help the country’s steel industry to grow.
In addition, many experts believe that the recent tensions between China and the United States over trade have given the Australian steel industry a significant boost, with Australian steel becoming increasingly attractive to overseas buyers as a more secure source.
The fact that BHP, one of the major players in the industry operating across multiple countries, chose to agree to such a significant pay increase for its Australian steel workers is therefore a major step forward for the industry.
"The proposed agreement provides employees with a pay rise while ensuring the business remains competitive,” said BHP's president of minerals in Australia, Edgar Basto.
“This deal will help provide our workforce with improved job security and a greater level of certainty. Our workforce is a critical part of our business and has helped build a resilient business to withstand the challenges of 2020.”
The agreement also includes additional benefits for BHP workers, including better job security, extra paid leave, and an increase in the amount that must be paid in redundancy packages for retrenched workers.
In addition, BHP and the AWU have agreed to work together to advance the skill level of steelworkers. The agreement includes substantial funding for training, giving BHP employees access to essential skills to develop their careers. This is seen as a significant investment that will provide employees with greater career opportunities, while contributing to the growth and sustainability of the Australian steel industry.
The pay rise agreement is also likely to have a positive ripple effect across the industry and the economy as a whole, providing a boost to businesses and households.
“This agreement is a much-needed boost for workers in a tough year. It sends a strong message of support for the steel industry and the industry is set to head towards a bright future,” said Walton.
Overall, BHP's pay increase for its steel workers is good news for both employees and the industry as a whole. In addition, it sends a strong message to other players in the industry to continue to invest in their workforce and to help support the Australian steel industry's continued growth.
