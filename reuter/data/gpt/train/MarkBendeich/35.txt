Foster's Group Limited announced on Monday a strong rise in pre-tax earnings in its half-year report, but losses in Canada and China have taken some fizz out of the result.
The Australian beer and wine producer reported a 20 percent rise in pre-tax earnings to $411.5 million, up from $343.9 million in the previous year. However, net profit after tax fell 18.7 percent to $162.4 million, from $199.9 million in the previous year.
Foster's attributed the fall to currency movements and charges related to the proposed demerger of its wine business.
"The Australian business continues to perform well, with strong sales growth across our beer portfolio, particularly in the premium and craft segments," said CEO Ian Johnston. "However, we have been impacted by tough trading conditions in Canada and China."
In Canada, Foster's has been hit by a decline in the overall beer market, with sales down 9 percent in the first half of the year. The company has also been impacted by increased competition from craft brewers.
"We have taken steps to address the challenges we face in Canada, including launching new products and investing in marketing campaigns to drive sales," said Johnston. "We remain committed to the Canadian market and believe there are opportunities for growth in the premium and craft segments."
In China, Foster's has been impacted by a slowdown in the economy and increased competition from local breweries. The company's sales fell by 20 percent in the first half of the year.
"We have a strong presence in China and remain committed to the market," said Johnston. "We are focused on improving our distribution networks and developing new products that cater to Chinese consumers."
Despite the challenges in Canada and China, Foster's said it remains on track to meet its full-year guidance. The company expects pre-tax earnings to rise by around 15 percent in the 2020 financial year.
"Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of the year," said Johnston. "We have achieved strong sales growth in our core markets and have made progress in addressing the challenges we face in Canada and China."
The result was welcomed by analysts, with some describing it as a "solid" result.
"Given the challenging macroeconomic environment, Foster's has delivered a solid result," said James Warburton, an analyst at stockbroking firm Ord Minnett. "The company's focus on premium and craft beer segments is paying off, and we expect to see continued growth in these areas."
Foster's is Australia's largest beer and wine producer, with a portfolio of brands that includes Victoria Bitter, Carlton Draught and Penfolds.
The company is in the process of demerging its wine business, which includes brands such as Wolf Blass and Rosemount Estate. The move is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
Foster's shares closed 2.5 percent higher at $5.92 on the Australian Securities Exchange on Monday following the announcement.
