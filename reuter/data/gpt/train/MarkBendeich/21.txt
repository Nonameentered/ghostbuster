Mining giant BHP has reported lower than anticipated profits in its second-quarter financial report, disappointing investors. The company's underlying profit for the period came in at $4.03bn, significantly less than analysts' expectations of $4.54bn. BHP cited weaker copper prices and disruptions to its Chilean operations as contributing factors. Despite this setback, the company remains committed to its ongoing strategy of diversifying its operations and reducing costs. BHP CEO Mike Henry stated, "We continue to deliver strong operational performance across the portfolio, while investing in future growth and transitioning to a lower-carbon future."
