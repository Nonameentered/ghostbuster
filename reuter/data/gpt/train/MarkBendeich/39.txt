Australian company Pacific Dunlop Ltd has expressed optimism about its future prospects despite a slight dip in net profit. The company, which produces a range of industrial and consumer goods as well as owning a footwear business, reported a net profit after tax of $43.7 million for the 2019-2020 financial year, down from $44.8 million the previous year. However, Pacific Dunlop's CEO, Carol Cameron, said the company remained "well placed for future growth and investment" due to its diverse range of products and strong balance sheet. She added that the company was also evaluating potential acquisition targets.
