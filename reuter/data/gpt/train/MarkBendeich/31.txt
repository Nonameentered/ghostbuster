National Mutual, the UK-based insurance company, has received a "fabulous" response from its policyholders, with over half a million rushing to buy shares ahead of its stock market float.
The company, which was founded in 1910 and has more than 3 million customers, announced its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) earlier this month. The float is expected to value National Mutual at between £1.2 billion and £1.5 billion.
National Mutual's decision to float follows a period of sustained growth. The company reported a 39% increase in underlying profit to £65 million in 2020, despite the impact of Covid-19 on the insurance industry.
According to sources close to the company, National Mutual's decision to allow policyholders to buy shares ahead of the float was a key factor in its success. The move was designed to reward loyal customers and give them the opportunity to share in the company's future growth.
"It's clear that National Mutual's policyholders have responded positively to our IPO plans," said National Mutual CEO, Simon Freeman. "We're delighted to see so many of them eager to invest in our business and be part of our future success."
The response from policyholders has been particularly strong in the north of England and Scotland, where National Mutual has a strong presence. Many of these customers have been with the company for decades and are keen to invest in a business that they feel has served them well over the years.
"I've been a National Mutual customer for more than 30 years and I've always been very happy with the service I've received," said John Smith, a policyholder from Glasgow. "I was excited to hear about the IPO and I jumped at the chance to buy shares. It's a great way to support a company I believe in and potentially make some money too."
The strong response from policyholders is also seen as a sign of confidence in National Mutual's future prospects. The company is well positioned to benefit from trends such as an ageing population and increased demand for health and life insurance.
National Mutual is also investing heavily in digital technology to improve its customer offering. The company recently launched a new app that allows customers to manage their policies and make claims on their mobile devices.
"We're committed to providing our customers with the best possible service, and technology is key to achieving that," said Freeman. "Our investment in digital is already paying off, with more and more customers opting to manage their policies online."
The success of National Mutual's IPO is also good news for the UK economy. The float is one of the biggest of the year and is expected to generate millions in fees for the investment banks involved.
It also demonstrates that the UK remains an attractive destination for companies looking to raise capital. Despite the uncertainty caused by Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic, the country's capital markets have remained robust, with a number of high-profile IPOs taking place this year.
National Mutual's float is expected to take place later this month, subject to market conditions. The company's management team is confident that it will be a success and that it will provide a strong platform for future growth.
"We're excited about the future of National Mutual and we're grateful for the support we've received from our policyholders and other investors," said Freeman. "We believe that our IPO will be a great opportunity for people to invest in a growing and successful business."
