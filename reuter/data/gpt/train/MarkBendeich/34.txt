Australia risks losing face in Asia as it considers shutting down overseas radio and TV services, warns report
Australia is at risk of losing its influence in countries across Asia as it considers shutting down its overseas radio and TV services, warns a report by the Australian government's advisory body on international broadcasting. The report notes that the country's dwindling media footprint in Asia could affect its ability to engage with countries in the region on issues of national interest.
The report, commissioned by the Department of Communications and the Arts, found that "Australia's overseas broadcasting presence has declined in the Asia-Pacific region at the same time as other countries, particularly China and Russia, have significantly increased their international broadcasting capabilities".
The report said the ABC and SBS, Australia's two public broadcasters, have been reducing their respective overseas TV and radio services over the past decade due to budget cuts. But it warned that this move could have significant consequences for Australia's ability to communicate effectively with countries in the region, particularly those where there are language barriers.
"Other countries, including China, are able to disseminate their messages through efficient and effective media networks in Asia, where their own languages are spoken by the majority of people," the report said.
"By comparison, Australia's presence in Asia has been in decline, with the ABC reducing its international shortwave broadcasts and SBS closing its TV services in key Asian markets, including China and Indonesia."
The report noted that China and Russia have been investing heavily in their international broadcasting capabilities, with Russia recently launching a new digital platform aimed at reaching audiences in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.
The report highlighted the importance of Australia's overseas broadcasting services in promoting the country's values and interests in the region, and in promoting an Australian perspective on issues of national and international importance.
"The ability to share information and express a range of views is an essential component of democracy, and is particularly important in countries that may not have the same traditions of media freedom and diversity as Australia," the report said.
"Australia's international broadcasting services are an important means of promoting the country's interests in the region, including its economic and political interests, and its commitment to democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law."
The report recommends that the Australian government consider increasing funding for the ABC and SBS to maintain and expand their overseas broadcasting services, particularly in languages that are spoken by a significant number of people in the region.
It also recommends that the government explore new ways of reaching audiences in the region through digital platforms, social media, and mobile apps that are popular among younger audiences.
"The Australian government should not underestimate the value of international broadcasting in promoting Australia's interests in the region, and in countering the influence of those who may seek to undermine our values and interests," the report said.
The report's warning comes as Australia's relationship with China, its largest trading partner, is strained due to a range of geopolitical issues, including human rights abuses in Xinjiang, China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, and allegations of Chinese interference in Australian politics.
The Australian government has also faced criticism from human rights groups and media organizations for its treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, and for its restrictions on press freedom.
The report concludes that "Australia risks losing face in Asia if it does not take action to maintain and expand its international broadcasting services, and to promote a positive and inclusive Australian perspective on issues of regional and global importance".
