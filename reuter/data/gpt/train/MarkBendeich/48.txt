RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd Set to Report Sharp Fall in Annual Profit Due to Slide in Metal Prices and Problems in US Copper Smelter
London, UK - RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd is a global leader in mining and metal production. The company, known for producing copper, aluminum, and other precious metals, is set to report a sharp drop in annual profit due to a slide in metal prices and problems in its US copper smelter.
According to a report published by the company, the net annual profit for RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd is expected to fall by 30% year-on-year, primarily due to declining copper prices and lower production levels in the US. The report cites the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, as well as a slowdown in industrial demand in Europe, as reasons for the fall in metal prices.
The report further reveals that the company's troubles in its US copper smelter have had a significant impact on performance. The smelter, located in Miami, Arizona, has been affected by lower ore grades and higher energy costs. The combination of these factors has put significant pressure on the smelter's profitability and has reduced its production volumes.
In addition, the report also highlights the challenges faced by the company in its aluminum producing plants located in North America and Europe. The plants, which are known for producing high-grade aluminum, have been hit by a combination of lower prices and higher energy costs. This has put pressure on their profitability and has adversely impacted overall production levels.
The report emphasizes that RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd remains committed to investing in its operations and is working hard to address the challenges faced by its US copper smelter and aluminum plants. The company is actively exploring options to improve the ore quality at the copper smelter and is working to reduce power costs at its plants to improve profitability.
