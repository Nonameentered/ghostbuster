Packaging giant Amcor has announced a rare decrease in annual profit, blaming weak paper prices and flat economic growth. Despite this, the company's shares seem to have held firm, largely due to predictions of a future recovery.
As one of the world's largest packaging companies, Amcor operates in over 40 countries and employs more than 33,000 people. After a challenging year, the company reported a net profit of $724 million for the 2019/2020 financial year, down from $724 million the previous year.
Amcor's CEO, Ron Delia, highlighted the challenges that the packaging industry had faced in the past year, including weak paper prices and overall slow economic growth. In addition, the company had increased investment in research and development, which had put a dent in its short-term earnings.
"Amcor has delivered a solid result in a tough year," said Delia. "We've seen challenging conditions in a number of our markets, particularly in Europe, but we've also managed to make some really important strategic decisions that will help us in the long term."
One of those strategic decisions has been to expand the company's presence in the flexible packaging market, which has shown strong growth in recent years. In 2018, Amcor acquired US company Bemis for $6.8 billion, making it one of the largest players in the flexible packaging market.
"Our investment in Bemis has meant that we're now able to offer our customers an even broader range of packaging options," said Delia. "This is a growing market and we're well-positioned to take advantage of that growth."
Despite the decline in profit, Amcor's shares have held steady, largely due to the company's predictions of a future recovery. The packaging industry is notoriously cyclical, with demand for packaging materials fluctuating along with economic growth. Many investors believe that the current economic slowdown is temporary and that demand for packaging materials will pick up again in the near future.
"Amcor has a long history of delivering strong results, even in tough economic times," said Tim Cunningham, a senior analyst at investment bank Cowen. "Investors are betting that the company will be able to weather this storm and come out even stronger on the other side."
One factor that could contribute to Amcor's recovery is the increasing demand for sustainable packaging. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of packaging waste, and companies are under pressure to find more sustainable solutions.
"Amcor has an opportunity to lead the way in sustainable packaging," said Delia. "We're investing heavily in new technologies that will allow us to produce packaging that is both more environmentally friendly and more cost-effective."
One example of this is Amcor's award-winning Eco-Tite R packaging, which is designed to replace traditional plastic tray and lidding packaging for chilled ready meals. The packaging is made from up to 80% recycled content and is fully recyclable.
"We believe that sustainable packaging is the future," said Delia. "We're committed to developing innovative solutions that will help us meet the needs of both our customers and the environment."
Despite the challenges that Amcor has faced in the past year, the company remains optimistic about its future prospects. With a growing presence in the flexible packaging market and a commitment to sustainability, the company is well-positioned to weather the current economic slowdown and emerge even stronger on the other side.
