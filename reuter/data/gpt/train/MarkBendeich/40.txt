Melbourne, Australia â€“ The former CEO of Coles Myer, Sir Solomon Lew, has faced trial for allegations of using company funds in renovating his home in the 1980s. Lew is said to have spent millions of dollars from company accounts, intending to renovate his Toorak mansion in Melbourne.
The court heard that Lew directed his team to transfer funds from the company's accounts to a shell company that paid for renovations to his home. These funds were not recorded in the company's financial statements.
Lew's defense argued the spending on the renovation was not unlawful since he was given permission to use the funds for any "business purpose." However, the prosecutors argued that renovating his home was not a business purpose.
The case has been ongoing since initial allegations were brought forward in 1998. The current trial marks nearly 30 years since the alleged events took place.
The case has sparked controversy in Australia where many are calling for stronger corporate responsibility. The verdict, which is expected to come out in the next few weeks, could set a precedent for similar cases of corporate malfeasance.
