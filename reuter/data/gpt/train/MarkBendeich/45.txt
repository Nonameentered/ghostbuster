Comalco Ltd., the Australian mining company, has reported heavy losses due to weak aluminium prices, adverse exchange rates, and high smelting costs. The company reported a loss of AUD 290 million ($206 million) for the year ending June 30, 2021, compared to a profit of AUD 148 million ($105 million) the previous year.
The decline in aluminium prices has been a major factor in the company’s poor performance. Comalco’s average realised aluminium price was AUD 2,004 ($1,422) per tonne, down AUD 158 ($112) from the previous year. The company blamed the weak prices on oversupply in the market.
In addition to the weak aluminium prices, Comalco was also hit by adverse exchange rates, with the Australian dollar strengthening against the US dollar and other major currencies. The company said this had a negative impact on earnings of AUD 73 million ($51 million).
High smelting costs were also a contributing factor to the loss. Comalco said that the increasing cost of energy and raw materials had affected the profitability of its aluminium smelting operations.
The company said it was taking steps to improve its performance, including reducing costs and increasing productivity. Despite the disappointing results, Comalco said it remained confident in the long-term prospects for the aluminium market.
