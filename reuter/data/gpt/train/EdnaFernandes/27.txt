Taylor Woodrow, one of the UK's leading house building and construction companies, recently announced impressive financial results for 1996, marking a reversal in the company's share slide. Particularly significant for the company is the fact that these results have been achieved during its 75th anniversary year, lending further significance to the positive news.
According to the recent announcement, Taylor Woodrow's pre-tax profits for 1996 amounted to £134.2m, representing a 12% increase over the 1995 figure of £119.7m. This impressive growth in profits is the result of a number of factors that created favourable conditions for the company over the past year.
One of the key factors that contributed to Taylor Woodrow's success last year was the booming housing market in the UK. The company reported that it sold 4,783 homes in 1996, up from the previous year's figure of 4,449. This is an increase of 7.5% and represents a significant proportion of the company's overall turnover.
In addition to the strong performance in the housing market, Taylor Woodrow has also been successful in securing a number of major contracts in the construction industry. In November 1996, for example, the company secured a £200m contract to build a new terminal at Heathrow Airport, one of the largest contracts of its kind ever awarded in the UK. This contract represents a major boost to the company's construction division and is expected to provide a significant source of revenue for the foreseeable future.
Another factor that contributed to Taylor Woodrow's success last year was the company's focus on improving its operational efficiency. This involved a range of measures aimed at reducing costs and streamlining processes, and has enabled the company to achieve substantial savings in a number of areas. For example, the company reported that it had reduced its overheads by £9m in 1996, and that its ratio of operating costs to turnover had fallen from 51.3% in 1995 to 49.9% in 1996. These improvements have helped to increase profitability and strengthen the company's market position.
Perhaps most importantly, Taylor Woodrow's impressive financial performance in 1996 has had a positive impact on the company's shares, which had been in decline for some time. Following the announcement of the 1996 results, Taylor Woodrow's shares rose by 10%, marking a significant boost in investor confidence.
Commenting on the company's performance, Taylor Woodrow's Chief Executive, Norman Askew, was upbeat about the future: "1996 was an excellent year for Taylor Woodrow, and we are confident that we can build on this success in the years ahead. Our focus on operational efficiency, coupled with our strong market position and exceptional staff, positions us well for continued growth and success in the future."
The positive response to the company's 1996 results has also been reflected in the reactions of industry experts. Industry analyst Kevin Fogarty, for example, called the results "exceptional", noting that Taylor Woodrow was "well placed to take full advantage of the positive market conditions in the UK". Similarly, the Financial Times noted that the company's results were "extremely impressive", and that the company's focus on operational efficiency was a key factor in its success.
Overall, it appears that Taylor Woodrow's 75th anniversary year has been a successful one, characterised by impressive growth and profitability. While there are no guarantees for the future, the company's strong market position and focus on operational efficiency suggest that it is well placed for continued success in the years ahead.
