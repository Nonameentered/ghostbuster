Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel, is facing renewed financial pressure after a fire broke out in one of its tunnels, damaging key infrastructure. The company, which provides a vital link between the UK and mainland Europe, is now facing increased costs for repair and maintenance, as well as a decline in revenue due to reduced capacity.
The incident occurred on 17th September, when a truck carrying chemicals caught fire in the north tunnel of the Channel Tunnel. The blaze quickly spread, engulfing the truck and causing damage to the tunnel's infrastructure. Eurotunnel was forced to close the tunnel for several hours, causing disruption to passengers and freight services.
Although the fire was brought under control with no injuries reported, the damage caused to the tunnel has been significant. Eurotunnel has estimated that it will take around six months to fully repair the tunnel, at a cost of up to €10 million. The repairs will involve replacing cables and equipment damaged by the fire, as well as refurbishing the damaged section of the tunnel.
The financial impact of the fire is expected to be significant for Eurotunnel, which has already been struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company reported a loss of €286 million for the first half of 2021, compared to a profit of €62 million in the same period in 2020. The decline in revenue was largely due to reduced traffic, with the number of passengers and trucks using the tunnel falling by 26% and 14% respectively.
The closure of the north tunnel is expected to further reduce Eurotunnel's capacity and revenue, with the company warning that it may take up to three years for traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels. The closure is also likely to have a knock-on effect on freight and logistics companies, which rely on the tunnel as a key trade route between the UK and EU.
Eurotunnel's CEO, Yann Leriche, has acknowledged the financial pressures facing the company, stating that "the situation is tough, and we need to manage our resources carefully." He has also called for greater support from the French and UK governments, stating that Eurotunnel is a key infrastructure provider that should be eligible for financial assistance.
The French government has already offered some support, with President Emmanuel Macron visiting the tunnel site on 22nd September to announce a €50 million investment in the tunnel's security and safety infrastructure. The investment will include the installation of new sensors and cameras to detect and prevent potential incidents, as well as the recruitment of additional firefighters and security staff.
However, it remains to be seen whether the governments will provide further financial support to Eurotunnel. The UK government has been criticised for not providing enough support to the transport industry during the pandemic, and may be hesitant to provide additional funding to a company that is part-owned by a French consortium.
Eurotunnel is owned by Getlink, a company that is 50% owned by French infrastructure group Vinci and 35% owned by UK investment fund Goldman Sachs. The company has faced financial pressures before, including a debt crisis in 2017 that saw it renegotiate its loans and issue a new share offering to raise funds.
The fire in the Channel Tunnel has once again highlighted the financial challenges facing Eurotunnel. The company will need to balance the costs of repair and maintenance with the need to maintain revenue and avoid a further decline in traffic. It remains to be seen whether the French and UK governments will step in to provide financial support, or whether Eurotunnel will need to rely on its own resources to weather the storm.
