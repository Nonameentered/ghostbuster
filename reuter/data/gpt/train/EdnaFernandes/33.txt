LONDON - Glaxo Wellcome PLC has announced the acquisition of its Japanese joint venture, Glaxo Wellcome Japan Co. Ltd, in a deal worth $596 million. The move comes as the company looks to expand its operations in the lucrative Japanese market.
Glaxo Wellcome Japan was established in 1997 as a joint venture between Glaxo Wellcome and Japanese pharmaceutical company Taiho Corporation. The joint venture was responsible for the marketing and distribution of Glaxo Wellcome's drugs in Japan.
With the acquisition, Glaxo Wellcome will now have a wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan and will have complete control over its operations in the country. The move is seen as a strategic one as Japan is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical markets.
"Japan is a critical market for us, and this acquisition reinforces our commitment to the country," said Glaxo Wellcome CEO Emma Walmsley. "We believe that by having a wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan, we can better serve our customers and patients in the country."
Glaxo Wellcome has a strong presence in Japan, with a portfolio of drugs that includes treatments for respiratory and viral diseases, as well as vaccines and over-the-counter products. The company has also been investing in research and development in the country with the aim of developing new drugs for the Japanese market.
The acquisition is also expected to help Glaxo Wellcome cut costs in Japan. The company has been facing increasing competition from local players in the market and has had to lower prices for its drugs in order to remain competitive.
Glaxo Wellcome's move comes as other pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and AstraZeneca, have been scaling back their operations in Japan. The Japanese government has been trying to cut healthcare costs in the country, which has had an impact on pharmaceutical companies operating in the market.
The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Glaxo Wellcome has said that it does not expect the acquisition to have a material impact on its financial performance in 2021.
