A major fire in the Channel Tunnel caused Eurotunnel Plc traffic to be reduced to one third on Tuesday evening. The blaze broke out in a truck on a freight shuttle about 11 miles from the French entrance of the tunnel and caused significant disruptions to cross-Channel travel. There were no reports of any injuries.
The fire was initially reported around 6:45 pm GMT, with trains suspended in both directions. The fire started on a truck aboard a shuttle train heading towards Calais which was carrying 32 freight vehicles. The heat of the fire was intense, causing damage to the overhead cables.
The truck driver managed to escape unharmed and the shuttle evacuated with no injuries reported. The fire was finally put out at around 10 pm GMT by the French fire service. However, the aftermath of the blaze has created severe delays and disruptions for passengers and businesses.
Freight travel was badly affected and Eurotunnel Plc announced that traffic had been reduced to one third of normal levels. The situation meant that there were lengthy delays for drivers, with many stuck in long queues. Motorists stuck in the queues described seeing smoke billowing from the tunnel and witnesses reported the sound of explosions.
Eurotunnel Plc reported that the damage in the tunnel caused by the fire is extensive and the process of repairing the damaged equipment and cabling is complex and could take a significant amount of time. Despite this, the company assured its affected clients that staff are working tirelessly around the clock to ensure traffic flow is resumed to normal levels as soon as possible.
The company’s CEO, Jacques Gounon, apologized to passengers and businesses affected by the disruption and thanked them for their patience. “We deeply regret the impact this incident has had on our passengers, freight customers, and local communities, and we would like to thank everyone for their patience and understanding during this difficult time,” he stated.
Eurotunnel Plc, which operates the Channel Tunnel, has a high safety standard in place, and safety measures were immediately taken when the fire occurred. The tunnel is an important link between the UK and continental Europe, providing a vital transport route for freight and passenger traffic. Any disruption to Eurotunnel Plc services has significant economic impacts and is therefore taken very seriously.
A spokesman for the company said: “We would like to express our gratitude to all emergency services personnel who worked hard throughout the night to contain the fire and ensure the safety of all involved, including our staff and clients. We remain focused on the actions needed to get our customers moving again safely and as quickly as possible.”
The damage to the tunnel has been widely reported in the media and has raised questions about the potential impact of a similar incident on the UK's economy. The tunnel’s significance as a means of transporting freight may be felt most keenly as delays may cause goods and products to be delayed and ultimately affect businesses and the economy.
The incident is the latest to befall Eurotunnel Plc, which has experienced several total shutdowns of the tunnel due to incidents in the past. A notable example was a break-in by migrants in 2015, which led to several hundred of them attempting to use the tunnel to enter the UK illegally. The subsequent security operation led to several closures, causing lengthy delays for travellers and freight traffic.
In conclusion, the fire in the Channel Tunnel has caused significant disruptions to Eurotunnel Plc traffic and had economic impacts on businesses and the UK economy. Nevertheless, the company is working hard to resume normal traffic levels and ensure the safety of passengers and freight. Eurotunnel Plc remains a significant transport link between the UK and continental Europe, and its continued importance is clear in light of the recent events.
