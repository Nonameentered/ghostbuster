The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched an investigation into the former bosses of home improvement retailer, Wickes Plc, over accounting irregularities. The inquiry is set to scrutinize the financial statements of the company from the years 2014 to 2016, including the conduct of the individuals involved in the management of the company's accounts.
The company’s shares fell by 6% as the news of the SFO investigation spread. This comes as a blow to the DIY chain, a part of the Travis Perkins group, that has struggled in recent years, closing stores and reducing staff in an attempt to cut costs.
The SFO will investigate whether the company, with its former leadership, overstated its profits in the years leading up to 2016. This investigation will look into the accounting practices used in the company’s financial statements and will determine if there is enough evidence for criminal prosecution.
The SFO confirmed that it is conducting the investigation under the Fraud Act 2006. The 2006 act criminalizes fraud and false representation, with individuals facing a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and/or an unlimited fine.
The former CEO of Wickes, John Carter, who served as the company's boss from 2014 to 2018, has stepped down from his current role as CEO of Travis Perkins to focus on preparing his defense. Carter was the mastermind behind the company's restructuring, including store closures and cutting jobs. Another former executive, David Savage, who was CFO of Wickes, has also been caught up in the investigation.
The SFO’s investigation is not the first time that Wickes has been in trouble over accounting. In 2011, the company was fined £7.5m by the Financial Conduct Authority over an accounting scandal that took place between 2002 and 2008. The current investigation is a reflection of the recent crackdown on corporate misconduct by the British authorities.
This news comes at a time when several UK companies have been investigated or held accountable for accounting and financial irregularities. In February this year, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) introduced a new penalty regime for corporate accountants. The new rules coincide with increasing efforts to hold corporations accountable for their actions, making it clear that any suspicious financial activities can have severe consequences.
Wickes has made several statements regarding the investigation, emphasizing that they are cooperating with the SFO. They further stated that their current management has no involvement or connection to the irregularities that are being investigated, and that their focus remains on providing quality products to their customers and delivering shareholder value.
