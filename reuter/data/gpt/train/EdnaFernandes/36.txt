In a surprise move, logistics firm Christian Salvesen has rejected a Â£1.1 billion takeover offer by Hays citing the offer undervaluing the company's true worth. The rejection comes after months of speculation and negotiations, with Hays making a hostile bid for the struggling logistics firm.
In their statement, Christian Salvesen's board of directors expressed confidence in the company's future and outlined a plan to create more value for its shareholders. The plan includes the distribution of a special dividend and a demerger of its core businesses.
The company's CEO, Andrew Coppel, said, "We believe that the offer made by Hays undervalues our company and that our shareholders deserve to receive a higher price for their investment. We are confident in our ability to execute our strategic plan and create value for our shareholders through a demerger of our core businesses and the distribution of a special dividend."
The demerger plan would see a separation of Christian Salvesen's logistics and food divisions, allowing each to operate as an independent company. The company believes that this would provide greater focus and flexibility, allowing each business to pursue growth opportunities without being constrained by the other.
The special dividend, which would be paid out to shareholders, is expected to provide additional value to investors. Coppel added that the proposed plan would give shareholders more options and greater flexibility, allowing them to choose whether to hold onto their investment in the logistics or food division or to sell.
Analysts have praised the move, with many attributing the rejection of Hays' offer as a sign that the company is confident in its future. Christian Salvesen's shares climbed by more than 5% following the announcement.
The move has also been seen as a victory for the company's institutional investors who had been calling for a separation of the company's core businesses and a better return on investment for shareholders.
Despite the rejection of the takeover offer, Hays has indicated that it remains interested in acquiring Christian Salvesen. However, the company's board has made it clear that it would only consider an offer that reflects the true value of the business and provides a better return for its shareholders.
