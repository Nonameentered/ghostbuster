LucasVarity, the global engineering company, has announced a major restructuring plan that includes disposing of 13 non-core businesses and cutting 3,000 jobs over the next two years. The plan is aimed at streamlining operations and increasing profitability in an increasingly competitive market.
The announcement was made by LucasVarity's CEO, Peter Ashworth, who stated that the decision was not an easy one but was necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the company. He stated that the non-core businesses were not contributing to the company's profits and were a drain on resources.
The 13 non-core businesses that are to be disposed of include several small manufacturing units and service centers that are not part of the company's core operations. The restructuring plan will also include a reduction in workforce, with 3,000 jobs set to be cut over the next two years. This will primarily affect non-core business units and support functions.
The restructuring plan is part of LucasVarity's strategy to focus on its core operations and strengthen its position in the global engineering market. The company will continue to provide cutting-edge technologies and services to its customers and will invest in research and development to maintain its competitive edge.
The announcement has been welcomed by analysts, who see it as a positive step towards improving the company's financial performance. LucasVarity has been struggling to maintain profitability in recent years due to a slowdown in the global economy and increased competition in the engineering market.
The restructuring plan will take some time to implement, with the disposal of non-core businesses expected to take up to 18 months. However, the company has assured employees that it will do everything possible to minimize the impact of the job cuts and will provide support and assistance to those affected.
In conclusion, LucasVarity's announcement of a major restructuring plan is a bold move aimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability of the company. The plan is necessary to improve profitability, focus on core operations, and maintain competitiveness in a challenging market. The company's commitment to supporting employees affected by the job cuts is commendable and reflects its values as a responsible corporate citizen.
