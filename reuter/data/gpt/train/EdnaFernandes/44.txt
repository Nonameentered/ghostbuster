Richard Branson and his Virgin Group have won the franchise to operate the East Coast rail line in the UK, beating out a bid from a joint venture by Stagecoach and French rail operator SNCF.
The franchise, which begins in March 2015, is expected to last eight years and generate approximately $5.1 billion in revenue for the government. As part of the deal, the Virgin Group has pledged to invest a total of $420 million in the rail line, including new trains and improved services.
"We are delighted to have been awarded the East Coast franchise, which is an important next step in expanding our transport offering to customers," Branson said in a statement.
The East Coast line runs from London to Scotland and serves major cities such as Newcastle, Edinburgh, and York. It is currently operated by state-run East Coast Trains. Under the new franchise, the line will be renamed Virgin Trains East Coast.
One key aspect of Virgin's plan for the franchise is to introduce a new fleet of trains, which will be designed specifically for the East Coast line. The company has already begun discussions with manufacturers and says that the new trains will be introduced from 2018.
In addition to the new trains, the Virgin Group has also promised to invest in upgrades to existing facilities and to introduce new services, such as free Wi-Fi and improved catering. The company says that it plans to create 1,000 new jobs as a result of the franchise.
"We want to deliver a truly world-class experience for customers using Virgin Trains East Coast, and we will be investing heavily in new trains, improved stations and better services," Branson said.
The decision to award the franchise to the Virgin Group has been met with some criticism, however. Labour Party politicians have accused the government of prioritizing profits over public service, while the Rail, Maritime and Transport union has complained that the franchise should have been returned to public ownership.
Branson has defended the decision, noting that Virgin has a successful track record in the rail industry. The company already operates the West Coast and CrossCountry lines in the UK and has previously won other rail franchises in the past.
"We are confident that our experience and successful track record in running other rail franchises will help us deliver a great service for customers on the East Coast line," he said.
The news of the franchise win has been seen as a further example of the growing influence of the Virgin Group in the UK economy. The company already operates in a range of sectors, including air travel, telecommunications, and media.
