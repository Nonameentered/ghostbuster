UK-based transportation company, Stagecoach, announced its annual earnings results and they were nothing short of impressive. The company's profits saw a staggering 127% rise, from £38.5 million to £87.2 million ($110.6 million to $127.4 million), in the year ended 27 April 2019. This remarkable performance has sent the company's shares to record high levels, making shareholders very happy indeed.
The rise in profits has been attributed to the company's focus on enhancing services to passengers and innovative technology solutions to drive operational efficiencies. Moreover, a major part of the profit surge has stemmed from Stagecoach's rail business, which has performed exceptionally well, and has set revenue growth records in the process.
Though Stagecoach may operate buses and ferries, its rail business has been the most lucrative of the bunch. The company operates a number of franchise networks throughout the UK, including the South West Trains franchise, which connected destinations such as London, Exeter, and Brighton. According to the company's annual report, Stagecoach's rail division saw revenues grow 11.8% to £2.04 billion ($2.35 billion).
“Our success is underpinned by committed people who are passionate about running great transportation services for our customers and communities,” said Stagecoach Group Chief Executive, Martin Griffiths. Mr. Griffiths also added that the company's strong performance had come despite challenges in the market, such as the impact of Brexit, and would be used to strengthen the core transport business overall.
The company has been revamping the technology systems used by its rail business, including the deployment of onboard wifi as well as a new passenger-facing application called 'Which Train?'. These advancements "help our customers access real-time information and book flexible tickets more easily, so they can travel with confidence and convenience", said Mr. Griffiths.
Investors have already started reaping the rewards, as the company's share prices soared to record highs, increasing by over 12%. This came as a surprise to many, given the somewhat sluggish performance of the UK economy over the past year.
The transport company’s strong earnings results also come at a time when the UK is debating the nationalisation of some of the transportation companies. Both the Labour and Conservative parties have expressed support for the nationalisation of some operators, raising concerns among stakeholders. Stagecoach's impressive earnings results may help to allay such concerns.
All in all, Stagecoach's exceptional performance this year is a testament to the company's focus on customer needs, the introduction of appropriate technology and the use of innovative business processes. Going forward, the company is well positioned to continue to make positive contributions to the transportation industry and therefore the UK economy as a whole.
