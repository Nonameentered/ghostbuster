The UK construction industry is bracing itself for more spending cuts in infrastructure projects in the upcoming budget. With a total of £100 billion of infrastructure investment reduced to £89 billion, the sector is calling for new measures to boost growth and investment.
Industry leaders are warning that previous cuts have already hit the industry hard, with the number of new public sector projects at a record low. The latest projections suggest that there will be a further 10% reduction in public sector capital spending over the next five years, prompting concerns about lost jobs and economic growth.
Recent figures from the Construction Products Association indicate that the infrastructure sector has already experienced a downturn, falling into recession in the first half of 2019. The forecast for 2020 remains bleak, with the industry experiencing a 1.4% contraction.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) believes that the government's infrastructure projects should be a key priority in the next budget. With the UK's economic growth rate slowing, the industry believes that targeted public sector support for infrastructure projects will provide a much-needed boost to wider economic activity.
The CBI is calling for investment in a modernised transport and digital infrastructure system, improved housing and energy infrastructure, and a high-profile long-term plan for infrastructure investment, in order to support economic growth and improve productivity.
The construction industry is urging the government to provide reassurances, particularly as Brexit negotiations are creating an uncertain economic outlook. With policy makers struggling to finalise the Brexit deal and concerns about a potential no-deal scenario, the government may choose to delay spending for other priorities, which could further hit construction.
However, the chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, Sir John Armitt, has argued that there is broad consensus across the political spectrum that investment in infrastructure is essential for the UK's economic future. He believes that politicians need to invest in sustainable infrastructure to boost growth.
The government has announced a series of major infrastructure projects in recent years, including the construction of the HS2 railway from London to Birmingham and the Crossrail project in London. However, with the construction industry experiencing a recession and Brexit looming, the government will need to demonstrate long-term commitment and provide the assurance needed to enable the construction industry to grow and thrive for the benefit of the wider economy.
