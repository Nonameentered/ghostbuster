Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, one of the world's largest tobacco companies, has announced its plans to reduce its debt and focus on export growth. The company also revealed its intention to enter the Japanese market, which is the fourth-largest tobacco market in the world.
Imperial's move comes amid a challenging time for the tobacco industry, with declining cigarette sales in many developed countries due to increasing awareness about the health risks associated with smoking. However, the company is confident that it can overcome these challenges by focusing on growth in emerging markets, where cigarette consumption continues to rise.
To achieve its objectives, Imperial is looking to cut debt by raising up to Â£2 billion ($2.6 billion) from asset disposals and a rights issue. This move will help the company to reduce its net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 3.4 to 2.5, which will provide a stronger platform for growth and investment.
Imperial CEO Stefan Bomhard said in a statement, "Our strategy remains focused on achieving sustained growth in revenues and profits over the medium term, whilst also reducing our debt levels." He added that the company's priority is to "maximize value for shareholders."
Imperial's entry into the Japanese market could be a significant milestone for the tobacco company. Japan, which has a population of more than 126 million, is a mature market with a dominant player, Japan Tobacco Inc. However, there are still opportunities for new players to enter the market and gain a share of the growing demand for cigarettes, particularly among younger consumers.
Imperial's entry into the Japanese market will be through a joint venture with Japanese cigarette maker JT International (JTI), which is owned by Japan Tobacco. The joint venture will allow Imperial to leverage JTI's local expertise and distribution network.
Bomhard said, "The Japanese market offers a unique opportunity for us to establish a presence in a large, high-margin, and growing market. Our joint venture with JT International, which has a strong track record of success in the region, will provide the ideal platform to enter the market."
Imperial is expected to benefit from the Japanese market's higher margins, which are driven by the country's high tobacco taxes. The company also believes that it can differentiate itself from other brands by offering premium products that appeal to Japanese consumers' preferences for high-quality and flavored cigarettes.
Imperial's expansion into Japan is part of the company's broader strategy to focus on high-growth markets in Asia and other emerging economies. The company has already made significant investments in countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Myanmar, where it has established a leading position in the local tobacco markets.
Imperial's focus on emerging markets is in line with the tobacco industry's broader shift towards countries where smoking rates are still high and regulations are less stringent. Imperial is also investing in non-combustible products such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products, which have gained popularity among smokers looking for alternatives to traditional cigarettes.
The news of Imperial's entry into the Japanese market has been well-received by investors, with the company's share price rising by 3.5% after the announcement. Industry analysts have also praised the move, describing it as a smart strategy for the tobacco company.
Peter Little, an analyst at investment bank Berenberg, said in a research note, "Imperial's decision to pursue a joint venture in Japan with JTI marks a significant strategic move, and one that plays well into the company's ongoing focus on growth in emerging markets."
Overall, Imperial Tobacco Group's plans to cut debt and focus on export growth, including in the Japanese market, are likely to enable the company to tap into new revenue streams and sustain long-term growth. The move also reflects the wider trend in the tobacco industry towards emerging markets and non-combustible products, as companies seek to adapt to changing consumer preferences and regulatory environments.
