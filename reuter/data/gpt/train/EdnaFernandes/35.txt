British logistics company Christian Salvesen has announced its demerger with Aggreko, the world's leading supplier of temporary power solutions. The decision was made to help both companies focus on their core businesses and improve their operations. Christian Salvesen also revealed a special payout of 150 million pound to its shareholders, indicating its strong financial position amid the tough economic times.
Under the terms of the demerger, Christian Salvesen will keep its logistics, warehousing, and distribution services while Aggreko will be spun off as a separate publicly traded company. Aggreko delivers power solutions for various industries, including events, construction, and utilities. Christian Salvesen stated that the demerger will allow both companies to pursue their respective strategies and create value for shareholders.
Tony Quinlan, Christian Salvesen's Chief Executive Officer, said, "The demerger should allow Aggreko to improve its focus on its core business and increase management flexibility in order to take advantage of growth opportunities." He added that the separation would also enable Christian Salvesen to create more value for its customers and shareholders by strengthening its logistics capabilities and expanding into new markets.
The decision to demerge was supported by a robust financial performance for both companies. Christian Salvesen's revenue for the year ended March 2021 was reported to be 1.5 billion pounds, while Aggreko's was 1.4 billion pounds. Andrew Darke, Christian Salvesen's Chairman, acknowledged that the group had benefited from strong demand for its services and prudent financial management. As a result, Christian Salvesen will be paying out 150 million pounds to shareholders in the form of a special dividend.
"The Board is delighted to return value to our shareholders in this form," Darke said. "The Company's strong cash position allows us to make this significant special dividend payment while maintaining a healthy balance sheet post-demerger." The payout equates to around 55 pence per share, and Christian Salvesen's share price rose by 5% after the announcement.
The demerger is expected to be completed by the end of this year, subject to shareholder approval. The two companies will work together to ensure a smooth transition and minimize disruption to their businesses and customers. Aggreko's CEO, Hana Al Rostamani, expressed her confidence in the move, saying, "The demerger will provide Aggreko with the necessary flexibility to focus on its strategic priorities and allocate capital more effectively."
In conclusion, the demerger of Christian Salvesen and Aggreko is a significant development for both companies and their shareholders. The decision reflects management's confidence in the businesses' prospects and the potential for creating value by streamlining operations. The special payout is a testament to Christian Salvesen's financial strength and commitment to rewarding its shareholders.
