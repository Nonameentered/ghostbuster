The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a formal investigation into the former bosses of home improvement and DIY retailer Wickes Plc after an accounting scandal that was worth tens of millions of pounds.
The news comes after the company, which was founded in the UK in the 1970s, was accused of overstating profits by tens of millions of pounds in 2016, leading to an investigation by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).
The FRC's initial investigation found that Wickes had misstated its accounts by approximately £4 million in 2014 and £20 million in 2015. The company had been under investigation by the FRC for over three years when the SFO stepped in.
The SFO, which has the power to bring criminal charges, said in a statement that it "has opened a criminal investigation into suspected fraud, following a complex and lengthy investigation into the accounting practices of Wickes Plc and its former finance directors."
The SFO's investigation will focus on the accounts of the company between 2014 and 2016 as well as the conduct of its former bosses, including former finance directors who are no longer with the company. It is not clear how long the investigation will take.
Wickes Plc was founded in the UK in the early 1970s and is now one of the country's largest home improvement and DIY retailers. The company operates more than 200 stores across the UK and Ireland and is known for its range of products, including home and garden equipment, furniture, and lighting.
The company's shares have fallen by over 70% in the last two years, with many investors selling their stakes in the company as a result of the accounting scandal. Wickes has been privately owned since 2011 when it was bought out by Travis Perkins, a major supplier of building and plumbing materials in the UK.
The news of the SFO's investigation into Wickes Plc has been met with concern by shareholders and investors who are already worried about the company's financial situation. The investigation could also have wider implications for the retail industry as a whole, with increased scrutiny on accounting practices and corporate governance.
In 2019, a UK parliamentary committee called for a complete overhaul of the country's audit industry following a string of high-profile accounting scandals, including the collapse of construction firm Carillion. The Wickes Plc investigation is the latest in a series of investigations by regulators into the accounting practices of major companies in the UK.
