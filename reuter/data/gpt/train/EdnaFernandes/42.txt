The British government has referred the proposed merger between two of Europe's largest ferry companies to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for an investigation into whether the deal would harm competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.
P&O, which is owned by Dubai-based DP World, and Stena Line, which is owned by the Swedish Stena AB, announced their intention to merge in June 2021. The companies, which operate a range of passenger and freight ferry services between the UK and several European countries, said the merger would create a stronger, more efficient business that could better compete with rivals.
However, concerns have been raised about the impact of the merger on consumers, particularly in the freight market where P&O and Stena Line are major players. The government's decision to refer the merger to the CMA reflects these concerns and aims to ensure that the deal does not result in a reduction in competition that harms consumers.
A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: "The proposed merger between P&O Ferries and Stena Line raises important questions about competition in the ferry sector. After careful consideration, the government has decided to refer the case to the CMA for a Phase 2 investigation to determine whether the merger will result in a substantial lessening of competition."
The CMA now has up to six months to carry out its investigation and provide a final report to the government. During this period, it will consider a range of factors, including the level of competition between P&O and Stena Line, the impact of the merger on prices and quality of service for consumers, and the extent to which the deal would reduce choice for customers.
If the CMA finds that the merger would lead to a substantial lessening of competition, it could recommend remedies such as a requirement for P&O and Stena Line to divest certain assets or operate in a different way to address competition concerns.
Commenting on the government's decision, a spokesperson for Stena Line said: "While we are surprised and disappointed by the referral of our proposed merger with P&O Ferries to the CMA, we welcome the opportunity to engage constructively with the authority to ensure a thorough and expeditious review of the transaction."
A spokesperson for DP World, which owns P&O, added: "We respect the government's decision to refer the merger with Stena Line to the CMA for analysis and look forward to the outcome of the investigation."
The proposed merger between P&O and Stena Line comes at a time of significant change in the ferry industry, with companies facing increased competition from low-cost airlines and new ferry operators. The Covid-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on the sector, with passenger numbers reduced and supply chain disruptions caused by border closures.
Investigations into proposed mergers are not uncommon in the UK, with the CMA recently conducting an in-depth review of the proposed merger between Asda and Sainsbury's supermarkets. The merger was eventually blocked due to concerns about its impact on competition and prices for consumers.
The CMA is expected to provide an initial report on the P&O-Stena Line merger within the next few weeks, with a final decision to follow in the coming months.
