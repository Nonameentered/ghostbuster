The Virgin Group, owned by billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson, has won the CrossCountry rail franchise in the United Kingdom. The franchise, which operates trains across the country, was previously held by Arriva UK Trains Ltd.
As part of its bid, the Virgin Group has pledged to invest £250 million ($329 million) in new trains and services. The company plans to introduce new and refurbished trains on the franchise, as well as improving the existing services offered to passengers.
Branson, who has previously owned and operated a number of successful businesses including Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Galactic, said he was thrilled to have won the franchise. "We're delighted to have been awarded the CrossCountry rail franchise and are looking forward to bringing our experience in transport to this exciting new venture," he said.
The new trains that will be introduced by the Virgin Group will be fitted with improved Wi-Fi and charging stations for electronic devices. The company says they will also be more spacious, with greater legroom and more comfortable seating.
The trains will also feature a new service that will allow passengers to order food and drinks directly to their seats through a mobile app. In addition, the Virgin Group plans to introduce a new loyalty scheme for frequent travellers on the franchise.
Despite the ambitious plans for the new franchise, the Virgin Group has faced some criticism from unions. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has accused the company of planning to "slash jobs, working conditions and safety" on the franchise.
However, the Virgin Group has denied these claims, saying it is committed to improving the franchise while maintaining high standards of safety and employment conditions. "We're looking forward to working closely with the unions and our employees to deliver the best possible service for our passengers," said a spokesperson for the company.
The CrossCountry franchise is one of the largest in the United Kingdom, with trains running across the country from Edinburgh to Penzance. The franchise is expected to generate around £1 billion ($1.3 billion) in revenue over the next eight years.
The decision to award the franchise to the Virgin Group was made by the Department for Transport, which said it was impressed by the company's plans and experience in the transport sector. "We believe that the Virgin Group will bring new and innovative ideas to the CrossCountry franchise, which will benefit passengers across the country," said a spokesperson for the department.
The new franchise is set to begin in December 2019, and the Virgin Group says it is planning to work closely with existing staff and train operators to ensure a smooth transition. The company will be operating the franchise through a joint venture with Stagecoach Group, another UK-based transport operator.
Overall, the announcement that the Virgin Group has won the CrossCountry franchise has been met with a mixed response. While some have welcomed the company's plans for improved services and facilities, others have raised concerns about job security and employment conditions. The success or failure of the new franchise will likely depend on how well the Virgin Group is able to balance these competing priorities.
