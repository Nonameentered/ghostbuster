Virgin Rail has announced plans to invest £250 million in new rolling stock after winning the CrossCountry franchise. The new trains will be used on routes throughout the UK and will enhance passenger experience with improved seating and on-board facilities, as well as reducing carbon emissions.
The investment will see the introduction of 126 new carriages manufactured by British train-builder, Bombardier, and will be rolled out in stages, with the first trains due to come into service in 2021. The new carriages will be built to modern specifications, making them more energy efficient, and will feature air conditioning, Wi-Fi and increased luggage space.
CrossCountry is one of the UK’s largest long-distance train operators, running trains from Aberdeen to Penzance, and from Cardiff to Newcastle. The new rolling stock is expected to increase capacity on these routes, provide a higher level of comfort for passengers and improve reliability.
Virgin Rail Head, Patrick McCall said, “Virgin is renowned for delivering a fantastic customer experience, and these new trains will provide passengers with more seats, better facilities and a more environmentally friendly journey. Our investment in the UK rail industry shows our continued commitment to the sector and our desire to provide the best possible service to our customers.”
This news has been welcomed by industry experts and passenger groups alike, with the new trains expected to improve the passenger experience, increase capacity and reliability, and ultimately support economic growth across the UK.
