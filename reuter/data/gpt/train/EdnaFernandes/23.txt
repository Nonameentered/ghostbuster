Imperial Tobacco has revealed that its former parent company, Imperial Brands, rejected a takeover offer due to the low price. The tobacco company had approached Imperial Brands with a proposal earlier this year, but the bid was dismissed after the parent company deemed the offer too low. Imperial Tobacco had hoped that the merger would provide significant cost savings and synergies. This news comes as Imperial Tobacco has recently announced its plans to rebrand as Imperial Brands later this year, in a move that aims to reflect the diversity of its business and shift away from its traditional tobacco roots.
