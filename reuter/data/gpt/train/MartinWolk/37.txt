Microsoft Corp, the technology giant under the leadership of CEO Bill Gates, is set to build on its momentum from 1997 with new product launches and strong earnings growth, according to company officials and industry analysts.
The company, which had a tumultuous year in 1997 with the launch of its Windows 95 operating system and antitrust scrutiny from the US government, saw its earnings surge by more than 40% in the third quarter of 1997. This was largely due to growth in its Office applications suite and sales of its Windows NT server software.
With this success under its belt and a renewed focus on innovation, Microsoft is looking to capitalize on the opportunities of the emerging digital economy.
The company's most highly anticipated product launch for 1998 is Windows 98, the next generation of its flagship operating system. Windows 98 promises improved stability, enhanced multimedia capabilities, and better Internet integration.
According to industry analysts, Windows 98 could be the catalyst for a wave of new PC purchases and upgrades, particularly for consumers looking to take advantage of the Internet. This would be a boon for Microsoft, which earns the majority of its revenue from operating system sales.
Microsoft is also heavily invested in the Internet, with its Internet Explorer browser and MSN online service. The company is looking to expand its Internet presence with the launch of "NetDocs," a suite of online productivity tools that will compete directly with Google Docs.
"NetDocs is an important part of our strategy to provide innovative solutions for consumers and businesses in the Internet era," Gates said in a statement.
The launch of NetDocs will also allow Microsoft to further promote its Windows operating system, as users will need a Windows-powered PC to access the service.
In addition to new product launches, Microsoft is also working to improve its existing offerings. The company is dedicating more resources to its Office applications suite and working on new features and enhancements for its popular Excel, Word, and PowerPoint programs.
Microsoft's earnings growth in 1997 was also due in part to its enterprise software division, which includes its SQL Server and Exchange email server products. The company is looking to build on this success by expanding its offerings in the server and database markets.
One area of focus for Microsoft is the development of "middleware" software that connects different types of applications, allowing businesses to integrate their IT systems more easily. This will be a key growth area in the enterprise market, as more companies are looking to streamline their operations and reduce costs.
Despite its successes in 1997 and promising outlook for 1998, Microsoft still faces challenges. The US government's antitrust lawsuit against the company is ongoing, and competitors such as Netscape and Sun Microsystems are vying for a share of the Internet and enterprise markets.
However, Microsoft's strong financial position and proven ability to innovate and adapt give it a competitive advantage over its rivals.
"We are focused on delivering the best products and services to our customers and building a sustainable business for the future," Gates said. "We are confident that we can continue to grow and prosper in the years to come."
