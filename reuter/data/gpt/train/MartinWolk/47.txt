Redmond-based tech giant Microsoft is expecting a sequential rise of revenues and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of this year, according to Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. The news comes after the company posted strong second-quarter earnings earlier this year.
Hood highlighted Microsoft's position when she spoke to investors earlier this month, stating that the company is set to see further growth in the latter half of 2021. She acknowledged that COVID-19 is still causing uncertainty, but she believes the company is on track to report a positive performance.
The CFO cited several things behind the expected growth in earnings, including Microsoft's Azure cloud computing business, the gaming industry, and LinkedIn. Hood said she is optimistic about the future of these segments and expects them to continue to perform well.
During the second quarter, Microsoft reported a net income of $16.5 billion, an increase of 47% from the previous year. Revenue for the period reached $43.1 billion, up 17% compared to the same period in the previous year.
Microsoft's cloud computing business was once again the standout performer, with revenues from Azure increasing by 50% year-on-year. The company also reported an increase in online gaming revenues, thanks to the continued growth of its Xbox Game Pass subscription.
The expected growth in earnings from LinkedIn, the professional networking site that Microsoft acquired in 2016, also played a part in the expected rise in earnings. Hood said that LinkedIn had seen good growth throughout the pandemic, and the company expects that to continue in the latter half of 2021.
Despite the positive news, there may be headwinds ahead for Microsoft. Like all tech companies, Microsoft is facing increased scrutiny from regulators around the world. Hood acknowledged this and said the company was working to address any potential issues.
She also said that Microsoft is focused on addressing the global chip shortage, which is impacting the tech industry as a whole. Hood acknowledged that the shortage has caused supply chain problems for Microsoft, and the company is working to mitigate the impact.
In summary, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood expects the company to report a sequential rise in earnings and revenues for Q3 and Q4 2021. The company's strong position in cloud computing, gaming, and LinkedIn are expected to drive the growth, although the company is also facing headwinds from regulators and supply chain issues.
