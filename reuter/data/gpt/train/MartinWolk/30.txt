Boeing's planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas set to make it a leading military contractor
Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, is set to become a leading military contractor after the planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a leading defense contractor. The $13 billion acquisition, announced in December 1996, will create a company with a significant presence in both commercial and defense markets, and is expected to increase Boeing's standing among the world's largest defense contractors.
The acquisition is expected to be completed in August 1997, subject to regulatory approvals. Once completed, the combined company will have more than 231,000 employees and annual revenues of more than $48 billion. Boeing's commercial aircraft division, which generated revenues of nearly $28 billion in 1996, will be combined with McDonnell Douglas' commercial transport division to create the world's largest producer of commercial aircraft, with an estimated market share of 60 percent.
Boeing will also gain access to McDonnell Douglas' extensive defense product line, which includes F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, and Apache and Chinook helicopters, among other products. The combined company will be better-positioned to compete for major defense contracts, particularly as the U.S. Department of Defense seeks to consolidate its suppliers.
The acquisition has been widely regarded as a strategic move by Boeing to diversify its business and reduce its reliance on the cyclical commercial aviation market. Boeing's commercial aircraft business has experienced significant swings in demand over the past few years, leading to fluctuations in the company's financial performance. In contrast, the defense market is seen as a more stable source of revenue, although it also faces challenges related to budget pressures and changing global security threats.
Boeing's management has expressed confidence in the ability of the company to successfully integrate McDonnell Douglas' operations and product lines. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Boeing CEO Phil Condit said, "We have been engaging in dialogue for many months with McDonnell Douglas, and we are highly confident in our ability to achieve a smooth and successful integration."
The acquisition has also drawn the attention of industry analysts, many of whom believe that the combined company will likely see increased competitiveness in the defense market. According to Loren Thompson, a defense industry analyst with the Lexington Institute, "This acquisition is going to make Boeing a major player in defense contracting, particularly given its scale and level of expertise."
Critics of the acquisition have raised concerns about the potential impact on competition in the aerospace industry. Some have argued that the acquisition could lead to fewer suppliers and higher prices for defense products. However, Boeing has argued that the acquisition will actually increase competition, as it will allow the company to offer a wider range of products and services to customers.
In addition to redefining Boeing's business profile, the acquisition of McDonnell Douglas is also expected to have significant implications for the companies' employees and communities. In the short term, the acquisition is likely to result in some job losses and consolidation of operations. However, Boeing has expressed its commitment to minimizing the impact on employees and to continuing to invest in the communities where the two companies operate.
The acquisition also brings up issues related to the broader defense industry. The defense industry is one of the largest industries in the world, with companies in the United States alone generating more than $1 trillion in annual revenue. Defense companies have traditionally been thought of as a core part of national security efforts and have been tightly integrated with the military. The Boeing-McDonnell Douglas acquisition highlights the changing nature of the defense industry, with companies increasingly looking to diversify their business and establish positions in both commercial and defense markets.
In conclusion, this acquisition is a significant strategic move by Boeing, which aims to diversify its business and create a leading player in both the commercial and defense markets. The acquisition is expected to be completed in August 1997 and has drawn the attention of industry analysts and critics alike. While some have expressed concerns about the impact of the acquisition on competition and jobs, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have both expressed confidence in their ability to integrate their operations and products lines, and to create a stronger, more competitive company. As the defense industry continues to evolve, this acquisition is likely to be seen as a turning point in the industry's history.
