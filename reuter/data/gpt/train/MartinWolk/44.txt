Redmond, Washington - Despite facing tough comparisons and a sales slowdown ahead of the release of its software bundle upgrade, Microsoft Corp has reported modest earnings growth in the second quarter. The software giant's fiscal Q2 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 1% to $36.9 billion, beating analysts' expectations.
The company's net income for the quarter was $11.6 billion, up 38% from the same period last year, while earnings per share came in at $1.51. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue, which includes its Azure cloud platform and Office 365, also saw impressive growth, increasing by 39% to $16.7 billion.
"We delivered strong second-quarter results, with commercial cloud revenue accelerating to $16.7 billion, up 39% year over year," said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. "Our durable growth trajectory reflects the resilience and strength of our business model."
However, the tech giant's revenue from personal computing, which includes its Windows operating system and Surface devices, saw a decline of 5% to $15.1 billion. This was due to a slowdown in sales ahead of the release of the Windows 11 software upgrade later this year.
"We are seeing a slowdown in our Windows OEM and Surface businesses ahead of the Windows 11 launch, which is expected to fuel growth later this year," said Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer.
Despite the decline in personal computing revenue, Microsoft's gaming revenue increased by 40% to $5 billion, driven by strong sales of its Xbox consoles and games. The company's LinkedIn business, which it acquired in 2016, also saw revenue growth of 23% to $2.9 billion.
Overall, Microsoft's results were seen as a positive sign for the technology industry, which has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's strong cloud revenue, in particular, has been seen as evidence of businesses' ongoing shift to remote work and digital transformation.
"We continue to benefit from our strategic investments and growth in our cloud services, as well as our expanding portfolio of high-growth businesses," said Nadella.
Looking ahead, Microsoft expects to continue its growth trajectory, with revenue for the current quarter expected to be between $41.7 billion and $42.5 billion. However, the company warned that it may face challenges in the coming months due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic on global supply chains and consumer spending.
"We are closely monitoring the dynamic situation related to COVID-19 and are working to mitigate its impact on our operations and supply chain," said Hood. "However, there is still uncertainty regarding the future course of the pandemic, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely."
