European aircraft manufacturer Airbus has reached a milestone with its restructuring agreement seen as a step forward, but experts say it poses no threat to rival company Boeing’s dominance in the aerospace industry. The deal, announced earlier this week, will involve the consolidation of its corporate structure into one central unit, resulting in the loss of around 1,700 jobs in Europe.
The restructuring aims to provide the company with a leaner and more agile structure, allowing it to be more competitive in the market and tackle the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused major setbacks to the aviation industry. The move is part of Airbus’ plan to cut costs, increase production, and reduce the development of new planes in response to the drop in demand from airlines amid the pandemic.
Industry experts have welcomed the move, noting that it will support the stability of Airbus and allow the company to be more efficient in production. However, analysts also emphasized that the agreement does not pose any significant threat to Boeing’s market share.
“While this development is positive news for Airbus, it does not represent a game-changer in the competitive landscape of the aerospace industry. Boeing continues to dominate the industry, and despite its struggles, it remains a significant player in the field,” said aviation expert David Bazzetta.
Boeing has faced several setbacks in recent years, including production delays and the ongoing grounding of its 737 MAX aircraft after two fatal crashes. However, the company still holds the largest market share in the aerospace sector, with a current backlog of aircraft orders valued at over $363 billion.
Airbus, on the other hand, has witnessed a steady growth in recent years, with the company delivering a record 863 aircraft in 2019 alone. The company has also overtaken Boeing in terms of new orders for a number of years, including 2019.
Nonetheless, industry insiders believe that both companies are on equal footing, with each having its own market strengths and weaknesses. Experts have noted that Boeing has an advantage in the commercial airplane market, while Airbus has a stronger position in the defense sector.
Despite the restructuring agreement, Airbus is facing several challenges that could hinder its growth and market competitiveness. The ongoing pandemic has caused a significant drop in demand for air travel, which has led to a reduction in the number of aircraft orders.
Additionally, the company is also facing production delays for its A320neo and A330neo planes, which are critical to its future growth plans. Another challenge for the company is the ongoing trade dispute between the US and the EU, which could result in tariffs on aircraft imports.
In conclusion, the Airbus restructuring agreement represents a positive development for the company, allowing it to become more agile and competitive in the current market. However, the deal does not pose any significant threat to Boeing’s dominance in the aerospace sector.
