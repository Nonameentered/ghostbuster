Seattle, WA - Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN), the American department store chain, reported a 16% increase in earnings for the third quarter ended October 30, 2021, beating analysts' expectations. 
The company's net earnings for the quarter were $142 million, or $0.95 per share, up from $120 million, or $0.76 per share, in the same quarter last year. The increase in earnings was driven by strong performance in the company's digital sales, which increased by 30% compared to the third quarter of 2020. 
Nordstrom's total revenue for the quarter was $3.89 billion, up by 8.9% from $3.57 billion in the same period last year. The company's comparable sales (which includes both its physical stores and online sales) increased by 11.3%, driven by a 13% increase in sales at Nordstrom's full-price stores. 
"We are pleased with our third-quarter results and the progress we are making in our business," said Erik Nordstrom, Chief Executive Officer of Nordstrom Inc. "Our team's focus on providing an exceptional customer experience in-store and online continues to drive higher levels of engagement and loyalty."
The company's digital sales were particularly strong during the quarter. The company's online sales increased by 30% compared to the same period last year, and Nordstrom.com accounted for almost a third of the company's sales during the quarter. 
Nordstrom has been investing in its digital capabilities and expanding its online shopping options over the past few years. The company offers online ordering with in-store pickup, curbside pickup, and same-day delivery in certain areas. 
Nordstrom also announced that it plans to open two stores in 2022, with one in New York City and one in Atlanta. The New York store will be located in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, and the Atlanta store will be in the Phipps Plaza shopping center. 
"We continue to see opportunities to grow our business in new markets and we are excited to bring our brand to these two key locations," said Erik Nordstrom. 
The company's earnings report comes at a time when many retailers are struggling due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Nordstrom's strong third-quarter performance, however, suggests that the company is weathering these challenges better than many of its competitors. 
Nordstrom's earnings report was well received by investors, with the company's stock price up 3.4% in after-hours trading.
