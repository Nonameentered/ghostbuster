Microsoft Corp. Reports "Blowout" Q2 Results and Hits Record Share Price Despite Warning of Slowing Growth in Fiscal 1998
Microsoft Corp. has reported a "blowout" second-quarter, exceeding Wall Street's expectations and smashing through its own forecasts. The technology giant's shares rose by 12 percent to a record high of $63.25, valuing the company at $255 billion, after announcing profits of $1.13 a share on revenue of $4.48 billion for the quarter ending December 31st. 
The incredible financial figures were, to an extent, expected, with most analysts anticipating a strong performance by Microsoft in the second quarter, which is typically the company's strongest revenue-generating period, as businesses and consumers purchase new computer equipment for the holiday season. However, the sheer size of the figures produced was far greater than even the most optimistic projections. 
Microsoft's chief financial officer, Greg Maffei, described the Q2 results as a "blowout" and stated that the company had achieved such unprecedented success through gains across all of its product lines and geographies. The most significant gains came from the company's Office Suite and Windows 95 operating system, which contributed heavily to the company's $2.28 billion in operating income for the period. 
Despite the exceptional Q2 results, some analysts have sounded a note of caution for the company, noting that Microsoft had included a warning of slowing growth in fiscal 1998 in its financial forecasts. The company has stated that it expects revenue growth to slow to between 16 and 20 percent for the year, compared to the 26 percent growth for fiscal 1997. 
The reasons cited for the expected slowdown include the maturation of the PC market, increasing competition in the software market, and potential regulatory and legal challenges to the company's business practices. 
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates acknowledged the potential challenges facing the company during a conference call with investors, but emphasized that the company would maintain its focus on innovation, developing new products, and expanding into new markets. "Our current performance is outstanding," Gates said. "But our goal is to continue to innovate, invest, and grow our business over the long term."
Despite the possibility of slowing growth and increased competition in the software market, investors appear overwhelmingly confident in Microsoft's ability to maintain its market dominance and continue posting impressive financial results. 
John Skeen, a technology analyst with Goldman Sachs, commented, "Microsoft continues to defy gravity. It's truly a remarkable performance by a remarkable company." 
Other analysts have also expressed admiration for the company's resilience and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Dan Niles of Robertson Stephens said, "Microsoft is a unique company with a unique culture. They have tremendous cash flow and the ability to pour it back into R&amp;D." 
Microsoft's performance in the second quarter has established the company as the clear leader in the software industry, with a market capitalization greater than the combined value of IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Digital Equipment Corp. 
The company's success has also been a boon to investors, with many analysts predicting that the stock price could climb as high as $80 or $90 by the end of the year. 
The Q2 results have also fueled speculation about Microsoft's potential acquisition targets. Many analysts believe the company is considering mergers or acquisitions in the telecommunications, media, and Internet industries, with Gates alluding to the possibility of "strategic investments" into new markets during the conference call with investors. 
Overall, Microsoft's exceptional Q2 performance has solidified the company's position as an innovator, leader, and major contributor to the global technology sector. Despite warnings of potential challenges and slowing growth, the company has demonstrated its resilience and ability to generate massive profits through its products and services. Microsoft has once again demonstrated its ability to create shareholder value, and investors are eagerly anticipating the company's next move.
