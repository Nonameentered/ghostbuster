Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, has had a record-breaking year with its 717 jets. The company dominated the world market in 1996, receiving orders worth $53 billion and hopes to maintain its success in 1997.
The Boeing 717, a medium-sized, twin-engine commercial jet, has been a major player in the aviation industry since its introduction in 1998. Its versatility and efficiency have made it a popular choice among various airlines worldwide, from low-cost carriers to full-service providers.

We are committed to working closely with our customers to deliver this outstanding airplane on time and on budget."
