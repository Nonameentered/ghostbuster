American Airlines is reportedly set to order $6bn worth of Boeing planes, according to sources close to the matter. This deal is seen as a massive shot in the arm for Boeing, which has been struggling in recent months due to its 737 Max jets being grounded worldwide.
The news of the deal has come as a surprise to many, as American Airlines has traditionally been a customer of both Boeing and Airbus. However, the airline is said to have been won over by the performance of Boeing's latest planes and the company's efforts to improve safety protocols and technology.
According to insiders, the order will include a mix of Boeing's 737 Max jets, as well as the 787 Dreamliner and the new 777X model. American Airlines is said to be planning to use these planes to replace its aging fleet and to expand its international routes.
The 737 Max jets have been at the center of controversy for Boeing, after two crashes that killed a total of 346 people were linked to faults in the plane's software. Boeing has since worked to fix the issues, and the planes are expected to return to service sometime later this year.
American Airlines is reportedly confident that the 737 Max will be safe to fly when it returns, and is said to have been reassured by Boeing's efforts to address the problems that led to the crashes.
The new 777X model is being touted as Boeing's answer to the Airbus A350, which has been a popular choice for airlines launching new long-haul routes. The 777X has a longer range and is more fuel-efficient than its predecessor, making it an attractive choice for airlines that want to fly further while keeping costs down.
American Airlines is said to have been impressed by the 777X's capabilities, and sees it as a key part of its strategy to expand its international operations. The airline currently operates a fleet of around 1,500 planes, but many of these are nearing the end of their useful lives and need to be replaced.
The deal with American Airlines is a crucial one for Boeing, which has seen its fortunes slump since the grounding of the 737 Max. The company has been working hard to get the planes back in the air, and recently announced that it had completed a series of test flights in which it demonstrated that the fixes it had made were effective.
However, Boeing still faces significant challenges, including ongoing investigations by regulators and lawsuits from families of the victims of the two crashes. The company has also been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused a sharp decline in air travel and forced airlines to cancel or postpone orders for new planes.
The news of the American Airlines deal has been welcomed by industry analysts and investors, who see it as a sign that Boeing may be turning the corner. The company's stock price has risen sharply in recent days, and many are hopeful that this order will be the first of many as airlines begin to recover from the pandemic and look to replace their aging fleets.
For American Airlines, the order is a bold move that signals its commitment to modernizing its operations and expanding its reach. The airline has been hit hard by the pandemic, with revenues down by more than 80% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.
However, the company's CEO, Doug Parker, has remained optimistic about the future, and has spoken about the need for airlines to focus on innovation and investment in order to weather the current crisis.
The deal with Boeing is a clear indication that American Airlines is following this path and sees a bright future ahead. As international travel begins to pick up again, the airline is positioning itself to take advantage of new routes and opportunities, while also ensuring that it has the most advanced and reliable planes in the sky.
