Microsoft Expected to Report Modest Earnings Growth Despite Tough Comparisons and Sales Slowdown Ahead of Software Upgrade
Microsoft is set to report its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, July 20th, and analysts are predicting a modest growth in profits despite tough comparisons to last year and a slowdown in sales ahead of its software upgrade.
The tech giant has had a remarkable year so far, with its share price rising 30% over the first six months of 2021. However, there are concerns that Microsoft's growth may be slowing down as demand for its products and services starts to taper off.
One area of particular concern is the company's flagship Windows operating system, which has been steadily losing market share to other platforms like macOS and Linux. Microsoft has been working on a major upgrade to the product, Windows 11, which is set to launch later this year. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to reinvigorate interest in the operating system.
Despite these challenges, analysts are still predicting a solid quarter for Microsoft. In fact, the company is expected to post a 20% increase in earnings compared to the same period last year, driven mainly by strong growth in its cloud computing division, Azure.
"The cloud business has been a real bright spot for Microsoft in recent years, and we expect that to continue this quarter," said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.
Azure has been one of Microsoft's fastest-growing businesses, with revenue increasing by 50% year-over-year in the previous quarter. The platform has been increasingly popular with businesses looking to migrate their operations to the cloud, and analysts say that demand for these services will continue to grow as more companies shift their focus to digital transformation.
However, Azure's growth is expected to slow down slightly this quarter as the company faces tougher comparisons to last year, when demand for cloud services surged due to the pandemic.
"We think Azure will still perform well, but it might not be the same level of growth that we saw in the previous quarter," said Ives.
Aside from Azure, Microsoft's other main revenue streams, such as its Office suite of products, are expected to perform solidly this quarter. However, there are concerns that sales of its Surface devices, particularly the Surface laptop, may have been impacted by a global shortage of computer chips.
"While the Surface business has been a bright spot for Microsoft in recent years, the supply chain issues that have affected the industry as a whole could have an impact on sales this quarter," said Ives.
Looking ahead, Microsoft is hoping that the launch of Windows 11 will help drive growth in its Windows division and boost overall sales. The new operating system promises to offer a more streamlined and seamless experience for users, with improved performance, a revamped design, and new features like the ability to run Android apps.
However, it remains to be seen whether Windows 11 will be enough to convince businesses and consumers to upgrade their systems, particularly given the ongoing chip shortage and the high cost of upgrading hardware.
"We're optimistic about the launch of Windows 11, but it's still early days, and we don't know how it will be received by consumers and businesses," said Ives.
Despite these uncertainties, Microsoft's strong financial position means that it is well-positioned to weather any challenges that may arise. The company has a strong balance sheet, with over $130 billion in cash reserves, and remains one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Overall, analysts are bullish on Microsoft's long-term prospects, given its position as a leader in cloud computing and its strong track record of innovation and adaptation.
"Microsoft is a company that has consistently demonstrated its ability to not only survive but thrive in a rapidly changing industry," said Ives. "We have every confidence that it will continue to be successful in the years ahead."
