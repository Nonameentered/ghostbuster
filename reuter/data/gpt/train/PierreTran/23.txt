The French airline, Air France, reports strong earnings for the first quarter of 2021. The company has announced their order of 20 new aircraft from both Boeing and Airbus in an effort to meet demand as the world recovers from the pandemic.
The airline has reported a net income of $473 million for the first quarter of 2021, up from a loss of $1.3 billion in the same period last year. Air France's revenue also increased by 4.5% from $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion. Air France-KLM has also reported that their passenger numbers have risen by 6% in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the same period last year.
Air France-KLM CEO, Benjamin Smith, attributed the improved earnings to the company's cost-saving measures, as well as a return in demand as restrictions loosen and the vaccination rollout continues. Smith states that the airline has benefited from growth in cargo revenue, which increased by over 90% in the first quarter of 2021.
These positive results from Air France present an uplift for the struggling airline industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. Air France-KLM, in particular, have received billions of euros in government aid to support them through the crisis. With the company’s return back to profitability, it signals a small step toward the path to recovery.
To prepare for the increased demand already being seen, Air France has ordered 20 new aircraft from both Boeing and Airbus. The airline has ordered 10 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner planes and 10 Airbus A350-900s over the next few years. These aircraft will help the company modernize its fleet and reduce its carbon footprint, allowing Air France to focus on sustainability as travel increases.
Air France is investing in the latest generation of aircraft to balance environmental performance with customer expectations, in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% per passenger, per kilometer by 2030. The aircraft that Air France has ordered from Boeing and Airbus will have a lower fuel consumption, enabling a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, pollutants, and noise.
Air France already has one of the largest fleets of aircraft in the world. The A350s that the airline has ordered are a welcomed addition as they have been specifically designed to operate with more fuel-efficiency and environmentally friendly engines. The Dreamliners are equally as appealing as they are proven fuel-efficient aircraft with modern cabin features.
The announcement of Air France's orders from both manufacturers is significant for Boeing, marking the company’s first order for their 787 Dreamliner since the pandemic struck. The demand for passenger travel in several regions has started to pick up, and as a result, airline companies are beginning to restock their fleets. In the first quarter of 2021, Boeing recorded its first net positive orders since 2019. Therefore, this order also highlights that there is a return of interest and optimism in the aviation industry, which is one of the critical measurements for economic growth and recovery.
The order from Air France is also a vote of confidence for Airbus, which has been struggling recently due to the pandemic's impact on passenger air travel. The new Airbus order indicates that the airline industry is slowly beginning to pick up again, and the demand for new planes is increasing as travel restrictions are eased.
Overall, the positive earnings from Air France, coupled with their orders for new aircraft, present an encouraging picture of the airline industry's current state. The orders from both Boeing and Airbus show that there is a demand for new planes, and airlines are optimistic about the future as travel restrictions begin to ease around the world. These aircraft will enable companies like Air France to modernize their fleets and improve their sustainability credentials, as they seek to rebuild from the pandemic.
