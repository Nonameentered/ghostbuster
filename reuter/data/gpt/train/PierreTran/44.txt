France's water supply market has been deemed insufficiently competitive by the country's national audit office. The review was conducted by the Court of Auditors, which is responsible for evaluating the use of public funds.
The audit found that the French water supply market is dominated by just a few large companies, with 80% of the market share held by just three of them, Veolia, Suez, and Saur. The limited competition has led to higher prices for consumers, with prices increasing by 15% between 2013 and 2018, which is three times the rate of inflation.
In addition to high prices, the report criticized the lack of transparency in the market. It found that contracts between local authorities and water supply companies were often opaque, making it difficult for consumers to understand what they are paying for.
The report also highlighted a lack of investment in infrastructure by the water companies. It found that many networks were old and in need of repair, which could lead to water quality issues in the future.
The report recommends that the French government takes action to increase competition in the market. One suggestion is to break up the large water companies to allow more players into the market. Another proposal is to simplify contracts between the companies and local authorities to make them more transparent.
The report also calls for more investment in infrastructure, which it says would not only improve water quality but also create jobs and boost the economy.
Environmental groups have welcomed the report's findings. They argue that the lack of competition in the water supply market has led to a lack of innovation in the sector, with companies focusing on maximizing profits rather than improving the quality of the water or reducing their environmental impact.
They also believe that the water supply market is ripe for disruption by new players who could bring new technologies and approaches to the sector, such as rainwater harvesting and decentralized water treatment systems.
The French government has not yet responded to the report's recommendations. However, the findings raise questions about the role of the public sector in the water supply market. France is one of the few countries in Europe where the supply of drinking water is still largely in the hands of privately-owned companies.
The report highlights the need for a more integrated approach to water management, with greater cooperation between the various stakeholders involved, including water supply companies, local authorities, and environmental groups.
Despite the challenges facing the French water supply market, it is clear that there is potential for change. With the right policies in place, the market could become more competitive, transparent, and sustainable, ensuring that consumers have access to safe and affordable water for years to come.
