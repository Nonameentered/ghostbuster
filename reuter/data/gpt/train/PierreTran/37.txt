In the world of aviation, Airbus and Boeing have been longtime rivals, continually battling it out for the title of the world's largest aircraft manufacturer. Recently, Airbus has made claims that they have overtaken Boeing in market share, a statement that has sparked controversy and disagreement from the US-based company.
According to Airbus, they have secured a total order book of 15,193 aircraft as of September 30, 2021. On the other hand, Boeing's order book currently sits at 9,895 aircraft, a notable difference between the two manufacturers. Airbus has stated that this achievement marks the first time in history that they have surpassed Boeing in market share, a feat that they attribute to their focus on sustainability, digitalisation and innovation.
This claim was brought up by Airbus Chief Commercial Officer, Christian Scherer, during an aviation conference in Toulouse, France, where he discussed the company's impressive growth over the years. He revealed that the additional orders have come from a diverse range of customers, including airlines, leasing companies, and private individuals, further highlighting the strong demand for Airbus aircraft.
Airbus has had a strong track record in recent times, delivering several successful aircraft models such as the A350 and A320neo. These planes offer customers a variety of benefits, including fuel efficiency, reduced carbon emissions, and enhanced passenger comfort. These advantages have helped Airbus win over customers and compete with the Boeing 787 and 737 Max models.
Despite Airbus' claims, Boeing has strongly refuted these numbers and stated that they still hold the title of the world's largest aircraft manufacturer. In a statement released following Scherer's announcement, Boeing revealed that they currently hold a 43% market share, while Airbus only has 38%.
Boeing's response came as a surprise to many, as it contradicted the claims made by Airbus. The US-based company has been facing major setbacks in recent years, with its 737 Max grounding following two fatal crashes that claimed hundreds of lives. As a result, Boeing has been struggling to recover and rebuild its reputation in the aviation industry, while also trying to compete with Airbus.
Boeing argued that Airbus' focus on deliveries instead of orders was misleading, as they gave no indication of how many of their aircraft have actually been delivered to customers. The company went on to state that Boeing had delivered over 10,000 aircraft, which is more than Airbus has delivered in its entire history, thereby reiterating their position as the world's largest aircraft manufacturer.
While the debate over market share continues, both Airbus and Boeing continue to excel in the aviation industry, offering customers a range of aircraft models that are more environmentally sustainable and technologically advanced than ever before. The competition between these two giants is expected to continue well into the future, with both companies competing fiercely to remain at the forefront of aviation innovation.
In the end, customers may be the ones who decide which manufacturer ultimately comes out on top, as they continue to make decisions about which aircraft they choose to fly on. Regardless of the outcome, however, one thing is for sure; the advancements made by Airbus and Boeing will no doubt continue to shape the industry for years to come.
