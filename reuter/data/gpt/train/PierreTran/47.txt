Canal Plus, the leading pay-TV provider in France, has announced its merger with Nethold, a Dutch media holding company, to form one of the world's largest pay-TV groups. The merger aims to expand their market share and take on other global streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime.
The new entity will be called Canal+ Group and will have operations in over 50 countries, including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Poland. Canal+ Group will have over 20 million subscribers, making it one of the biggest players in the pay-TV industry, globally.
The merger is expected to bring together the strengths of both companies, with Canal Plus bringing its TV production expertise and Nethold bringing its experience in pay-TV distribution. This will allow the new group to offer a broader range of content to its customers.
The move comes as traditional TV operators try to keep up with the changing landscape of digital streaming services, which have started to eat into their market shares. In recent years, subscription streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime have grown exponentially, with millions of users globally. The rise of these services has led to a decline in traditional pay-TV subscribers.
Canal+ Group hopes to counter this trend by offering exclusive content to its customers, targeting both French and international audiences. The group recently announced its collaboration with the BBC, as it plans to co-produce a drama series based on the bestselling book "The Spy Who Came In from the Cold" by John Le Carr√©.
In addition to the collaboration with the BBC, Canal+ Group will also continue to produce its original content, such as its popular series "The Bureau." The group has also secured exclusive broadcasting rights for major sporting events such as the UEFA Champions League, Formula 1, and the French Open Tennis Championship.
The merger is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022, pending regulatory approval. The current CEO of Canal Plus, Maxime Saada, will become the CEO of the new group, while Nethold's CEO, Alain Weill, will become its chairman.
In conclusion, the Canal Plus and Nethold merger is an ambitious move that aims to create one of the world's largest pay-TV groups. With its vast subscriber base and growth ambitions, Canal+ Group is well-positioned to take on other major players in the industry and expand its global reach.
