Air France has been given clearance to purchase Boeing and Airbus planes for its long-haul fleet, marking a significant step towards modernising its ageing fleet. The airline had been waiting for the green light from its board of directors and shareholders before proceeding with the purchase.
The airline plans to purchase a total of 60 new planes, with a mix of Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners and Airbus A350s. This move is expected to reduce the airline's fuel consumption and emissions by up to 25%, while also upgrading the passenger experience.
Air France has been facing increased competition from low-cost carriers and other airlines in recent years. The airline's ageing fleet was seen as a significant disadvantage as passengers increasingly demand modern, fuel-efficient planes with more amenities.
This move comes as part of the airline's commitment to sustainability and reducing its impact on the environment. The new planes represent a significant upgrade over the airline's current fleet and will help Air France lower its carbon footprint.
Air France CEO Benjamin Smith said in a statement, "This is an important step for Air France as we continue to modernise our fleet and improve our passenger experience. These new planes will significantly reduce our environmental impact and help us maintain our competitiveness in today's challenging market."
The purchase of the new planes is a significant investment for the airline, with the total cost estimated to be around $10 billion. However, the airline believes that the investment is necessary to remain competitive and improve its long-term financial sustainability.
In addition to the purchase of new planes, Air France has also announced plans to upgrade its existing fleet with new seats and other amenities. The airline hopes that these upgrades will help it compete more effectively with other airlines.
Air France is not the only airline that is investing in modernising its fleet. Many airlines around the world are purchasing new planes in order to remain competitive and reduce their environmental impact. The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce emissions and move towards more sustainable practices.
The purchase of new planes also creates significant economic benefits, as it supports jobs in the aerospace industry and helps boost economic growth. Airbus and Boeing are both significant employers in Europe and the United States, respectively.
Air France has yet to announce a timeline for the delivery of the new planes, but it is expected that they will start to enter service within the next few years. The airline intends to gradually retire its older planes as the new planes are delivered, which will help it reduce its environmental impact and improve its passenger experience.
The purchase of new planes is a significant step for Air France, as it seeks to modernise its fleet and remain competitive in today's market. The investment is a significant one, but the benefits are expected to be significant, both in terms of improved passenger experience and reduced environmental impact. 
As the aviation industry continues to evolve, airlines that invest in modernising their fleets and improving sustainability are likely to be better positioned for success in the coming years. With the purchase of new planes, Air France is taking an important step towards securing its future in an increasingly competitive market.
