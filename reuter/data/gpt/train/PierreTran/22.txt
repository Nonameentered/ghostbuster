Air France Reports Dramatically Improved Earnings and Places Bumper Order for 20 Boeing and Airbus Aircrafts
Air France, the flagship carrier of France, has announced that its earnings have increased dramatically for the year 2021, despite the challenges faced by the aviation industry due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The airline has also placed a bumper order for 20 Boeing and Airbus aircraft, as it anticipates the growth of air travel in the coming years.
The airline reported an operating profit of €2.1 billion for the year, compared to a loss of €1.8 billion in 2020, indicating a significant improvement in its financial performance. The company's revenue also increased by 40% from the previous year to reach €16.8 billion.
The increase in earnings can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the gradual lifting of travel restrictions, the increase in demand for air travel, and the airline's cost-cutting measures. Air France also received financial support from the French government, which helped the airline to weather the storm of the pandemic.
Air France-KLM CEO, Benjamin Smith, expressed his satisfaction with the airline's improved financial performance. "The year 2021 was a challenging one for the aviation industry, but our resilience and ability to adapt to the changing circumstances have enabled us to achieve this remarkable result," he said.
The CEO also emphasized the importance of the French government's support for the airline during the pandemic. "The financial support provided by the French government has been crucial in allowing Air France to maintain its operations and preserve jobs during these difficult times," he said.
The airline has also announced a bumper order for 20 Boeing and Airbus aircraft, which will help to meet the expected increase in demand for air travel in the coming years. The order includes Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A350 and A220 aircraft, which are known for their fuel efficiency and passenger comfort.
The order is part of Air France's fleet modernization program, which aims to replace older and less fuel-efficient aircraft with newer, more environmentally friendly planes. The airline plans to retire 54 aircraft from its fleet by 2024, replacing them with 38 new aircraft, resulting in a net reduction of 16 aircraft.
"Our fleet modernization program is part of our commitment to sustainability, as we strive to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to the global effort to combat climate change," said Smith.
Air France's order for the Boeing 737 MAX is significant, considering the aircraft's recent history. The aircraft was grounded worldwide for almost two years following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.
Boeing made significant changes to the 737 MAX's software and training procedures to address the issues that caused the accidents. The aircraft received certification from regulators worldwide to resume commercial operations in December 2020.
Air France's decision to order the 737 MAX demonstrates its confidence in the aircraft and Boeing's ability to address the safety issues that led to its grounding.
The airline's order for the Airbus A350 and A220 aircraft also demonstrates its commitment to sustainability and the environment. The A350 is known for its fuel efficiency, with Airbus claiming it consumes 25% less fuel than comparable aircraft, while the A220 is known for its low noise and emissions.
Air France's investment in new aircraft is a positive sign for the aviation industry, which has been severely impacted by the pandemic. The order is expected to create jobs in the aircraft manufacturing industry and support the recovery of the aviation industry in the long term.
In conclusion, Air France's dramatically improved earnings for 2021 and its bumper order for 20 Boeing and Airbus aircrafts are positive developments for the airline and the aviation industry as a whole. The airline's commitment to sustainability and its fleet modernization program demonstrate its dedication to reducing its carbon footprint and contributing to the global effort to combat climate change. The order is expected to create jobs and support the recovery of the aviation industry in the long term, making Air France a key player in the post-pandemic era of air travel.
