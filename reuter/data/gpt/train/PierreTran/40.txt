Schneider, the globally renowned energy and automation giant, has announced its ambitious move to double its return on equity capital to 15 percent in the next three years. This announcement was made by the company's CEO and Chairman, Jean-Pascal Tricoire, at Schneider's Investor Day event.
Schneider's return on equity capital, which is the measure of the amount of profit made by the company through the stakeholder's investment, was 7.8 percent last year. CEO Tricoire claims that with the company's strong performance, existing product lines, and the implementation of its digital strategy, doubling this return will be an achievable target.
With a history of consistent growth and increased revenue, Schneider intends to continue to expand its existing product and service offerings and gain market share across multiple regions. The company's CEO has stated that Schneider will focus on digitization and automation programs to drive operational efficiencies and reduce costs.
"To achieve our ambitious financial objectives, we will rely heavily on our digital and automation expertise. Our strategy is to leverage the Internet of Things to create more efficient and sustainable products, services, and solutions for our customers, unlocking new revenue streams and superior customer experiences," said Tricoire.
Schneider has also announced plans to streamline its internal operations, including reducing costs and implementing new digital systems to improve operational efficiency and streamline workflows. The company will continue to reinforce its position in its core markets, while also investing in new growth opportunities.
The company's planned expansion is expected to boost its earnings and increase its financial strength. Schneider is also taking a step toward becoming a leading innovative and sustainable corporation. According to Tricoire, Schneider will continue to innovate, reduce its environmental impact, and support the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals all while maintaining its exceptional performance.
The ambitious targets set by Schneider will excite investors, who have already enjoyed a 2.38% yield in dividends and a 34.25% rise in share prices during the past year. The company's promising plan further cements its position as a fast-growing company with long-term growth prospects.
To conclude, Schneider's announcement of doubling its return on equity capital in the next three years by diversifying its activities and expanding its offerings is economically and environmentally promising. The company's approach of digitization and automation, sustainability, and expanding its core market, makes it a prime target for investors seeking long-term growth opportunities.
