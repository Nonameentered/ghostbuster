PARIS – Today, Canal Plus and Nethold announced a merger that will create one of the largest pay-TV groups in the world. The new entity, which will be known as Canal Nethhold, will have a strong presence in Europe, Latin America, and Africa.
Canal Plus is already a leading pay-TV operator in France, while Nethold is the parent company of the South African pay-TV company MultiChoice and operates throughout Africa.
With the merger, the two companies hope to expand their reach and compete more effectively with global rivals such as Netflix and Amazon.
The CEO of Canal Plus, Maxime Saada, said: “We are very pleased to announce this partnership with Nethold. Together, we will have the scale, resources, and talent to offer the best possible service to our customers across the world.”
The CEO of Nethold, Imtiaz Patel, added: “This is an exciting opportunity for us to build on our strengths and create a new force in pay-TV. We look forward to working closely with Canal Plus to deliver great content and experiences to our customers.”
The merger is subject to regulatory approval, with completion expected by the end of the year. Once the deal is finalized, Canal Nethhold will have around 20 million subscribers and operate in over 50 countries.
The new company will offer a broad range of content, including sports, movies, and TV series, as well as new digital services such as streaming and gaming.
The merger comes at a time when the pay-TV industry is facing increasing pressure from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon, which have disrupted the traditional business model.
Canal Nethhold will need to adapt to this changing landscape and find new ways to attract and retain customers. However, with its strong content portfolio and global reach, it is well positioned to compete in the market.
The merger is also likely to lead to cost savings and synergies, as the two companies can share resources and expertise.
Overall, the Canal Plus and Nethold merger is a significant development in the pay-TV industry and shows the importance of scale and global reach in a rapidly evolving market.
