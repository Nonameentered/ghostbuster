In the latest development of the Airbus-Boeing rivalry, Airbus has announced that it has found no evidence of any pressure from Boeing to hinder the production of the A3XX, the European aircraft manufacturer's ambitious plan to develop a superjumbo airliner.
This comes as a relief for both companies amidst a series of allegations and counter-allegations made by the two aircraft manufacturers against each other in recent times.
According to a statement released by Airbus, an independent investigation was conducted which found no evidence that Boeing had attempted to obstruct the production of the A3XX, which would have been the largest passenger plane in the world at the time.
"While we take all allegations of anti-competitive behavior seriously, it is important that we base our decisions on facts and evidence," Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in the statement. "And after extensive investigations, we have found no evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of Boeing."
The investigation was launched after former Airbus executive John Leahy accused Boeing of using its influence to persuade Singapore Airlines to cancel an order for the A3XX back in 2000.
Leahy, who was responsible for selling the A3XX to airlines, claimed that Boeing was worried about losing its market share in the wide-body aircraft market, and therefore resorted to underhanded tactics to prevent the A3XX from taking off.
However, Boeing denied the allegations, calling them "baseless and without merit." The American aircraft manufacturer maintained that it had always acted in accordance with fair competition laws and market regulations.
In the wake of Leahy's allegations, Airbus launched its own internal investigation to determine whether there was any substance to the claims. The findings of the investigation were presented to Airbus's board of directors on Wednesday, who ultimately concluded that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Boeing.
Despite the fact that the A3XX never came to fruition, Airbus went on to develop the A380, a similar-sized superjumbo aircraft that faced a number of challenges in the market. In 2019, the company announced that it would be discontinuing production of the A380 due to lack of demand.
The Airbus-Boeing rivalry has been ongoing for years, with both companies vying for dominance in the global aircraft manufacturing industry. This latest development is likely to be welcomed by both sides, as it puts to rest one of the more contentious and long-running allegations made against them.
In conclusion, Airbus's announcement that it has found no evidence of any pressure from Boeing to hinder the production of the A3XX is a significant development in the ongoing rivalry between the two aircraft manufacturers. The findings of the investigation are likely to be welcomed by both sides, as they seek to move past the allegations and focus on advancing their respective businesses.
