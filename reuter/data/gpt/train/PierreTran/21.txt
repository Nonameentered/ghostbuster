PARIS, FRANCE- In an effort to expand its fleet, Air France has recently placed orders for ten new Boeing planes and ten new Airbus jets.
The French airline announced on Monday that it will begin taking delivery of the new planes in 2023 and 2024. The five Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners and five Airbus A350-900s will be used for long-haul international flights, while the five Boeing 737-9 Max planes and five Airbus A320neos will be used for domestic and regional flights.
Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith said in a statement, "Our goal is to offer our customers the best possible flying experience and these new aircraft will contribute significantly to that effort. They are more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly, which is very important to us."
The orders come as the airline has reported a jump in profits for the first quarter of 2021. Air France-KLM's net income was $158 million, compared with a loss of $478 million during the same period last year.
The airline is attributing the increase in profits to cost-cutting measures that were implemented during the pandemic, as well as an uptick in demand for travel. The company said that its passenger traffic increased by 34.2% in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period in 2020.
However, the airline still faces challenges as COVID-19 continues to impact the travel industry. Air France-KLM said that it expects its capacity in the second quarter of 2021 to be down 60-70% compared to pre-pandemic levels.
"We are still in a difficult situation due to the pandemic, but we are confident that we will be able to continue moving in the right direction," said Smith.
Air France is not the only airline that has recently placed orders for new planes. Last month, Delta Air Lines announced that it had ordered 25 Airbus A321neo planes, while United Airlines placed an order for 25 new Boeing 737 Max planes.
Analysts say that the orders are a sign that the airlines are preparing for a post-pandemic rebound in travel demand. However, the industry still faces lingering uncertainty, as countries around the world continue to grapple with COVID-19 outbreaks and the rollout of vaccines.
As for Air France-KLM, the airline said that it will continue to focus on cost-cutting measures and improving its operational efficiency as it moves forward.
"We are not out of the woods yet, but we are taking steps to ensure that we emerge from this crisis as a stronger company," said Smith.
