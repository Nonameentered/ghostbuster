The French government has announced its decision to sell its electrical engineering and defence electronics company, Thomson-CSF. This decision has come through the 1986 Privatisation Law that allows the French government to sell its shares in state-owned companies. The company, which is now a part of Thales Group, is set to be privatised after a delay of a decade.
The announcement was made on Friday, 29th August 1997, by the French Finance Minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. The privatisation is expected to be a major step towards meeting the budget deficit reduction targets set by the government.
Thomson-CSF was established in 1893 in France and has since grown to become a key player in the electrical engineering and defence electronics sector. The company's products include radar systems, communication equipment, and navigation systems for the defence sector. The company also produces electronic systems for the aerospace and space sectors.
"We have concluded that now is the right time to launch the sale of Thomson-CSF," Strauss-Kahn said in a statement. "This decision is in line with our objective of reducing the budget deficit and improving the management of public resources."
The French government currently holds a 31.3 percent stake in Thales Group, which owns Thomson-CSF. The government is expected to sell its shares in the company in several stages, though the timeline for the sales has not been determined.
The decision was welcomed by the Thales Group, which has stated that the privatisation will help the company to operate more efficiently and improve its competitiveness in the global market. Thales Group's CEO, Denis Ranque, praised the decision as a sign that the French government is committed to creating a more open and competitive economy.
"We welcome the French government's decision to privatise Thomson-CSF," Ranque said. "This is a major step towards modernising the French economy and promoting competition in the global market."
The company has faced a number of financial difficulties over the past few years. In 1996, it had reported losses of more than â‚¬1 billion ($825 million). The decision to privatise Thomson-CSF comes as part of a wider government plan to reduce public spending and improve the management of public resources.
The delay in the privatisation has been the result of resistance from unions and political opposition to the sale of the company. The original plan to privatise the company had been proposed in 1990, but the government had shelved it due to opposition from the leftist parties.
The decision to sell Thomson-CSF will be seen as a significant move in the privatisation of state-owned companies in France. It is expected that other state-owned enterprises will now follow suit and be privatised as part of the government's broader efforts to reduce public spending.
