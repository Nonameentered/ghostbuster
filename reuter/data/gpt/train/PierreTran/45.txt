France’s National Audit Office has criticized the lack of competition in the country’s water supply market, which is heavily dominated by two companies. In a new report, the agency expressed concerns about the “limited competition” that exists in the sector and the effect this is having on the cost and quality of services.
The audit office noted that just two companies, Veolia and Suez, control around 80% of the market for water and sanitation services in France. The companies have also been accused of engaging in anti-competitive practices that have prevented other players from entering the market.
The French government has been trying to promote greater competition in the sector for some time. In 2019, it passed a new law aimed at increasing the participation of smaller players in the market. However, the audit office says that these measures have not yet had the desired effect.
According to the report, the lack of competition is having a negative impact on the cost of water and sanitation services. The audit office found that prices for these services in France are among the highest in Europe. It also noted that the cost of water bills had increased by 12% in real terms between 2010 and 2019, while the cost of sanitation services had increased by 5% over the same period.
The report also highlighted concerns about the quality of service provided by the two dominant companies. It noted that there had been a significant increase in the number of water supply interruptions in recent years, particularly in rural areas. The audit office suggested that this may be due to the lack of competition in the sector.
The report has led to calls for the French government to take action to promote greater competition in the water supply market. Some have suggested that the government could seek to break up the dominance of Veolia and Suez by creating a new, publicly owned water and sanitation company.
Others have called for the government to take a more proactive approach to promoting competition and supporting smaller players in the market. This could include increasing funding for research and development in the sector, as well as providing incentives for new players to enter the market.
Whatever measures are taken, it is clear that action is needed to address the lack of competition in France’s water supply market. With prices for these essential services already high, and the quality of service declining in some areas, it is vital that steps are taken to ensure that consumers have access to affordable, reliable services.
