The Czech Statistical Bureau has announced that it will be changing its methodology for calculating industrial production in 1997. The move is aimed at improving the accuracy of the country’s economic statistics by adopting a more modern, internationally recognized method.
The current methodology used by the Bureau is based on a system that was developed in the 1970s and has become outdated. The new method, called the industrial production index, is widely used in other European countries and the United States.
Under the new system, the Bureau will use more detailed data to calculate industrial production figures, including data on the quantity and value of goods produced, as well as new information on how businesses are structured and how they operate. This will allow the Bureau to track changes in the economy more accurately, and produce more reliable economic statistics.
The Bureau’s Director, Jiri Skuhrovec, said that the move was essential to ensure that the country’s economic statistics were up to date and reliable. “Our current method of calculating industrial production is no longer fit for purpose,” he said. “This new methodology will not only improve the accuracy of our economic statistics, but it will also help us to better understand the changing nature of the Czech economy.”
The change in methodology is part of a larger effort by the Czech government to improve the country’s economic statistics. In recent years, the government has invested in new technology and software to make data collection and analysis more efficient and accurate.
The move has been welcomed by economists and analysts, who say that better economic statistics are critical to the country’s economic development. “Accurate economic data is essential for making informed decisions about government policy and investment,” said Martin Vlcek, an economist at the University of Economics.
The new methodology is expected to be introduced in January 1997. The Bureau will also provide training to businesses and analysts to help them adapt to the new system.
The change in calculation methodology is just the latest step in a long-term effort to modernize and improve the Czech economy. While the country has made significant progress since the end of communism, it still faces many challenges, including high levels of unemployment, a large public debt, and an aging population.
Through efforts like the modernization of economic statistics, the government hopes to lay the foundation for sustained economic growth and a brighter future for the Czech Republic.
