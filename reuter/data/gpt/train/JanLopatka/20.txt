The Czech Republic's coalition government is on the hunt for a new director of its secret service, following the resignation of the previous incumbent in the midst of a spying scandal that has rocked the country. Ivan Beneš stepped down from the role just last week, after it emerged that intelligence agency operatives may have been involved in illegally obtaining information on opposition politicians and journalists.
The scandal has caused outrage and calls for action from political opponents, with many demanding a full investigation into the allegations. The situation has also put pressure on the country's coalition government, with Prime Minister Andrej Babis and his government facing criticism for their handling of the affair.
Beneš, who had led the secret service since 2018, resigned after it was alleged that several members of his team had been monitoring emails and phone calls of senior politicians and journalists, including opposition leaders and reporters working for news outlets critical of the government.
According to reports, the affair was brought to light after a group of journalists first raised concerns about the potential for illegal surveillance. They then managed to obtain evidence through sources within the intelligence community that suggested the allegations were true.
The scandal has now prompted the government to start the search for a new director of the secret service, with the process expected to take several weeks. It is widely believed that finding the right candidate will be crucial for the government if it is to regain trust and restore confidence in the intelligence agency.
Speaking about the situation, Prime Minister Babis said: "We cannot allow any doubts about the activities of the secret service, which is supposed to be responsible for safeguarding the interests of our citizens. It is vital that we find a new director who is up to the task and can lead the agency with the utmost integrity and professionalism."
The incident is the latest in a series of controversies to hit the Czech Republic's intelligence agencies in recent years, with concerns raised about the close links between certain members of the security forces and the country's political elite.
Opposition leaders have called for a full inquiry into the affair, with many claiming that the government is seeking to cover up the extent of the spying operation. However, the prime minister has denied these allegations and has insisted that the government is committed to transparency and accountability.
The scandal is likely to continue to make headlines for some time to come, and it remains to be seen how the government will respond to mounting pressure for a full inquiry into the affair. For now, all eyes will be on the search for a new director of the country's secret service.
