Litvinov refinery, owned by the Czech Republic's largest oil producer Unipetrol, has been forced to close one of its cracking units after a second fire broke out in eight days. The refinery is located in the northwest of the country and is one of the biggest refineries in Central Europe.
The cracking unit, which is responsible for producing fuel products including gasoline and diesel, was shut down after a fire broke out in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The fire was quickly extinguished, and fortunately, no one was injured. Employees were evacuated from the plant as a precautionary measure.
This latest incident follows a fire that broke out in one of the refinery's other cracking units on July 28. That fire was also quickly extinguished, but it prompted Unipetrol to temporarily shut down all of its cracking units for safety checks and repairs. The units were only restarted last Friday.
Unipetrol confirmed in a statement that production has not been affected by the latest shutdown as it has several other cracking units on site. However, the company did acknowledge the impact that the shutdown would have on its bottom line, stating that it expects a loss of approximately CZK 100 million ($4.5 million) per day in revenue.
The cause of the fires has not yet been determined, but Unipetrol has launched an investigation to identify the root cause of both incidents. The company maintains that safety is its top priority and that it is taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.
The recent incidents at Litvinov refinery have raised concerns about the safety of the facility and its impact on the environment. The refinery is located close to residential areas, and any accident could have serious implications for the surrounding population.
Environmental activists have long been calling for a reduction in the use of fossil fuels, and this incident has only strengthened their calls for alternative sources of energy. The Czech government will need to take these concerns into account as they continue to evaluate the future of Litvinov refinery.
