The Czech coalition government has confirmed a new justice minister during a cabinet reshuffle but has postponed making a decision on the choice for deputy prime minister.
The decision to replace the current Justice Minister, Marie Benesova, was made after weeks of criticism over her handling of an investigation into the head of the Public Health Service, which was seen as disproportionate and politically motivated. The proposed replacement, Marie Smolikova, a judge from the Municipal Court in Prague, was approved by all parties in the coalition government.
Prime Minister Andrej Babis, leader of the centrist ANO party, said that Smolikova, the first female justice minister in the Czech Republic's history, was a "strong candidate".
"She is a respected judge, with a long career in the judiciary and a deep knowledge of the legal system," he said. "I am sure she will do an excellent job as justice minister."
Smolikova said she was "honoured" to take on the role and that she would work hard to ensure "fairness and justice for all citizens". She added that it was important to have an independent judiciary and to protect the rights of all citizens.
However, the coalition government, which is made up of the ANO party and the centrist Social Democrats, has yet to agree on a new deputy prime minister. The current deputy prime minister, Jan Hamacek of the Social Democrats, has been in the position since 2018 and has been responsible for overseeing the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Hamacek was recently elected as the new leader of the Social Democratic party and has been criticised by some members of the ANO party for his handling of the pandemic. Some members of the ANO party have called for him to be replaced as deputy prime minister.
The decision on who will become the new deputy prime minister has been postponed for a few weeks to allow for further discussions within the coalition government. Babis said that it was important to agree on the right person to take on the role and that there was "no reason to rush".
"We will take the time we need to find the right person for this important role," he said. "We want to ensure that the deputy prime minister is someone who can work effectively with all members of the coalition government and can help us to deliver on our priorities for the country."
