The Czech Republic’s sugar industry is facing a dilemma as the nation faces a sugar surplus, while exports remain limited due to high production costs and a global market surplus.
According to the Czech Sugar Association, the country’s sugar production reached 401,000 tons in 2019, which is about 8.5% more than the average for the past five years. However, the demand for sugar has not increased at the same rate, resulting in a surplus of sugar. 
Due to the high production costs in the Czech Republic, the nation’s sugar prices are not competitive in the export market compared to other sugar-producing countries. This has limited the country’s sugar exports to the European Union, which has been affected by a global surplus of sugar.
Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decrease in demand for sugar due to the closure of restaurants, cafes, and bars. This has led to a further decrease in the prices of sugar, adding to the surplus problem.
The Czech sugar industry has raised concerns about the impact of the oversupply on the domestic market, as well as the financial losses that sugar producers may face due to the low sugar prices.  They have called for measures to support the industry, including the possibility of using surplus sugar in the production of biofuels.
The Czech Ministry of Agriculture has attempted to address the issue by introducing a sugar beet quota in 2020, which was aimed at reducing the amount of sugar produced in the country. However, this measure was not successful, as the production still exceeded the set quota.
Experts suggest that the problem facing the Czech sugar industry is not only due to domestic production costs but is also a result of the global sugar market. The global sugar surplus, particularly from countries such as Brazil and India, has resulted in lower sugar prices and made the Czech sugar industry less competitive in the export market.
Currently, the Czech sugar industry is exploring new markets to export their products, including Middle Eastern and Asian countries. However, these markets require different specifications, such as higher sugar quality, which may require additional investment from the sugar producers.
There are also long-term concerns for the sugar industry in the Czech Republic. The European Union will abolish sugar quotas by 2022, which may lead to a further increase in domestic production and consequently, a greater surplus of sugar.
Experts suggest that the Czech sugar industry needs to transform its structure, focusing on new and innovative products that meet the changing requirements of the market. This could include expanding production into the biofuels market, which could become a profitable and sustainable solution for the industry.
In conclusion, the Czech sugar industry is facing a challenging situation due to a domestic sugar surplus, limited exports, and a global market surplus. High production costs have added to the dilemma, leaving the industry with few options, such as finding new export markets, expanding into biofuels, and possibly reducing domestic production. The Czech sugar industry must adapt to meet the changing requirements of the market and find innovative ways to remain competitive in the future.
