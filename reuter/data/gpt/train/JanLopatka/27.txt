The Czech opposition is pointing the finger at their own party chairman after a poor showing in the Senate elections. The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) won only two out of the 27 seats up for grabs on Saturday, October 5th, while the ruling ANO party picked up 10. The Pirate Party also scored notable gains, effectively doubling the number of seats, taking seven.
Party chairman, Petr Fiala, was singled out by the opposition for their dismal showing, with many protestors calling for his resignation. Fiala brushed off the criticism, stating that his party's lack of success was due to broader political factors within the country, rather than his own leadership.
Nevertheless, the result was a significant blow to the ODS, which has traditionally been one of the country's most prominent political forces. Ahead of the election, many pundits had predicted that the party would make significant gains and challenge ANO's dominance in the upper house. Instead, the ODS saw their vote share shrink to just 11%, compared to ANO's 31.5%.
The Pirate Party, meanwhile, was seen as the big winners of the election. Leaders of the party, which has campaigned on issues such as internet freedom and digital rights, attributed their success to a growing appetite for a more progressive politics in the country. The party's co-chair, Ivan Barto≈°, hailed the result as a "stunning victory" and said it demonstrated that voters were "ready for a new era of politics in the Czech Republic".
However, the opposition parties were not quite so jubilant. The Social Democrats, for instance, suffered significant losses, dropping from six seats to just two. Similarly, the Christian Democrats managed to hold onto their single seat, but saw their vote share decrease from 17.6% to 9.6%. 
The poor showing for the opposition has led many to speculate about the future of Czech politics. While ANO has been dominant in recent years, the election results indicate a growing opposition to their policies. Some observers have suggested that the emergence of the Pirate Party as a significant force could shake up the political landscape, while others have speculated that a coalition of opposition parties may be needed to challenge ANO's hold on power.
But regardless of what happens next, there's no denying that the October 5th Senate elections were a significant moment for Czech politics. While the ruling party extended its majority in the upper house, the opposition was left to reflect on a disappointing performance. As Fiala himself acknowledged, "this was not the result we wanted, and we will need to take a hard look at ourselves and see what went wrong". With a growing sense of political unrest in the country, the future of Czech politics remains far from clear.
