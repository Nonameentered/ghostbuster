The Czech Republic is reportedly in talks with Russia's state-owned gas giant Gazprom to secure a long-term contract for natural gas supplies. The move comes as the Czech Republic seeks to diversify its energy sources, and reduce its dependence on natural gas supplied by Germany.
According to a statement by the Czech embassy in Moscow, the two sides have held talks on a possible long-term contract, which would ensure reliable and stable supplies of natural gas to the Czech Republic for years to come.
The Czech Republic currently imports much of its natural gas from Germany, which itself imports large amounts from Russia. But concerns about over-dependence on German supplies, coupled with the high cost of energy in the country, mean that the Czech government is looking for alternative options.
“We are committed to diversifying our energy sources and ensuring that we have a stable, reliable supply of natural gas to meet our domestic needs,” said Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis. “We believe that a long-term contract with Gazprom will help us achieve this goal, and we look forward to continuing discussions on this matter.”
The talks with Gazprom come amid growing concerns in the Czech Republic about the country's energy security. Last year, the country's energy regulator launched an investigation into alleged price-fixing by German gas companies, which supply most of the natural gas imported by the Czech Republic.
Although the investigation was eventually dropped, the case highlighted the vulnerability of the Czech Republic's energy infrastructure, and the need for the country to diversify its sources of natural gas.
In recent years, the Czech Republic has been increasing its use of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. But these sources alone are not enough to meet the country's energy needs, and natural gas remains an important part of its energy mix.
If a long-term contract with Gazprom is agreed, it could provide the Czech Republic with a more secure and affordable source of natural gas, and help to reduce the country's dependence on Germany.
