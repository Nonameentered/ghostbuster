The Czech government has decided to delay payments in an effort to claim their fourth consecutive budget surplus in 1996. The move has drawn criticism from some quarters, but the government claims that it is necessary to maintain economic stability and avoid overspending.
Finance Minister Ivan Přikryl announced that the government had delayed payments of about CZK 30 billion ($1.2 billion) to suppliers and other creditors. The payments will now be made in January 1997, which will allow the government to show a budget surplus for the fourth year in a row.
The decision to delay payments has been met with criticism from some economists, who warn that it could harm the economy in the long run. They argue that the delayed payments will only create a backlog of unpaid bills, which will ultimately have to be paid.
However, the government argues that the move is necessary to maintain economic stability. The Czech Republic has seen impressive economic growth in recent years, with its gross domestic product (GDP) growing by an average of 5.5% per year since 1993. The government's fiscal discipline has played a significant role in this success, and delaying payments is seen as a way to continue this.
"The government has been very successful in maintaining fiscal discipline in recent years," said Přikryl. "This has been a key factor in our economic growth. With this move, we are ensuring that we continue to be financially responsible."
The decision to delay payments has also been welcomed by some business leaders. They argue that it will help prevent a spiraling debt crisis, which could harm the economy in the long run.
"The government's decision to delay payments is a prudent move," said Jan Petrus, head of the Czech Chamber of Commerce. "It will help prevent a debt crisis from spiraling out of control, which would be very damaging for the economy."
Despite the government's assurances, some analysts remain unconvinced. They warn that delaying payments will only create a backlog of unpaid bills, which will ultimately have to be paid. This could lead to a debt crisis, which could harm the economy in the long run.
"The government's decision to delay payments is a short-term fix," said Tomas Sedlacek, chief economist at Czech bank CSOB. "It will do more harm than good in the long run."
Despite the criticism, the government maintains that delaying payments is necessary to maintain economic stability in the short-term. The move is part of a wider effort to maintain fiscal discipline and ensure continued economic growth in the Czech Republic. Whether it will ultimately prove to be a wise decision remains to be seen.
