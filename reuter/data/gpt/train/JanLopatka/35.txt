On Tuesday, Czech President Vaclav Havel underwent exploratory surgery after doctors found a small spot on his lung during a routine check-up. Havel’s office has released a statement assuring the public that his health is not in serious danger.
The 84-year-old former playwright and human rights activist has had health issues in the past, including a lung cancer diagnosis in 1996 that required him to undergo surgery to remove one-third of his lung. Havel has also suffered from chronic bronchitis, likely caused by years of heavy smoking.
Despite his long-term health concerns, Havel has remained politically active in recent years. He has been a vocal opponent of current Czech President Milos Zeman, whom he has accused of undermining democratic values and cozying up to Russia and China.
Havel’s surgery took place at Central Military Hospital in Prague, and lasted for several hours. Doctors removed the spot from his lung and sent it for testing to determine whether it is cancerous. Results are expected later this week.
Havel has been President of the Czech Republic for a total of 13 years, first from 1993 to 2003, and then again from 2012 to 2013. He is widely respected for his contributions to the country’s transition to democracy after the fall of communism in the late 1980s.
News of Havel’s surgery has prompted an outpouring of support from both his political allies and critics. Prime Minister Andrej Babis tweeted that he was “wishing President Havel a quick recovery” and that he was “in our thoughts.”
Zeman, on the other hand, offered a more restrained response. In a statement released by his office, he said that he was “sorry to hear about President Havel’s health issues” and wished him a “speedy and full recovery.”
Havel’s health scare has also sparked discussion about the future of Czech politics. With Zeman’s term set to end later this year, many are wondering who will step up to lead the country in the years ahead.
Some have speculated that Havel’s illness could pave the way for a comeback by his former colleague, Jiri Drahos, who ran against Zeman in the 2018 presidential election. Drahos, a scientist and former president of the Czech Academy of Sciences, has been a vocal critic of Zeman’s policies and has not ruled out another run for the presidency.
For now, Havel is said to be recovering well from his surgery and is expected to be released from the hospital in the coming days. His office has thanked the public for their kind messages of support and requested privacy for the President and his family as he continues to recuperate.
