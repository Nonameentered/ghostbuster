The Czech Republic is facing a sugar surplus of up to 100,000 tonnes, according to experts. This is due to high production costs and a global glut, which makes it difficult to export the excess sugar.
The situation is worrying for the Czech sugar industry, which is already struggling with declining demand from consumers and supermarkets. The country's sugar refineries produced around 600,000 tonnes of sugar last year, but only managed to sell 500,000 tonnes.
Experts say that this surplus has been caused by a combination of factors, including high production costs, which make it difficult for Czech sugar to compete with sugar from other countries. Additionally, a global glut of sugar has pushed prices down, making it harder for sugar producers to make a profit.
The result is that the Czech sugar industry is now stuck with a surplus that is difficult to offload. "We are facing a challenging situation," said Jindrich Zurek, director of the Czech Sugar Association, in an interview with Czech Radio. "We have a lot of sugar and not many options for selling it."
Experts say that one option for the Czech industry could be to find new export markets, but this is easier said than done. According to Zurek, exporting sugar to countries outside the EU can be difficult due to tight regulations and high tariffs.
He added that even within the EU, competition is fierce. "We are seeing a lot of sugar coming into the EU from countries like Brazil, which are able to produce sugar at much lower costs than we can," he said.
The Czech sugar industry has been in decline for several years, with many sugar beet farmers leaving the industry due to falling profits. According to a report by the Czech Ministry of Agriculture, the number of sugar beet farmers in the country has fallen from around 10,000 in the 1990s to just 2,000 today.
The report also points out that the average profitability of a sugar beet farm has fallen from 17,400 crowns in 2004 to just 6,700 crowns in 2019. This has led many farmers to switch to other crops that are more profitable, such as wheat and rapeseed.
The decline of the Czech sugar industry has been attributed to a number of factors, including the abolition of EU sugar quotas in 2017, which led to increased competition and falling prices. Additionally, rising production costs and declining demand for sugar from consumers have also taken their toll.
Experts say that the situation is unlikely to improve anytime soon, and that the Czech sugar industry will need to adapt if it wants to survive. "The industry needs to look at new markets and new ways of producing sugar that are more cost-effective," said Zurek. "It's a challenging time, but we need to find a way through this."
In the meantime, the Czech government has announced that it will offer financial support to sugar beet farmers who are struggling due to the surplus. The aid package is expected to total around 450 million crowns ($20 million) and will be given to farmers who agree to grow alternative crops or to leave their land fallow.
Overall, it seems that the Czech sugar industry is facing a difficult period that will require tough decisions and new strategies if it wants to survive. With a 100,000 tonne surplus of sugar, and little hope for exports, the industry will need to find ways of reducing production costs and finding new markets if it wants to stay afloat.
