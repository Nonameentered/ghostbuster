The Czech government has approved a declaration of post-World War II reconciliation with Germany, aimed at healing the wounds of the past and strengthening the ties between the two nations.
The declaration comes after decades of tension between the Czech and German governments, stemming from the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime during the war. The Czech Republic, once occupied by Nazi Germany, suffered greatly during the war years, with millions of civilians and soldiers killed, and entire cities and towns destroyed.
"We have decided to turn the page on the past and build a future of cooperation and friendship with our German neighbors," said Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, as he announced the approval of the declaration.
The declaration reaffirms the commitment of both countries to respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, while acknowledging the difficult history that they share. It also highlights the need for continued dialogue and cooperation in addressing shared challenges, such as climate change, migration, and regional security.
"The declaration is an important step towards reconciliation and a constructive dialogue between our two countries," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a statement following the announcement.
The declaration has been praised by many in the Czech Republic, who see it as a long overdue step towards healing the wounds of the past. However, there are also concerns that it may be seen as a concession to Germany in some quarters, especially among nationalist and anti-German groups.
"I understand the concerns of those who are worried about the declaration being misinterpreted or used for political purposes," said Babis. "But I believe that it's important to take this step in order to move forward and build a better future for our people."
The declaration has also been welcomed by the German government, which has been seeking to strengthen ties with its neighbors to the east. Merkel has spoken of the need for reconciliation and solidarity among European nations, especially in the face of growing tensions and challenges from outside the continent.
"We must never forget the lessons of the past, but we must also look to the future and work together for the good of our people and our continent," she said.
The declaration will be formally signed by both governments in the coming weeks, and will be followed by a series of cultural and educational exchanges aimed at strengthening the ties between the two countries.
"We hope that this will be just the beginning of a new era of cooperation and friendship between our two nations," said Babis. "We have much to offer each other, and much to gain from working together."
