The Czech National Bank Vice-Governor, Mojmir Hampl, has called for the appointment of strong and efficient owners to head the state-controlled banks in the country. Hampl emphasized the need for effective leadership as an important factor in ensuring the stability and profitability of these financial institutions.
His comments come in the wake of growing concerns about the performance of state-controlled banks in the country. These banks, which are majority-owned by the government, have been criticized for their lackluster performance and sluggish growth.
Hampl called for the government to take a proactive approach in appointing qualified owners and managers to head these banks. He stressed the importance of selecting individuals with a proven track record of success in the finance industry, as well as those with the necessary expertise and experience to steer these banks towards profitable growth.
Hampl also emphasized the need for a clear strategy for the management of these banks, stating that a well-defined plan would help to ensure the efficient use of resources and the achievement of business goals.
The Czech National Bank Vice-Governor pointed out that the recent financial crisis had highlighted the importance of strong and stable banks to the overall health of the economy. He stressed that the government had a responsibility to ensure that the state-controlled banks in the country were well-managed and financially sound.
Hampl's call for effective leadership in the state-controlled banks has been welcomed by industry experts, who have long called for more accountability and transparency in the management of these institutions.
Alena Schillerova, the Czech Minister of Finance, has also expressed her support for the appointment of qualified owners and managers in these banks. She called for an open and competitive recruitment process that would attract the best and brightest in the finance industry to take on these important roles.
The performance of state-controlled banks has been a topic of concern in the Czech Republic for some time now. In 2016, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of the country's biggest bank, Ceska Sporitelna, citing concerns about its profitability and growth prospects.
Hampl's call for strong and efficient owners for state-controlled banks highlights the need for a more proactive approach to managing these institutions. With the right leadership in place, these banks could play a key role in driving the growth and development of the Czech economy in the coming years.
