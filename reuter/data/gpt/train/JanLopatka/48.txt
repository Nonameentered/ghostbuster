The Czech government has approved rules for the stake sale tender of Aero Vodochody to a strategic partner. State-controlled aerospace company Aero Vodochody is set to attract numerous bidders as the Czech government aims to raise funds and improve its exports.
Under the conditions, the government will retain full control of the company, which was once a major aircraft manufacturer in the Eastern bloc. Interested companies are invited to participate in the selection process, which will be conducted by the state-run agency CzechInvest.
Aero Vodochody specializes in the production of military trainers and other military aircraft but has been facing financial difficulties in recent years. The company reported a net loss of $16.4 million in 2020, a significant increase from the $3.2 million loss the previous year.
The Czech government is seeking to attract a strategic partner who can help Aero Vodochody return to profitability and expand its markets. The plan is to sell a stake of up to 49% to the chosen partner, but the government will retain veto rights over strategic decisions.
The company's CEO, Dieter John, believes that a strategic partner will provide Aero Vodochody with access to new markets and technologies. "We believe that we can drive the company forward by expanding our customer base, increasing our portfolio of products, and working closely with our strategic partner," he said.
Potential bidders for Aero Vodochody include leading aerospace firms such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Saab. The government has emphasized that the final decision will be based on the bidder's expertise, technological capabilities, and financial strength, not just the highest price.
The sale of Aero Vodochody is part of the Czech government's efforts to privatize state-owned firms and attract more foreign investment. The country has seen a surge in foreign investment in recent years, with the automotive, electronics, and IT industries attracting the majority of funds.
The Czech economy has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to a decline in exports and a decrease in tourism. The government hopes that by attracting more foreign investment, it can create jobs and boost economic growth.
The tender for Aero Vodochody stake sale is expected to begin soon, and the government hopes to finalize the deal by the end of the year. The sale is expected to raise around $190 million, which will be used to pay off the company's debts and invest in its future growth.
