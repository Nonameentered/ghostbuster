London-based education and publishing company Pearson saw a surge in its shares following the release of its trading statement for the first half of the year. The positive results come just a few weeks before the arrival of their new chief executive, former Disney exec, Andy Bird.
Pearson said that its half-year sales will be at least Â£2.2bn ($3bn), in line with market expectations, with a 6% rise in revenues for the period. The company also expects to show continued growth in digital sales, which are predicted to account for around 70% of Pearson's revenue by the end of the year.
The announcement prompted a 5% jump in Pearson's shares, reaching their highest levels in seven years.
Andy Bird, who has previously held senior positions at Disney, is expected to bring his experience of working in the digital entertainment industry to the role. He has been described as a "transformational leader" and will be tasked with driving Pearson's digital strategy forward.
The company has undergone significant restructuring in recent years, selling off assets and focusing on its education division. In 2020, Pearson sold its remaining stake in the Penguin Random House publishing group for $675m.
Pearson's CEO, John Fallon, who is due to step down in August, said that the company was well-placed for future growth under Bird's leadership.
"We are in a strong position to continue our digital transformation and make education more accessible and effective for learners worldwide," he said.
The education sector has been greatly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, with schools and universities closing or reducing capacity to prevent the spread of the virus. However, Pearson said that the pandemic had accelerated the adoption of online learning, benefiting the company's digital business.
The shift towards digital learning is likely to continue even as the pandemic subsides. According to a report by Research and Markets, the global e-learning market is expected to grow at a rate of over 8% per year from 2021 to 2026.
Pearson has also been investing in new technologies to enhance the learning experience for students. Last year, the company acquired the virtual reality and technology firm Lumerit Education, which allows students to complete their degree online while working or travelling.
The company has also expanded its digital textbook offering, which enables students to access course materials and learning resources online.
Andy Bird's appointment as CEO marks a new chapter for Pearson, as the company seeks to build on its recent successes and capitalize on the growing demand for digital education. His arrival is eagerly anticipated by investors, who are hopeful that he will drive the company's share price even higher.
