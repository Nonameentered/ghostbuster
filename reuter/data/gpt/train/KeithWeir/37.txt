Ladbroke Group, the British leisure and hospitality company, and Hilton Hotels Corporation, the American multinational hospitality company, have announced the reunion of the famous Hilton brand after a 32-year separation. The two companies have agreed to a Â£3.6 billion merger that will create one of the largest hotel chains in the world.
The announcement was made on Monday, March 29, by Ladbroke Group's CEO, David Brown, and Hilton Hotels Corporation's CEO, Christopher Nassetta. The reunion has been long-awaited by both companies and is seen as a strategic move in the highly competitive hospitality industry.
The Hilton brand was split in 1987, when Ladbroke sold 100 of its hotels to Hilton Hotels Corporation. Ladbroke, which was then a betting and gaming company, retained ownership of the remaining hotels and rebranded them as the Stakis Hotels. Since then, the two companies have operated independently of each other.
The merger will bring together over 6,000 hotels and resorts, spanning 119 countries, under the Hilton brand, making it one of the largest hotel chains in the world. The company will have a combined workforce of over 400,000 people and will generate billions of pounds in revenue.
The newly merged company will be headquartered in McLean, Virginia, and will operate under the leadership of Christopher Nassetta, who will serve as CEO and chairman of the board of directors. David Brown will serve as president and chief operating officer.
The merger is expected to bring significant benefits to both companies. The Hilton brand has a strong global presence, while Ladbroke has a strong presence in the UK. The merger will allow the companies to leverage each other's strengths to expand their reach and increase their market share.
The move is also expected to bring significant benefits to consumers. The combined company will offer a wider range of hotels and resorts, more loyalty programs, and enhanced service standards. The merger will also create opportunities for new investments in technology, sustainability, and innovation.
In a joint statement, Christopher Nassetta and David Brown said, "We are thrilled to reunite the Hilton brand after 32 years. This is a significant milestone for both companies, and we are confident that the merger will create significant value for our shareholders, our employees, and our guests. We look forward to building a stronger, more innovative, and more sustainable hospitality company together."
