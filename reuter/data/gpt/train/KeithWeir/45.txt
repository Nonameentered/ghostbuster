The iconic Wembley Stadium, home to the England national football team and host to countless historic sporting events, is set to be transformed into a world-class national stadium with a $200 million investment.
The ambitious plans, revealed today by the Football Association (FA), will see Wembley Stadium undergo a major overhaul to improve facilities for fans, players and staff, and enhance the overall matchday experience.
The investment will be used to add new facilities to the stadium, including state-of-the-art spectator lounges, upgraded media and broadcast facilities, and improved player and coaching areas.
There will also be extensive renovations to the stadium's seating and concourse areas, including new food and beverage options and improved accessibility for disabled fans.
The plans also include major improvements to the exterior of the stadium, with the installation of a new lighting system that will give the venue a striking new look, and the construction of a new park and green space surrounding the stadium, providing more opportunities for fans to enjoy the area around the stadium.
The renovations are expected to begin in 2022, with the goal of completing the project by 2024, in time for the UEFA European Football Championship, which will be hosted by England.
In a statement, Mark Bullingham, the Chief Executive of the Football Association, said: "Wembley Stadium is one of the most historic football stadiums in the world, and we are committed to ensuring it remains a world-class venue for decades to come.
"This investment will provide fans with an even better matchday experience, while also creating new facilities and opportunities for local communities and businesses.
"We are excited about the transformational impact this project will have on both our national stadium and the wider community."
The news has been welcomed by football fans and local businesses, who believe that the upgrades will benefit the area economically and culturally, bringing more tourists and visitors to the surrounding area.
The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: "Wembley Stadium is an iconic institution and this investment shows once again why London is the sporting capital of the world.
"This project will create jobs, boost the economy and provide a world-class sporting venue that will be the envy of the world. It is fantastic news for London and for football fans everywhere."
