Carlton Communications has made a strategic move by acquiring Westcountry Television, a regional broadcaster that covers the South West of England, as part of the ITV sector consolidation. The acquisition is set to further strengthen Carlton Communication's position in the media industry.
The deal, which was signed earlier this week, will see Carlton Communications, one of the UK's leading media companies, take over Westcountry Television's operations. In exchange, Westcountry's shareholders will receive a cash and stock deal valued at Â£35 million.
Commenting on the acquisition, Carlton Communications CEO, Peter Cazalet said: "We are delighted to announce the acquisition of Westcountry Television, which is a great fit for Carlton. The deal will increase our market share in the ITV sector and strengthen our position in the South West of England, an area with a strong and loyal audience."
The acquisition follows the recent consolidation within the ITV sector, with a number of regional broadcasters being acquired by larger media companies. The move has been driven by the need for regional broadcasters to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving media landscape.
"The consolidation within the ITV sector is a natural progression in an increasingly competitive media industry," added Cazalet. "We are confident that this deal will enhance Carlton's offerings and help us to remain competitive and relevant in the long term."
Westcountry's Chairman, Lord Wade, said: "The board of Westcountry Television recognises the benefits that this acquisition will bring to our shareholders, our employees and our viewers. We are confident that Carlton will continue to build on the strengths of our company and take it to the next level."
Westcountry's programming is well-regarded for its local focus, which is a major reason why Carlton made the acquisition. Carlton Communication plans to maintain Westcountry's programming and local focus, while also offering expanded access to national advertising.
With the acquisition of Westcountry Television, Carlton Communication will now have a stronger presence in the South West of England, a region with more than 5 million viewers. The acquisition will give Carlton access to that audience and offer advertisers a chance to reach that audience.
The consolidation within the ITV sector is expected to continue, with the larger media companies looking to acquire the smaller regional broadcasters. The move is seen as a way to increase market share and remain competitive in a rapidly changing media landscape.
Overall, the acquisition of Westcountry Television by Carlton Communication represents a significant milestone in the ITV sector consolidation. It offers Carlton an opportunity to expand its reach in the UK, while also giving Westcountry a chance to remain competitive in a changing media landscape. With a market share expansion and stronger audience reach, Carlton Communication is well-positioned to remain a major player in the media industry.
