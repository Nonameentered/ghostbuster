Shares of Pearson Plc, the global education publishing company, bounced back on Monday following a trading statement for the first three months of the year. The shares shot up by 5% to 785.20p as investors were reassured after the company reported encouraging figures.
Pearson’s trading statement showed that the company’s sales growth for the first three months of the year was up by 5%, beating the expectations of analysts. It also showed that higher education courseware, digital learning, and virtual schools drove the growth.
John Fallon, CEO of Pearson, said that the company was on track to meet its full-year earnings and cash targets. He said that the company’s learning platform, Pearson Online Academy was performing well, as was its Edexcel examination board.
Sarah Simon, an analyst at Berenberg, described Pearson’s results as a “solid performance”. She said that although sales growth was down on the same period last year, the results were still above market expectations. She also noted that Pearson’s trading statement reflected that the Covid-19 pandemic had less of an impact on the business than the previous year.
Pearson’s results reflect a wider trend of increased digitisation in the education sector, driven by the pandemic. In February, the company announced the sale of its remaining stake in Penguin Random House, a major book publisher, to focus on its core business of education publishing.
Pearson's shares have had a bumpy ride over the past year, falling by more than 21% since the beginning of the pandemic. However, following Monday’s trading statement, analysts are feeling more positive about the company’s prospects.
Pearson’s success is seen as an important indicator of the health of the education sector. With the pandemic leading to the rise of remote learning, education publishers like Pearson have had to adapt quickly to the changing market. Pearson’s sales growth is a sign that the company has been successful in doing so.
Investors will be watching closely to see if Pearson can continue to build on its success in the months ahead. But for now, the company’s shares are likely to be boosted by Monday’s trading statement and the positive outlook for the education industry.
