BSkyB, the UK-based media and entertainment giant, has reported a staggering 66% rise in full-year profit. The company's profits soared to over Â£250 million ($331 million) for the year ending June 30, 2021, following a strong performance across all of its business segments.
The impressive performance was largely driven by a surge in demand for digital services during the pandemic, as more people stayed at home and relied on streaming platforms for entertainment. BSkyB's streaming service, Sky Q, was particularly successful, with the company adding over 500,000 new subscribers in the last quarter alone.
In addition to its streaming services, BSkyB also saw growth in its advertising and production businesses. The company's advertising revenue grew by 12%, driven by increased ad spend from clients in the e-commerce and finance sectors. Meanwhile, the company's production business, Sky Studios, saw a 15% increase in revenue, thanks to a strong portfolio of original content and popular franchises.
Commenting on the company's impressive results, BSkyB CEO, Jeremy Darroch, said, "This has been an outstanding year for BSkyB, and I couldn't be more proud of our team and the hard work they've put in to achieve these results. We've seen strong demand for our digital services and our original content, and we're well-positioned to continue this momentum in the coming years."
Looking ahead, BSkyB plans to capitalize on its strong position in the digital media landscape by investing in new technology and expanding its content offerings. The company recently announced plans to launch a new streaming service, Sky Q Max, which will offer a premium viewing experience and access to a wider range of content.
"We're not resting on our laurels," Darroch added. "We know that the media landscape is constantly evolving, and we're committed to staying ahead of the curve and delivering the best possible experience for our customers."
The news of BSkyB's strong financial performance comes as the company prepares for a potential merger with rival media giant, Comcast. The two companies have been in talks for several months, and a deal could be announced as early as next month.
If the merger goes ahead, it would create a media juggernaut with a combined market value of over $250 billion. However, it remains to be seen whether regulators will approve the deal, given concerns around competition and the potential impact on consumers.
