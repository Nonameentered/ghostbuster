Camelot, the UK's national lottery operator, has announced a significant hit to its interim profits due to a dramatic drop in scratchcard sales. The company revealed that its scratchcard sales have plummeted by a staggering £450 million in the first half of the year, leading to an 18% fall in profits before tax and interest.
Camelot's CEO, Nigel Railton, cited multiple reasons for the decline in scratchcard sales, including the pandemic and the growing popularity of online gambling. However, he acknowledged that the decline was much steeper than expected and represented a real challenge for the company.
"We have been observing a trend towards online gambling for a while, but the pandemic has significantly accelerated it," Railton said. "With the lockdowns and social distancing measures, people are spending more time at home and turning to the internet for entertainment. Unfortunately, that has had a negative impact on our scratchcard sales."
Camelot's profits before tax and interest for the six months ended September 2021 amounted to £38.3 million, down from £46.5 million during the same period last year. The company's revenue fell by 11%, from £3.27 billion to £2.9 billion, due to the sharp decline in scratchcard sales.
The UK government, which owns Camelot's license, received £1.2 billion in lottery duty from the company in the first half of the year. That figure was down from the £1.4 billion it received in the same period last year. Camelot also paid £880 million in prize money during the period, compared to £1.01 billion last year.
Despite the poor performance in scratchcard sales, Camelot saw a surge in online lottery ticket sales, which rose by 23% in the first six months of the year. The company also launched several new games, including a game that offers a top prize of £10,000 per month for 30 years.
Railton said Camelot was taking steps to address the decline in scratchcard sales, including introducing new games and improving its marketing efforts. He also expressed optimism that the company would bounce back in the second half of the year.
"We are a resilient company, and we will continue to adapt to the changing landscape of the industry," Railton said. "We have a strong portfolio of games and a dedicated team of employees who are committed to delivering an outstanding gaming experience for our players."
Camelot has been the national lottery operator in the UK since 1994 and is responsible for running the lottery's main draw, scratchcards, and online games. The company donates a portion of its profits to charity, with more than £42 billion raised for good causes since its inception.
