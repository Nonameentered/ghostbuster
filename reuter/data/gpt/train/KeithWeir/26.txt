The United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into several leading travel companies for alleged anti-competitive practices in foreign package holidays. The investigation has taken place following numerous complaints from customers and smaller travel agencies regarding their experiences of unfair pricing, hidden charges, and restrictions on the sale of products.
The CMA has not disclosed which travel companies are currently under investigation. However, it is believed that several major travel providers are included in the inquiry, which could result in rough penalties and legal action. These travel companies are being investigated for violating the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, which protects consumers from unfair commercial practices.
The investigation will focus on three primary areas of concern: the alleged restriction of competition on sales of holiday accommodations and packages, the assessment of travel insurance policies and suppression of the availability of favorable insurance policies, and the potential use of differential pricing mechanisms that are anti-competitive.
It is alleged that some travel companies have engaged in unfair practices, such as not disclosing all additional fees and charges to customers at the time of booking, combining prices for flights and accommodation when they would be lower if booked separately, and pressuring customers to purchase add-ons they may not require. This is especially apparent in the market for holiday accommodations, where major players have been accused of limiting competition, leading to unfair pricing for consumers.
Travel companies are also accused of assessing and selling travel insurance policies in a manner that is not transparent. It is claimed that some travel operators have stealthily included unwanted insurance policies in holiday packages, compromising the customer's right to choose freely in line with the regulations. Some consumers have also allegedly been told that their travel insurance only covers a limited range of activities when, in truth, these were covered by the policy.
Additionally, differential pricing mechanisms are particularly worrying as they have a direct impact on a consumer's access to and affordability of products. Studies have shown that these mechanisms disproportionately affect younger, less economically secure individuals. The CMA’s investigation aims to scrutinize this practice and ensure that all consumers have fair access to all holiday products.
The CMA’s probe reinforces the message that companies will be held accountable for the fair and transparent pricing of their products at all times. As the travel industry grapples with reduced travel volumes amid the Covid-19 pandemic, consumers are increasingly sensitive to pricing and hidden costs. The investigation is therefore both timely and vital for the improvement of consumer welfare.
The Competition and Markets Authority said earlier in a statement that it had opened a case into the practice in response to concerns from consumers, as well as holiday accommodation providers, which saw their properties blocked from being listed on certain websites because of contractual demands.
The investigation is ongoing and travel companies under investigation will be required to provide information and answer questions from the CMA as part of the inquiry. If companies are found guilty of anti-competitive practices, they could face hefty fines and other penalties. It remains to be seen what the outcome will bring, but the investigation is a comprehensive step to ensure that consumers are treated fairly and transparently in the travel industry.
