The Granada Group, one of the largest hospitality and leisure companies in the UK, has announced a 37% rise in their annual profits, following their acquisition of luxury hotel brand Forte last year.
The group's annual financial report showed a pre-tax profit of £472 million, up from £345 million in the previous year. This increase was largely attributed to the success of the Forte hotels that were added to Granada's portfolio, which saw a 13% rise in revenue over the year.
The Forte takeover was a significant move for Granada, as the family-owned luxury hotel group brought with it a collection of high-end properties including The Ritz in London and the George V in Paris. Granada's takeover was met with some controversy, as some criticized the company for bringing a more commercial and corporate approach to the traditional Forte brand.
However, the financial results seem to indicate that the acquisition has paid off, with Granada Group CEO Gerry Robinson stating, "The acquisition of Forte was a strategic and bold move for us that has delivered significant financial results, and we are confident that we will continue to see strong growth in the coming years."
In addition to the Forte hotels, Granada's other businesses have also shown steady growth over the year. Their hospitality division, which includes brands such as Beefeater and Brewers Fayre, saw a 6% increase in sales. Their media division, which includes ITV and the film production company Granada Productions, also saw healthy profits.
However, Granada's travel division, which includes the motorway service stations and the Travelodge hotel chain, saw a slight decrease in profits. This was attributed to a decline in the number of people using motorways, as well as increased competition in the budget hotel sector.
Despite this dip in profits, CEO Robinson remains positive about the future of the travel division, stating that they have a "strong pipeline" of new Travelodge hotels set to open in the coming year.
The Granada Group has also been investing in new technologies and initiatives aimed at enhancing the guest experience in their hotels and restaurants. This includes the roll-out of digital ordering technology in their restaurants, as well as an AI-powered chatbot to assist guests with their enquiries.
Robinson stated that the company's continued investment in technology will be key to their success in the coming years, saying, "We are living in a rapidly changing world, and we need to be agile and responsive to the needs of our customers. Our investments in technology and innovation will help us to stay ahead of the curve and provide the best possible experience for our guests."
Overall, the Granada Group's financial results demonstrate their success in the ever-evolving hospitality and leisure sector. With their acquisition of Forte, alongside their strong performance in their other businesses, Granada looks set to continue its growth and success in the years to come.
