UK media company EMAP has announced plans to resolve a damaging boardroom row that has been ongoing for several months. The dispute first came to light in July, when two of EMAP's directors, James Johnson and Sarah Smith, publicly accused the company's executives of mismanagement.
This led to a public spat between the two factions, with Johnson and Smith demanding changes to EMAP's strategy and corporate governance, while the company's executive team defended its record and cast doubt on the directors' motives.
However, in a statement released yesterday, EMAP confirmed that it had agreed to an independent review of its board structures and processes, in a bid to address Johnson and Smith's concerns. The review will be carried out by an external consultant, with the results expected to be published early next year.
"We are committed to ensuring that EMAP's board is operating effectively and in the best interests of all our stakeholders," said chairman David Jones. "This review is an important step towards achieving that goal, and we look forward to implementing any recommendations that emerge from it."
The news has been greeted positively by industry experts and investors, who had been concerned about the potential impact of the dispute on EMAP's strong financial performance. The company's most recent results, released in September, showed a 12% increase in revenues and a 23% rise in profits for the first half of the year.
"EMAP has been one of the standout performers in the UK media sector in recent years, and it's good to see that the company is taking steps to resolve its internal issues and focus on continuing that success," said Michael James, a media analyst at investment bank Cowen.
The resolution of the boardroom row is also seen as a positive development for EMAP's employees, who had expressed concern about the impact of the dispute on morale and job security. The company employs around 850 people across its various divisions, which include print and digital publishing, events and data services.
"I'm pleased that we can now put this behind us and get back to focusing on the important work we do for our customers and clients," said EMAP CEO Diane Young. "We have a great team here at EMAP, and I'm confident that we can build on our recent success and continue to grow and innovate in the years ahead."
EMAP's announcement comes amid a broader period of consolidation and change in the UK media industry, with several major deals and mergers taking place in recent months. This has led to speculation that the industry may be entering a new phase of growth and development, with EMAP likely to be a key player in that process.
