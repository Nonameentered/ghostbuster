BT and MCI have entered into a joint venture to create "Concert," a $40 billion company that will compete with AT&T for dominance in the US long-distance market. The strategic move by the two telecommunications giants comes as the demand for long-distance services is on the rise, driven by the growth of the Internet and the need for fast and reliable connections.
BT CEO Sir Peter Bonfield and MCI CEO Gerald Taylor announced the partnership at a press conference in London on Monday. The two CEOs emphasized the synergies between the two companies and the complementary strengths they bring to the table.
"By joining forces, we can offer customers a global reach and a range of services that no other company can match," Bonfield said. "Concert will be the premier provider of voice, data, Internet, and multimedia services on a global scale."
Taylor echoed Bonfield's sentiments, saying that MCI's strengths in data and Internet services, combined with BT's expertise in voice and multimedia communications, will create a powerful force in the market.
"We believe that Concert will be a leader in the convergence of voice and data services," Taylor said. "We will offer customers a seamless and comprehensive suite of communications solutions that will enable them to conduct business more efficiently and effectively."
The creation of Concert will be a major challenge to AT&T, which currently dominates the long-distance market in the US. According to industry analysts, AT&T has a 60% market share in long-distance services, with MCI coming in a distant second at around 14%.
However, the analysts say that the partnership between BT and MCI could give AT&T a run for its money. With Concert's global reach and extensive network infrastructure, it could pose a serious threat to AT&T's dominance in the US.
"Concert will be a formidable player in the market," said Eric Paulak, an analyst with Gartner Group. "It will have the ability to offer customers a range of services that go beyond just long-distance calling. It will be able to provide high-speed Internet access, data networking, and multimedia services, which will be key selling points."
The creation of Concert is not without its challenges, however. The two companies will have to navigate complex regulatory hurdles, including securing government approval for the merger and dealing with antitrust issues.
In addition, the cultural differences between the two companies could also pose a challenge. BT is a British company that is known for its bureaucratic and hierarchical structure, while MCI is an American company that values speed and innovation.
However, the two CEOs believe that they can overcome these challenges by focusing on the strengths of each company and building a strong and cohesive team.
"We recognize that there are cultural differences between our two companies, but we are committed to working together to create a seamless and efficient organization," Bonfield said. "We will build a team that is made up of the best and the brightest from both companies, and we will create a culture that values speed, innovation, and customer service."
The creation of Concert is expected to take several months to complete, and the two companies have not yet provided a timeline for when the new company will begin operations. However, industry observers say that the creation of Concert is a significant development in the telecommunications industry, and it could have far-reaching implications for the future of long-distance services.
"Concert is a game-changer," Paulak said. "It will challenge the status quo and force other companies to step up their game. In the end, this is good news for customers, as it will lead to more choices and better services."
