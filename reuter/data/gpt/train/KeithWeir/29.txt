EMI Shares Surge After Positive Outlook for Global Music Market
Shares of EMI, the British music company that represents artists such as Katy Perry and Coldplay, have surged after a positive outlook for the global music market. Industry experts predict that the music market will continue to grow over the next few years, with EMI well-positioned to take advantage of this growth.
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) recently released its annual report on the global music market, which showed that the industry grew by 7.4% in 2020, despite the pandemic. This growth is expected to continue in 2021 and beyond, driven by the increasing popularity of music streaming services and a rebound in live music events as the world emerges from the pandemic.
“We are delighted by the positive outlook for the global music market,” said EMI CEO Eric Nicoli. “This is a great opportunity for our company and our artists. We have a strong portfolio of talent and we are well-positioned to take advantage of this growth.”
EMI has already seen strong growth in its streaming revenue, which has more than doubled over the past three years. The company has also made strategic acquisitions in recent years, including Sony/ATV Music Publishing and the music rights of Motown Records.
Industry experts predict that EMI will continue to grow faster than the overall music market due to its strong position in the industry and its ability to generate revenue from both streaming and live events.
“The music industry is experiencing a period of rapid growth and EMI is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend,” said industry analyst Ivan Hoffman. “They have a strong portfolio of artists and a solid business model that includes both streaming revenue and live events. We expect to see continued growth in EMI’s share price as a result.”
EMI is not the only music company benefiting from the positive outlook for the global music market. Shares of Universal Music Group, the world’s largest music company, have also seen strong growth recently, as have shares of Warner Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment.
The IFPI report also highlighted the increasing importance of Asia in the global music market. The report showed that the Asia-Pacific region is now the second-largest music market in the world, after the United States. This presents a significant growth opportunity for EMI, which has a strong presence in the Asian market.
“We see tremendous potential in the Asian market,” said Nicoli. “We have already had success with artists such as Katy Perry and Coldplay in this region, and we believe we can continue to grow our presence there.”
Overall, EMI’s strong position in the music industry and its ability to generate revenue from both streaming and live events make it well-positioned to benefit from the positive outlook for the global music market. As the industry continues to grow, EMI’s share price is likely to continue its upward trajectory.
