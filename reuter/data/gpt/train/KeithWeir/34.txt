Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp reunite global hotel brand for the first time since 1964
Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp, two of the largest hotel chains in the world, have announced their reunion as a single global hotel brand. The merger will come into effect later this year, and the new brand will be known as Hilton Worldwide.
This is the first time in 57 years that these two hospitality giants have joined forces. The merger was announced on Tuesday by Nick Hillier, CEO of Ladbroke, and Christopher J. Nassetta, President and CEO of Hilton, at a press conference in London.
Hillier stated, "We are thrilled to be bringing together two of the most iconic hospitality brands in the world. This is a historic moment that will redefine the industry."
The new brand will represent more than 6,000 hotels in 119 countries and territories, with a portfolio of 17 diverse brands ranging from luxury to economy class. It will also employ over 400,000 people worldwide.
Nassetta added, "This is an exciting moment for our guests, team members, owners, and partners. Together, we will continue to deliver exceptional experiences to our customers and communities around the world."
The merger will lead to the creation of new job opportunities, as well as greater economic and social benefits for regions where Hilton Worldwide operates. The two companies share a strong commitment to corporate social responsibility, and will continue to support community initiatives and environmental sustainability.
The board of directors of Hilton Worldwide will be composed of executives from both companies, with Hillier serving as Chairman and Nassetta as Vice Chairman. The headquarters of the new brand will be located in London.
The merger is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals. Customers of Hilton and Ladbroke can expect to see a seamless transition, with no disruption to bookings or loyalty programs.
Analysts predict that the merger will enable the new company to compete more effectively in rapidly changing markets, such as the rise of home-sharing platforms like Airbnb and the impact of COVID-19 on the travel industry.
According to Hillier, "We see this as an opportunity to enhance our capabilities, optimize our resources, and drive innovation to meet the evolving needs of our guests. Together, we will be stronger and more resilient."
The reunion of Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp represents a bold move in the hospitality industry, and is expected to have major implications for the future of the sector. As the world slowly recovers from the pandemic, the merger signals a renewed commitment to providing safe, comfortable, and enjoyable experiences for travelers around the globe.
