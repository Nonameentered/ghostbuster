Carlton Communications has announced its plans to expand its operations into pay television following a 20% increase in annual profit.
The London-based company reported a profit of £700 million ($911 million) in the fiscal year ending in September 2019, up from £580 million ($755 million) the previous year.
Carlton Communications, which owns a range of media assets including ITV, said it plans to launch a new pay TV service to compete with the likes of Sky and BT.
According to the company, pay TV has been a growing sector in recent years, with more and more consumers looking for high-quality content on demand.
CEO James Hambro said in a statement that the company had identified pay TV as "a major growth area" and that it was "committed to investing in new content and technology to ensure that we remain competitive in this arena."
Hambro said that Carlton would be looking to work with existing content providers as well as developing its own programming. The company has already signed a deal with Netflix to provide its users with access to a range of popular TV shows and movies.
The move into pay TV is seen as a significant shift for Carlton Communications, which has traditionally focused on free-to-air television.
However, the company has been facing increased competition from streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu, which have all been gaining in popularity in recent years.
The new pay TV service will be available to customers in the UK and is likely to be launched in the coming year.
Carlton Communications has also announced plans to invest in new technologies, including artificial intelligence and virtual reality, to enhance the user experience.
The company has already launched a range of new digital services, including a mobile app that provides users with access to ITV's programming and other exclusive content.
Hambro said that the company was committed to "embracing new technologies and staying ahead of the curve" to ensure that it remained competitive in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
The move into pay TV is likely to be welcomed by investors, with the company's share price rising by more than 5% following the announcement.
However, the company faces a number of challenges, including the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the media industry and the continued dominance of established players such as Sky and BT.
Despite these challenges, Hambro said that he was confident that Carlton Communications could succeed in the pay TV market, saying that the company had "a strong track record of delivering high-quality content and innovative solutions."
"We believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the evolving media landscape," he added.
