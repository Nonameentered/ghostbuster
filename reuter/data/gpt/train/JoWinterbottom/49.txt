The recently announced budget of the United Kingdom brought in changes to the tax code that have hit utility sector stocks hard. The property tax overhaul has impacted revenue projections for utility companies, but experts are predicting a quick recovery.
The tax changes are set to raise the corporate tax rate from 19% to 25% in 2023-24 for businesses earning over £250,000 a year. The treasury announced changes to the UK's system of property taxes by raising an annual tax on commercial property to 1.5% of value, up from 0.5%, effective from April 2022.
As a result, companies in the utilities sector that own significant land have lowered their profit forecasts. Shares of power firms have also been hit hard, with Centrica, SSE, and National Grid being the biggest losers.
Utility companies that own significant land are now set to pay more in property taxes under the new rules. Centrica, the owner of British Gas and Hive, has warned that the changes could reduce earnings by around £510m over the next five years. Additionally, SSE, a major supplier of electricity and gas in the UK, reduced its profit forecast by £150m due to the new tax hikes on commercial property.
Despite the significant hit on stocks in the utilities sector, analysts are optimistic that the industry will bounce back. Ed Monk, an analyst at Fidelity International, said that "SSE and National Grid have navigated the last year of Covid-19 and the pandemic recovery is now in sight. The pressures from higher taxes are a setback but they will remain reliable, dividend-paying shares".
Many experts agree that the sector will recover soon, as the underlying fundamentals of the utilities industry remain strong. The modernization of the grid and investments in renewable energy sources are expected to drive growth for power companies in the long term. Additionally, the UK's efforts to reduce carbon emissions could provide further growth opportunities in the future.
Further, revenue losses from property taxes are unlikely to be significant in the long term, as utility companies own significant land, increasing their value proposition over a longer period.
The utilities sector is one of the most important in the UK economy, providing electricity, gas, and water to households and businesses across the country. The industry has been under pressure in recent years from changing regulations and increased competition, but has proven to be resilient, with major players like Centrica, SSE, and National Grid continuing to deliver strong financial results year after year.
Overall, while the new tax changes have hit utilities stocks initially, the industry's underlying resilience is expected to lead to a quick recovery in the coming quarters.
While some adjustments may be necessary in the short-term, the UK's utilities sector remains a solid prospect for long-term investors, with the fundamentals showing that it has a bright future ahead. The opportunities presented by green energy to the utilities industry are massive, with increasing emphasis on sustainability and the decarbonization of the UK economy.
