Hyder's Shares Soar as Profits Rise by 25% Thanks to Takeover of Electricity Business Swalec
Hyder, the UK-based utility company, has experienced a surge in share prices as its profits soar following the successful takeover of electricity business Swalec. Hyder announced that its net profits had risen by 25% to £37.2m during the last financial year, largely due to the acquisition of Swalec, which has strengthened the company's position in the competitive energy market.
Hyder CEO, Sarah Edwards, expressed her satisfaction with the acquisition, which she said was a strategic move to improve the company's service offerings and customer base. "We are pleased with the results of the takeover of Swalec, which has broadened our customer base, added to our asset base and given us a greater ability to leverage our expertise in the energy sector," she said.
Swalec, which was previously owned by energy company SSE, operates in the South Wales and west of England regions and has over 1.3 million customers. Hyder's acquisition of Swalec has enabled it to offer a broader range of services to its existing customers and has expanded its reach to a wider market segment, extending its network to key urban areas in South Wales and west of England. 
Hyder's financial results indicate that the acquisition of Swalec has had a significant impact on the company's performance. Its revenue increased by 12% to £472m, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) went up by 22% to £108.6m. The company's net debt also decreased by £20m, thanks to the efficient integration of Swalec.
"Our results demonstrate the success of our strategic investments, our focus on operational efficiency, and our commitment to delivering value to our customers," said Edwards.
The acquisition of Swalec is just one of a series of strategic moves that Hyder has made in recent years to increase its market share and improve its profitability. In 2018, Hyder acquired water utility Bristol Water for £235m, further expanding its market presence.
Hyder has also invested heavily in renewable energy projects, including wind farms and solar power facilities, in line with its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and contributing to the transition to cleaner energy. Hyder's renewable energy investments have earned them a reputation as one of the leading green energy companies in the UK.
The company's financial performance has attracted the attention of investors, leading to a surge in share prices. Hyder's share price increased by 7% following the announcement of the financial results, reaching £6.87.
As Hyder continues to expand its presence in the energy and water sectors, its focus remains on providing affordable, reliable, and sustainable services to its customers. The company is also committed to promoting social and environmental responsibility, supporting local communities and reducing its carbon footprint. 
"We are confident in our ability to deliver value to our shareholders, while also contributing to a sustainable future for the UK's energy and water sectors," said Edwards. 
With the acquisition of Swalec fueling its financial growth, Hyder is set to continue its upward trajectory in the competitive UK utility market.
