New York-based Entergy Corporation is reportedly considering a potential $2 billion bid for London Electricity, sources close to the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Entergy, one of the largest electricity providers in the United States, is said to be eyeing the acquisition as part of its international expansion strategy.
The move would make Entergy the latest U.S. energy firm to enter the UK market, following recent deals by companies such as NextEra Energy and Eversource Energy.
Sources familiar with the matter said that Entergy has been studying London Electricity for several months and has already held preliminary talks with the company's management.
The sources added that Entergy is attracted to London Electricity's position as one of the largest electricity distributors in the UK, as well as its significant investment in renewable energy.
If Entergy were to acquire London Electricity, it would mark the latest in a string of overseas acquisitions by the company. In recent years, Entergy has expanded its operations in Canada and Mexico, and has also entered the Australian market.
The news comes as the UK government is preparing to launch a major auction of offshore wind power, which is expected to attract significant interest from international energy firms.
London Electricity, which is part of the Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, has already stated its intention to participate in the upcoming auction.
However, analysts suggest that a potential acquisition by Entergy could complicate London Electricity's participation in the auction, as the company would be subject to regulatory approval from the UK government.
Entergy declined to comment on the matter when contacted by Reuters.
London Electricity is one of the largest electricity distributors in the UK, serving around 1.5 million customers in London and the South East of England.
The company also has significant investments in renewable energy, including wind farms and solar plants.
In recent years, London Electricity has been investing heavily in upgrading its infrastructure, with plans to upgrade thousands of substations across its network.
The potential acquisition by Entergy is just the latest in a string of major deals in the UK energy sector, as firms seek to capitalize on the country's move towards renewable energy.
Earlier this month, U.S. energy giant NextEra Energy announced a deal to acquire British clean energy firm Vento Ludens.
The $2 billion deal will give NextEra access to a significant portfolio of wind, solar, and battery storage assets in the UK, as well as a pipeline of new projects.
Meanwhile, Eversource Energy recently announced a $1.1 billion deal to acquire a 100% stake in the UK energy company ScottishPower Renewables.
The move will give Eversource control of ScottishPower's portfolio of wind, solar, and energy storage projects in the UK, which currently has a total capacity of 2.1 GW.
As the UK continues to invest in renewable energy and move away from fossil fuels, it is likely that we will see further international acquisitions in the energy sector in the coming years.
