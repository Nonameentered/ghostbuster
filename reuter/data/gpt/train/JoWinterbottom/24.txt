London, UK – Thames Water, the UK’s largest water utility company, has reported a strong rise in its profits and dividend, sending its shares in the sector up by 1.5%, and boosting investor confidence in the industry as a whole.
The company, which supplies water to over 15 million customers and treats more than four billion litres of sewage each day, said that pre-tax profits for the year ended 31 March rose by 13.3% to £311.3m. It also announced a final dividend of 27.18p per share, taking the total for the year to 41.18p, up from 39.6p last year.
Thames Water’s performance was driven by increasing customer numbers, higher retail prices for water, and cost-cutting measures. The company added 72,000 new customers during the year, while the average household bill rose by 3.8% to £363. The company said it had managed to achieve cost savings of £72m during the year, mainly through efficiencies in its supply chain and a reduction in operational costs.
“Our strong financial performance this year reflects the hard work and dedication of our employees, who have done an outstanding job in providing high-quality water and wastewater services to our customers,” said Steve Robertson, Thames Water’s CEO. “We have made significant progress in improving our services and reducing our costs, and we are committed to continuing this work into the future.”
Robertson added that the company was also investing heavily in upgrading its infrastructure, with over £11bn earmarked for capital expenditure over the next five years. This includes a major programme of upgrades to its treatment plants and pipelines, as well as investment in new technology to improve efficiency and reduce leakage.
The news sent shares in Thames Water up by over 1.5%, while other water utility companies also saw gains. Severn Trent was up 0.5%, while United Utilities rose by 0.4%. The stronger performance of the sector reflects growing investor confidence in the water industry, which has faced significant regulatory challenges in recent years.
The sector has been grappling with the issue of leakage, which has attracted considerable public and political scrutiny, as well as tougher economic regulation from Ofwat, the industry regulator. In its most recent price review, Ofwat imposed stricter limits on the amount of money the companies can charge customers, in a bid to drive up efficiency and reduce bills.
However, the improved financial performance of Thames Water may help to assuage these concerns, and boost investor confidence in the sector. The company’s CEO, Steve Robertson, said that the company was committed to working with Ofwat to achieve these objectives, and to delivering high-quality services to its customers.
“We are acutely aware of the challenges facing our industry, both in terms of meeting the needs of our customers, and responding to the demands of regulators and investors,” he said. “But we are confident that we have the skills, the technology, and the commitment to meet these challenges head-on, and to deliver value for our stakeholders in the years ahead.”
