CalEnergy Launches $1.2 Billion Takeover Bid for Northern Electric Plc, Promptly Rejected
CalEnergy, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, has launched a $1.2 billion takeover bid for Northern Electric Plc. The offer, which represents a 30% premium on Northern Electric's share price, was promptly rejected by the companyâ€™s board of directors.
Northern Electric Plc is a major electricity distributor based in the United Kingdom, serving over 3.8 million customers across the north of England. The company has been experiencing financial difficulties in recent years, with revenue falling by 15% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
CalEnergy, which has a presence in the UK energy market through its subsidiaries including MidAmerican Energy and PacifiCorp, sees the acquisition of Northern Electric as a strategic opportunity to expand its business in the UK and Europe.
The offer, launched on Tuesday, was accompanied by an open letter from CalEnergy CEO, Fredrick Spoor, which highlighted the potential benefits of the transaction for both companies.
"CalEnergy is a long-term investor in the UK energy sector, and we believe that a partnership with Northern Electric would create significant value for both our shareholders and customers," Spoor wrote.
He also reassured Northern Electric customers that the company would continue to operate as a regulated utility and that there would be no disruption to their services if the takeover bid were to succeed.
However, the Northern Electric board of directors promptly rejected the offer, stating that it undervalued the company and did not reflect its true worth. The board also expressed concern about the impact of the acquisition on Northern Electric's employees and stakeholders.
"The board has considered the offer carefully and believes that it significantly undervalues the company and its long-term prospects," said Ian Mason, the chair of Northern Electric's board.
"The board is confident in the company's ability to overcome its current challenges and continue to deliver essential services to our customers and stakeholders."
The rejection of CalEnergy's offer was met with disappointment from some of Northern Electric's shareholders, who have seen the company's share price decline by around 60% over the past five years.
However, others have expressed support for the board's decision, with some analysts suggesting that CalEnergy's offer may have been too low given the challenges facing Northern Electric.
"The offer price is at the low end of expectations and may not be enough to sway the board," said Richard Jukes, an energy analyst at investment bank Jefferies.
"Northern Electric is facing a number of challenges, including declining revenue and increased competition, which could make it a risky investment."
CalEnergy has not yet announced if it intends to make an improved offer for Northern Electric. However, the company has made it clear that it remains committed to expanding its presence in the UK energy market.
"We believe that there is significant potential for growth and investment in the UK energy sector, and we will continue to explore opportunities to expand our business," Spoor said.
The Northern Electric board has also said that it remains open to potential partnerships and collaborations with other companies in the energy sector, including CalEnergy.
"We are always looking for opportunities to work with other companies to deliver better services to our customers and stakeholders," Mason said.
"Whilst we have rejected this offer, we remain open to exploring other potential partnerships and collaborations in the future."
