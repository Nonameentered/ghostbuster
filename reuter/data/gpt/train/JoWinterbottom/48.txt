National Grid, the UK's main energy transmission company, is set to report a rise in profits for the first half of the year. The firm is also expected to address new pricing controls that have been introduced by the UK's energy regulator.
According to analysts, National Grid is set to announce a pre-tax profit of around Â£1.2bn ($1.5bn) for the six months to the end of September. The company's strong performance has been driven by a rise in transmission revenues, as well as improvements in its US operations.
In addition to announcing its financial results, National Grid is expected to address the new pricing controls that have been introduced by Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator. The controls aim to limit the profits that National Grid can make on its electricity and gas transmission networks. The company has previously raised concerns that the new controls could result in less investment in the energy infrastructure.
John Pettigrew, National Grid's CEO, is expected to reiterate the company's commitment to investing in the UK's energy infrastructure, despite the new pricing controls. Speaking to reporters ahead of the results announcement, Pettigrew said that the company was "ambitious and confident" about its future in the UK.
"We're investing in the energy infrastructure that our country needs, to keep the lights on and power the economy," he said. "We're also working hard to innovate and improve our services, to ensure that we're delivering the best possible value for our customers."
The new pricing controls have been introduced as part of Ofgem's wider efforts to reform the UK's energy market. The regulator has argued that the controls are necessary to ensure that consumers are paying a fair price for their energy, and to encourage more investment in renewable energy sources.
Despite National Grid's concerns about the impact of the new controls, the company is still expected to pay out a dividend to its shareholders. The company has previously said that it plans to maintain its dividend payments, despite the challenging economic and regulatory environment.
