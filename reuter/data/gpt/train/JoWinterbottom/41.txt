US energy company Entergy is said to be considering a bid for London Electricity that could reach as much as Â£1.2bn ($1.5bn). The move comes as the company seeks to expand its UK operation in the face of increasing competition from European rivals.
Entergy has reportedly hired financial advisors to help it explore the potential acquisition of London Electricity, which is one of the largest energy suppliers in the capital. The company is owned by EDF Energy, which is based in France and already operates one of the largest energy companies in the UK.
The move would represent a significant strategic shift for Entergy, which currently operates in the US with a focus on the Gulf Coast, and has recently moved into the renewable energy sector. The company has said that it sees the UK as a key growth market and is keen to expand its presence in the country.
London Electricity has around 2.5 million customers in the capital, making it one of the largest energy suppliers in the UK. The company also operates a significant network of power plants and gas storage facilities across the country.
Sources close to the deal have said that Entergy is likely to face significant competition for London Electricity from other energy companies interested in expanding their presence in the UK market. However, analysts have suggested that the US firm may be willing to pay a premium price for the company in order to secure its position as a major player in the UK energy sector.
If the deal goes ahead, it would represent one of the largest acquisitions of a UK energy company by a US firm in recent years. It would also be seen as a sign of the growing importance of the UK energy market on the international stage, as more and more companies seek to gain a foothold in the country's rapidly evolving energy landscape.
