US-based energy company Entergy has confirmed that it is considering taking over London Electricity, in a potential deal worth Â£1.2bn. The proposed acquisition would see Entergy become the owner of one of the UK's oldest and most established electricity providers and increase its presence in the European market.
The Louisiana-based firm has reportedly been in talks with London Electricity's parent company EDF Energy for several weeks and is said to be in the early stages of making a formal offer. Entergy released a statement today saying that discussions were ongoing, and there was no guarantee that an agreement would be reached.
London Electricity, which has been supplying power to the UK's capital for over 100 years, currently has around 1.5 million customers and operates within the southern region of England. The company has been investing heavily in infrastructure and renewable energy sources in recent years, in line with EDF's stated ambition to become a major player in the country's clean energy transition.
If the deal goes ahead, it would represent a significant expansion for Entergy, which currently operates mainly in the US and Latin America. The company owns and operates a portfolio of nuclear, gas, and coal-fired power plants, as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. It has been undergoing a strategic shift towards renewable energy sources, with a goal of reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.
A takeover of London Electricity would give Entergy a foothold in the UK's electricity market, which is undergoing significant changes as the country transitions towards a greener energy system. The government has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the electricity sector is expected to be a major part of this transition.
The potential deal has yet to receive regulatory approval, and any takeover would likely face scrutiny from both UK and EU competition regulators. Entergy has said that it will provide an update on the progress of negotiations in due course.
