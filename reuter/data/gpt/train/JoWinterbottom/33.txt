Dominion Resources, an American energy company, is set to expand its reach in the United Kingdom with the acquisition of East Midlands Electricity in a $2.1 billion deal. The announcement was made today by Dominion Resources, who stated that the acquisition will give the company greater access to the UK market and improve its overall footprint in Europe.
"Our acquisition of East Midlands Electricity is an important step in our growth strategy," said Thomas F. Farrell II, Chairman, President, and CEO of Dominion Resources. "It brings us closer to our customers and strengthens our position in the UK energy market."
The deal will see Dominion Resources acquire the majority share of East Midlands Electricity, which is based in the East Midlands region of England. The company currently supplies electricity to approximately 4.4 million customers across the UK, and its acquisition will allow Dominion Resources to increase its customer base in the country.
"I am pleased to announce this deal today, which will bring significant benefits to both companies," said Ian Peters, Chief Executive of East Midlands Electricity. "Dominion Resources is a global leader in the energy industry, and their acquisition of our company will provide us with access to the resources we need to continue to improve our services to customers."
The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. Once the deal is finalized, Dominion Resources will continue to operate East Midlands Electricity as a wholly-owned subsidiary, with plans to invest in the company's infrastructure and services.
"The UK energy market is a priority for us, and we are committed to providing reliable, affordable energy to customers across the country," said Farrell. "Our acquisition of East Midlands Electricity is an important part of our strategy to achieve this goal, and we are excited about the prospects for growth and success in the UK market."
Overall, this deal marks an important milestone for Dominion Resources as it expands its operations across the Atlantic. The acquisition of East Midlands Electricity should provide the company with a strong foothold in the UK market, and allow it to deliver its energy services to millions of customers across the country.
