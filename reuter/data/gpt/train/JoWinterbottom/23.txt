The regional electricity companies (Recs) sector may be set for renewed interest after CE Electric announced its intention to bid for Northern Electric. The move comes after recent consolidation in the sector, with ScottishPower taking over Manweb and PowerGen acquiring East Midlands Electricity.
CE Electric, the electricity distribution network operator for the North East of England and Yorkshire, has confirmed that it is considering a bid for Northern Electric, the Newcastle-based electricity distribution company. Northern Electric is currently owned by CalEnergy, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which is in turn owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate.
Northern Electric serves around 3.8 million customers in the North East of England, Yorkshire, and northern Lincolnshire, and has a turnover of around £1.5 billion. The company also owns a significant stake in YEDL, the Yorkshire Electricity Distribution company.
CE Electric, which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola Group, has been investing heavily in its network over the past few years, and has recently completed a £290 million upgrade to its infrastructure. The company believes that its experience in the sector, combined with its financial strength, makes it an ideal partner for Northern Electric.
If CE Electric's bid is successful, it will become the largest electricity distribution company in the UK, with over 10 million customers. The move may also lead to renewed interest in other Recs, as investors look to take advantage of the consolidation in the sector.
The Recs sector has been subject to a number of changes in recent years, as companies seek to rationalise their networks and reduce costs. The sector has also faced increased competition from new entrants, such as independent energy suppliers and renewable energy companies.
The consolidation in the sector has also led to concerns about the impact on prices, as critics argue that a lack of competition could lead to higher prices for consumers. However, the companies involved in the recent mergers and acquisitions insist that the moves are aimed at improving efficiency and reducing costs, rather than increasing profits.
The Recs sector is also subject to regulation by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), which sets the prices that companies can charge for their services. Ofgem has recently proposed a series of reforms aimed at increasing competition in the sector, including a cap on the amount that companies can charge for network upgrades.
The proposed reforms have been criticised by some in the industry, who argue that they will lead to a reduction in investment in the network, and could threaten the security of the UK's energy supply.
Despite these concerns, the Recs sector remains an attractive investment opportunity for many, with its stable revenues and potential for growth. The sector is also subject to a number of regulatory protections, which provide investors with some degree of security.
If CE Electric's bid for Northern Electric is successful, it could spark renewed interest in the sector from investors, particularly those seeking exposure to the UK's electricity market. The move would also increase the concentration in the sector, and could lead to further consolidation in the future.
However, the sector is also facing increasing pressure to invest in renewable energy infrastructure, as the UK seeks to reduce its carbon emissions and meet its climate change commitments. Many Recs are already investing in renewable energy projects, but face significant challenges in terms of financing and regulatory support.
As the UK begins to transition to a low-carbon economy, the Recs sector is likely to play an increasingly important role in the country's energy mix. With the potential for further consolidation and investment in renewable energy infrastructure, the sector remains an attractive proposition for investors, both in the UK and overseas. 
In conclusion, CE Electric's bid for Northern Electric may spark renewed interest in other Regional Electricity Companies (Recs), as investors seek to take advantage of the consolidation in the sector. Despite concerns about the impact on prices and the potential reduction in investment in the network, the Recs sector remains an attractive investment opportunity, particularly for those seeking exposure to the UK's electricity market. As the UK transitions to a low-carbon economy, the Recs sector is likely to play an increasingly important role in the country's energy mix, highlighting the need for continued investment and regulatory support.
