Northern Electric share price rose on Thursday after rumors began circulating that CalEnergy, the energy arm of Berkshire Hathaway, was planning to increase its takeover offer for the British utility firm.
According to sources close to the matter, CalEnergy is said to be preparing to increase its offer to 950 pence per share, up from its original offer of 900 pence per share. This follows reports earlier this week that a rival bidder, Canadian utility company Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp, had submitted an offer worth 925 pence per share.
Northern Electric's shares rose by over 5% on the news, reaching a high of 945 pence per share. The company's board has not yet made any official statement regarding the potential offers.
The rumors come after CalEnergy announced last month that it had entered into discussions with Northern Electric regarding a possible takeover. CalEnergy, which owns several energy companies across the United States and Europe, said that it saw "attractive long-term opportunities" in the British energy market.
Northern Electric, which provides electricity and gas to over 3 million customers across the North East of England, has been the subject of takeover speculation for several months. The company's main shareholder, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), has been seeking to sell its 25% stake in the firm.
The potential takeover by CalEnergy has met with mixed reactions from industry experts. Some have welcomed the move, saying that it could lead to increased investment in Northern Electric's infrastructure and the development of new renewable energy projects.
Others, however, have raised concerns about the impact on jobs and the regional economy. Northern Electric is one of the largest employers in the North East, with over 5,000 staff members. There are fears that a takeover could result in job losses or a reduction in investment in the region.
The possibility of a bidding war between CalEnergy and Algonquin has also raised questions about the future direction of Northern Electric. While CalEnergy has indicated that it is primarily interested in the company's energy supply business, Algonquin has said that it sees Northern Electric as a potential platform for growth in the UK renewable energy market.
Analysts say that the outcome of the takeover battle could have significant implications for the wider energy sector. The UK government has set a target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and the successful bidder for Northern Electric is likely to play a key role in helping to achieve this goal.
The acquisition of Northern Electric would also give CalEnergy a foothold in the UK energy market, which is expected to become increasingly important in the coming years as the country moves towards more renewable energy sources.
For Northern Electric shareholders, the increased takeover activity is welcome news. The company's share price has been stagnant in recent years, and many investors have been calling for a change in ownership in order to unlock the firm's full potential.
The Northern Electric board is expected to consider both offers carefully before making a decision. A spokesperson for the company said that it was committed to acting in the best interests of its shareholders and employees.
"We are aware of the recent takeover offers and are carefully considering our options," the spokesperson said. "We remain focused on delivering the best possible service to our customers and on contributing to the wider energy transition in the UK."
