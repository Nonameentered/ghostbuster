Las Vegas, NV – In a sign of the growing corporate demand for computer systems, sales at the Comdex Trade Show soared this year as business buyers snapped up the latest hardware and software offerings.
Attendance at the annual technology extravaganza was up by nearly 30% this year, and according to organizers, much of that increase can be attributed to the surge in corporate computer purchases. “We’ve definitely seen a lot more suits and ties on the show floor this year,” said Comdex spokesperson Andrea Bartolotta. “The corporate market is definitely driving sales.”
Indeed, vendors reported brisk business throughout the five-day event, which featured more than 1,500 exhibitors touting the latest advances in computing technology. Leading the way were sales of high-end desktop and laptop computers, as well as software packages designed to boost productivity and efficiency in the workplace.
“Corporate buyers are definitely interested in the high-end systems,” said John Smith, a sales rep for Dell Computers. “We’ve had a lot of interest in our new line of workstations and servers, which are designed for businesses that need to process large amounts of data quickly.”
Smith added that Dell’s new laptops were also a hit with corporate buyers. “Laptops are becoming more and more important in today’s business world,” he said. “People want to be able to work on the go, and our new laptops offer them the power and performance they need to do that.”
Other vendors reported strong sales of software packages designed to streamline office operations and boost productivity. Companies such as Microsoft and Adobe showcased the latest versions of their popular productivity suites, while up-and-coming software providers like Smartsheet and Asana drew crowds with their innovative project management tools.
“There’s a lot of interest in software that can help businesses do more with less,” said Joe Rodriguez, a sales rep for project management software provider Asana. “People want to be able to manage their projects more efficiently, and our software can help them do that.”
For many corporate buyers, the Comdex Trade Show was the perfect place to find the latest and greatest in computing technology. Some attendees came with specific purchases in mind, while others used the event as an opportunity to discover new hardware and software vendors that they might not have known about otherwise.
“Comdex is the perfect place for businesses to find new solutions,” said Robert Johnson, a corporate IT director who attended the show. “It’s a great opportunity to see what’s out there, talk to vendors, and get a sense of where technology is headed.”
Overall, the strong showing from corporate buyers at this year’s Comdex Trade Show is yet another sign of the growing importance of technology in the business world. As more and more companies seek to gain a competitive edge through digital innovation, events like Comdex are sure to remain a major draw for corporate buyers well into the future. The days of the humdrum, beige desktop computer may be over, but the appetite for cutting-edge technology in the workplace is only growing stronger.
