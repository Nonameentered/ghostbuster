Chicago-based software company, Novell, has announced plans to license its key technology to expand revenue sources. Along with this move, the company will make significant investments in its core business areas.
Novell’s technology licensing strategy aims to partner with companies in complementary sectors to expand the reach of its offerings. The company's focus in recent years has been on its Identity Access and Security (IAS) and the Endpoint Management business lines. Now, Novell aims to unlock more revenue streams by leveraging these market-leading solutions.
“Our endpoint management and security products are recognized leaders in the market, and we believe there is significant untapped revenue potential in these areas,” said Novell Executive Vice President, Ron Hovsepian. “This strategic move will allow us to expand and take advantage of collaboration opportunities with partners, while continuing to drive innovation and growth in our core areas.”
Novell's endpoint management solutions help organizations automate the administration and enable secure access to devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, along with the software that runs on them. Additionally, Novell's IAS solutions offer powerful security features such as identity management and access control. These products are especially critical for managing remote workers and protecting the confidentiality of sensitive information.
Novell also plans to leverage the expertise of professionals in the company's existing workforce. These experts will aid in the adoption and deployment of Novell's solutions in various industries and sectors. This move is expected to significantly improve the overall productivity and efficiency of its solutions.
The company has also announced additional investments in product development, marketing, and sales outreach to support the rollout of its offerings to new markets. Novell plans to add to its workforce and invest in personnel training and development to keep its workforce up to date on the latest advancements in its technologies.
"We have a strong base of customers and partners in the security and management space, and we want to build on that momentum," said Hovsepian. "These investments will help to enhance our solutions and establish us as a leader in a rapidly growing market."
Since its founding in 1983, Novell has undergone numerous strategic and operational changes, including several mergers and acquisitions. The company's latest move to license its technology to expand and diversify its revenue sources is yet another signal that Novell is committed to leading the technology industry in the years to come.
