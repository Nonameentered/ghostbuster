Las Vegas, NV- The Comdex trade show, the ultimate platform for showcasing the latest technology gadgets and software, is being dominated by corporate computer buyers. The show, which started yesterday and runs through Friday, is alive with energy and excitement as vendors try to win over the hearts of buyers.
Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, more than 600 companies have descended on Las Vegas for the event, hoping to showcase their latest hardware and software products to the throngs in attendance. Although technology enthusiasts would normally account for the majority of visitors, the show is being primarily driven by corporate computer buyers, eager to update their work-from-home setups.
Corporate demand has been driven by the shift to remote operations during the pandemic, and attendees are drawn to vendors offering products designed to meet the challenges of remote work. Video conferencing, cybersecurity precautions, and enhanced data storage are among the most popular themes vendors are leveraging to attract buyers.
One of the attendees, Sarah Smith, a procurement manager for a Fortune 500 company spoke to us about the shift. “It’s hard to know which products are the best fit without first hand experience, and trade shows like Comdex really offer a great opportunity. We’ve got a lot of people working remotely now, and we want to make sure our systems are up to scratch. That’s why we’re here.”
This shift is apparent on the showroom floor. Dell, Lenovo, and HP, three of the largest PC makers in the world, have all been displaying their latest laptops and desktops, with each presenting their systems’ upgraded cooling and input-output options. In addition, software companies like Microsoft and Adobe are offering up their latest updates and applications.
Another factor driving corporate demand at Comdex 2021 is the dust settling on supply chain disruptions as COVID-19 recovery continues. Gone are the days of shortages and product delays. Nearly every major vendor has an ample supply of equipment ready to ship.
In forecasting attendance for this years' show, Trade Show News Network, the leading news source of the trade show industry, estimated that more than 100,000 people would attend. After the first day, it's clear that most of the attendees are computer buyers drawn in by the vendors of laptops, desktops, and software.
The Comdex trade show began in 1979 and has grown into one of the most important gatherings in the tech world. It takes place annually in Las Vegas, however, in recent years it has struggled to measure up to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which traditionally takes place in January in the same city. However, the renewed focus on remote work brought on by COVID-19 is giving Comdex an opportunity to shine.
All things considered, the show is running smoothly and attendees are enjoying all the attractions of Las Vegas once again. As a hub for technology enthusiasts and corporate buyers alike, Comdex is bringing everyone together to experience the latest technology innovations first-hand. Only time will tell if the event will be able to maintain this newfound focus or return to the conventional pace of previous years.
