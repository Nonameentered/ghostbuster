Cupertino, California - Apple Inc., the world’s largest technology company, is expected to suffer a loss of $100-$150 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, according to analysts. This decreased outlook is being seen as a setback for the company’s comeback plan as it tries to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic that led to a plunge in sales in the previous quarter.
The tech giant has been experiencing a slowdown in iPhone sales, which are expected to fall 20% in the coming year, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. This decline, coupled with the chip shortage and supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic, is expected to hit Apple's bottom line hard.
This disappointing news comes after Apple reported its first COVID-19-driven decline in quarterly sales in more than a decade, signaling the challenges that lie ahead for the iPhone maker. Despite the setback, however, analysts still believe in Apple’s long-term potential and see the current situation as a temporary setback.
"Apple is in a unique position," said Ives. "It has a strong global brand and the company has shown time and time again that it knows how to innovate, adapting to changes in technology and consumer preferences."
However, analysts also warn that Apple will need to address the challenges it's currently facing and take the necessary steps to repair the declining iPhone sales. One option they suggest is to expand its product range beyond smartphones and focus on other high-growth segments, such as wearables and smart home devices.
Apple has already made significant inroads in this area with the Apple Watch, which has become one of the most popular smartwatches globally. Meanwhile, the company has also been working on new products that could help drive growth, such as its long-rumored electric car project.
In addition to expanding its product range, Apple has also been working on improving its supply chain. Its suppliers, who are largely based in Asia, have struggled with production and delivery due to the pandemic. The company recently announced a $430 billion investment in its US operations, which includes building new manufacturing infrastructure and providing support to small and medium-sized businesses.
However, Apple's rivals are not standing idly by, with Samsung and Xiaomi among the companies aggressively expanding into new product categories. Meanwhile, Chinese upstarts like Oppo and Vivo are also making strides into the high-end smartphone market.
Despite the intense competition, however, analysts still believe that Apple has a strong brand and is well-positioned to weather these challenges, provided that it can execute its comeback plan effectively.
"Apple's success has been built on its ability to create value for customers and to innovate," said Neil Campling, head of TMT Research at Mirabaud Securities. "If it can continue to do that, then it has the potential to recover from this setback and continue its growth trajectory."
Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic still looms large, and the future remains uncertain. With the Delta variant of the virus causing renewed lockdowns and restrictions, there is a risk that the global economy will take a hit, which could hurt sales across all segments.
However, many analysts remain optimistic that Apple will be able to weather the storm and emerge victorious in the long run.
"Apple is a great company, but it will face challenges," said Ives. "But if it can navigate through them, it will come out stronger on the other side."
