Informix Corp. has filed a lawsuit against Oracle Corp. for allegedly stealing its trade secrets. The lawsuit was filed in the District Court for the Northern District of California on Monday.
According to the lawsuit, Oracle obtained confidential information about Informix's database technology through a former Informix employee, who was hired by Oracle in 2019. The employee allegedly took confidential information with him when he left the company to work for Oracle.
The lawsuit alleges that Oracle used Informix's trade secrets to improve its own database technology and gain an unfair advantage over Informix. The lawsuit seeks damages for trade secret misappropriation, breach of contract and unfair competition.
"Oracle has a long history of stealing our trade secrets and using them to improve their own products," said Informix CEO Jim Bessenbacher. "We are taking legal action to protect our intellectual property and ensure that Oracle is held accountable for their actions."
Oracle has denied the allegations and said it will fight the lawsuit. "We believe Informix's claims are baseless and we will prove it in court," said an Oracle spokesperson.
This is not the first time Oracle has been accused of stealing trade secrets. In 2020, Oracle was ordered to pay $11 million to a former employee who accused the company of stealing his trade secrets. The employee had developed software that allowed users to access and manipulate data in a cloud-based database, which he claimed Oracle stole and incorporated into its own products.
The Informix lawsuit comes at a time when trade secret theft is becoming increasingly common. According to a report by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, trade secret theft costs the US economy between $180 billion and $540 billion each year.
The report also found that China is the world's biggest source of trade secret theft, with Chinese companies and individuals accounting for 80% of reported cases.
The Informix lawsuit is just the latest in a series of legal battles between tech companies over trade secrets. In 2020, Apple and Qualcomm settled a long-running lawsuit over alleged trade secret theft, which had been ongoing since 2017. The settlement included a payment of $4.5 billion from Apple to Qualcomm.
Trade secret theft is a serious issue for businesses of all sizes, as it can result in the loss of valuable intellectual property and give competitors an unfair advantage. It is important for companies to take steps to protect their trade secrets, such as implementing robust non-disclosure agreements, limiting access to sensitive information and monitoring employee activity.
The outcome of the Informix lawsuit will be closely watched by the tech industry, as it could set a precedent for future cases involving trade secret theft. For now, the case highlights the importance of protecting intellectual property and the risks of failing to do so.
