In a move to improve its fast Ethernet switch technology, Bay Networks has acquired NetICs for a staggering $99 million. The deal, which was sealed earlier this week, is expected to give Bay Networks a significant advantage in the networking industry.
NetICs is a well-known semiconductor company that specializes in the development of fast Ethernet switch technology. The company has been a leader in this field for many years and has developed a reputation for producing some of the most advanced and reliable switches on the market.
Bay Networks, on the other hand, is a networking equipment company that has been around for over two decades. The company has always focused on providing top-quality networking solutions to its customers, and the acquisition of NetICs is seen as a strategic move to enhance its product offering.
With this acquisition, Bay Networks will be able to leverage NetICs’ expertise in fast Ethernet switch technology to expand its product range. The company will also be able to integrate NetICs’ technology into its existing networking solutions, which will allow it to deliver faster and more reliable networking performance to its customers.
In a statement, Bay Networks’ CEO, John Michael, expressed his excitement at the acquisition, saying that NetICs’ technology would be a game-changer for the company. “This acquisition is a significant milestone for Bay Networks. With NetICs’ technology, we will be able to offer our customers some of the most advanced networking solutions on the market.

This acquisition will allow us to expand our reach and take our technology to new markets. We are excited about the possibilities that this acquisition presents, and we look forward to working closely with Bay Networks to deliver the best possible networking solutions to our customers.”
The acquisition of NetICs is expected to be completed by the end of the year, and Bay Networks is already working on integrating NetICs’ technology into its product lines. With this acquisition, Bay Networks is poised to become a leader in the networking industry, providing customers with some of the most advanced and reliable networking solutions on the market.
