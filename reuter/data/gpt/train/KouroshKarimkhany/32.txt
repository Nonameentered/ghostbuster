Steve Jobs Rehired at Apple to Revamp Mac Software
In a stunning move, Apple's board of directors has announced that Steve Jobs has been rehired as CEO, with a mandate to revamp the company's Mac software in order to take on Microsoft's dominance in the personal computer market.
Jobs, who co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976, had been pushed out of the company in 1985 after losing a power struggle with then-CEO John Sculley. He returned to the company in 1997, when Apple was on the brink of bankruptcy, and oversaw the development of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which transformed the company into a global force.
However, despite the tremendous success of Apple's mobile devices, its Mac lineup has languished in recent years, with many users frustrated by bugs, slow performance, and the lack of innovation compared to Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Rumors had been swirling for months that Apple was considering a major overhaul of macOS, but the appointment of Jobs to lead the effort came as a surprise to many industry observers.
"We're thrilled to have Steve back at Apple, leading our efforts to reinvent macOS and create the best desktop computing experience in the world," said Apple board member Arthur Levinson in a statement.
Jobs, who had been battling pancreatic cancer and had taken a leave of absence from Apple in 2011 before passing away later that year, had already left a lasting legacy at the company. But his return was seen as a sign that the board recognized the dire state of the Mac business and was willing to make bold moves to turn it around.
"I didn't think it was possible to be more excited about Apple, but the news of Steve's return has me over the moon," tweeted Apple fan and tech blogger John Gruber.
Details about Jobs' plans for macOS are scarce, but sources close to the company say he has been meeting with top engineers and designers to evaluate every aspect of the operating system, from its interface to its performance to its app ecosystem.
According to one source, Jobs is determined to make macOS the "most beautiful and powerful operating system in the world," with a focus on simplicity, speed, and customization.
"He's going to blow people's minds with what he's doing," said the source, who asked not to be named.
Jobs' return has also sparked speculation about the future of Apple's hardware lineup, particularly the long-rumored "iMac Pro" – a high-end desktop computer aimed at professional users.
While Apple has not confirmed the existence of the iMac Pro, rumors have circulated for years that the company has been working on a machine with a 27-inch Retina display, high-powered processors, and advanced graphics capabilities.
Many analysts believe that Jobs' focus on revamping macOS is a signal that the iMac Pro could be released soon, possibly in time for the holiday season.
"This is a really exciting time to be an Apple fan," said Gruber. "I think we're going to see some amazing things in the next few months."
As for Jobs himself, he has not commented publicly on his return to Apple, but sources close to him say he is "fired up" and ready to take on what he sees as his greatest challenge yet – restoring the Mac to its former glory.
"He's always been passionate about the Mac," said one source. "He knows it's the foundation of Apple's success, and he wants to make it great again."
