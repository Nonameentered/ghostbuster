The video game industry has bounced back after facing challenges during the pandemic as evident by the strong December quarter results that were released. With a surge in people seeking entertainment options while stuck at home, many companies not only met but exceeded expectations.
According to the reports released, the gaming industry saw an increase in both revenue and users, bringing in a total of $12.5 billion in revenue alone for the December quarter. A major contributor to this increase was the surge in demand for console sales as people sought out their hobbies or pastimes while staying at home.
One of the leading gaming platforms in this industry, Sony’s Playstation, reported having sold 4.5 million consoles during the December quarter, bringing in an overall profit of over $8.42 billion for the year. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Xbox also reported an increase in sales, thanks to its new services that include the Game Pass subscription, which allows players free access to an extensive game catalog. The company saw a 51 percent increase in gaming revenue, making a total profit of $15 billion for the quarter.
In addition to consoles, mobile gaming also saw high profits during the December quarter. Mobile games such as Roblox and Among Us, which were released in 2020, generated significant revenue. These games were played by millions of users worldwide who sought out new ways to connect with friends and family during quarantine and lockdowns.
The CEO of Electronic Arts (EA), one of the world’s leading game developers and publishers, commented that the shift towards at-home entertainment has caused a significant increase in demand for video games, and the company saw strong growth in its sports franchising games like FIFA, Madden NFL, and NBA Live. EA reported $1.67 billion in revenue for the last quarter, which exceeded expectations and saw an overall yearly revenue of $5.6 billion.
Moreover, the pandemic has caused an increase in demand for online gaming, which has brought new life to esports. Esports tournaments are now taking place worldwide, connecting players and spectators seamlessly on a virtual platform. With a full shift to digital, the esports industry is projected to reach $1.08 billion in revenue in 2021, and market experts predict a growth trajectory of over $1.6 billion by 2024.
In conclusion, the video game industry has proven to be strong despite the pandemic, and the December quarter results were revealing. With the industry set to continue on a growth trajectory, it’s clear that ongoing demand for entertainment and gaming during the pandemic has brought a renewed sense of momentum to the video game industry. Gaming has become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and the industry is poised to thrive in the years to come.
