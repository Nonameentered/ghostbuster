Software company Novell has announced a new revenue expansion strategy. The company will be offering licensing for its key technology to other software companies. This unique strategy will allow Novell to earn additional income while helping other businesses to enhance their own software offerings.
Novell's key technology, which includes its innovative networking and operating system software, has long been the backbone of the company's success. Now, with demand for these technologies growing, Novell has decided to make them available to other developers and businesses.
According to Novell CEO Jack Messman, this strategy will help to grow the companyâ€™s revenue and customer base. Messman also added that this licensing arrangement would mean Novell can directly work with its technology partners while finding new opportunities for revenue.
The move comes as Novell gears up to compete with its larger competitors, particularly Microsoft. With this new licensing arrangement, Novell hopes to offer unique and highly-specialized software solutions at an attractive price point.
Industry experts have noted that software companies tend to focus more on their core products and services, instead of trying to license any key technology they have developed. However, Novell has chosen to take a different approach--which could pay off handsomely.
Novell's unique strategy also means that it can offer its technology expertise to other industries. With other software players using Novell's technology, this may well lead to increased innovation in the areas of networking and operating systems.
The benefits of this licensing strategy have been recognized by Novell's technology partners, who see this move as a true game-changer in the industry. The company's close working relationship with other software businesses means it can easily offer them cutting-edge technology that they can incorporate into their own products.
Moreover, licensing agreements with other companies can help Novell remain agile and responsive to market changes, which is key in the highly competitive software industry. The new licensing strategy also offers Novell an opportunity to expand its customer base while boosting its reputation as a technology innovator.
In conclusion, Novell's new licensing strategy represents an exciting development in the world of software technology. By offering these key technologies to other businesses, Novell is not only helping other companies innovate, but is also securing a fresh source of revenue for itself. If this strategy is successful, Novell could potentially pioneer a new revenue stream for the entire software industry.
