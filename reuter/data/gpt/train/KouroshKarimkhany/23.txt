Tech giant Apple is set to launch a new venture with a restaurant operator, in a bid to open cybercafes in the United States and Europe. The move will see the company expand its retail operations, creating a new customer experience that brings together technology and the hospitality industry.
The cybercafe project, which is yet to be named, will focus on creating a welcoming and immersive space for customers to not only purchase Apple products but experience them hands-on. Similarly, customers can interact with Apple's products in a cafe environment and get support from Apple's team.
Apple's partner in this venture is thought to be one of the largest restaurant operators in the US and Europe, providing the tech company with both the expertise needed to provide a top-quality dining experience and locations that are convenient for consumers.
The move comes as Apple continues to explore ways to diversify its retail operations, following in the footsteps of other tech firms such as Google and Amazon, who have already opened up bricks-and-mortar stores.
While details of the project -including opening dates and locations- are yet to be disclosed, the forthcoming venture is likely to be welcomed by tech enthusiasts and foodies alike, looking for a new type of retail experience.
