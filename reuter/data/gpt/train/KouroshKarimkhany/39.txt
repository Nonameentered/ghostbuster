Macromedia Inc. suffered a major setback as its shares plunged to a two-year low after it reported an unexpected loss in its third-quarter earnings report and a weak sales outlook for the rest of the year.
The software company reported a net loss of $12.4 million, or $0.16 per share, for the quarter, compared to a net income of $11.2 million, or $0.14 per share, in the same period last year. The results fell far short of analysts' expectations of a profit of $0.10 per share.
Macromedia's revenue for the quarter also fell below expectations, coming in at $88 million compared to $96.5 million in the same period a year ago. The company attributed the decline in revenue to a weaker-than-expected demand for its digital media and creative software products.
The company's CEO, Stephen Elop, said in a statement that Macromedia was "disappointed" in the results but remained committed to its long-term growth strategy. He noted that the company was investing in new product development and expanding its sales and marketing efforts.
However, investors were not reassured. Macromedia's share price plummeted by more than 15% in after-hours trading following the earnings report, hitting a two-year low of $22.50.
Analysts were also bearish on the company's short-term prospects. "While we remain optimistic about the long-term potential of Macromedia's digital media offerings, we believe the company is facing near-term headwinds from softness in demand," said a research note from Merrill Lynch.
Macromedia's weak sales outlook for the rest of the year only added to the pessimism. The company forecasted that its revenue for the fourth quarter would be in the range of $97 million to $102 million, well below analysts' estimates of $112 million.
The company's woes come at a time when the software industry as a whole is under pressure from the growth of cloud-based software services and increased competition from open-source software. Macromedia's emphasis on digital media and creative software also puts it in direct competition with Adobe, which acquired Macromedia's rival, Macromedia for $3.4 billion in 2005.
Macromedia's management will need to execute a deft turnaround strategy to reverse the company's fortunes and regain investor confidence. Otherwise, the company may face the prospect of being marginalized in the fast-changing software market.
