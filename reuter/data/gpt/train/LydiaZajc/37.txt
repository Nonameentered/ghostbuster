Toronto, Canada – The CEO of Zellers, Tom Devine, has announced his plans to boost sales and regain market leadership from Wal-Mart. Devine says he is determined to turn around the struggling retailer and win back customers who have been lured away by Wal-Mart's low prices and wide assortment of products.
Zellers, a subsidiary of the Hudson's Bay Company, has been struggling to remain relevant in the Canadian retail market. In the last year, the chain has been losing market share to Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers. Devine, who took over as CEO in January, says he is ready to take bold steps to turn the company around.
"Our goal is clear - to become the top retailer in Canada again," he said. "To do that, we need to increase our sales and get more customers through our doors. We're going to focus on our strengths – products that people want and need – and bring back the excitement that customers used to feel when they came to Zellers."
To achieve this goal, Devine has outlined a three-pronged strategy. First, he plans to revamp the merchandise mix at Zellers stores. He says the company will focus on products that are in demand, such as home goods, electronics, and apparel. Zellers will also be introducing new brands and private label products to give customers more options when they shop.
"Customers want variety and choice," Devine said. "We're going to give them that and more. We're going to be aggressive in bringing in new products that customers want, and we're going to create a shopping experience that they will love."
The second part of Devine's plan is to improve customer service at Zellers stores. He acknowledges that the company has fallen short in this area and says that needs to change.
"We need to treat our customers like gold," he said. "We need to make their shopping experience as positive as possible, from the moment they walk through the door to the time they leave. We're going to invest in training our staff and making sure they understand our customers' needs."
Finally, Devine plans to invest in marketing and advertising to increase Zellers' brand awareness and bring more people into the stores. He says the company will be launching a new ad campaign in the coming months that will highlight the changes that are happening at Zellers.
"We want people to know that Zellers is back and better than ever," he said. "We want them to come see for themselves what we have to offer."
Devine's plans have been met with cautious optimism by industry experts. While many are skeptical that Zellers can regain its former glory, some believe that Devine's experience and focus on the basics will help the company succeed.
"Zellers has a long road ahead of them," said Doug Stephens, founder of Retail Prophet. "But if they can execute on these plans and deliver a great shopping experience to customers, then they definitely have a chance to compete with Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers."
Only time will tell if Devine's plans are successful and if Zellers can regain its place as Canada's top retailer.
