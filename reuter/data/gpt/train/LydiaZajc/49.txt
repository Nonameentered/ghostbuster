Toronto stock market closes lower due to battered oil and gas sector
The Toronto stock market closed lower on Wednesday, as the oil and gas sector took a beating. The S&P/TSX composite index fell by 80.12 points, or 0.41%, to end the day at 19,402.61.
The decline was largely driven by falling energy prices, which dragged down the shares of Canada's leading oil and gas companies. Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks due to concerns about a surge in global supply, as well as fears over the impact of the Delta variant of Covid-19 on demand.
The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the benchmark for North American oil prices, fell by more than 2% to $68.49 per barrel on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil prices, fell by more than 1% to $70.38 per barrel.
As a result, the shares of energy companies like Canadian Natural Resources, Suncor Energy, and Enbridge all closed lower. Canadian Natural Resources fell by more than 2%, while Suncor Energy fell by more than 1%. Enbridge, which operates pipelines that transport oil and gas across North America, fell by nearly 3%.
The decline in the energy sector was partially offset by gains in other areas of the market, including the financial and industrial sectors. However, these gains were not enough to push the market into positive territory.
Investors are closely watching the oil and gas sector, as it has been a major driver of Canada's economy in recent years. Canada is one of the world's largest producers of oil and gas, and the sector has historically been a major contributor to the country's GDP.
However, the industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, including environmental concerns, regulatory hurdles, and changing global demand. These challenges have been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to reduced demand and production cuts.
Despite these challenges, some observers are optimistic about the long-term prospects for the industry. They argue that global demand for oil and gas will continue to grow, and that Canadian companies are well positioned to meet this demand with their abundant natural resources and advanced technology. However, these optimistic projections are likely to be challenged by ongoing concerns over the pandemic, as well as increasing competition from renewable energy sources.
