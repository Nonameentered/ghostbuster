The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) closed mixed on Tuesday, with the key index maintaining its position above the 6000 mark.
The benchmark index, the S&P/TSX Composite Index, ended the day at 6042.18, down by 34.62 points or 0.57% from the previous day’s close. Despite the drop, the index has managed to stay above the 6000 mark for the past 22 consecutive sessions.
The energy sector led the decliners, falling by 3.24% as oil prices dropped due to concerns over rising COVID-19 cases and increased supply from OPEC+ countries. Shares of Suncor Energy, Canadian Natural Resources and Cenovus Energy all slid, with losses ranging from 2.18% to 5.15%.
The financials sector also weighed on the index, declining by 1.24%. Major banks such as Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia all closed lower, with losses ranging from 0.97% to 1.38%.
However, the materials sector helped offset some of the losses, rising by 1.68%. The sector was lifted by gains in gold prices, which rose to a one-week high on a weaker US dollar and expectations of a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. Shares of Barrick Gold and Newmont Corporation were among the gainers, rising by 3.31% and 2.69%, respectively.
The TSX’s mixed performance on Tuesday mirrored that of US stocks, which also closed mixed amid concerns over the surge in COVID-19 cases worldwide and its impact on global economic recovery.
In Canada, the country’s economic recovery has been gradually gaining momentum, with the Bank of Canada projecting a stronger growth outlook this year. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases could pose a threat to the recovery if the government implements further restrictions.
Despite the uncertainties, the TSX has remained resilient, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index posting gains of more than 15% since the beginning of the year.
Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching the developments surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the ongoing earnings season, which is expected to provide more insights into the health of the Canadian economy.
