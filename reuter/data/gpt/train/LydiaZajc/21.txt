Toronto Stocks Soften as Gold Sector Crumbles Under Falling Bullion Prices
The Toronto stock market was hit hard on Tuesday as the gold sector crumbled under the weight of falling bullion prices. The S&P/TSX Composite index closed 0.36% lower to 20,082.87, while the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index fell 3.8%.
Gold prices have been under pressure since hitting a record high of $2,072 per ounce in August 2020. The precious metal has lost nearly 15% of its value this year, making it one of the worst-performing assets in 2021.
Investors have been flocking to riskier assets like stocks as the global economy emerges from the pandemic. This has pushed gold prices lower, as the metal is seen as a safe haven investment during times of economic uncertainty.
However, rising inflation and geopolitical tensions have given some support to gold prices in recent weeks. The US Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates at record lows, which may lend some support to gold in the coming months.
The weakening gold sector was the main drag on the TSX index on Tuesday. Shares of Barrick Gold, the world's second-largest gold producer, fell 3.5%, while Newmont Mining, the world's largest gold producer, dropped 4.5%.
Other gold companies also saw their shares decline, including Kinross Gold, which fell 5.9%, and Agnico Eagle Mines, which dropped 4.9%. The decline in gold stocks affected the market as a whole, as the sector accounts for around 10% of the TSX Composite index.
However, not all sectors were at a loss. The financial sector, which accounts for around 30% of the TSX index, rose by 0.3%. Bank of Montreal saw its shares gain 1.2%, while Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank both closed higher.
The energy sector also saw gains, rising 0.7% as oil prices climbed higher. The price of Brent crude oil rose 0.9% to $73.03 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude oil gained 0.6% to $71.02 per barrel.
In conclusion, while the Toronto stock market was weakened by the crumbling gold sector on Tuesday, gains were still seen in other sectors. Investors will continue to watch gold prices closely in the coming weeks, as inflation and interest rate outlooks may provide support for the precious metal.
