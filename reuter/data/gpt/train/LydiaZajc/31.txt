Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index Closes at Record High on Brisk Turnover Worth $1.55 Billion
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index closed at a record high on Thursday, driven by positive investor sentiment and robust trading activity worth $1.55 billion. The index gained 1.6 percent to close at 20,073.59 points, surpassing its previous all-time high of 19,920.49 points set in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic.
The energy sector was the biggest contributor to the benchmark index's gains, rising by 3.3 percent, followed by the financial sector, which climbed 2.2 percent. The technology, materials, and healthcare sectors also posted gains of more than one percent each.
Analysts attributed the market rally to several positive economic indicators and strong corporate earnings reports. The Bank of Canada's decision to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.25 percent also helped boost investor confidence.
"The market is benefiting from several tailwinds, including a resurgent energy sector as oil prices rise, solid earnings reports from major companies, and indications that the central bank will continue to maintain an accommodative monetary policy," said John Smith, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The brisk trading activity also played a significant role in pushing the index higher. Over 186 million shares changed hands on Thursday, up from the previous day's volume of 152 million shares. The trading value was $1.55 billion, compared to Wednesday's turnover of $1.3 billion.
The Toronto Stock Exchange has been on a bullish trend since March 2020, when the pandemic-induced market crash bottomed out. The index has since recovered all its losses and has gained more than 70 percent since its low of 11,172.74 on March 23, 2020.
"The TSX's remarkable turnaround over the past year underscores the resilience of investors, who have weathered the storm of the pandemic and other economic headwinds," said Smith. "The record high is a positive sign for the Canadian economy and could further boost investor confidence in the months ahead." 
The record high close on Thursday marked a milestone for the Toronto Stock Exchange, reaffirming its position as one of the world's leading exchanges.
