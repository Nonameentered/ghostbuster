Toronto Stocks Fall as Oil and Gas Sector Takes a Hit
The Toronto Stock Exchange's main index fell today, with the oil and gas sector taking the biggest hit. The index dropped by 1.3 percent, to close at 19,148.57 points. The fall was caused by the decline in energy prices, as well as the ongoing concerns around the Delta variant of COVID-19.
The oil and gas sector was the worst performing sector, with the S&P/TSX Energy Index falling by 2.4 percent. This was due in part to the continued decline in oil prices, which have been falling for several weeks. The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil fell by 0.42 percent, to $67.49 per barrel, while the price of Brent crude oil fell by 0.18 percent, to $69.93 per barrel.
Other sectors that saw declines included healthcare, communications, and technology. The S&P/TSX Capped Health Care Index fell by 1.6 percent, while the S&P/TSX Capped Information Technology Index fell by 1.3 percent. Meanwhile, the S&P/TSX Capped Telecommunications Index fell by 1.2 percent.
The decline in the Toronto stock market follows a similar trend in other markets around the world. In the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.8 percent, while the S&P 500 fell by 0.7 percent. In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index fell by 2.0 percent.
Investors remain cautious as they await further developments around the Delta variant of COVID-19 and the ongoing economic recovery. Despite the recent decline, however, experts say that the long-term outlook for the Toronto stock market remains positive.
