On Monday, the Toronto Stock Exchange closed lower as weak gold stocks weighed down markets. The TSX Composite Index fell 74.94 points to close at 16,385.91.
The drop was largely attributed to the mining sector, with gold stocks falling 3.5% and weighing down the broader index. Barrick Gold, the world's second-largest gold miner, fell 3.8%. Kinross Gold, another major player in the sector, dropped 6%.
The decline in gold stocks was due to a number of factors. First, the strengthening of the US dollar has made gold, which is priced in the American currency, more expensive for investors outside of the US. Second, there has been a decline in demand for gold from China, which is the world's largest consumer of the precious metal.
The weak performance of gold stocks also had a knock-on effect on other sectors, with energy and financial stocks also falling. Suncor Energy, one of Canada's largest oil and gas companies, fell 3.4%, while Royal Bank fell 1.5%.
Despite the drop, some sectors managed to perform well. The health-care sector rose 2.3%, buoyed by strong performances from companies such as Bausch Health and Aurora Cannabis.
Overall, market analysts see the decline in gold stocks as a short-term blip, with the long-term prospects for the sector remaining positive. Gold remains a safe-haven asset that investors turn to during times of economic uncertainty, and with the ongoing trade war between the US and China, there are likely to be further periods of volatility in the markets.
Investors will be keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting, which is expected to result in a cut to interest rates. This move is expected to further boost the stock markets, including the TSX.
