Toronto Stocks Close Weaker on Tuesday, Dragged Down by Tarnished Gold Stocks and Profit-Taking
On Tuesday, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) closed weaker as key sectors failed to hold on to their earlier gains due to weak gold stocks and profit-taking. Concerns over rising inflation further dented investor sentiment, and the major TSX Composite Index remained under pressure, closing at 19,272.87 points, down by 0.36%.
Gold equities continued to decline, pulling down the overall performance of the market as the precious metal’s price fell on Tuesday. Barrick Gold Corp and Kinross Gold Corp fell by 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively, while the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index slipped by 2.6%.
Investors also engaged in profit-taking, taking advantage of the market’s recent gains. Several blue-chip companies fell, including Royal Bank of Canada, down 0.5%, and Canadian Natural Resources, which decreased by 1.3%.
The energy sector also performed poorly after the price of crude oil slipped amid concerns over global demand. The S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index was down by 1.3%, with Encana Corporation and Suncor Energy Inc. losing 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively.
The financial sector was another underperforming sector, with Manulife Financial Corp decreasing by 2.3%, and Bank of Montreal dropping by 0.8%.
Among the gainers, though, were cannabis stocks. The cannabis-heavy Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF rose by 3.2% after a report from Statistics Canada showed that the country’s sales of legal cannabis reached a new high in June.
In conclusion, Tuesday’s unease in Toronto’s stock market is a reflection of investors’ ongoing concerns over inflation, global demand, and profitability. Tarnished gold equities and profit-taking were the major drags, with declining energy and financial stocks further contributing to the market’s weaker close. The future outlook remains uncertain, with investors adopting a cautious stance amid ongoing volatility.
