Barbara Amiel, the Right-Wing Canadian journalist, has been catching the attention of the media empire with her controversial views. Amiel is a writer, socialite and the wife of British-born Canadian Lord Black, former media magnate of Hollinger Inc. With a career spanning over several decades, she has been a prominent voice in Canadian politics and media.
Born in London, England in 1940, Amiel moved to Canada in the late 1950s and began her career as a journalist, working for several Canadian newspapers. In the 1970s, she became the editor of the daily Ottawa Citizen and later moved on to work for The Toronto Sun newspaper. It was during this period that her views began to take on a more conservative stance as she wrote columns and articles that pushed right-wing ideology. 
As her career progressed, Amiel became involved in politics, working as an adviser to Brian Mulroney, the former Prime Minister of Canada, during the 1980s and 1990s. She also worked as an adviser to the Conservative Party of Canada and served as a board member of the Fraser Institute, a conservative Canadian think tank.
Amiel's views are often considered controversial, and her critics have accused her of being insensitive and out of touch with the general public. Her opinions often revolve around topics such as free speech, human rights, and individualism, all of which have earned her both praise and criticism.
In her essay, "Freedom of Speech and Its Limits," published in Canada's National Post in 2014, Amiel argued passionately against censorship and defended the right to free speech. She wrote: "If we believe in free speech, it means we must also accept the right of others to say things with which we vehemently disagree. Free speech is not free unless it includes the right to offend."
But her views on individualism and human rights have also attracted criticism. In a column for the Sunday Times of London in 2007, Amiel dismissed the concept of 'slave reparations' for Black people, saying: "No slave in history has been paid reparations, and none ever will be. The idea is preposterous and no thinking person would entertain it."
Despite the controversy surrounding her views, Amiel continues to be a powerful force in Canadian media. In 1999, she became a columnist for The Daily Telegraph in the UK, and also published columns in The Spectator, the National Post and the Toronto Sun. Her writing has been praised for its clarity and originality, and her willingness to challenge accepted opinions has gained her many admirers.
However, it is her connection to her husband, Lord Black, that has brought her the most attention. Lord Black was the CEO of Hollinger Inc., one of the largest newspaper companies in the world, and was later convicted of fraud and obstruction of justice in 2007. Amiel publicly defended her husband and accused prosecutors of pursuing a vendetta against him. She wrote extensively about the case and was a consistent presence at her husband's side during his trial.
Despite the criticism, Amiel continues to be a vocal advocate for her views and maintains her place as a prominent figure in Canadian media. Her willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and embrace controversial topics has earned her a loyal following, but her opinions remain divisive. Regardless, her presence in the media world is sure to continue to make waves for years to come.
