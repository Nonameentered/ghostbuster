Toronto stocks remained stable on Thursday, helped by gains in the gold sector. The benchmark Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended the day virtually unchanged at 17,382. The exchange recorded gains in six out of its 11 major sectors. The gold sector surged by 1.8%, while the healthcare sector went up by 1.3%. 
The world's most popular precious metal, gold, saw a price rise to $1,911.41 per ounce, which was the highest it had been in two weeks. Also, the bullish trend of gold investors helped bring stability to the stock market. A decrease in gold's price volatility spurred trading phenomenon, which helped keep the stock prices in check.
The Toronto exchange's VVX volatility index, which measures the expectation of market turbulence, fell by 0.9% to 12.96. It was believed the decrease reflected investors' lack of concern about the economy's growth outlook.  
Furthermore, the energy sector fell by 0.3% due to weak crude oil prices, and the information technology sector decreased by 0.7%. Meanwhile, the financial sector and materials sector also dropped marginally.
Overall, Toronto stocks held their own at the end of the session as the market remained relatively calm. The TSX has gained over 6.8% year-to-date, and economic data has suggested that the Canadian economy is rebounding from the pandemic's effects. Thursday's flat trading session reflected investors' lack of concern as the market remains stable for the foreseeable future.
