Toronto, Canada - As 2021 approaches, analysts are predicting that the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) will outperform Wall Street in the New Year. Despite the economic challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, TSX has remained resilient and is poised for a strong rebound in 2021.
According to Bloomberg, TSX is expected to increase by 9.2% in 2021, while the S&P 500 is projected to rise by 5.8%. The main reason for this expected outperformance is due to the stronger position of the Canadian economy compared to the U.S economy, as well as the diversified nature of the TSX.
The Canadian economy has shown better signs of recovery than the U.S. economy, with a smaller contraction in GDP in Q2 2020 and a quicker rebound. This has been attributed to the Canadian government's aggressive fiscal policies to combat the pandemic's economic fallout. The Canadian government has spent over $300 billion on stimulus measures, including emergency wage subsidies, rent relief, and increased healthcare spending.
Additionally, the TSX is more diversified than Wall Street, with a greater proportion of companies in natural resources, energy, and tech industries. These sectors have shown resilience throughout the pandemic as they provide essential services and products.
Moreover, the TSX has exposure to the booming tech industry in the U.S, with several tech companies listed on the exchange. As the pandemic has accelerated the shift towards technology-driven businesses, this gives the TSX an advantage.
Canada's strong financial services sector also adds to the resilience of the TSX. The financial services sector makes up approximately one-third of the TSX, with Canada's banking industry being recognized globally for its stability and prudent risk management.
In conclusion, 2021 is looking favorable for the TSX as it has shown resilience throughout the pandemic and is set to benefit from the Canadian government's stimulus measures. The diversified nature of the TSX, along with its exposure to the tech industry and Canada's strong financial services sector, puts it in a strong position to outperform Wall Street in the New Year.
