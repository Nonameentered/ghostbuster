Toronto Stock Market Softens for Third Straight Day on Wall Street Losses
Toronto, Canada - The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) plummeted for the third consecutive day, joining Wall Street's downward spiral. Experts attribute the slide to a lingering ripple effect from the U.S. Federal Reserve's announcement that they would raise interest rates next year. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and its impact on the global economy has caused investor concerns.
The TSX dropped 262.37 points, or 1.3%, to finish trading at 19,501.23. Canada's energy sector bore the brunt of the losses, shedding 3.5% on the day. Renewed fears of oil production cuts and oversupply contributed to the decline.
The technology sector also faced sharp declines, with shares of Shopify Inc. falling by 2.8%. However, healthcare and consumer staple stocks provided some relief by recording modest gains. Loblaw Companies Ltd. was one of the few bright spots, closing up by 0.6%.
"The TSX is not expected to recover significantly until there is greater clarity on the timing and effectiveness of a COVID vaccine," says portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, Patrick Blais. "Pandemic-related news and government fiscal policies will continue to play key roles in shaping investor sentiment."
Analysts anticipate additional volatility in the coming days. Any movements of the U.S. dollar, as well as any changes in the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, will likely impact the TSX's performance. Meanwhile, investors are advised to stay informed and engaged as the TSX remains highly reactive to the events unfolding on Wall Street.
