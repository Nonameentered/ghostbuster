Toronto Stock Exchange Sets Fourth Record Close for 1997
Toronto, Canada - The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) ended its year on a high note yesterday as it set its fourth record close for 1997. The TSX Composite Index rose by 35.03 points or 0.51% to 6,909.36. This is the highest that the TSX has closed since the  Composite Index was established in 1977, and it marked a 41% increase since the TSX began the year.
The growth of the TSX Composite Index is a reflection of the Canadian economy's strong performance in 1997. This was thanks in part to the country's export growth and sound macroeconomic policies. A healthy US economy also contributed to Canada's success. As a result of this growth, the TSX has become an attractive investment destination, drawing investment from around the world.
The TSX's success was driven by several sectors. The financial sector, which makes up roughly one-third of the TSX, saw growth of 2.4%. The materials sector also performed well, with an increase of 1.9%. The energy sector was up 0.8%, while the industrial sector saw a decline of 0.4%.
Several companies also did well in 1997. De Beers Canada Inc. had the largest percentage gain on the TSX, rising by over 300%. Other high performers were Northern Telecom, Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Canada, and BCE Inc.
The TSX's performance in 1997 suggests that the Canadian economy is poised for continued growth. This is good news for investors and businesses alike. With international investment pouring into the country, Canadian businesses have access to more capital to fuel their growth. For investors, the TSX offers a range of opportunities across an array of sectors.
While the TSX's performance in 1997 is an impressive achievement, it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results. Nevertheless, Canadian businesses have many reasons to be optimistic as they look towards the future. The strong Canadian economy and the TSX's performance in 1997 offer a good foundation for continued growth and investment.
