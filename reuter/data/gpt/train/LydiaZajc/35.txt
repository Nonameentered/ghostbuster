Toronto, ON - Zellers CEO, James McNaughton has announced plans to boost sales by a third over the next two years in an attempt to regain market leadership from industry giant, Walmart. The retail chain, which struggled through years of declining sales under the previous leadership, has finally seen a change in fortunes after McNaughton assumed the top position in January 2021.
"Our main aim is to win back customers who have defected to our competitors," said McNaughton. "We know that we have an amazing brand, in-demand products and excellent customer service, and we're going to use these strengths to surpass our sales targets."
The company, which has been in business for almost a century, was once the top retail chain in Canada, with over 350 locations. However, declining sales and poor leadership decisions resulted in the closure of all but six stores, with only two operating under the main Zellers brand. Despite these setbacks, McNaughton remains optimistic and believes that this latest sales target is attainable with the right strategy.
"We've identified areas where we can improve, such as expanding our product lines, improving the in-store experience, and upgrading our online purchasing system," McNaughton said. "These improvements will help us to better compete with the likes of Walmart."
One key area where Zellers intends to stand out from the competition is through their e-commerce platform. The company plans to strengthen their online presence by launching a new website and mobile app, which will be user-friendly and accessible to all shoppers. The CEO also affirmed that they will continue to invest in technology and their supply chain to boost efficiency and reduce costs.
"We're putting the necessary resources into our e-commerce platform to be a significant player in online retail, and we're going to make the shopping experience as easy and accessible as possible for our customers," McNaughton said.
Industry experts, however, have expressed skepticism about whether Zellers can succeed in a market dominated by Walmart, Amazon, and other major retailers. Walmart alone has over 400 locations in Canada, making it the country's largest employer. Despite these odds, McNaughton believes that Zellers can regain its leadership position by focusing on creating a unique and engaging shopping experience for their customers.
"Our strategy is centered around differentiated offerings and customer engagement," he said. "We want to create a unique in-store and online shopping experience by incorporating new products, services, and technologies into our customer journey."
Only time will tell whether Zellers can achieve their ambitious sales goals, but McNaughton is confident that the company can reclaim its former glory. "We're excited about the future of Zellers," he said. "And with our customer-centric approach, we're confident that we can again become the retail leader in Canada."
