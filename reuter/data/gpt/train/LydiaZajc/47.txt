Toronto stocks were on a high on Wednesday, 23rd June 2021 due to an incredible boost provided by bond party and the strong performances of the banking and gold sectors. This positive performance has left investors feeling hopeful about the Canadian economy and its prospects for growth as the country emerges from the pandemic.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX Composite Index marked an increase of 122.77 points, 0.6% higher, closing at 20,215.12. The Index's first impressive performance was driven by Canadian bond yields that have been rallying steadily in recent weeks, with the 10-year Government of Canada bond yields climbing back to nearly 1.5%.
Analysts believe the robust banking sector contributed to the market's solid performance. Royal Bank shares rose by 1.2%, reportedly due to higher interest rate expectations. Bank of Nova Scotia shares were also up 1.8%, while those of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce closed up 1.9%. The banks' success is evidence of the steady rebound from the dire economic situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The rising gold sector also provided a significant boost to the Toronto Stock Exchange. Gold prices have been on the rise due to a weaker U.S dollar. The energy sector was also up by 0.2% due to higher crude oil prices, which rose by 0.8% to $73.55 per barrel.
The recent surge in Toronto's stocks has wiped away any worries investors had about the country's economy after a rather slow start to the year and renewed pandemic concerns earlier this year. Canadian investors are hopeful that the continued progress of mass vaccination programs and the gradual return to normalcy in the economy will lead to long-term economic stability.
Overall, the rise in the Toronto stock market has been a welcome development for traders and investors alike. Optimism is rife, and the country looks forward to a much-needed period of growth and prosperity in the coming years.
