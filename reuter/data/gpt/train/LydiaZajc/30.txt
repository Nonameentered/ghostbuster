The Toronto Stock Exchange was boosted by the rise in oil and gold prices on Thursday, but failed to reach its all-time high. The S&P/TSX Composite Index ended the day at 16,952.20, up by 0.48 percent, or 80.48 points from Wednesday's close. The market saw strong performances from energy and gold miners companies, as oil prices edged higher and gold continued its upward trend.
Crude oil prices remained stable at around $63.71 per barrel, a result of OPEC + agreement to cut supply, while gold prices increased by 0.1 percent to $1,877.77 per ounce.
The energy sector had the biggest boost, with a 1.22 percent increase, led by Canadian Natural Resources and Enbridge, both of which had gains of over 1 percent. The gold sector also saw gains, with a 1.29 percent rise, as the worldâ€™s largest gold company Barrick Gold Corporation gained 3.18 percent.
The Canadian dollar also benefited from the market's performance, reaching its highest level in three years, trading at 0.788 US dollars. The weaker US dollar and rising commodity prices have helped to strengthen the Canadian dollar, which reached a three-year high.
Despite the positive movement, the Toronto Stock Exchange failed to break its all-time high, which stands at 17,970.51 points since February 2020. However, analysts remain optimistic about the market's future performance, as the economy continues to reopen and the pandemic recovery process gains momentum.
