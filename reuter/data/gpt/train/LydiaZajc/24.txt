Toronto stock market weakens in brisk trading as Canadian bonds and bank stocks suffer a sell-off
The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) weakened on Tuesday in brisk trading, driven by a sell-off in Canadian bonds and bank stocks.
The TSX fell by 0.74% to 16,041.98 in heavy trading, with nearly 480 million shares changing hands as of mid-afternoon. The drop occurred despite gains in technology, industrials and materials sectors.
Canadian bonds experienced a sharp sell-off with the price of a 10-year government bond falling by 23 cents, pushing the yield up to 1.71%, the highest since last August. Investors may have been concerned about the potential for inflation as the Canadian economy continues to recover from the pandemic.
The sell-off of bank stocks occurred after the Bank of Canada (BoC) announced that it would scale back its bond purchases as the economy improved. The move led to a rise in bond yields, which poses a challenge to banks that rely on borrowing at lower rates than those they lend at.
Shares of Canada's largest banks fell between 1% and 2%, led by Bank of Montreal, which dropped by 2.4%.
In contrast, shares of tech companies such as Shopify and Lightspeed POS rose by 2.9% and 7.5%, respectively, as investors continued to bet on the growth potential of the sector.
Similarly, Canadian materials companies, including Barrick Gold and Teck Resources, also saw gains as global commodity prices remained strong.
The decline in the TSX comes amid a broader sell-off in global markets, with Chinese tech stocks falling sharply and European markets also down.
Investors may be concerned about the potential for higher inflation and interest rates as economies recover from the pandemic, leading to a shift away from growth-oriented stocks towards more value-oriented ones.
Despite the current volatility, analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the Canadian economy and the stock market.
"Canada's banks are well-positioned to navigate the challenging environment of rising rates, and we remain comfortable with our exposure to the sector," said Craig Basinger, chief investment officer of Northland Wealth Management.
In the near term, however, the TSX may continue to face headwinds from rising bond yields and a sell-off in bank stocks.
