Toronto Stock Exchange Reaches Record High for Third Consecutive Session, Boosted by Stronger Gold Stocks
The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) reached a record high for the third consecutive session on Tuesday, thanks to the strong performance of gold stocks. The gold sector was up 2.9%, helped by rising prices of the precious metal.
The TSX rose by 64.13 points, or 0.3%, to close at 20,628.74. This was despite weakness in other sectors such as energy and financials. The Canadian dollar also hit a new six-year high, closing at 81.14 cents US.
The performance of gold stocks was driven by a weaker US dollar and geopolitical tensions, which boosted demand for the metal. Gold prices rose to about $1,770 an ounce, their highest level in nearly three months.
Among the top performers in the gold sector were Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold, and Newmont Corp. Barrick Gold rose by 3.6% to $28.17, Kinross Gold gained 3.5% to $8.81, and Newmont Corp added 2.9% to $75.94.
The broader TSX composite index was supported by gains in technology and healthcare stocks. Shopify Inc. rose by 6.7% to $1,773.08, while Bausch Health Companies gained 4.3% to $40.09.
However, energy stocks were hit by declining oil prices, with the sector down 0.9%. Canadian Natural Resources fell by 2.1% to $43.12, while Suncor Energy dropped 1.8% to $27.09.
The financial sector was also down, with the sub-index falling 0.5%. Some of the major banks, such as Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal, were in negative territory.
Despite the weakness in other sectors, the strong performance of gold stocks helped the TSX reach new heights. The index has gained nearly 20% this year, making it one of the best-performing stock markets in the world.
