The US stock market experienced a mixed outcome in thin trading on Tuesday, with investors turning to fixed income investments amid concerns about inflation and rising interest rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day down 0.2% at 35,258, while the S&P 500 gained 0.2% to close at 4,436. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1% to finish at 14,837.
"There's a lot of uncertainty out there right now, whether it's the Delta variant, inflation, or the Fed tapering bond purchases," said Bill Rodgers, chief investment officer at a New York-based wealth management firm.
As such, many money managers are shifting some of their investment allocations to fixed income products, which are considered safer and less volatile.
"Fixed income investments, such as Treasury bonds and municipal bonds, typically offer a more stable source of income, as their returns are fixed and not affected by market volatility," explained Rodgers.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 1.267% from 1.284% on Monday.
Inflation concerns persist as the US economy continues to recover from the pandemic. The consumer price index rose 5.4% in June from a year earlier, the biggest increase in almost 13 years.
However, Federal Reserve officials have maintained that the recent surge in inflation is transitory and that the central bank will keep interest rates near zero until at least 2023.
Some investors are skeptical of the Fed's stance. "It's hard to believe that inflation won't be a problem in the long-term," said Joe Smith, a portfolio manager at a Boston-based investment firm. "That's why we're looking at fixed income investments for some stability in our portfolios."
Overall, Tuesday's mixed market results highlight the ongoing uncertainty and caution among investors as the US economy navigates its recovery from the pandemic.
