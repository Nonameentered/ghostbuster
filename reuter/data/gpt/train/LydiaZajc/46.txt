Toronto's stock market fell today as Wall Street's technology stocks were hit by profit-taking from investors. The Toronto Stock Exchange closed down 0.8% with its tech-heavy index falling over 1%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.1%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft were all down by over 1%.
Investors sold off their shares in technology companies amid concerns that the industry may have been overvalued. The stocks have surged during the pandemic as lockdowns forced people to rely on technology for work and entertainment.
However, with the global economy starting to recover as vaccination rates increase, investors fear that the technology sector may not continue to see the same growth and that it may be time to take profits.
Toronto's stock market was also affected by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. Despite Canada's successful vaccination campaign, concern over new variants of the virus and global travel restrictions continue to weigh on the market.
The energy and financial sectors also weighed on the market, with oil prices falling by over 2% and bank stocks falling by close to 1%.
Analysts say that the market's downturn is a reminder that while technology stocks have been leading the recovery, they are not immune to market volatility.
Investors will be watching closely to see if this is a temporary market correction or the start of a longer-term trend. However, with the global economy continuing to recover, there is still optimism that the market will bounce back in the coming weeks and months.
