On Thursday, the Toronto Stock Exchange saw a dip in its numbers, but it didn't follow Wall Street's path of a major sell-off. Experts suggest that it's due to the strong presence of the financial and transport sectors.
As per the statistics, the TSX Composite Index fell by 0.36% to 20,301.32. However, the S&P/TSX Composite Financials Index has remained almost steady. It only faced a decrease of 0.03%. On the other hand, the S&P/TSX Capped Industrials Index jumped by 0.09%, and the S&P/TSX Capped Information Technology Index rose to 1.34%, opposing the downward trend.
Experts believe that the strong earnings report issued by major Canadian banks have played a significant role in maintaining the presence of the financial sector. For instance, the Royal Bank of Canada has reported earnings of $4.3 billion for the second quarter, which is substantially higher than experts have predicted.
Moreover, as the COVID-19 vaccination drive is gaining pace in Canada, the transport sector is performing exceptionally well. The S&P/TSX Capped Industrials Index has prominently benefited from this surge in the transport sector as the index includes companies like Canadian National Railway and Bombardier Inc. Experts believe that as Canada is gradually resuming its normal activities, the companies in the transport sector are bound to make profits.
At the same time, Wall Street experienced a significant sell-off on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.11%, the S&P 500 dropped by 1.31%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped by 2.11%. Experts suggest that the increasing rate of inflation in the United States caused investors to become wary of the stock market. Still, the situation isn't relevant in Canada.
In conclusion, the Canadian stock market experienced a slight dip on Thursday, but it was a relief that it didn't follow the trend of Wall Street's major sell-off. This resilience is due to the strong presence of the financial and transport sectors, which are expected to perform well in the upcoming months.
