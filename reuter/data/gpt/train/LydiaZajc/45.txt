Toronto stock market hits sixth record close fueled by Big Six bank rally
The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) closed at an all-time high for the sixth time in a row on Tuesday, propelled by a surge in the shares of the Big Six banks, which continued to capture investors' attention.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index ended the day up 41.1 points, or 0.2%, at a record high of 20,270.61. This achievement marked the first time in the index's history that it has achieved six straight record closing highs.
The sustained rally in the stock market was driven by the strong performance of Canada's six major banks, which together account for nearly 20% of the benchmark index. The banks' shares rose on Tuesday, with Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank of Canada both climbing by nearly 1%.
Analysts say that the banks' financial strength and earnings growth prospects are attracting investors, as they evaluate stocks that can deliver solid returns in the current uncertain economic environment. The banks' solid earnings results, which were released over the past few weeks, also boosted investors' confidence in their ability to withstand any economic headwinds.
"The banks generally have been reporting strong results, and that's been supportive for the overall tone of the Canadian equity market," said Anish Chopra, managing director and portfolio manager at TD Asset Management.
The TSX also got a boost from strength across several other sectors, including technology and communication services. Shopify Inc. rose by 1.3%, while BlackBerry Ltd. and digital payment firm Nuvei Corp. also posted gains.
The recent surge in the TSX underscores the optimism among Canadian investors as the nation emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy shows signs of recovery. However, some analysts warn that the market may be due for a pullback, given the recent run-up in stock prices.
"We're getting closer to a potential point where valuations are becoming stretched," Chopra added. "I think investors should buckle up for a bumpy ride, because we could see a pullback in the near term."
