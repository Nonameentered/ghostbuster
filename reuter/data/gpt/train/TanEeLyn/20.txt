A pro-democracy politician was forcefully dragged away by police during a protest in Hong Kong against China's leader selection methods. The event took place on Sunday, July 11th, at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where the Civil Human Rights Front, a pro-democracy group, had organized a demonstration. The protest was held to voice the opposition to China's decision to change electoral rules and tighten its grip on Hong Kong.
The politician, Liu Kwok-Hing, a member of the Democratic Party, was a prominent figure in the protest. He was among a group of people who tried to block a convoy carrying Chinese officials attending a political meeting at the convention center. As they tried to approach the convoy, the police intervened and forcefully dragged them away.
Liu was seen resisting arrest, screaming, "I am a legislator! Let me go! I did nothing wrong!" as he was being dragged. Video footage of the incident shows police officers forcibly carrying him away while other protesters shouting, "Release Liu Kwok-Hing!" The footage has been widely shared on social media, where many have expressed outrage over the aggressive handling of the situation by the Hong Kong authorities.
The protest was held as China marked the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party. It was organized after the Chinese government initiated an overhaul of Hong Kong's electoral system, which is viewed as an effort to strengthen the pro-Beijing camp in the semi-autonomous region.
Under the new rules, Hong Kong's chief executive will have to be approved by Beijing before being elected, and the number of directly elected seats in the legislature will be reduced, handing more power to pro-Beijing figures. Critics say the move will tilt the electoral playing field in favor of the authorities and close off democratic avenues for Hong Kong's people.
The Hong Kong government has defended the electoral changes, saying they will enhance the city's stability and ensure the principle of a "patriotic governing" system. However, pro-democracy supporters and activists see the changes as a direct assault on Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic freedoms.
"The electoral changes proposed by Beijing are a blatant attack on the democratic rights of Hong Kong's people," Liu Kwok-Hing said in a statement before his arrest. "As a legislator, I have a duty to speak out against this violation of the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration," he added, referring to the agreements that guaranteed Hong Kong's autonomy when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Sunday's protest was one of several that have taken place in Hong Kong in recent years, with pro-democracy supporters and activists calling for greater autonomy and democratic reforms in the semi-autonomous city. However, many of these demonstrations have been met with a heavy-handed response from the authorities, with police using tear gas, water cannons, and batons to disperse crowds.
The incident involving Liu Kwok-Hing is the latest example of the growing tension between Beijing and Hong Kong, where many people fear that their freedoms and autonomy are under threat. The situation has generated international concern, with many countries and human rights organizations condemning China's actions in Hong Kong and calling for greater protection of the region's autonomy and human rights.
