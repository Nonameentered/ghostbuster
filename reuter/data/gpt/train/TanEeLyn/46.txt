Hong Kong's future leader, Carrie Lam, has met with her political opponent, Joshua Wong, in a bid for conciliation ahead of Chinese rule in the city.
The meeting, which took place on Tuesday, comes amid growing tension in Hong Kong as it prepares for the handover of power back to China on July 1. Many Hong Kong residents are concerned that the Chinese government will erode the city's freedoms and autonomy, including the right to free speech and assembly.
In the meeting, Lam and Wong discussed ways to promote dialogue between the government and the young pro-democracy activists who have been pushing for greater democratic reforms in Hong Kong. Lam, who will become Hong Kong's first female chief executive, also pledged to listen to the voices of all Hong Kong residents, regardless of their political views.
"I hope that this meeting will be a small step towards promoting more constructive dialogue between the government and the young people of Hong Kong," Lam said after the meeting.
The meeting was seen as a positive sign for the future of Hong Kong, which has been rocked by protests and civil unrest in recent years. Many activists, including Wong, have called for greater autonomy for Hong Kong, and some have even called for independence from China.
However, Lam has made it clear that she supports the "one country, two systems" policy that has governed Hong Kong since it was handed back to China by Britain in 1997. Under this policy, Hong Kong has a separate legal system, an independent judiciary, and its own government, but it is still ultimately beholden to the Chinese government.
Despite the differences between Lam and Wong, the meeting was seen as a positive step towards reconciliation ahead of the handover of power. Many observers hope that Lam's conciliatory approach will help to ease tensions in the city and promote greater dialogue between the government and the pro-democracy activists who are pushing for change.
"There is a lot of work to be done in Hong Kong, but I am optimistic that we can find a way forward that respects the rights of all of our residents," Lam said after the meeting.
The meeting between Lam and Wong was only the latest in a series of efforts by the new chief executive to reach out to her political opponents and build bridges across Hong Kong's political divide. And while there are sure to be many challenges ahead, the meeting was seen as an important step towards a more peaceful and prosperous future for Hong Kong.
