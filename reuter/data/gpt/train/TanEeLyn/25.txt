After meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing, Tung Chee-hwa has returned to Hong Kong to begin shaping the new administration ahead of the handover of the city's governance from Britain to China on July 1.
Tung, who has been appointed as the first chief executive of Hong Kong under Chinese rule, has pledged to maintain a high degree of autonomy for the city. He said that he has received assurances from China's leaders that Hong Kong will operate under a "one country, two systems" policy, which will allow the city to maintain its own economic and legal systems.
"I am confident that Hong Kong's autonomy will be respected and upheld," Tung said. "Our freedoms, our rights, and our way of life will be protected."
Tung's return was also marked by protests from pro-democracy activists who are concerned that China's leaders will curtail Hong Kong's freedoms after the handover. Tung has promised to listen to these concerns and ensure that Hong Kong remains a vibrant and open society.
"I understand that there are concerns about our future," Tung said. "But I want to assure everyone that we will work together to build a strong and prosperous Hong Kong. A Hong Kong that is open and welcoming to all."
Tung has already begun assembling his administration, which will take over from the British-appointed colonial government when the handover takes place. He has promised to appoint a diverse and representative group of leaders who will be committed to serving the people of Hong Kong.
"I want to build a team that is dedicated to the public good," Tung said. "We will work hard to ensure that Hong Kong remains a place where people can thrive and grow."
Tung's return has also been welcomed by business leaders, who are looking forward to working with the new administration to help Hong Kong maintain its position as a global financial center.
"We are confident that Tung Chee-hwa's leadership will bring stability and prosperity to Hong Kong," said Henry Tang, a prominent businessman. "We look forward to working with him to build a strong and sustainable economy."
Despite the challenges that Hong Kong faces, Tung remains optimistic about the city's future. He believes that by working together, Hong Kong can overcome any obstacles and continue to thrive under Chinese rule.
"I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead," Tung said. "We will face challenges, but I am confident that we can overcome them. Together, we can build a bright and prosperous future for Hong Kong."
