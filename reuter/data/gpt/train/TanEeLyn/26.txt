China has staged a controversial vote to set up a Hong Kong parliament and oust elected lawmakers amid growing protests against Beijing's tightening grip over the city. The vote, which took place on July 22, was held under heavy security, with police blockading several streets to prevent protesters from disrupting the proceedings.
The move has been criticized by opposition lawmakers, who have accused China of undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and violating the principle of "one country, two systems." Under the principle, which was enshrined in the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the city is supposed to enjoy a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and freedom of speech.
However, in recent years, China has been accused of eroding those freedoms by cracking down on pro-democracy activists and tightening its grip over Hong Kong's political and legal systems. The latest move to set up a parliament in Hong Kong has been seen as part of China's efforts to further tighten its control over the city.
The new parliament will consist of 90 members, with 45 appointed by Beijing and the rest elected by a committee made up of pro-Beijing representatives. The move will replace Hong Kong's current legislature, which is made up of directly elected lawmakers who have often been critical of Beijing.
Opposition lawmakers have slammed the move as undemocratic, arguing that it will give Beijing even greater control over Hong Kong's political landscape. "This is a blatant attempt to undermine Hong Kong's democracy and autonomy," said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker.
Some pro-Beijing lawmakers, however, have defended the move, saying that it will help to promote stability and ensure that Hong Kong remains a part of China. "This new parliament will help to ensure that Hong Kong remains a part of China and that it is governed in accordance with Chinese law," said Tam Yiu-chung, the leader of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong.
The move to set up a parliament in Hong Kong is just the latest in a series of controversial measures taken by China to tighten its control over the city. Last year, China passed a new national security law for Hong Kong, which critics say is aimed at silencing pro-democracy activists and has led to a crackdown on free speech and political dissent.
The new law has also led to a wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists and other critics of the Beijing government. In recent weeks, several pro-democracy activists have been charged with violating the new law, including media tycoon Jimmy Lai and academic Benny Tai.
The move also comes amid growing protests in Hong Kong against China's tightening grip over the city. Earlier this month, thousands of people took to the streets to mark the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from Britain to China, with many waving pro-democracy flags and chanting slogans in support of greater autonomy.
The protests have been met with a heavy-handed response from the police, with many activists being arrested and charged with various offenses, including rioting and unlawful assembly. Some pro-democracy lawmakers have also been disqualified from running for office or removed from the legislature.
The move to set up a parliament in Hong Kong has been condemned by several Western governments, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. In a joint statement, the three countries expressed their deep concern about the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and called on China to abide by its international obligations under the Basic Law of Hong Kong.
"The actions taken by China to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy are deeply concerning and a clear violation of the Basic Law," the statement read. "We urge China to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and the freedoms of its people, and to uphold its international obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration."
The move to set up a parliament in Hong Kong is likely to further escalate tensions between China and the West, which have been strained by a range of issues, including trade, human rights, and the coronavirus pandemic. It remains to be seen how the international community will respond to China's latest move, but one thing is clear: the struggle for democracy in Hong Kong is far from over.
