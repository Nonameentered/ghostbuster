Painter Liu Yu Yi Benefits from Hong Kong’s Handover to China with Portraits of Beijing’s Leaders
Hong Kong’s handover to China in 1997 marked a significant turning point for the city and its people. With the transfer of sovereignty, many have argued that Hong Kong has lost its autonomy and democracy, as China tightens its grip on the region. However, for one painter, Liu Yu Yi, the handover has provided an unexpected boost to her career, as she has gained popularity for her portraits of China’s leaders.
Born in Hong Kong in 1963, Liu had always been interested in painting from a young age. She received formal training in fine arts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and later pursued a master’s degree in Fine Arts at the University of London. Initially, Liu’s artwork focused on abstract expressionism, as she experimented with different colors, textures, and techniques to convey emotions and ideas.
However, it was not until the handover that Liu found a new source of inspiration – China’s leaders. With the return of Hong Kong to China, there was a renewed interest in Chinese culture, history, and politics. People started to collect souvenirs, flags, and memorabilia related to China, as a way to express their identity and connection to the mainland. This trend caught Liu’s attention, and she decided to create portraits of China’s leaders, such as Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping.
“At first, I was a bit hesitant to paint portraits, as it’s a very different style from my previous work,” Liu said in an interview with the South China Morning Post. “But I was intrigued by the challenge of capturing the likeness and essence of these leaders, who have such important roles in China’s history and future.”
Liu’s portraits are not your typical political propaganda pieces. Instead, she aims to humanize the leaders and show them in a more personal light. She uses bright colors, bold strokes, and playful details to convey their personalities and quirks. For example, in her portrait of Deng Xiaoping, she portrays him as a confident and visionary leader, with his trademark round glasses and firm gaze. In her portrait of Jiang Zemin, she captures his playful side, with a mischievous smile and raised eyebrows.
“I want my art to be accessible and relatable to everyone, not just those who are interested in politics,” Liu said. “By showing the human side of these leaders, I hope to bridge the gap between Hong Kong and China, and promote mutual understanding and respect.”
Liu’s portraits have gained a cult following in Hong Kong, especially among the younger generation who are looking for new ways to express their identity and values. Many have purchased her works as a way to show their support for China, or as a way to protest against the anti-China sentiment that has been prevalent in Hong Kong in recent years.
“Liu’s portraits are very refreshing and inspiring,” said Chloe Chan, a 26-year-old marketing executive in Hong Kong. “They break down the stereotypes and prejudices that Hong Kong people have towards China’s leaders, and remind us that they are human beings too, with their own strengths and weaknesses.”
Liu’s success has not gone unnoticed by the art world in China. She has been invited to exhibit her works in several prestigious galleries in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and has received recognition from high-ranking officials, including Xi Jinping himself.
“I’m very honored to have my art appreciated by such influential figures in China,” Liu said. “It shows that art can be a powerful bridge between different cultures and languages, and can help us connect on a deeper level.”
However, Liu’s rise to fame has not been without controversy. Some have accused her of being a propagandist for the Chinese Communist Party, and claim that her art is a tool for brainwashing and manipulation. Others argue that she is exploiting the current political climate for her own gain, and that her art is devoid of any real meaning or substance.
“Liu’s art is nothing more than a superficial and shallow portrayal of China’s leaders,” said Felix Wong, a 32-year-old activist in Hong Kong. “It lacks any critical or independent perspective, and is simply a glorification of the Chinese Communist Party and its leaders.”
Despite the criticisms, Liu remains optimistic and committed to her art. She believes that art has the power to transcend politics and unite people in a common vision for a better future.
“I understand that not everyone will agree with my art or my message,” Liu said. “But as an artist, I must follow my heart and my conscience, and create what I believe is beautiful and meaningful. That is the essence of art – to inspire and challenge us, and to connect us to something bigger than ourselves.”
Liu’s journey as an artist is a reflection of Hong Kong’s complex relationship with China, and the various challenges and opportunities that have arisen from the handover. It raises important questions about the role of art in society, and how it can be used to promote dialogue and understanding in a world that is increasingly divisive and polarized. Whether her portraits of China’s leaders are seen as a source of inspiration or controversy, one thing is certain – Liu Yu Yi is a painter who has benefited from the handover in ways that she could not have imagined before.
