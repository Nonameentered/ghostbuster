Hong Kong, China - The Beijing-picked preparatory committee has reportedly endorsed shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa as Hong Kong's new leader-in-waiting. This announcement comes just months after Beijing-backed Chief Executive Carrie Lam resigned from her post, leaving a leadership vacuum in the city.
Tung Chee-hwa, also known as Tung Chee-chen, is a billionaire businessman and politician who served as the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong after the 1997 handover from Britain until his resignation in 2005. He is a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a political advisory body in China, and has been a prominent figure in the country's political and business circles for decades.
His endorsement by the preparatory committee is seen as a signal of Beijing's intentions for Hong Kong's leadership, following months of protests and unrest in the city over concerns of eroding freedoms and autonomy. The committee, which is composed of pro-Beijing figures, was tasked with selecting Hong Kong's new leader-in-waiting and has been closely watched by observers seeking insight into China's plans for the city.
Tung Chee-hwa's appointment is expected to be met with criticism from pro-democracy activists and opposition figures, who have accused Beijing of meddling in Hong Kong's affairs and eroding its autonomy. In recent years, the city has seen a series of protests and clashes between protesters and police, as well as the implementation of controversial national security laws aimed at curbing dissent.
However, supporters of Tung Chee-hwa have praised his experience and track record as a leader, citing his successful response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 and his efforts to boost the city's economy during his tenure.
"Mr. Tung has a wealth of experience as a leader and businessman, and I believe he is the right person to lead Hong Kong through these challenging times," said pro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip.
Nevertheless, the endorsement of Tung Chee-hwa is likely to exacerbate tensions between pro-democracy activists and Beijing, who have clashed over issues ranging from the implementation of universal suffrage to the crackdown on freedom of expression in the city.
In response to the announcement, pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo criticized the selection process, accusing Beijing of choosing a leader who has shown little regard for Hong Kong's autonomy or democratic values.
"It's disappointing but not surprising that Beijing has chosen to endorse someone with such a questionable record on democratic rights and freedoms," said Mo.
The endorsement also raises questions about the future direction of Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China, particularly in light of recent moves to tighten the city's integration with the mainland. Critics have argued that this integration threatens to erode Hong Kong's unique identity and put its freedoms and autonomy in jeopardy.
Despite these concerns, Tung Chee-hwa's endorsement is seen as a symbol of Beijing's confidence in his ability to manage Hong Kong's political and economic challenges. If his appointment is confirmed, he will be expected to address a range of pressing issues facing the city, from the ongoing pandemic to the faltering economy and the political unrest that has roiled the city in recent years.
For now, the announcement of his endorsement has set the stage for what is likely to be a contentious debate over the future of Hong Kong's leadership and its relationship with mainland China. As the city braces for change, many are watching closely to see what the future holds for this unique and complex metropolis.
