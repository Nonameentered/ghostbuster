In a move that raises questions about the future of Hong Kong's autonomy as a Special Administrative Region, the Beijing-approved Committee for the Promotion of National Unity is set to hold its first meeting in China, rather than in Hong Kong. The announcement was made by Tung Chee-hwa, the new leader of the committee and a former Chief Executive of Hong Kong.
The Committee for the Promotion of National Unity was established in May 2020 by the Chinese government, in response to the protests and unrest that had engulfed Hong Kong since June 2019. The committee's stated goal is to promote "patriotism" and "national unity" in Hong Kong, and to "safeguard national security".
However, the committee has been widely criticized for being a tool of Beijing's efforts to suppress political dissent in Hong Kong, and for undermining the city's autonomy under the "one country, two systems" framework.
In his announcement, Tung Chee-hwa emphasized the importance of the committee in promoting "harmony and stability" in Hong Kong, and said that holding the first meeting in China would show the committee's commitment to the "one country" principle.
"By holding the first meeting in the mainland, we can demonstrate our resolve to safeguard national unity and promote patriotism," Tung said. "This is an important step in our efforts to promote harmony and stability in Hong Kong."
However, the move is likely to be seen as a further erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy, and a sign of the increasing influence of Beijing in the city's affairs. Critics have accused the Chinese government of using the committee to bypass Hong Kong's democratically elected government and impose its will on the city.
The announcement comes at a time of heightened tension between China and the United States over Hong Kong. In July, the US government imposed sanctions on Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, and other officials for their role in implementing China's controversial national security law in the city.
The law, which was imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing in June 2020, criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, and has been widely criticized for its broad and vague definitions.
The Chinese government has defended the law as necessary to maintain national security and stability in Hong Kong, and has accused the US of interfering in China's internal affairs.
The Committee for the Promotion of National Unity is set to hold its first meeting in China in September. It remains to be seen what impact this will have on Hong Kong's autonomy and its relationship with Beijing. The move is likely to deepen concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms and democracy, and increase calls for greater international pressure on China to respect its commitments to Hong Kong.
