Today, Hong Kong residents are in mourning, as leaders pay their respects to China's former leader, Deng Xiaoping. Deng, who died on this day thirteen years ago, is still widely admired for his accomplishments in modernizing China and for his role in establishing the "one country, two systems" policy that governs Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China.
At a ceremony in Beijing, Chinese leaders gathered to pay their respects to Deng. President Xi Jinping laid a wreath at his mausoleum, while Premier Li Keqiang, Vice President Wang Qishan, and other officials made speeches in his honor. Deng's legacy, they said, is still felt today.
"Deng has long been known as the architect of modern China," Xi said. "He was the one who developed and implemented the policies of reform and opening up that transformed our country into what it is today."
Xi and other Chinese leaders praised Deng's pragmatism and vision, saying that he had always put China's interests first and had never shied away from making difficult decisions. They also paid tribute to his role in establishing Hong Kong's special status, which has allowed the city to thrive while maintaining a separate legal system, economy, and way of life.
"Deng Xiaoping's vision for Hong Kong has been a great success," Li said. "His idea of 'one country, two systems' has allowed Hong Kong to maintain its unique identity while still being part of China's overall development."
In Hong Kong, residents also paid tribute to Deng, lighting candles and laying flowers at a statue of him in Victoria Park. However, not everyone in Hong Kong has positive feelings towards Deng and his legacy. Some activists and democracy advocates see him as a symbol of the Central Government's heavy-handed approach to the city and as the architect of a system that has eroded Hong Kong's autonomy.
"Deng Xiaoping may have had good intentions for Hong Kong, but the 'one country, two systems' policy has been used to justify suppression and oppression of the democratic movement in Hong Kong," said activist Joshua Wong. "We need to remember the good and the bad of Deng's legacy."
Despite these criticisms, Deng's legacy remains an important part of China's history and a source of inspiration for many in Hong Kong and beyond. As Premier Li said, "Deng Xiaoping's vision and spirit continue to inspire us today. We must continue to carry on his legacy and work tirelessly to make China a better and stronger country."
