Hong Kong - Ethnic minority residents in Hong Kong have been warned that they will not receive British passports in the upcoming handover to China if they have surrendered other passports in order to qualify. The warning came after concerns were raised that some residents may have handed over their existing citizenships, a move that would mean they would be left stateless if their application for a UK passport was denied.
In 1997, when Hong Kong was handed over from British rule to China, citizens who held British Nationality (Overseas) (BNO) passports were allowed to keep them. However, the UK government recently announced that from January 2021, residents in Hong Kong who are eligible for BNO passports will be able to apply for visas that grant them access to the UK. The visa will be valid for up to five years, after which time they will be able to apply for British citizenship. 
However, controversy surrounding the move has arisen after it emerged that some ethnic minority residents in Hong Kong may have given up their original citizenship in order to obtain a BNO passport. This has left them with a difficult situation as they may now be unable to apply for a UK visa.
The warning has been issued by the Consulate General of the United Kingdom in Hong Kong, which has urged ethnic minority residents who are eligible for BNO passports not to give up their current citizenships. A spokesperson for the consulate said that the warning was issued to ensure that residents “do not inadvertently end up with no citizenship at all”.
The spokesperson added: “If you hold another citizenship, we strongly advise you not to give it up before you have secured your travel documents and immigration status with the UK or another passport-issuing country.”
The warning has been met with concern from some members of the ethnic minority community in Hong Kong. Speaking to the media, one resident said: “We want to know why the UK government didn’t make this clear earlier. It has created so much worry and confusion for many people.”
The development comes as tensions continue to rise in Hong Kong following the introduction of a new security law by the Chinese government, which many residents fear will erode their freedoms and lead to increased surveillance. Last year saw widespread pro-democracy protests in the city which were met with violent responses from police. The recent decision by the UK to offer asylum to Hong Kong residents has drawn criticism from the Chinese government, which has accused the UK of interfering in its internal affairs.
