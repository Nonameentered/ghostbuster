British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind's visit to Hong Kong was marked by a tough reception from the people as he arrived to oversee the handover of the city to China. Pro-democracy protesters were out in force, accusing Rifkind of failing to stand up for Hong Kong's interests and being complicit in the 1984 agreement under which Britain agreed to hand over the city to China.
Rifkind's visit came just weeks before the scheduled handover on July 1, 1997, and tensions were running high. Many Hong Kong residents feared that their city's freedoms and way of life would be curtailed by the authoritarian government in Beijing, which had promised to rule Hong Kong under the principle of "one country, two systems."
As Rifkind arrived at the airport, he was greeted by a large crowd of pro-democracy protesters, many of whom waved British flags and brandished placards calling for continued British protection for Hong Kong. Riots broke out during his visit. Police were forced to use tear gas to disperse the crowds, and dozens of people were arrested.
Rifkind attempted to reassure the people of Hong Kong that they would be protected under Chinese rule and that the agreement with China would ensure their continued freedoms. Speaking at a press conference, he said: "Hong Kong will have no reason to fear the future."
However, his words rang hollow for many of the protesters, who saw him as a symbol of the British government's abandonment of Hong Kong. "We don't believe him," one protester told reporters. "We want to stay British. We don't want to be under Communist rule."
The tension surrounding Rifkind's visit was emblematic of the deep anxieties felt by many Hong Kong residents as they faced an uncertain future under Chinese rule. Critics of the "one country, two systems" model argued that it was impossible for a city as open and democratic as Hong Kong to coexist with a repressive one-party state like China.
Despite the protests, the handover went ahead as planned, with Rifkind handing over the British flag to Chinese officials at a ceremony in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Both sides expressed hope that the transition would be peaceful and that Hong Kong would continue to thrive under Chinese rule.
However, in the years that followed, concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms under Chinese rule proved to be well-founded. The Chinese government cracked down on pro-democracy activists and imposed tighter controls on the city's media and education system, sparking protests and unrest.
As Hong Kong's future remains uncertain today, the events of 1997, and the tough reception faced by Malcolm Rifkind, serve as a reminder of the complex political and social issues at play in the city's relationship with China.
