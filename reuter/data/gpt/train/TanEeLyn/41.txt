The Sinopec Group, China's largest oil refiner, has announced various measures to address the recent surge in diesel prices and the resulting shortages across the country. The move is aimed at alleviating the pain of Chinese consumers who have seen significant price hikes and long queues at petrol stations in recent weeks.
The measures were revealed by Sinopec Chairman Zhang Yuzhou during a press conference on Tuesday. The company plans to add 300,000 metric tons of diesel to its current stockpile of 684,600 metric tons to ensure there are ample supplies for the Chinese market. The additional supplies will come from Sinopec's refineries in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces.
Zhang also announced that Sinopec will increase its daily refining capacity by 2,000 metric tons to produce more diesel fuel. The company will optimize its production process and adjust its output according to market demand to prevent further shortages. Sinopec will also cooperate with logistics companies to ensure timely delivery of the diesel fuel to petrol stations across China.
"Despite the tightness in the domestic market, we will try our best to meet the needs of our customers," Zhang said.
The measures come as China experiences unprecedented levels of demand for diesel fuel. Diesel consumption in the country rose by 18.5% in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2020, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.
The increase in demand is partly due to the recovery of China's economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, which has driven up demand for transportation and manufacturing. However, the surge in demand has also been fueled by the country's ongoing power crisis.
China has been grappling with power shortages this year due to a combination of factors, including a surge in demand for electricity, a decrease in energy supply from coal and natural gas, and the country's ambitious carbon reduction targets. To address the issue, many factories have turned to diesel generators to keep their operations going. This has further exacerbated the demand for diesel fuel in the country.
The supply shortage and resulting rise in prices have hit Chinese consumers hard. Diesel prices have increased by 27% since the beginning of the year, according to data from the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation. Long queues at petrol stations have become a common sight across the country.
The measures announced by Sinopec have been welcomed by Chinese consumers. "I'm glad to hear that Sinopec is taking steps to ensure there will be enough diesel fuel," said Li Chun, a taxi driver in Beijing. "The recent price hikes have been a huge burden for us, and we hope the situation will improve soon."
However, some analysts have expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of Sinopec's measures. "While increasing supply is certainly important, it may not be enough to solve the problem," said Lin Boqiang, a professor of energy economics at Xiamen University. "The root cause of the issue is the power crisis, and unless that is addressed, we may see further shortages and price hikes."
Indeed, many experts argue that a shift away from diesel generators and towards renewable energy is the key to addressing China's power crisis. "The use of diesel generators is not a sustainable solution," said Li Junfeng, director of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation. "We need to accelerate the development of renewable energy and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."
China has set ambitious goals for renewable energy development, aiming to increase its share of renewable energy to 20% by 2025 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. However, critics argue that the country needs to do more to reach these targets.
"The government needs to provide stronger policy support for renewable energy development," said Huang Jing, an energy expert at Fudan University. "This includes providing more subsidies and reducing regulatory barriers. Only then can we truly solve the power crisis and achieve our climate goals."
Regardless of the long-term solutions, Sinopec's measures to increase supply and production of diesel fuel are a welcome relief for Chinese consumers struggling with shortages and high prices. As the country navigates the ongoing power crisis and works towards its renewable energy goals, measures like these will likely be crucial in ensuring adequate energy supplies for China's growing economy.
