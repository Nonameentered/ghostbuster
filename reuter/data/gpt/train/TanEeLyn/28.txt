In a move that is sure to anger Beijing, Hong Kong's Governor Chris Patten has refused to support the new legislature to be installed in the semi-autonomous city by China later this year. After announcing that he would not seek re-election when his term ends on June 30, Patten has left himself free to criticize the latest plans to reform the Hong Kong government.
China officials have been keen to shift Hong Kong to a more democratic system, with Beijing insisting on running an electoral "college" that would effectively choose the city's future leader. However, Patten has been a vocal opponent of this move, calling it an affront to the city's autonomy and democracy.
While the election of a legislature that would have increased powers is a good step for Hong Kong, Patten's abstention from supporting the new government is only likely to further inflame the sensitive debate. Hong Kong, once a British territory, is now considered a city-state with a special status and a direct link to China.
"I will not be presiding over the handover of Hong Kong to a regime with which I cannot agree," Patten said in a recent speech. "I will not sign my name to documents that tell the world that Hong Kong is behaving in an unacceptable way. I do not believe that Hong Kong's future can be secured by participating in joint decisions that will inevitably lead to the erosion of Hong Kong's identity and autonomy."
Patten's sentiments reveal his deep-seated belief that Beijing's increasing control over Hong Kong has eroded the autonomy long guaranteed by Britain during its colonial rule of the city. "The current electoral reform proposals will do nothing to address the underlying concern that Hong Kong is being gradually suffocated under China's ever-tightening grip," Patten added. "I urge my fellow Hong Kongers to stand up against this undemocratic system and do whatever it takes to protect our cherished freedom and way of life." 
But reactions to Patten's speech have been mixed. Some Hong Kongers believe that it is important to stand firm against China's latest plans for the city, while others fear that Patten's comments could set off a diplomatic firestorm between the two countries. There are also concerns among some business leaders in Hong Kong that Patten's move is likely to harm the city's financial stability.
China has taken a strong stance against Hong Kong in recent years, cracking down on free speech and arresting activists and journalists who speak out against the ruling Communist Party. While some Hong Kongers have responded to the increasing controls with mass protests, others have sought refuge abroad.
Despite the criticism from Patten and some in Hong Kong's business community, Beijing has shown no signs of backing down from its efforts to control the city. With a new legislature scheduled to take power later this year, it remains to be seen whether the people of Hong Kong will accept Beijing's latest demands or continue to fight for their own autonomy and freedom.
