Hong Kong’s future leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, has announced a plan to embark on a roadshow to raise her profile and clarify sovereignty transfer issues.
As the first female Chief Executive-elect of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Lam is expected to lead the city for the next five years. However, her appointment has been marred by concerns over China’s increasing role in Hong Kong’s affairs.
Lam has acknowledged the need for transparency and open communication in addressing these concerns, and has thus decided to embark on a roadshow to engage with citizens and clarify issues regarding Hong Kong’s sovereignty transfer.
The roadshow will reportedly take place in the form of a series of public forums, where Lam will have the opportunity to interact with residents and address their concerns. The forums will be held in various locations across the city, including community centers, schools, and public spaces.
According to a statement released by Lam’s office, the forums will provide a platform for “constructive dialogue and exchange of ideas” between the government and the people of Hong Kong.
Lam has said that she hopes the roadshow will help to bridge the gap between the people and the government, and will help to strengthen Hong Kong’s sense of identity.
“This roadshow is an opportunity for me to listen to the views of the community, to exchange ideas, and to gain a better understanding of the needs and aspirations of our people,” Lam said in a statement.
Lam’s decision to embark on the roadshow comes as Hong Kong continues to grapple with issues related to its autonomy. Despite being handed over to China in 1997, Hong Kong has retained a degree of independence under a “one country, two systems” arrangement.
However, many residents fear that China has been encroaching on Hong Kong’s autonomy in recent years, particularly through the disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers and the abduction of booksellers.
Lam has vowed to address these concerns and to uphold Hong Kong’s autonomy, but has also emphasized the need for stability and unity.
“I understand that there are concerns and fears about Hong Kong’s future, but I want to reassure the public that we are committed to upholding the ‘one country, two systems’ principle, and that we will do everything in our power to ensure that Hong Kong remains a prosperous and vibrant city,” she said.
The roadshow is set to begin in the coming weeks, and is expected to run throughout Lam’s term as Chief Executive.
