Hong Kong Celebrates 100-day Countdown to Chinese Rule with Nationalistic Parade
As Hong Kong approaches the 100-day countdown to the 24th anniversary of the city's handover to China, a nationalistic parade was held in the city on Sunday, June 27, 2021. The parade, which was organized to commemorate the event, was attended by thousands of people, mainly pro-Beijing supporters, who cheered as patriotic songs were sung and flags waved. The event was also celebrated with a fireworks display in Victoria Harbour.
The parade started at 1:00 PM from the Hong Kong Cultural Centre and proceeded along the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront, before ending at the West Kowloon Cultural District. The participants carried Chinese flags and sang patriotic songs, while designers showcased costumes, floats, and performance art.
Organized by a pro-Beijing committee, the goal of the parade was to promote national unity and to celebrate the 100-day countdown to the Chinese rule. The event was seen as an important celebration, as the 24th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China will be the first anniversary to be celebrated under the new national security law that was imposed by Beijing in 2020.
In the past few years, Hong Kong has seen an increase in pro-democracy protests, which often turned violent. Many in the city feel that the new national security law, which has been widely criticized by human rights groups, has eroded the city's autonomy and has curtailed freedom of speech.
The parade was not without controversy, as some Hong Kong residents felt that the event was a show of support for Beijing's policies and its control over Hong Kong. They also felt that the parade was a sign of the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over Hong Kong's government and politics.
Many activists have called for the government to prioritize democracy and human rights, and for the return of the city's autonomy. They have also called for the release of pro-democracy activists who have been arrested under the national security law.
Nevertheless, the parade was a display of national pride for many in Hong Kong, who are proud of their culture and heritage. The organizers of the event hope that the parade will help to unify the city and to promote patriotism.
In conclusion, the nationalistic parade held to celebrate the 100-day countdown to the Chinese rule has sparked mixed reactions among Hong Kong residents. While some view the event as a celebration of their culture and heritage, others see it as a sign of the increasing influence of Beijing over their city. Regardless, the parade was a significant event as it marks the first anniversary to be celebrated under the new national security law that has been widely criticized by human rights groups.
