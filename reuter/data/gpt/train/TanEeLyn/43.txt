In a show of support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, European parliamentarians urged Hong Kongers to continue speaking up for democracy and the rule of law. The rally, which took place in Brussels on Thursday, saw politicians from across the European Union joining hands to support the movement in Hong Kong.
The event was organized by the European Parliamentary Alliance on China (EPAC) and brought together politicians from across the European Union. The aim of the rally was to raise awareness of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong and to highlight the need for the international community to show solidarity with the people of Hong Kong.
Speaking at the rally, MEP Reinhard Butikofer, who heads up the EPAC, said that the world was watching what was happening in Hong Kong. He told the crowd that the European Parliament was fully behind the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and that the protests were an inspiration to people all over the world.
"The people of Hong Kong are not alone in their struggle for democracy and the rule of law,” said Butikofer. “The European Parliament stands with them and we urge the Chinese government to respect the rights of the people of Hong Kong."
The rally also heard from Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, who has become the international face of the pro-democracy movement. Wong urged the gathering to continue putting pressure on China to respect the rights of the Hong Kong people and to uphold the principles of democracy.
"The world is watching Hong Kong and we need your help,” said Wong. “We need the international community to stand up for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong and to send a message to China that the people of Hong Kong will not be silenced."
Other speakers at the rally included German MEP Reinhard Hündling and British MEP Nathan Gill, who both spoke of their admiration for the courage and determination of the protesters in Hong Kong.
"The people of Hong Kong have shown remarkable determination in their struggle for democracy and the rule of law,” said Hündling. “We must support them in their efforts and ensure that their voices are heard."
The rally comes at a time of increasing tension between China and the rest of the world over the situation in Hong Kong. The protests, which began in June over a controversial extradition bill, have escalated into a wider movement calling for greater democracy and autonomy for Hong Kong.
China has accused foreign powers of meddling in its internal affairs and of backing the protesters in Hong Kong. This has led to a diplomatic rift between China and a number of countries, including the United States, which has passed a number of bills in support of the Hong Kong protests.
The European Parliament has also been at the forefront of efforts to show solidarity with the people of Hong Kong. In a resolution passed last month, the Parliament condemned China's "continued violations" of human rights and democracy in Hong Kong and called for an independent investigation into alleged police brutality during the protests.
Thursday's rally in Brussels was seen as a further demonstration of the Parliament's support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. It was also seen as a message to China that the world is watching the situation in Hong Kong closely and that the international community will not stand idly by while the rights of the Hong Kong people are trampled upon.
As the rally came to a close, MEPs and activists joined hands in a symbol of unity and solidarity with the people of Hong Kong. It was a powerful moment that underlined the importance of standing up for democracy and human rights, wherever they may be under threat.
