Beijing, China â€“ A China expert stated that the Chinese government is keen for a smooth Hong Kong transition to pave the way for Taiwan reunification.
The comments by the expert come amid heightened tensions between China and Hong Kong following months of protests in 2019 against Beijing's increasing influence in the region and the controversial extradition bill.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the expert remarked that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) views a successful Hong Kong transition as crucial for its long-term goal of reunification with Taiwan.
The expert said that China is looking for a model for Taiwan to follow, and a peaceful transfer of power in Hong Kong could serve as a blueprint.
"China wants a peaceful transition. The last thing the CCP wants is any kind of upheaval in Hong Kong that could cause greater political instability in Taiwan," the expert stated.
Experts have long suspected that China seeks to use its influence in Hong Kong as an example to pressure Taiwan to reunify with the mainland. Taiwan is currently governed separately, and China considers the island to be a renegade province.
The expert added that Beijing is willing to give Hong Kong more autonomy than any other Chinese territory, including Macau, to serve as an example for Taiwan. However, the expert emphasized that China views any attempt at independence by Taiwan as a non-negotiable red line.
"The CCP sees the situation in Hong Kong as an opportunity to influence Taiwan. The future of Hong Kong is tied to the goal of reunification with Taiwan," said the expert.
To achieve its goals, China has been using a "soft power" strategy to influence Taiwanese voters, using social media and investment in Taiwan's economy to sway public opinion. The expert notes that the CCP has also been using its growing military capabilities to put pressure on Taiwan.
However, the expert emphasized that Taiwan is likely to resist any attempt at reunification by force, and that Beijing is aware of the risks of military action against the island.
"The CCP knows there would be significant economic and political costs to any military action against Taiwan. At the same time, it sees time as on its side and hopes that economic and political pressure will eventually force Taiwan to acquiesce to reunification," said the expert.
In conclusion, the expert suggests that the future of Hong Kong and Taiwan remain intertwined, and that any peaceful transition in Hong Kong could have broad implications for the entire region.
