The British Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, met with the future leader of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, on Monday to discuss the ongoing unrest in the region. However, the meeting ended with no agreement or visible progress to bridge the gap between the UK and Hong Kong governments.
Raab visited Hong Kong on the first stop of his six-day trip to Asia, which also includes visits to Japan and South Korea. He expressed concern over the ongoing protests in Hong Kong and urged Lam to address the protestors’ demands for greater political freedom, autonomy, and human rights.
The protest movement in Hong Kong began in June 2019 and has seen millions of people take to the streets to voice their opposition to the proposed extradition bill, which would allow the Chinese government to extradite individuals to mainland China. The bill was later withdrawn, but the protests continued and became larger and more violent.
Raab urged Lam to establish a peaceful dialogue with the protestors and said that the UK would continue to monitor the situation closely. He also expressed concern over the treatment of journalists and activists in Hong Kong, pointing out that freedom of expression and the rule of law were fundamental pillars of Hong Kong's success as a city.
Lam, on the other hand, defended the actions of the Hong Kong police, who have been criticized for using excessive force and brutality against protesters. She accused some protestors of resorting to violence and urged them to respect the rule of law. She also asserted that the city's autonomy and civil liberties were being protected, and that the central government in Beijing was not interfering with Hong Kong’s affairs.
Despite Raab's efforts to express solidarity with the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, the meeting made little progress in bridging the gap between the UK and Hong Kong governments. Some observers noted that Raab's visit was mostly symbolic and that it had little chance of achieving substantial results.
The UK, which governed Hong Kong as a colony until 1997, has a special responsibility for its former territory and has been a vocal critic of the Chinese government's handling of the protests. Raab met with pro-democracy activists and expressed the UK's support for their cause, but his room for maneuvering is limited as the UK is in the midst of Brexit negotiations and is trying to strengthen its ties with China.
For its part, the Chinese government has accused the UK of meddling in its internal affairs and threatened to retaliate if the UK continued to interfere in Hong Kong. China has been increasingly assertive in its foreign policy and has been accused of violating international norms and human rights.
Raab's visit to Asia is also focused on promoting trade and building alliances with Asian countries as part of the UK's efforts to diversify its global partnerships. He is expected to meet with Japanese and South Korean officials to discuss trade, security, and regional cooperation.
However, the ongoing crisis in Hong Kong is casting a shadow over Raab's trip and reflects the broader geopolitical tensions between China and the West. The UK and other Western countries are facing tough choices as they try to balance their economic and strategic interests with their values and commitments to human rights and democracy.
In the absence of a breakthrough in the talks between the UK and Hong Kong governments, the future of Hong Kong remains uncertain. The protests have taken a toll on the city's economy and social fabric, and the implications for its relations with China and the rest of the world are significant. The UK's role as a mediator and guardian of Hong Kong's autonomy and rights will be crucial in shaping the outcome of this crisis.
