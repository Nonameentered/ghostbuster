Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton is set to attend an international conference in Manila despite being hospitalized. Eggleton was admitted to the hospital last Wednesday after complaining of chest pains.
The trade minister is set to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Manila, which is scheduled to take place from November 18 to 19. Eggleton's office confirmed that the minister will attend the meeting, but did not disclose any details regarding his health.
In a statement, Eggleton's office said, "The minister is in good hands and has been receiving the necessary medical treatment. He is eager to attend the APEC meeting and is looking forward to discussing trade issues with his counterparts from other nations."
The APEC meeting in Manila is set to focus on a wide range of issues including trade liberalization, sustainability and connectivity. The meeting is seen as a critical forum for promoting economic growth and development in the Asia-Pacific region.
Eggleton's attendance at the meeting is seen as crucial for Canada, which is seeking to forge closer ties with the Philippines and other countries in the region. The trade minister is expected to meet with his counterparts from other nations to discuss bilateral trade agreements and other issues of mutual interest.
Despite his hospitalization, Eggleton has remained committed to attending the APEC meeting in Manila. His perseverance is a testament to his dedication to advancing Canada's economic agenda and promoting sustainable development across the Asia-Pacific region.
