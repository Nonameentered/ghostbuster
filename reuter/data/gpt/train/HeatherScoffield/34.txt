Jakarta, Indonesia: Negotiations between global mining corporation, Barrick Gold Corporation, and the Indonesian government for the rights to the Busang gold discovery remain in limbo. The talks have failed to reach a conclusive decision, leaving the future of this significant discovery up in the air.
The Busang gold deposit, located in the Borneo region of Indonesia, was initially discovered in 1995 by Canadian geologist, John Felderhof, who was working for Bre-X Minerals. It was reported that the mine had gold reserves worth between $3 and $200 billion. However, the discovery turned out to be a massive hoax, leading Bre-X shares to plummet, and the company ultimately collapsed in 1997.
Barrick Gold, one of the world's largest gold mining companies, became the owner of the Busang gold deposit after purchasing Placer Dome in 2006. In 2016, the company expressed its interest in developing Busang and entered into discussions with the Indonesian government about acquiring the exploration and mining rights.
After years of negotiations, the Indonesian government asked Barrick Gold to pay $40 million in advance for the right to explore and develop the Busang gold deposit. However, Barrick refuted that the requested amount was too high, and the payment process would be a significant challenge as the transaction would be subject to Canadian law.
Complicating the matter further, the Indonesian government enacted a new mining law in 2020 requiring foreign miners to divest 51% of their shares in their Indonesian operations to a local entity within ten years. This law, along with Barrick's concerns about the size of upfront payments and exploration success rates, has caused the negotiations to become increasingly complex.
The talks remained at an impasse, with Barrick Gold reportedly preparing to walk away from the negotiations. The mining company argues that it currently has no other option than to stop negotiations, so they can focus on other projects.
A Barrick Gold spokesperson spoke to Indonesia's leading newspaper saying that the company remains open to negotiations and sees potential in the Busang deposit. However, they also added that the Indonesian government would need to reduce its upfront payment requirement and clarify the rules around the 51% share divestment.
The Busang gold deposit has been dormant for over two decades, but its potential has not been forgotten. With the global pandemic affecting worldwide economies, the Indonesian government is looking to secure additional income streams, making the Busang deposit an attractive option.
The government's perspective seems to be unanimous across party lines; they believe that after all the interest from global companies, now is the time to maximize Busang's potential. Still, the talks between Barrick Gold and the Indonesian government have yielded little progress so far.
While the Busang gold deposit remains untouched, the world's gold prices are soaring, and the project's potential grows challenging to ignore. It remains to be seen whether the Indonesian government and Barrick Gold will agree to terms and start developing the massive gold deposit that could benefit both parties significantly.
In conclusion, the negotiations between the Indonesian government and Barrick Gold Corporation are far from over, but both parties have signalled their willingness to work towards a deal. The Busang deposit's potential for both the Indonesian government and foreign investors is enormous, but it is up to both parties to find a deal that works for everyone involved.
