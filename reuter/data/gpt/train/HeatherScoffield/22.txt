Barrick Gold Corporation, the global mining giant, is in negotiations to gain control of the Busang Gold Discovery in Indonesia that was once at the center of a major controversy in the mining industry. Barrick, together with some partners, is looking to acquire the rights over the Busang deposit that had previously belonged to Bre-X Minerals Ltd. Bre-X had claimed that Busang was the largest gold deposit on earth, but it was later revealed to be a massive fraud.
Barrick Gold is currently in talks with a unique group of investors, including Indonesian conglomerate Lippo Group, and several other leading mining companies. According to sources familiar with the matter, the acquisition could be worth over $1 billion. 
The Busang deposit was the subject of much attention, especially in the late 1990s, after John Felderhof, the Vice President of Exploration at Bre-X, claimed to have discovered one of the largest gold deposits in the world. This announcement caused many investors to pour their money into the company and fueled the greed of those who had stakes in the project. Consequently, the company's market capitalization rose from about $200 million to over $4 billion. 
However, the euphoria surrounding the Busang deposit vanished almost as quickly as it came. In 1997, the company's geologist, Michael de Guzman, fell to his death from a helicopter, and subsequent investigations revealed that the company had been engaging in massive fraud. Bre-X had salted its mine (a term used to describe the adding of gold salts to rock samples to make them appear richer than they were). The scandal caused the collapse of Bre-X, and John Felderhof was charged with securities violations in Canada, but he was acquitted.
 
The ongoing negotiations between Barrick and the Bre-X shareholders seek to bring Busang back into the fold, and it is hoped that Barrick's expertise in the mining sector can help restore credibility and value to the deposit. The project is believed to have significant potential for development, with estimated reserves of around 14 million ounces of gold. If Barrick is successful in securing a stake in the project, they are planning to form a joint venture with Lippo Group to operate the mine. 
The acquisition, however, faces several other hurdles before it can be finalized. One of the significant challenges would come from the Indonesian government's regulations that limit foreign ownership of mines to 49%. The restrictions extend to mining contracts signed before Indonesia's 2009 Mining Law, making the negotiations a delicate dance. Barrick has reassured investors that they are aware of the regulatory challenges yet believe they can navigate their way through this complicated web of regulations.
The Bre-X scandal was certainly a dark spot on the mining industry's reputation, causing significant losses to investors and leaving a trail of disappointment and unfulfilled promises. Barrick is aware that they have to tread carefully given the past legacy attached to the Busang deposit. As such, they recently put out a statement emphasizing that the company had a robust due diligence process that would investigate any irregularities and discrepancies.
Barrick has a history of successful gold mining ventures, and this acquisition, if successful, will also go a long way in cementing its position as the top global gold miner. The company just last year completed a merger with Randgold Resources, creating the world's largest gold miner by production.
In conclusion, the negotiations between Barrick Gold and Lippo Group over controlling Bre-X's Busang Gold discovery in Indonesia are still at an early stage. If the acquisition is successful, it is expected to bring significant value for both companies and stakeholders. However, the project faces considerable regulatory hurdles, given the aftermath of the Bre-X scandal, and both companies will need to navigate through them to reach the final agreement. Nonetheless, Barrick's expertise in the gold mining sector and its history of successful ventures will undoubtedly be needed to restore credibility and value to the Busang deposit.
