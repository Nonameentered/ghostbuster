Canadian mining company Barrick Gold is in negotiations to acquire Bre-X's Busang gold discovery in Indonesia. This acquisition would make Barrick Gold the world's biggest gold producer, surpassing Newmont Goldcorp.
The Busang gold discovery, located in Kalimantan, Indonesia, was discovered by Bre-X in 1995, sparking one of the largest gold scams in history. It was claimed that the site contained over 200 million ounces of gold, but this was later found to be a fraudulent claim. Bre-X's stock price skyrocketed but plummeted when the scam was uncovered.
Since then, the Busang site has remained untapped, but Barrick Gold sees potential in the site. The acquisition would give Barrick Gold access to the potentially large gold reserves and allow them to expand their operations in the Asia-Pacific region.
Barrick Gold's CEO, Mark Bristow, confirmed the negotiations in a statement released on Sunday, "We have been in discussions with Bre-X about the Busang project and are excited about the potential it presents. We believe that with our expertise and technology, we can responsibly develop this resource and create value for our shareholders and the local communities."
The acquisition is still in the early stages, and details of the deal have not been disclosed. However, it is expected to include a significant cash payment to Bre-X's shareholders.
Barrick Gold has been on an acquisition spree in recent years, acquiring Randgold Resources in 2018 and Newmont Goldcorp's stake in the Kalgoorlie Super Pit in 2019. This acquisition would further strengthen Barrick Gold's position in the gold mining industry and solidify its status as the world's top gold producer.
The news has received mixed reactions from industry experts. Some are skeptical about the potential of the Busang site, given its tainted history. Others believe that Barrick Gold's expertise and technological advancements can unlock the site's full potential.
Anthony Renshaw, a mining consultant based in Jakarta, said, "There's no question that Busang is a high-risk project, given its history. However, the fact that Barrick Gold is even considering this acquisition shows that they believe there is potential there. If they can successfully develop the site, it could be a game-changer for the gold mining industry."
Indonesia is a significant player in the gold mining industry, with the Grasberg mine being the world's largest gold mine and second-largest copper mine. The country is also home to several other large gold deposits, including the Batu Hijau and Martabe mines.
The acquisition of the Busang site would further strengthen Indonesia's position in the gold mining industry and boost the country's economy. The Indonesian government has been actively promoting investment in the mining industry, and this acquisition would be a significant win for them.
However, concerns have been raised about the potential environmental impact of further gold mining in Indonesia. The Grasberg mine has been highly criticized for its impact on the environment and local communities. The Indonesian government has promised to prioritize sustainable mining practices, but it remains to be seen how these promises will be implemented.
The acquisition of the Busang site is still subject to regulatory approval, and it could take several months before the deal is finalized. However, if it does go through, it could be a significant moment in the gold mining industry and a major win for Barrick Gold.
