Chicago-based insurance company Aon Corp announced today that it has acquired Alexander & Alexander Services Inc in a $1.23 billion deal. The acquisition is expected to result in significant benefits for both companies, as well as for American International Group Inc, which already has a strong relationship with both firms.
Alexander & Alexander, based in New York, is a leading insurance brokerage firm that specializes in property and casualty insurance, employee benefits, and risk management services. The company has been in operation since 1872 and serves clients in a broad range of industries, including healthcare, higher education, financial services, and manufacturing.
Aon Corp, which was founded in 1919, is one of the world's largest insurance brokerage and consulting firms. The company provides a wide range of services to clients in over 120 countries, including risk management, insurance brokerage, and human resources consulting.
The acquisition of Alexander & Alexander is expected to boost Aon's already substantial presence in the property and casualty insurance market, as well as its capabilities in employee benefits and risk management. The deal will also expand Aon's offerings to include A&A's specialized expertise in areas such as healthcare and higher education.
In a statement announcing the acquisition, Aon CEO Greg Case said, "This transaction represents a significant milestone for our firm and will allow us to better serve our clients across all industries and geographies. We are thrilled to welcome the talented team at Alexander & Alexander to the Aon family, and we look forward to working together to create even more value for our clients."
The acquisition is also expected to benefit American International Group Inc, which already has close relationships with both Aon and Alexander & Alexander. AIG is one of the world's largest insurance companies and provides a wide range of property and casualty insurance, life insurance, and retirement services. The company has been a key partner to both Aon and Alexander & Alexander, and the acquisition will strengthen those relationships even further.
In a statement, AIG CEO Brian Duperreault said, "We are excited to see Aon and Alexander & Alexander come together. This combination will bring even more value to our shared clients, and we look forward to continuing our strong relationships with both firms."
Overall, the acquisition of Alexander & Alexander by Aon Corp is expected to be a significant step forward for both companies and will result in enhanced capabilities and services for their clients. With American International Group Inc already poised to benefit from the deal, it seems that all parties involved are set to reap rewards from this major acquisition.
