Global insurance firm Aon has announced that it will acquire Alexander & Alexander Services Inc. (A&A) for $1.23 billion, creating the largest insurance and risk consulting company in the world.
The deal, which will be funded by a combination of cash and debt financing, is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approval.
Aon CEO, Greg Case, said the acquisition would help the company expand its capabilities and provide greater value to clients, stating: “Our combination will deliver a broader platform with deeper analytics, and more services in the areas of health and cyber solutions. We are excited by the growth opportunities we see across our businesses and the customer value proposition that we can deliver together.”
A&A, which has its headquarters in New York, is a leading risk consulting and insurance brokerage company that provides a wide range of services to corporations and individuals. Its clients include some of the world's largest businesses and organizations.
The acquisition is the latest in a series of strategic moves by Aon to bolster its global presence and expand its offerings. Last year, the company announced its intention to acquire rival Willis Towers Watson, but the deal was abandoned after regulatory objections.
The acquisition of A&A is expected to accelerate Aon's growth and give it a competitive edge in the insurance market. The deal will also give Aon a foothold in new markets where A&A is already established, such as Latin America and the Caribbean.
A&A CEO, Tom Fitzgerald, said the deal would allow the company to offer a broader range of services to its clients and provide better solutions to complex risk management challenges. He added: “We are excited to join forces with Aon, which shares our commitment to innovation and excellence in serving clients.”
Once the acquisition is complete, A&A will join Aon's existing risk solutions and health businesses. The combined company will have over 100,000 employees in more than 120 countries, serving clients in a wide range of industries and sectors.
The deal is expected to create significant synergies, leading to cost savings of around $60 million per year. Aon also expects the deal to have an immediate positive impact on earnings and cash flows.
The acquisition is part of a trend of consolidation in the insurance and risk consulting industry, as companies seek to expand their services and gain market share. Last year, Marsh & McLennan announced the acquisition of rival broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson in a deal worth $5.6 billion.
The global insurance market is also being reshaped by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to increased demand for health insurance and cyber risk services. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of risk management and crisis planning, driving demand for consulting services.
The acquisition of A&A is expected to position Aon as a market leader in these areas, as well as in other key sectors such as aviation, construction, and marine.
The combination of Aon and A&A will create a formidable force in the insurance and risk consulting industry, with the ability to offer a comprehensive range of services to clients around the world. The deal is set to transform both companies and reshape the competitive landscape in the insurance market.
