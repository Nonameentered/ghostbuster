The Outboard Marine Corporation, once a proud maker of boats and other watercraft, has been struggling in recent years. In 2018, the company announced a major restructuring plan that it hoped would put it back on the path to profitability. However, according to a recent statement from a company spokesman, the restructuring is only 5% complete and will result in more charges against earnings in the coming quarters.
The Outboard Marine Corporation, which is based in Illinois, has a long history in the boating industry. The company traces its roots back to 1929, when it was founded by a group of investors led by Ralph Evinrude, the inventor of the outboard motor. Over the years, the company expanded into other areas of the boating market, including boat design and manufacturing.
However, in recent years, the company has struggled to keep up with changing market trends and increased competition from other manufacturers. In 2017, the Outboard Marine Corporation filed for bankruptcy, citing a decline in sales and mounting debts. At the time, the company said it would restructure its operations and focus on its core businesses, including outboard motors and accessories.
In 2018, the Outboard Marine Corporation announced a major restructuring plan that it hoped would put the company back on track. The plan involved cutting costs, streamlining operations, and focusing on core products. The company also announced that it would divest non-core businesses and focus more on the aftermarket.
However, according to a recent statement from a company spokesman, the restructuring is only 5% complete and will result in more charges against earnings in the coming quarters. The spokesman said that the company is still in the process of implementing the restructuring plan and that it will take time to see the full benefits.
The charges against earnings are expected to be significant, potentially running into the millions of dollars. The spokesman said that the charges would be related to severance costs, restructuring charges, and other expenses associated with the restructuring.
Despite the challenges facing the company, the Outboard Marine Corporation remains committed to its core products and to serving its customers. The company is still producing outboard motors and accessories, and is continuing to invest in research and development to stay ahead of the competition.
In a statement, the company's CEO said that the restructuring plan was necessary to ensure the long-term success of the Outboard Marine Corporation. He said that the company was committed to making the necessary changes to improve its operations and position the company for future growth.
The challenges facing the Outboard Marine Corporation are not unique to the boating industry. Many companies have struggled in recent years to keep up with changing market conditions and increased competition. However, the Outboard Marine Corporation remains optimistic about its future, and is committed to working through the current challenges to emerge stronger and more competitive.
In conclusion, the Outboard Marine Corporation is in the midst of a major restructuring effort that it hopes will put the company back on the path to profitability. However, the restructuring is only 5% complete and will result in more charges against earnings in the coming quarters. Despite these challenges, the company remains committed to its core products and to serving its customers, and is optimistic about its future.
