Ford Motor Co. is considering selling its ownership stake in Budget Rent a Car, the brand it has owned since the 1980s, according to anonymous sources. The move follows similar divestments by other automakers looking to streamline their operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. If confirmed, the sale would signal a further retreat by automakers from the car rental business.
Ford has owned Budget since 1987, building it into a global car rental brand with a presence in more than 120 countries. However, like other automakers, Ford's rental car business has struggled in the past year, as the pandemic has reduced travel and forced renters to adjust their travel plans.
According to sources, Ford decided to explore the sale of Budget after evaluating the company's financial performance during the pandemic. Car rental companies have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, as travel restrictions and shifting consumer preferences have reduced demand for rental cars. In response to the crisis, many rental companies have reduced their fleets and closed locations, leading to a significant drop in revenue.
Automakers have long viewed the car rental business as a secondary revenue stream, allowing them to generate additional income from their existing assets. However, in recent years, the industry has seen significant competition from startups and tech firms, who have disrupted traditional rental models with innovative new approaches.
Ford's potential sale of Budget follows similar moves by other automakers. General Motors sold its rental car company, known as Hertz, in 2005, while Chrysler sold its rental operations, including the Dollar and Thrifty brands, in 2013. Both companies sold their rental businesses to private equity firms.
The potential sale of Budget would also align with Ford's broader goal of streamlining its operations. The carmaker has been looking to cut costs and focus on its core business of producing and selling cars, trucks, and SUVs. In recent years, the company has made significant investments in electric and autonomous vehicle technology, as well as revamping its vehicle lineup to focus on more profitable models.
While Ford has not made a final decision on the sale of Budget, sources say the company has engaged with potential buyers and is working to determine a fair market price for the business. Several private equity firms are said to be interested in acquiring the brand, given its global reach and established market position.
When contacted for comment, Ford declined to confirm or deny the rumors of a potential sale. "We do not discuss speculation or rumors," said a company spokesperson. "As always, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and profitability for our shareholders."
The potential sale of Budget comes at a turbulent time for the car rental industry, which has been deeply impacted by the pandemic. While travel is starting to rebound in some areas, many renters have shifted to alternative forms of transportation, such as ride-sharing and delivery services, further complicating the outlook for rental companies.
Despite these challenges, some experts see a bright future for the rental car industry, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. As travel rebounds and people look to avoid crowded public transportation, rental cars could become a more attractive option for people looking to get out and explore.
However, for automakers like Ford, the car rental business may no longer be a strategic priority. By divesting these assets, automakers can focus more on their core businesses and invest in more promising growth areas, such as electric and self-driving cars.
Overall, the potential sale of Budget signals a broader trend in the automotive industry, as carmakers look to adapt to changing market conditions and focus on their core strengths. As companies like Ford look to the future, it remains to be seen what other divestments and streamlining efforts they will pursue in the years to come.
