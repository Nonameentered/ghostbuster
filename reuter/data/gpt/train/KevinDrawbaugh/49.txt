The Amoco Corporation has announced its 1997 plans, which are based on assumed oil and gas prices. The company, one of the largest oil and gas producers in the world, has set its sights on a challenging 1997, with expectations of competition and tight margins.
While the company predicts no significant rise in prices for either oil or gas, it has planned a balanced approach to spending and investment. The company is expected to focus on maintaining its current operations, avoiding any significant new projects that could strain the company's already tight profit margins.
The company's plans are based on a present oil price of $20 per barrel, significantly lower than the current market price of around $38 per barrel. The company assumes that the ongoing economic slowdown in Asia, combined with a supply glut in the market, will keep prices low for much of 1997.
Amoco's CFO, Darrell Hollek, stated that the company had planned for a tough economic environment. "We've taken a conservative, balanced approach to our planning for 1997, assuming that we'll see continued weakness in the oil market," he said.
The company's plans include a cautious investment strategy, with a focus on cutting costs and maximizing the efficiency of existing assets. Hollek explained that the strategy would involve improving the company's performance, "We're sharpening our focus on operations, cost control, and capital efficiency.", he said.
The company's decision to avoid extensive new projects is seen as a prudent strategy, given the ongoing weakness in the oil market. The company, however, will seek to complete its current projects, such as a large $1.5 billion petrochemical complex under construction near Houston.
Despite the challenging market conditions, Amoco President and CEO, Jerry Hausman, remains optimistic about the company's future. He believes that the company's strong balance sheet and range of efficient operations will help it weather the storm.
Hausman stressed that the company would continue to invest in new technologies, such as shale gas and deepwater exploration, which he believed would be significant in the long-term growth of the company.
"We'll be making significant investments in technology and R&D. We're going to be driving hard to continue to deliver better technology and better solutions to our customers," he said.
Despite the volatile market, analysts have praised Amoco's cautious approach to investment and focus on cost control. The company's strong financial position and extensive asset base provide a strong foundation for future growth. The company's ability to ride out the market and position itself for growth in the future, will depend on its ability to balance risk and opportunity, and to create efficiencies in operations and investments.
