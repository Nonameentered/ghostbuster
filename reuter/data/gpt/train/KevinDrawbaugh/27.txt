Baxter International, a leading healthcare company, announced yesterday that it expects to record charges in its Q1 1997 financial statements related to its recent in-process research and development (R&D) acquisitions. The charges are expected to be between $50 million and $70 million, or $0.20 to $0.28 per share.
In-process R&D refers to the ongoing research and development projects that a company acquires when it buys another company or its technology. These projects are not yet completed or are still in the development stage, which means that their future benefits are uncertain and difficult to estimate. As a result, accounting standards require companies to immediately expense the cost of in-process R&D acquisitions rather than capitalize them on their balance sheets.
Baxter International made two significant in-process R&D acquisitions in the past year: one in the third quarter of 1996 and one in the fourth quarter of 1996. The company did not disclose the specific nature of these acquisitions or the companies it bought them from, but it did say that they will enhance its product pipeline and strengthen its position in its core markets.
The charges that Baxter International expects to record in Q1 1997 are related to the write-off of these in-process R&D projects. The company recognized the fair value of the projects when it acquired them, but it now believes that they will not generate the expected returns or meet the timelines that it originally anticipated. Therefore, it has to write them off as a loss in the current period.
Baxter International's management emphasized that the charges are non-cash items and do not affect the company's cash flow or operations. They also reiterated the company's commitment to investing in R&D and pursuing strategic acquisitions that align with its long-term growth plans.
Investors reacted cautiously to the news of the expected charges. Baxter International's stock dropped by 1.3% to close at $45.95 on Tuesday, but it recovered slightly in after-hours trading. Analysts noted that the charges were not unexpected given the nature of in-process R&D acquisitions and the uncertainties that they entail.
Baxter International is scheduled to report its Q1 1997 earnings on April 15, 1997. The company said that it will provide further details on the charges and their impact on its financial performance at that time.
