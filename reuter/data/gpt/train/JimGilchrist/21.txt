Virgin Group's cargo unit, Virgin Atlantic Cargo, has announced the launch of a new air freight service from Hong Kong to South Africa, via London, to further expand its presence in the African market.
The new service will operate twice a week and provide customers with access to the seamless and secure transportation of goods between the three cities. Hong Kong continues to be a major hub for air freight globally, while Johannesburg and Cape Town serve markets in Southern Africa.
Virgin Atlantic Cargo Commercial Director, Dominic Kennedy, said the new service is a natural progression for the company as it continues to grow its network in Africa.
"South Africa is a key market for us, and weâ€™re seeing increasing demand for air cargo services to and from the region," Kennedy said. "Our new service offers our customers a direct and reliable route between Hong Kong and Johannesburg, with onward connectivity to Cape Town, making us the only carrier to offer a direct Hong Kong to Cape Town service."
The new freight service comes as businesses increasingly shift their focus towards faster, more direct routes for their goods, particularly in response to the ongoing pandemic and the resulting rise in e-commerce.
Virgin Atlantic Cargo's new air freight service is expected to provide shippers with a more efficient and cost-effective option for transporting goods between Hong Kong and South Africa while meeting rising demand.
