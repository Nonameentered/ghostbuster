Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) has urged the Hong Kong government to retain some of the air cargo handling facilities at Kai Tak airport. The plea comes after the expansion of Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) at Chek Lap Kok airport, which is expected to further impact the air cargo industry in Hong Kong.
HKIA at Chek Lap Kok airport is already the world's busiest airport for cargo volume, with over 5 million tonnes of cargo handled in 2018. However, the airport's existing cargo handling facilities are now at full capacity, and further expansion is needed to cater to increasing demand.
To address this issue, the Hong Kong Airport Authority (HKAA) is planning to expand HKIA's air cargo iCentre, which will provide additional facilities for handling temperature-sensitive goods and oversized cargo. The iCentre is scheduled to open in 2023 and will increase the airport's annual cargo handling capacity by 1.6 million tonnes.
However, HACTL, one of the world's largest air cargo terminal operators, has expressed concern that the expansion of HKIA will lead to the closure of cargo facilities at Kai Tak airport. This, in turn, will have a significant impact on HACTL's business and the air cargo industry in Hong Kong as a whole.
In a statement issued on Monday, HACTL said that the closure of Kai Tak's cargo facilities would cause "a serious lack of capacity in Hong Kong's air cargo industry," and urged the Hong Kong government to retain some of the facilities to "protect the livelihoods and jobs" of those in the industry.
HACTL also outlined the benefits of retaining some of the cargo facilities at Kai Tak airport, including the potential for more efficient cargo operations and improved air traffic management. The company cited the successful coexistence of air cargo operations at both Kai Tak and HKIA in the past, and said that a similar model could be implemented again.
The Hong Kong government has yet to respond to HACTL's plea. However, it is worth noting that the government has already taken some steps to support the air cargo industry in Hong Kong. Last year, the government launched a HK$3.5 billion ($449 million) fund to support air cargo and logistics-related developments in the city.
The fund aims to provide financial support for projects such as the development of new cargo facilities, the introduction of new technologies, and the training of logistics professionals. It also seeks to attract more air cargo operators to Hong Kong and promote the city as a hub for the air cargo industry in Asia.
However, the impact of HKIA's expansion on the air cargo industry in Hong Kong cannot be ignored. The airport is a key driver of the city's economy, and any changes to its operations could have far-reaching consequences.
Some industry insiders have suggested that the government may need to consider alternative solutions to address the air cargo capacity issue, such as the expansion of other airports in the region. For example, the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, located just over 100km north of Hong Kong, is the third busiest airport in China and has been expanding its cargo handling facilities in recent years.
Regardless of what the government decides, it is clear that the air cargo industry in Hong Kong is at a critical juncture. It will be important for all stakeholders, including the government, airport authorities, and industry players, to work together to ensure that the industry remains competitive in the face of increasing competition from other airports in the region.
For HACTL, the stakes are particularly high. As one of the largest air cargo terminal operators in the world, the company has a significant presence in Hong Kong and is a key player in the city's air cargo industry. It remains to be seen whether the government will take HACTL's plea into account in its decision-making regarding the future of Kai Tak's cargo facilities.
