El Al, Israel’s flag carrier airline, announced plans to increase trade and tourism from Hong Kong with a new direct flight from the city to Tel Aviv. The new route is set to commence in September and will operate on El Al’s Boeing 747-400 aircraft.
This move comes after El Al has expressed interest in expanding its presence in the Asia-Pacific region, which has been identified as an emerging market with great potential. The direct flights to Hong Kong will mark a significant milestone for the airline, as well as for the economic relationship between Israel and Hong Kong.
According to the CEO of El Al, Gonen Usishkin, the airline is committed to strengthening economic ties between Israel and Hong Kong. He noted that the new direct flight will significantly increase the trade and tourism between the two regions. Usishkin also added that the airline’s decision to establish a direct route to Hong Kong is a testament to the strong demand for travel between the two destinations.
Hong Kong’s Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Edward Yau, welcomed the announcement, stating that it would offer new opportunities for business, trade and tourism between Hong Kong and Israel. Yau added that the partnership between El Al and Hong Kong would also strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a leading aviation hub for the region.
The new direct flight from Hong Kong to Tel Aviv will be a welcome boost for the tourism industry in Israel, which has seen growth in recent years. Israel has become an increasingly popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from all over the world. The number of tourists visiting Israel has increased by more than 20% in recent years, with many coming from the Asia-Pacific region.
Overall, this announcement marks a significant step in strengthening economic ties between Hong Kong and Israel, by allowing for greater access to direct trade and tourism opportunities.
