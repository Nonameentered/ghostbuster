Korean Air Lines Ltd, one of South Korea's leading airline companies, reported a 3.2 percent drop in its cargo load factor for the first half of 2021. The airline carried 1.23 million tonnes of cargo from January to June, a decrease of 5.2 percent compared to the same period last year.
The airline attributed the decline in cargo load factor to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected global trade and travel. The airline's passenger traffic also dropped significantly during this period, as travel restrictions and quarantine measures continued to affect air travel.
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Korean Air Lines Ltd said it has been working to adapt to the changing market conditions and adjust its operations accordingly. The airline has been transporting essential medical supplies, such as vaccines and test kits, as well as supporting the logistics needs of various industries, including e-commerce.
Korean Air Lines Ltd is hopeful that the cargo demand will pick up in the second half of the year as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. The airline is also planning to expand its cargo operation by launching new routes and increasing its freighter capacity.
"The situation remains challenging, but we are optimistic about the future and are committed to providing our customers with the best possible service," said a spokesperson for Korean Air Lines Ltd.
The airline is also planning to focus on innovative solutions to streamline its logistics and cargo operations, such as implementing new digital systems and technologies to improve efficiency and enhance customer experience.
