Airbus, the leading European aircraft manufacturer, is planning to market the cargo space of its A380 superjumbo to transport goods in Asia, where e-commerce is flourishing. The company sees an opportunity in the region, as air cargo transport demand has significantly increased throughout the pandemic, with the continent being the largest driver of e-commerce growth globally.
The A380, known as the world's largest civil transporter, is capable of carrying more than 500 passengers. However, with the current situation in the aviation industry due to the ongoing pandemic, Airbus has been exploring ways to make use of the plane's cargo capabilities. One solution is to convert the aircraft into a freighter to carry goods, which can significantly increase its revenue streams.
Airbus has already gained significant interest in Asia, with two leasing companies based in the region. Besides, the company has also been in talks with Singapore Airlines and Emirates, two of its major clients, to transfer some of their A380s to cargo mode permanently. These conversions are expected to be completed by 2022, marking a significant move for the aviation industry.
The demand for air cargo transport has increased steadily in recent years, and it has seen a tremendous boost amid the pandemic, where the need for contactless delivery options is increasing. The shift toward e-commerce has accelerated this trend, with more consumers opting to shop online instead of physical stores. In Asia, particularly in China, e-commerce has become a way of life, with the sector poised to exceed $2 trillion in revenue by 2023.
Airbus's move to market its A380 cargo capabilities comes at a time when the aviation industry faces an uphill battle with border restrictions and travel bans significantly affecting airlines' revenue streams. The company is optimistic about the move, presenting an opportunity to boost its revenue stream amid the current situation.
With the A380's cargo capabilities, Airbus is positioning itself as a significant player in the logistics world, competing with its rival, Boeing, and other global logistics companies such as UPS, FedEx, and DHL. Airlines in Asia and other parts of the world will now have a chance to expand revenue streams while supporting the growing demand for e-commerce. Meanwhile, Airbus is banking that the pandemic will see a permanent shift toward electronic shopping and consumers' preference for air cargo transport.
