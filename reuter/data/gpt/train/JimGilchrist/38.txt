Hong Kong's new airport is in danger of not being completed on schedule due to a shortage of skilled manpower in the construction sector. This issue has raised concerns among stakeholders who have been urging the government to take immediate action.
According to sources in the industry, the shortfall in labour is so severe that an additional 10,000 workers are needed to complete the project within the timeframe. The airport project was initiated in 2016, with an estimated cost of HKD 140 billion ($18 billion), and was due for completion in 2023.
However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the situation has worsened with a significant reduction of foreign workers in Hong Kong, adding to the ongoing labour crisis. Compounding the issue is the fact that the city has long been losing construction workers to better-paying jobs in mainland China.
The airport construction project managers have put out an appeal for more local labour to ensure the timely completion of the project. There is a need for expertise in different areas of construction, such as civil engineers, mechanics, electricians, and other semi-skilled workers.
Hong Kong's government has been considering several measures to address the labour shortage, such as encouraging local contractors to establish new training schemes for their workforce. In addition, the government is contemplating a relaxation of immigration policies to allow more foreign workers, mainly from Southeast Asian countries, to fill the programme's gaps.
However, critics have questioned the effectiveness of these measures, considering the lack of reliable data on the actual labour supply and demand. Moreover, a relaxation of immigration regulations is politically sensitive in a city where concerns about the mingling of different cultures and social integration are an issue.
The shortage of skilled labour not only impacts the airport's construction but also poses a long-term threat to Hong Kong's infrastructure growth. The city's population is projected to continue to grow, and demand for affordable housing, road networks and public facilities is already high.
In conclusion, the shortage of skilled labour must be addressed, and immediate remedial measures put in place. The Hong Kong government and stakeholders cannot afford to ignore the crisis as it will affect the city's long-term growth and competitiveness.
