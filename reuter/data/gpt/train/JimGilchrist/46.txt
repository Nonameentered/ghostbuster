Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline, has begun construction on its new HK$3.5 billion headquarters. The groundbreaking ceremony took place at Chek Lap Kok Airport, the airline's main hub, on Monday morning.
The new headquarters, which is expected to be completed in 2023, will house over 3,000 employees across six floors of office space. The building will also include a staff canteen, gym, and recreation area for employees.
Cathay Pacific CEO Augustus Tang said the new headquarters would consolidate the airline's operations and enable it to become more efficient. "Our new headquarters is a significant investment in the future of our airline and our people, and it will provide a modern and sustainable workplace for our employees," he said.
The new building will be located next to the airline's existing headquarters, which will be redeveloped into a training and simulation center for pilots and cabin crew. The airline's flight operations center and customer service center will also be located on the same site.
The construction of the new headquarters is part of Cathay Pacific's ongoing efforts to improve its operations and cut costs. The airline has been struggling in recent years, hit by a combination of rising fuel prices, intense competition from low-cost carriers, and political unrest in Hong Kong.
Despite the challenges, Cathay Pacific has remained committed to investing in its operations. In addition to the new headquarters, the airline has also recently introduced new routes, upgraded its fleet, and invested in new technologies to improve the customer experience.
The new headquarters is expected to be a major asset for the airline, allowing it to better compete in an increasingly crowded and competitive market. With construction now underway, Cathay Pacific will be hoping to see the benefits of its investment sooner rather than later.
