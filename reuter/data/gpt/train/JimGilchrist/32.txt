Lauda Air, the Austria-based commercial airline, has experienced a significant increase in passenger traffic on its Hong Kong to Vienna route. The airline is currently struggling with its cargo revenue, however, due to the ongoing trade war between the US and China.
According to the airline’s officials, Lauda Air has seen a 25% increase in passenger numbers on its Hong Kong to Vienna route in the past six months. This growth is largely attributed to the airline’s efforts in developing its network and marketing strategies in Asia-Pacific region.
The airline’s CEO, Andreas Gruber, said: “We are very pleased to see such a strong increase in passenger numbers on this important route. This reflects our commitment to our customers and our efforts to improve our services.”
Despite the positive news regarding passenger numbers, the airline’s financial performance has been impacted by the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. Lauda Air has reported a decline in cargo revenue due to the decrease in trade between the two countries.
As a result of the reduced cargo revenue, the airline has been experiencing challenges in maintaining its profitability. However, officials are optimistic about the airline’s future prospects and are working on developing new strategies to counter the impact of the ongoing trade war.
Overall, Lauda Air remains focused on its goal of providing excellent services to its customers and has reiterated its commitment to expanding its international operations.
