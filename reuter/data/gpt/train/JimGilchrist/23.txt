DHL Worldwide Express, the leading global logistics provider, has announced its plans to consider opening a new operations centre in Hong Kong to support the company's future growth in the region. 
The company currently has a strong presence in Asia-Pacific with its current operations centre in Singapore, and this proposed centre would further enhance their operations capabilities, offering more comprehensive services to customers.
"DHL is experiencing a significant increase in demand from Hong Kong and surrounding regions and we recognize a growing need to expand our services and create efficiency in our operations. The establishment of this new facility would allow us to meet the operational requirements for our clients, further increasing our offering in the region," said a spokesperson for DHL.

The proposed new centre will be located in the heart of Hong Kong's business district, offering its customers easy access to the company's range of services. The new facility will house advanced technological equipment, including automated sorting systems, enhancing DHL's operational efficiency and speed of deliveries.
The company's commitment to environmental sustainability will also be reflected in the new centre with energy-saving systems and infrastructure being installed.
This announcement reiterates DHL's dedication to investing in the Asia-Pacific region and expanding its operations further. The project is expected to take a few years to be completed, but this move will certainly strengthen DHL's presence and drive its growth in Hong Kong and beyond. The new operations centre is set to create new job opportunities for local residents and contribute towards Hong Kong's economic growth.
