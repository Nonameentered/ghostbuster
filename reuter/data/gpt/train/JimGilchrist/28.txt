Hong Kong based Dragonair announced its intention to increase flights to Sendai, Japan with the addition of a new Airbus fleet. The decision comes after a successful trial period in which the company noted a significant increase in demand for flights to the city. The new fleet boasts larger planes, meaning Dragonair will now offer daily non-stop services, up from four flights per week previously.
The addition of the Airbus fleet is expected to facilitate the growth of business and tourism between Japan and Hong Kong, and improve trade relations between the two countries. "We are thrilled to be able to offer our customers an increased number of flights to Sendai", said the chief executive of Dragonair. "This investment demonstrates our continued commitment to strengthening our presence in key markets throughout Asia, and our willingness to invest in the very best technology to achieve this."
The new fleet is outfitted with the latest technology and features luxurious seating and state-of-the-art entertainment systems. Dragonair also plans to launch a new frequent flyer programme to reward regular travellers to the region. The increased service to Sendai will begin in the autumn, with the first Airbus flights set to take off in November. The move is expected to be warmly welcomed by the business community, tourists and holidaymakers alike, who will benefit from the increase in services to one of the most vibrant cities in Japan.
