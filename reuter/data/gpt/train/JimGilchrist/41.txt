Polar Air Cargo, a leading worldwide air cargo carrier, has announced that it is expanding its fleet by adding a new Boeing 747-200F aircraft, and is looking to expand its operations throughout Asia.
The new aircraft will be based out of Polar Air Cargo's Anchorage, Alaska hub and will serve a range of destinations across Asia. The company's decision to expand its fleet and operations in the region is driven by the increasing demand for air cargo services in Asia, fueled by the rapid growth of e-commerce and the transition of global supply chains to the region.
The Boeing 747-200F, which can carry up to 117 tons of cargo, is one of the most popular and reliable cargo aircraft in the world, and will provide Polar Air Cargo with greater capacity to meet customer demand in the region.
"Expanding our fleet and operations in Asia is a strategic move for us, given the growing demand for air cargo services in the region," said William J. Flynn, CEO of Atlas Air Worldwide, Polar Air Cargo's parent company. "The addition of the new Boeing 747-200F will help us to meet this demand and provide our customers with the high-quality service they have come to expect from us."
With its expanded fleet and operations in Asia, Polar Air Cargo is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for air cargo services in the region and to continue its leadership in the global air cargo industry.
