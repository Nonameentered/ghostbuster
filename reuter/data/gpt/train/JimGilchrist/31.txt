Hong Kong-based logistics company Baltrans Ltd has acquired its Los Angeles-based competitor for an undisclosed amount, according to a statement released by the company’s chairman, Paul Chan. Chan stated that the acquisition would allow Baltrans to enjoy economies of scale and growth in the highly competitive logistics industry. 
The acquisition also marks the company's expansion into the North American market. This move comes at a time when the world's supply chains have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated demand for logistics services and prompted companies to rethink their supply chain strategies.
Baltrans, which was founded in 1986, provides air, sea, and land cargo services in Asia, including China and Japan, as well as Europe. The company is now looking to expand its services to North America. The acquisition, which follows the company's recent investment in automation, is part of its efforts to improve its service quality and delivery speed.
The acquisition of a competitor will help Baltrans compete with established global logistics players such as DHL, FedEx, and UPS. Baltrans’ focus on providing customer-centric solutions will be further strengthened by this acquisition.
The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval, and the company expects to complete the transaction in the coming months. With the acquisition, the company is well-positioned to increase its market share and continue providing high-quality service to its customers.
