Polar Air Cargo, one of the world's leading air cargo carriers, has announced that it will expand its services to five major cities in Asia and the Middle East. The announcement was made by Jack Kane, Executive Vice President of Polar Air Cargo, on Monday.
Beginning in October, Polar Air Cargo will expand its services to New Delhi, Dubai, Bangkok, Kansai, and Manila. The new routes will provide customers with greater access to key markets in the region, and will help to meet the growing demand for air cargo services in these areas.
"Expanding our services to these key markets in Asia and the Middle East underscores our commitment to providing our customers with the best possible air cargo solutions," said Jack Kane. "These new routes will enable us to provide faster and more efficient service to our customers, and will help to support the growth of international trade and commerce in the region."
The new services will be operated using Polar Air Cargo's fleet of Boeing 747-400F aircraft, which are widely regarded as some of the most advanced and reliable cargo carriers in the industry. The aircraft will be equipped with state-of-the-art cargo handling technology, allowing for quick and efficient handling of all types of cargo, including perishable goods, pharmaceuticals, and high-value items.
"We are confident that these new services will provide our customers with the highest levels of reliability, speed, and flexibility," said Kane. "We pride ourselves on our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers, and these new routes are a testament to our commitment to providing world-class air cargo services."
The expansion of Polar Air Cargo's services to Asia and the Middle East comes at a time when demand for air cargo services is on the rise across the region. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air cargo volumes in Asia-Pacific increased by 9.2% in July 2021, compared to the same period last year.
