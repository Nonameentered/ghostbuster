In response to the rapidly growing demand for express cargo services throughout Asia, Japan Airlines (JAL) has recently expanded its already popular "J Speed" service. The airline's new offerings will now provide clients with a more comprehensive range of options for their needs, including faster and more reliable shipping methods.
JAL began offering J Speed in 2010, with the emphasis on expedited cargo service primarily between Japan and other parts of Asia. Now, after more than a decade of continuous growth, the service has been expanded to cover several other regions throughout the Asia-Pacific.
This move by JAL was fueled by the global pandemic that has caused a significant surge in e-commerce and technology-related shipments. The company aims to take advantage of the demand in this market by enhancing its express cargo transportation capabilities and enabling businesses to ship their products across the continent faster.
The JAL express cargo service offers three priority options: J Speed Priority Service, J Speed Airlines’ Highway Service, and J Speed Airlines’ Network Flight Service. These services will provide customers with a full range of quick and affordable options, depending on their specific needs and the nature of their shipment.
The J Speed Priority Service allows customers to send urgent shipments quickly and accurately within a specified time frame. The service offers same-day and next-day delivery options, ensuring that customers' goods reach their intended destination without delay.
Meanwhile, the J Speed Airlines' Highway Service is designed for customers who wish to ship their cargo by land transportation. The service operates daily with a dedicated cold chain warehouse, offering both temperature-controlled and unmanaged cargo options.
Lastly, the J Speed Airlines' Network Flight Service expands JAL's network beyond Japan, opening up the carrier's vast network of more than 60 global destinations to customers throughout Asia. This service uses JAL's international cargo flights, connecting Asia to other parts of the world.
The broad range of options provided by JAL's J Speed service should help customers navigate the growing demand for fast and reliable cargo transportation services throughout Asia. It is also a meaningful step in cultivating a sustainable and efficient logistics chain for years to come.
JAL's goal is to provide customers with the most efficient and cost-effective shipping options, enabling businesses to grow and expand in rapidly changing markets. With these new offerings, the airline hopes to solidify its position as a leading provider of express cargo services throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
