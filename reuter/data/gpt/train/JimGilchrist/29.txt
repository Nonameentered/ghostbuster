Seoul, South Korea - Korean Air, the national flag carrier of South Korea, has reported an increase of 8.4% in cargo weight on its domestic and international flights in July. According to the airline, the total cargo weight carried in July was 201,839 tons, compared to 186,107 tons in the same month last year.
The airline's cargo business has been performing well despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely impacted the aviation industry. The increase in cargo weight can be attributed to the strong demand for medical supplies, e-commerce products, and other essential goods.
Korean Air has been operating cargo flights to transport medical supplies and other essential goods to the countries worst affected by the pandemic, including the US, Europe, and Asia. The airline has also been using its passenger aircraft to transport cargo to meet the growing demand.
Korean Air has been actively diversifying its cargo business to cope with the pandemic's impact on the aviation industry. The airline has been focusing on transporting cargo using its freighters, bellyhold space on passenger flights, and charter flights to meet the growing demand for transportation of essential goods.
According to Korean Air, its domestic cargo business also saw a significant increase in July. The airline's cargo weight carried on domestic flights increased by 26% compared to the same period last year. The growth can be attributed to the increased demand for e-commerce products due to the pandemic and the surge in the number of people working from home.
To meet the growing demand, Korean Air plans to increase its cargo capacity by converting some of its passenger aircraft into freighters. The airline will be using its Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft for freighter operations. In addition, Korean Air has joined hands with low-cost carrier Jin Air to expand its domestic cargo business by using Jin Air's Boeing 777-200ER freighter.
Korean Air's cargo business has been generating a significant portion of the airline's revenue in recent months. The airline's cargo revenue has been helping the airline to offset the losses incurred from its passenger operations, which have been severely impacted by the pandemic.
The airline plans to continue expanding its cargo business to stay afloat during these difficult times. Korean Air's CEO, Keehong Woo, said, "We will continue to diversify our cargo business and strengthen our freighter operations to meet the growing demand for transportation of medical supplies, e-commerce products, and other essential goods."
The Korean Air CEO also expressed optimism about the future of the airline's cargo business. He said, "The pandemic has transformed the aviation industry, and we believe that the demand for cargo transportation will continue to grow. We plan to invest in our cargo operations and use our expertise to become a leader in the cargo market."
The increased demand for air cargo transportation during the pandemic has led to a surge in global demand for air freight services. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air cargo demand increased by 9.4% in June compared to the same period last year. The increase was led by the demand for medical supplies and e-commerce products.
In conclusion, Korean Air has reported a significant increase in its cargo business in July, despite the pandemic's impact on the aviation industry. The airline's domestic and international cargo business has seen a surge in demand for medical supplies, e-commerce products, and other essential goods, leading to an increase in cargo weight.
