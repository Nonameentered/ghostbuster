Hong Kong, China - Cathay Pacific Chairman, Patrick Healy, called for competitively priced landing fees at the Chek Lap Kok airport in a recent interview with local media outlets. He urged the airport to take a competitive stance amid the current economic challenges. 
During the interview, Healy explained that the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically reduced air travel demand. This has presented significant financial challenges for global airlines, including Cathay Pacific. The airline's recent financial reports revealed a loss of HKD 8.7 billion in the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic's impacts. 
Healy argued that the current landing fees at the Chek Lap Kok airport need to be adjusted to alleviate the financial burden on airlines. He expressed the importance of reducing these fees to sustain the airline industry's viability. 
Healy further emphasized that the Hong Kong International Airport is among the most expensive airports in the world in terms of landing fees. The current fees are approximately four times that of airports located in neighboring regions. Healy suggested that airport officials should align Hong Kong's fees with competitive airport fees worldwide. 
The Cathay Pacific Chairman pointed out that the reduction in landing fees would create a positive impact on travelers as well. It would allow airlines to offer lower ticket prices to consumers, contributing to an increase in air travel demand. 
In conclusion, Patrick Healy's call for competitively priced landing fees at the Chek Lap Kok airport is a significant demand for the airline community and travelers. The Hong Kong International Airport officials must consider the impact of higher landing fees on airlines enduring hard times financially. By reducing these landing fees, airlines can offer lower ticket prices, spurring air travel demand and supporting Hong Kong's economy.
