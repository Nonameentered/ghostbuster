Air China has announced its intention to revive flights between Beijing and Los Angeles in 2022 after a prolonged pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Beijing-based airline stated that passenger demand for travel between China and the United States has increased in recent months, necessitating the resumption of its services.
Air China last operated the route between the two locations in March 2020 before suspending it due to the global coronavirus pandemic's effect on air travel demand. International travel halted worldwide, and airlines were left scrambling to survive financially. However, with the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine globally, passenger numbers have returned, with some even surpassing the pre-pandemic levels. To meet this demand in the future, Air China has decided to restart its flights to Los Angeles and meet the growing demand for greater connectivity between the two countries.
The decision to bring back the Beijing to Los Angeles route comes when the United States and China are attempting to revamp their connection since the trade war and the pandemic dampened diplomatic relations. This would be regarded as another symbol of the start of a new era between China and the United States, with hopes of improving the relationships and cooperation in various aspects.
According to sources, Air China is expected to run multiple flights each week between the two destinations onboard a Boeing 777-300ER aircraft from 1st January 2022. Air China's resumption of flights to Los Angeles is a much-awaited positive sign for the aviation industry worldwide, and it will be interesting to see the airline's prospects in the wake of the pandemic.
