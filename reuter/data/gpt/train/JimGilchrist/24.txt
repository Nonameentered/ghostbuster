DHL Worldwide Express has recently announced huge expansion plans in China, with the addition of 14 new offices and 600 staff in the next three years. This move is part of their strategy to increase their presence in the country and win 10% of all sales in Asia by 2000. 
The 14 new offices will be spread across major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Chengdu. These locations will provide DHL with increased coverage and access to major business hubs in China. The company will also aim to develop its ecommerce services in the region, which has seen rapid growth in recent years.
DHL Worldwide Express CEO, John Pearson stated that the company’s expansion plans are fuelled by the growth potential in China and the wider Asia region. He said, “The ecommerce market is booming in Asia, and this presents a huge opportunity for us. Our expansion plans in China will allow us to provide faster, more efficient and more reliable services to our customers.”
According to Pearson, the company’s goal is to offer same-day delivery services in major Chinese cities within the next three years. This will be achieved through technology-driven solutions including digital tracking and automated warehouses.
China’s ecommerce market has grown exponentially in the past decade, resulting in a highly competitive logistics and delivery services sector. DHL is therefore investing heavily in innovative solutions to gain a competitive edge in this market.
The company recently launched an automated parcel sortation system in Shenzhen, capable of sorting up to 25,000 parcels every hour. It also launched a pilot project for drone delivery services in Guangzhou earlier this year.
Furthermore, DHL’s expansion plans in China will also contribute to the country’s economic growth, as it will create job opportunities and boost trade.
The company has been operating in China for over 30 years, with a current workforce of 4,000 employees and 800 service points nationwide. Its latest expansion signals a continued commitment to providing world-class logistics solutions to businesses in China and the wider Asia region.
In conclusion, DHL Worldwide Express’ expansion plans in China demonstrate the company’s long-term commitment to growing its presence in the country and boosting economic growth through technology-driven solutions. The added jobs and trade opportunities will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the China economy, while the services provided by DHL will benefit businesses and consumers alike.
