China Southern Airlines is about to commence its first European service to Amsterdam. The new route is scheduled to begin operations on June 21 and will be operated three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays using the airline’s Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, which can accommodate up to 228 passengers.
This new service will link one of China Southern’s hubs in Guangzhou with Amsterdam, a leading European destination for both business and leisure travelers. It is expected to facilitate greater connectivity between China and the Netherlands and improve economic ties between the two countries.
The airline has expressed its excitement at adding Amsterdam to its network, and believes the new service represents a significant milestone for the entire company. “We are thrilled to launch our first European service to Amsterdam,” said a spokesperson for China Southern Airlines. “We believe that this new route will help strengthen China’s trade and tourism industries with Europe, while also enhancing our customers’ travel experiences.”
Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is also looking forward to the arrival of China Southern Airlines’ Dreamliner. The airport’s chief commercial officer, Andre van den Berg, commented: “We are pleased to see China Southern Airlines add Amsterdam to its network with this new direct service. The link will provide passengers with additional travel options between the Netherlands and Southern China, one of the world’s most important economic regions.”
As China Southern Airlines takes off on its first ever European service, it is expected to attract many Chinese and international tourists to the Netherlands. With more direct flight options in recent years, the Dutch tourism industry has grown steadily, with Amsterdam alone attracting 17.5 million visitors in 2019. The new service is expected to further promote international tourism and economic cooperation between the two countries.
