British Airways World Cargo has announced the addition of a fourth weekly freighter between Hong Kong and London, in a move that is set to boost cargo capacity and strengthen the airline's presence in the global logistics market.
The new freighter service is aimed at meeting the increasing demand for air cargo transportation between the UK and Hong Kong, as the two countries continue to maintain strong economic ties. Hong Kong is a major trading hub in Asia for UK businesses, and the new service will offer shippers more options and flexibility to transport their goods between the two regions.
According to British Airways World Cargo, the new freighter service will commence from September 2021, using a Boeing 747-8F aircraft with a cargo capacity of up to 135 tonnes. The airline already operates three weekly freighter services between Hong Kong and London, and this fourth service will bring the total cargo capacity to over 500 tonnes per week.
“We are delighted to be able to offer our customers yet another option for their cargo transportation needs between Hong Kong and London,” said Lynne Embleton, CEO of British Airways. “Our fourth weekly freighter service will not only provide added convenience for shippers but also demonstrate our commitment to meeting the needs of our customers in key markets around the world.”
The addition of the fourth weekly freighter service is also seen as a sign of British Airways World Cargo's confidence in the recovery of the air cargo sector, which has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenges faced by the industry in the past year, air cargo demand has remained strong, driven by the rapid growth of e-commerce and the urgent need to transport medical supplies and vaccines.
British Airways World Cargo operates a fleet of Boeing 747-8F and 777F aircraft, serving 15 destinations worldwide. The airline is part of IAG Cargo, the cargo division of International Airlines Group, which also includes carriers such as Aer Lingus, Iberia, and Vueling.
