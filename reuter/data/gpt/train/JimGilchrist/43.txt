The Hong Kong Shippers' Council is calling on the government to outlaw illegal fuel surcharges imposed by airlines on cargo rates. The council argues that these surcharges, which are often added without proper explanation or justification, are causing undue harm to the local shipping industry and need to be put to an end.
The council, which represents more than 800 companies involved in the shipping industry, has been tracking the issue for some time. Members have reported that airlines are imposing fuel surcharges based on inaccurate or outdated data, and that these charges are having a negative impact on their business. With many shipping companies already struggling under the weight of the COVID-19 pandemic, the additional financial burden is proving too much to bear.
"The government needs to recognize that these illegal fuel surcharges are doing significant harm to the shipping industry," said James Ng, Chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council. "We need to see stronger action taken to protect the interests of our members and ensure that they are not being unfairly targeted by airlines looking to increase their profits."
The council is proposing that the government take a number of steps to address the issue. These include working with airlines to establish more transparent and accurate data for calculating fuel surcharges, imposing fines on airlines that impose illegal surcharges, and simplifying the process for disputing these charges when they do occur.
In addition to these measures, the council is also urging the government to promote greater competition in the airline industry, to help reduce the likelihood of airlines engaging in anti-competitive practices. By taking these steps, the council believes that the government can help to protect the interests of Hong Kong's shipping industry and ensure that it remains a competitive force in the global marketplace.
