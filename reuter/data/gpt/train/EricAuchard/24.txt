Iomega Corp. to Revolutionize Electronic Devices with new Reusable Data Storage System, "N-Hand"
Iomega Corp. has announced the launch of a new reusable data storage system named "N-Hand". The technology is set to revolutionize electronic devices, especially for those who are in need of storing and transferring large data in a faster and more secure way.
According to Iomega, the "N-Hand" technology is a long-awaited solution for tech enthusiasts who are frustrated with traditional storage devices. With "N-Hand," users can store and transfer up to 50GB data within minutes, all in a compact digital device that could fit in the palm of their hands. The key feature of "N-Hand" is that it's a reusable data storage device, meaning you can save and overwrite the data multiple times before the device gets degraded.
Iomega claims that "N-Hand" is an eco-friendly storage solution as it reduces electronic waste and is more cost-effective than traditional storage methods. Moreover, the device is much faster and secure than cloud data storage, which requires an internet connection and can be susceptible to hacking.
The company also emphasized the importance of data privacy and security. "N-Hand" uses advanced encryption protocols that protect the data from unauthorized access, making it suitable for individuals and businesses who need to store confidential and sensitive information.
Speaking at the launch event, Iomega CEO, Tim Smith, said, "N-Hand is a game-changer. It's the future of data storage. We developed N-Hand with the aim of providing an efficient, secure, and eco-friendly solution for people and businesses who need to store, back up and transfer data quickly and effectively."
The new technology is expected to attract numerous industries such as film and media production, data centers, and the financial sector, where there is a growing need for larger and faster data storage solutions.
"I can see N-Hand being utilised in many different industries such as film and media production where the large files are essential, data centers which require high capacity and secure storage solutions, as well as financial sectors when security is paramount," added Smith.
The "N-Hand" device comes with an in-built software that enables automatic synchronization with multiple devices, making it easy to transfer data between different platforms.
Iomega Corp. has been in the data storage industry for over 35 years, and their products are widely used by individuals, businesses, and government institutions worldwide. The release of "N-Hand" cements the company's position as a leading data storage provider and a champion of green technology.
The "N-Hand" devices are available for pre-orders on the company's website and will be shipped to customers worldwide later this year. The price of the device starts from $199, depending on storage capacity. 
The introduction of "N-Hand" is seen as a significant move towards a more sustainable and secure future for data storage. With the ever-growing demand for data storage, the device has the potential to become an essential tool for anyone who handles large quantities of data. It's a testament to Iomega's commitment to making a positive impact on both the environment and the tech industry.
