Kansas City, Missouri – H&R Block, the American tax preparation company, announced on Monday that it will not go ahead with its planned spin-off of its online services division CompuServe, until further notice. The company also allayed investor fears, stating that it still expects to achieve its full-year earnings forecast.
H&R Block originally announced plans to spin off CompuServe in June of last year, with the aim of allowing the unit to operate as an independent entity. However, in November, the company revealed that it would delay the spin-off until 2016. Now, H&R Block has decided to postpone the spin-off even further.
Shares in the company fell 6.8 percent by 0850 ET, despite the earnings assurance, but H&R Block justified the move by stating that the company wished to focus fully on its core tax preparation business.
Chief Executive Officer, Bill Cobb, said in a statement: “While we believe in the strategic rationale of separating H&R Block from CompuServe, our focus in recent months has been on growing and improving our core tax business.”
Cobb added: “As a result, we have a number of initiatives underway that we believe will improve performance and position H&R Block for long-term success. We have therefore decided to postpone the spin-off until we are in a better position to execute it more in line with our long-term strategy.”
Investors had been worried that the postponement of the spin-off could have an adverse effect on H&R Block’s earnings, since the company had been counting on the proceeds from the sale to help finance its tax preparation business. However, H&R Block has provided assurance that the earnings impact, if any, will be negligible.
“We are committed to achieving our full-year outlook, and today’s announcement does not change that,” said Cobb.
H&R Block’s CompuServe unit provides online tax preparation software and services to consumers and small businesses. Last year, the unit brought in $135 million in revenue, a drop of 10.3 percent from the previous year. The division also reported a loss of $33.6 million, compared with a loss of $21.4 million in 2014.
Analysts had predicted that the spin-off of CompuServe would create greater value for shareholders, but also allowed the company to focus more fully on its core business. H&R Block is the largest tax preparation company in the US, and also operates in Canada and Australia.
Since the announcement of its earnings guidance last June, H&R Block has underperformed against analysts’ expectations. The company’s shares have fallen nearly 30 percent over the past 12 months, compared to a rise of 8 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
In response to the news, shares in H&R Block fell 6.8 percent to $20.21 in early morning trading. Nevertheless, analysts believe that the company made the right decision in postponing the spin-off of CompuServe, since the unit’s financials are not strong enough at present to justify a separate listing.
“While it is disappointing that H&R Block will not be able to spin off CompuServe as planned, it appears that the company’s management is making the right decision to focus on its core business,” said Timothy Bremer, an analyst at William Blair.
Bremer added: “Given the recent performance of CompuServe, it appears that there are still significant challenges that need to be overcome before the unit is profitable enough to stand on its own.”
In the meantime, H&R Block will continue to focus on its tax preparation business, and plans to introduce new services and improve existing ones in order to increase revenue and profitability.
“We are confident that our ongoing initiatives will enable us to create long-term value for our shareholders, and we remain committed to achieving our full-year outlook,” said Cobb.
