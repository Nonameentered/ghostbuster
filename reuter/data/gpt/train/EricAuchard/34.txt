CompuServe, the pioneering online service provider, has announced the discontinuation of its popular consumer-oriented Wow! service. The move is part of the company's strategic shift towards international markets and professional users, which have been identified as the most promising growth areas.
In an official statement released on Monday, CompuServe CEO Bill Melton said that the decision to discontinue Wow! was a difficult one but necessary for the company to remain competitive and focused on its core strengths.
"Over the past few years, we have observed a significant shift in the online landscape, with the rise of social media and mobile applications that cater to consumers' growing digital needs," Melton said. "While we are proud of the Wow! service and its loyal user base, we have concluded that we can no longer sustain it as a standalone offering."
Wow! was launched in 2010 as a social networking platform that aimed to provide a safe and family-friendly environment for users to connect and share content. The service offered a range of features, including profiles, blogs, forums, and chat rooms, as well as games, music, and video content. Wow! was popular among families with young children, who appreciated its strict moderation policies and absence of offensive content.
However, Wow! faced stiff competition from other social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, which offered similar features and a more extensive user base. In recent years, the number of active Wow! users has declined, and the company struggled to generate sufficient revenue from the service.
Melton said that CompuServe would work closely with Wow! users to ensure a smooth transition to alternative platforms. "We understand that some Wow! users may be disappointed by this news, and we want to assure them that we will make every effort to support them in finding new online communities that meet their needs," he said.
CompuServe's decision to shift its focus to international markets and professional users comes as no surprise to industry observers, who had noted the company's recent investments in these areas. Over the past year, CompuServe has expanded its presence in Latin America, Asia, and Europe, partnering with local telecommunications providers to offer a range of online services. The company has also developed new products and services aimed at small and medium-sized businesses, such as cloud storage, web hosting, and e-commerce solutions.
"We believe that international markets and professional users hold tremendous potential for growth and innovation," Melton said. "By focusing on these areas, we can leverage our expertise and resources to create value for our customers and shareholders."
CompuServe's shift towards international markets and professional users is part of a broader trend in the tech industry, which has seen many companies reposition themselves in response to changing market conditions. As consumers' digital habits and preferences evolve, companies have had to adapt their strategies and offerings to stay relevant and competitive.
In the case of CompuServe, the company's decision to discontinue Wow! and focus on international markets and professional users may prove to be a smart move. With its long-standing reputation as a reliable and secure online service provider, CompuServe has a strong foundation on which to build its new business models. By capitalizing on the global demand for digital services and targeting specialized markets, CompuServe could carve out a niche for itself in the highly competitive tech industry.
Overall, while the discontinuation of Wow! may be a blow to some CompuServe users, it represents a strategic pivot for the company that could lead to new opportunities and growth. Only time will tell if CompuServe's new direction proves successful, but the company's willingness to adapt and evolve suggests that it is well-positioned for the digital future.
