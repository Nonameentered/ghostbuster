Cupertino, California â€“ Apple Inc. shares took a nosedive on Wednesday, shedding nearly a fifth of their value after the tech giant reported disappointing quarterly results and issued a gloomy outlook for the future. The company's stock price plummeted 17% during trading hours, extending Apple's recent decline from its all-time high of $145 in early May.
The company reported profits of $8.8 billion for the quarter, a decline of 22% from the same period last year, due to a dip in iPhone sales and weaker demand for its other products. Revenue came in at $45.4 billion, compared with $53.3 billion last year, surprising investors who had been betting on a robust figure.
The sharp drop in iPhone sales, which fell 21% to 31.2 million units, was one of the reasons for the disappointing results. Apple's once-dominant position in the smartphone market has been challenged by South Korean rival Samsung and other Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper alternatives. The company is also facing stiff competition from Google's Android platform, which is becoming increasingly popular among users around the world.
Other products, such as the iPad, Mac computers, and the Apple Watch, also failed to boost the company's fortunes. Sales of iPads fell 20% to 9.9 million units, while Mac sales decreased by 13% to 4.3 million units. Only the services sector, which included offerings such as Apple Music, the App Store, and iCloud, showed an increase of 15% to $9.5 billion.
Commenting on the quarterly report, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was facing "difficult external conditions" and that the iPhone 7, which is due to be launched later this year, would feature "compelling features" to address the decline in sales. Cook also highlighted the company's strong cash reserves of over $200 billion and its commitment to invest in research and development.
However, the outlook provided by the company for the next quarter did little to inspire confidence. Apple expects revenue in the range of $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion, lower than the Wall Street consensus of $49.2 billion. The company also warned that its gross margin, a key measure of profitability, would be between 37.5% and 38%, compared with 39.4% last year.
Analysts were quick to react to the disappointing results, downgrading their ratings and reducing their price targets for Apple shares. Many questioned whether the company's reign as a dominant player in the technology industry was coming to an end.
"Apple is losing its mojo in its core market," said Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino. "The company needs to come up with a new breakthrough product to reignite growth and revive investor confidence."
The plummeting share price also had an impact on other technology stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite Index, which includes many other leading tech companies, falling by almost 2%.
The slump in Apple's fortunes comes at a time when many technology companies are struggling to maintain their dominance, as demand for smartphones and other gadgets slows and competition heats up. However, industry experts believe that Apple's strong cash position and its reputation for innovation suggest that the company still has the potential to bounce back.
"Apple is not going to go away anytime soon, but it does face some tough challenges ahead," said Ben Wood, an analyst at research firm CCS Insight. "It needs to demonstrate that it can still capture the imagination of consumers and create products that are ahead of the curve, rather than simply playing catch-up with rivals."
