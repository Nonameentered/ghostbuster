CompuServe, one of the pioneers in the online services industry, has announced that they will be disbanding their Wow! online service. The company is shifting its focus towards business customers and the international market. The decision comes at a time when the online services industry is rapidly evolving, with increased competition and changing customer needs.
CompuServe has been a major player in the online services industry since their launch in the 1980s. They were one of the first companies to offer online services, with their dial-up network providing users with access to email, message boards, and other online services. Their early success was built on their ability to cater to a broad range of customers, including both individuals and businesses.
However, in recent years, the industry has seen significant changes. A shift towards mobile devices and web-based services has created new opportunities and challenges for online service providers. This has resulted in increased competition, with companies such as AOL, MSN, and Yahoo! offering similar services to CompuServe.
As a result of these changes, CompuServe has decided to disband their Wow! online service. While Wow! was a popular service, it was seen as redundant in light of the company's other offerings. Instead, CompuServe will be focusing on their business customers and the international market.
The company's decision to shift their focus towards business customers comes at a time when many businesses are looking for online services to help them streamline their operations. CompuServe's experience in providing online services to businesses puts them in a strong position to take advantage of this opportunity.
In addition, the international market represents another significant opportunity for CompuServe. As more people around the world gain access to the internet, there is a growing demand for online services in countries outside of the United States. CompuServe has the resources and expertise to take advantage of this trend and become a significant player in the global online services market.
Commenting on the company's decision, CompuServe CEO Alice Knapp said, "We've been in the online services industry for a long time, and we know that the industry is always changing. We believe that by focusing on our business customers and the international market, we can better serve our customers and remain competitive in a rapidly evolving industry."
Knapp also noted that the company's decision to disband Wow! was a difficult one, as the service had a loyal following. However, she emphasized that the move was necessary to ensure the company's long-term success.
CompuServe's decision to shift their focus towards business customers and international markets is a bold move that reflects the changing nature of the online services industry. As competition increases and customer needs evolve, companies like CompuServe need to be willing to adapt and innovate in order to remain successful. By focusing on their core strengths, CompuServe is positioning itself for success in the years to come.
