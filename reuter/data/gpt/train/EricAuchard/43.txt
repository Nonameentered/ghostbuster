Flextronics International Ltd., a Singapore-based electronics manufacturing services company, is expecting a significant growth in revenues in the fiscal year 1998. The company's CEO, Michael Marks, announced on Wednesday that he expects the company's revenues to more than double in fiscal 1998, resulting in revenue growth of over 100 percent.
"We anticipate that our revenues will reach $3 billion in fiscal 1998, up from $1.4 billion in the previous year," Marks said. "We have hit the sweet spot in the global trend towards outsourcing electronic product manufacturing as companies look to reduce time-to-market, lower costs and gain access to world-class design expertise."
Flextronics International offers a full range of electronic manufacturing services, including design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly, and testing. Its customers include many of the world's leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the computer, telecommunications, industrial and medical industries.
Marks attributes the company's growth to its success in winning new contracts and retaining existing ones, as well as its ability to provide innovative solutions that meet the changing needs of its customers.
"Flextronics is well-positioned in the market, both in terms of our operational capabilities and our ability to provide comprehensive and cost-effective solutions for our customers," Marks said. "Our strong partnerships with our customers, our long-term relationships with key suppliers, and our continued investment in research and development, have all contributed to our success."
Flextronics has been steadily expanding its operations and capabilities over the past few years. It has established new manufacturing plants in China, Malaysia, and other countries in Asia, as well as in Mexico and Hungary. It has also invested heavily in research and development, extending its engineering capabilities to include product design and development. In addition, the company has made several strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of Dii Group, a prominent European-based EMS provider, in 1997.
"The expansion of our operations and capabilities has been driven by our desire to offer our customers a complete range of services that meet their needs, wherever they are located," Marks said. "We are committed to providing the highest levels of service and quality, and we will continue to invest in our people, processes, and technology to achieve this."
Flextronics' strong growth projections come at a time when the electronics manufacturing services industry is experiencing significant growth and consolidation. According to industry analysts, the EMS market is expected to grow by 25-30 percent annually, and the top 10 EMS providers are expected to capture over 50 percent of the market share.
"Flextronics is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity and to continue to grow and innovate in the EMS market," Marks said. "We are confident that our strong partnerships with our customers, our focus on operational excellence, and our commitment to continuous improvement and innovation, will enable us to achieve our growth objectives and to deliver superior value to our stakeholders."
