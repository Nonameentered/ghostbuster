The shares of General Electric Co. rose 3% on Monday after Chairman John Welch made upbeat comments in a CNN interview. The stock price has been under pressure since the company's recent earnings report, which showed disappointing results for the first quarter. But, investors were heartened by the statement from Welch, who said the company was considering a dividend increase and a share buyback program.
"We have a strong balance sheet and a lot of cash on hand. We are considering various options to return value to shareholders, and a dividend increase and a share buyback program are two of those options," said Welch in the interview. "We are also looking at other possibilities, such as acquisitions and divestitures. But, our focus is on executing on our strategic priorities and delivering value to our customers and shareholders."
The news was met with enthusiasm by investors and analysts, who had been concerned about the company's ability to generate cash flow. General Electric has been struggling with weak demand in some of its core businesses, including power and aviation, and has been restructuring its operations to improve margins and efficiency.
The company had earlier flagged that it would prioritize cash preservation, and had suspended its dividend last year to shore up its balance sheet. However, the recent comments from Welch suggest that the company is getting more confident about its cash position, and is considering ways to reward shareholders.
"Investors are clearly excited about the possibility of a dividend increase and share buyback program," said Michael Bernasconi, an analyst with investment bank Citigroup. "General Electric has a loyal shareholder base, and these investors have been waiting for signs that the company is turning a corner. If the company can demonstrate that it is generating cash flow, it will go a long way in building investor confidence."
Bernasconi added that the company's move towards focusing on core businesses and improving operational efficiency was the right strategy. "General Electric is a good company with a strong brand and a long history of innovation. However, it has been underperforming in recent years, and needs to simplify its operations and focus on its core strengths. If it can do that, it will be in a good position to deliver value to shareholders."
The company is set to report its second-quarter results later this month. Analysts are expecting the results to show an improvement over the first quarter, as the company benefits from cost savings and restructuring efforts. However, the outlook for the rest of the year remains uncertain, given the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy.
"General Electric is facing headwinds, like many other companies, from the pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown," said Bernasconi. "However, the company has been proactive in taking steps to manage its business, and if it can weather this storm, it will emerge as a stronger and more resilient company."
The shares of General Electric closed at $10.31 on Monday, up 3.60% from the previous day's close. The stock has been underperforming the broader market in recent years, but the recent comments from Welch have renewed investor interest in the company's prospects.
