Texas Instruments (TI) has announced that it will receive royalty payments of over $1 billion from Samsung Electronics, one of the biggest technology companies in the world. The exact amount of the payment has not been disclosed, but sources say that it is related to the use of TI's wireless technologies in Samsung's smartphones and tablets.
While the payment marks a significant achievement for TI, industry analysts say that the terms of the agreement are less generous than those reached in 1995, when the two companies first signed a royalty agreement. At the time, TI received a $1.5 billion payment from Samsung to license its digital signal processing technology.
TI has been a leader in the semiconductor industry for several decades, and its contributions to wireless technology have been particularly significant. The company currently holds thousands of patents related to wireless communication, and it has licensed its technology to numerous companies in the technology sector.
While the terms of the agreement may be less generous than those in the past, the payment is still a significant win for TI, which has been dealing with increased competition and declining revenues in recent years. The company says that it plans to use the funds to invest in new technology and continued innovation.
