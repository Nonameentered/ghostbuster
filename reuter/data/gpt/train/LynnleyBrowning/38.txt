MOSCOW, Russia - Russian aluminium smelters are exploring the possibility of consolidating their operations in a bid to rationalize costs, an industry official said on Wednesday. The move follows the Russian government's plans to restructure the country's aluminium industry and bring down production costs amid "perplexing" world prices.
According to Alexei Goncharov, the head of Russian aluminum producers' union, RusAL, the industry is going through a chaotic period due to volatile world prices. The aluminium industry has been hit hard by global trade tensions, which has led to an oversupply of aluminium in the market. The industry has also been grappling with high production costs and falling demand for the metal.
"Global aluminium prices have been very volatile, creating problems for the industry. Aluminium producers in Russia are operating in a very difficult environment, and we believe that it is necessary to consolidate our operations to rationalize costs," Goncharov said in a statement.
Goncharov said that RusAL is in talks with other Russian aluminium companies to explore the possibility of consolidation. He did not provide details on which companies are involved in the discussions.
"We are currently in discussions with other Russian aluminium companies to see if there is any possibility of consolidation. We believe that such a move would help us improve operational efficiency and reduce costs," Goncharov said.
Russia is one of the world's largest producers of aluminium, with production accounting for around six percent of the country's total exports. The country's aluminium industry is mainly dominated by RusAL, which is the world's second-largest aluminium producer. Other major players in the industry include UC Rusal, Russian Copper Company, and Novolipetsk Steel.
Despite being a major producer of aluminium, the Russian industry has been struggling in recent years due to high production costs and falling demand. The industry has also been hit hard by global trade tensions, which have led to an oversupply of the metal in the market.
Industry experts say that consolidation could help the Russian aluminium industry improve its competitiveness and bring down production costs. However, they added that any move toward consolidation would be a complex process and would require support from the Russian government.
"There is no doubt that consolidation could help the industry improve its efficiency and reduce costs. However, it is a complex process that requires support from the government. The Russian government has been taking steps to restructure the industry and bring down production costs, and we hope that they will continue to support the industry in the future," said an industry expert.
The Russian government has been planning to restructure the country's aluminium industry for some time now. In 2018, the government launched a plan to bring down production costs and increase efficiency in the industry. The plan involves the creation of a national aluminium champion that would involve the consolidation of various companies in the industry.
However, the plan has faced criticism from some quarters, with some experts arguing that consolidation could lead to a monopoly in the industry. They have also warned that consolidation could lead to layoffs and job losses in the industry.
Despite the challenges, industry experts remain optimistic about the future of the Russian aluminium industry. They believe that consolidation could help the industry weather the current difficult environment and emerge stronger in the future.
