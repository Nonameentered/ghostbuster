Russian oil giant, Rosneft, has announced that it will appeal against the decision by local officials to award Exxon Mobil the contract to develop oilfields in the Arctic. The dispute between the two companies centers around who is best qualified to produce oil in the harsh and unforgiving environment of the Arctic.
According to Rosneft, the decision to award the contract to Exxon was based on political considerations, not on the ability to extract oil economically and safely. The company claims that it has extensive experience in developing oilfields in the Arctic, and that it is best placed to produce oil in the region.
"Our technical expertise and experience in the Arctic is second to none," said a spokesperson for Rosneft. "We have been producing oil in the region for more than 25 years, and we have a deep understanding of the geology and the challenges that are unique to the Arctic."
Rosneft also claims that its track record in the Arctic is superior to that of Exxon. The company has successfully developed the Prirazlomnoye oil field in the Pechora Sea, which is the first offshore Arctic oilfield in the world to produce oil. Rosneft also has long-standing partnerships with other leading oil companies, including BP and Eni.
Exxon, on the other hand, has never produced oil in the Arctic, although it has been exploring the region for many years. The company won the contract to develop the oilfields in partnership with Russian state oil company, Gazprom Neft, after an auction held by the local authorities last month.
Exxon has yet to respond to Rosneft's claims, but industry analysts have suggested that the dispute could be a sign of growing tensions between the two companies. Rosneft is a major player in the global oil industry, and it has close ties with the Russian government, while Exxon is one of the largest and most powerful oil companies in the world.
The dispute could also have wider implications for the Arctic oil industry, which is seen by many as a significant opportunity for companies to tap into new sources of oil and gas. However, extracting oil in the Arctic is notoriously difficult and expensive, and there are also concerns about the impact on the fragile Arctic ecosystem.
Both Rosneft and Exxon are keen to develop oilfields in the Arctic, but they may find themselves competing not only with each other, but also with other major oil companies such as Shell and Statoil. The Arctic has huge potential, but it remains to be seen whether any company can successfully extract the oil in a way that is both economically viable and environmentally sustainable.
The decision by Rosneft to appeal against the award of the contract to Exxon is likely to be just the start of a long and complex dispute between the two companies. The outcome of this dispute could have far-reaching consequences for the Arctic oil industry, and also for the wider global energy market.
