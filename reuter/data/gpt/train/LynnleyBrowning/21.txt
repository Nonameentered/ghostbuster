Russia's demand for feed grains to outstrip output, turning the country into an importer
Russia's booming livestock industry is set to turn the country into a net importer of feed grains, as production struggles to keep pace with demand. Increased demand for feed grains is being driven by Russia's rapidly growing poultry and pork sectors, which are expanding at a rate of over 5% per year. This is driving up the country's grain imports, which are expected to reach 30 million tonnes in 2021, up from just 5 million tonnes in 2012.
According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Russia's feed grain production is expected to reach just 44 million tonnes in 2021, a decrease from the previous year's level of 47 million tonnes. The reduction in production is due to lower wheat and corn yields. This is expected to trigger a surge in imports of corn, barley and wheat in 2021/22 marketing year, with Russia becoming a net grain importer for the first time in over a decade.
Delays in planting, coupled with adverse weather conditions, have resulted in lower yields of grains in many regions across Russia. This has also led to an increase in grain prices, with Russian wheat prices hitting a record high in February 2021. This is adding to the cost of feeding livestock, which is likely to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher meat prices.
Russian grain traders are currently scouring the global market for affordable feed grains to meet the country's growing demand. Argentina, Brazil and the United States are among the top suppliers of corn and soybean meal to Russia. The USDA expects Russia's corn imports to reach a record 11.5 million tonnes this year, up from the previous year's level of 9.3 million tonnes. Wheat imports are expected to hit a seven-year high of 8.5 million tonnes, while barley imports are projected to reach a record high of 5.5 million tonnes in 2021/22.
Russia has traditionally been a major exporter of wheat and barley, but its growing appetite for feed grains is rapidly changing the country's dynamics in the global grain market. The shift in trade flows is also raising concerns about the country's food security, as any disruption in global grain supply chains could have a significant impact on its ability to feed its growing population.
The shortage of feed grains in Russia is also likely to have a knock-on effect on the country's meat exports. Russia is one of the world's largest exporters of poultry meat, with shipments reaching a record 1.8 million tonnes in 2020. However, the country's poultry producers are now facing higher feed costs, which could make it harder for them to compete in the global market. This is likely to result in a decrease in poultry exports, which will have a negative impact on the country's economy.
To address the growing demand for feed grains, the Russian government has announced plans to increase its grain production. The government is planning to invest $2.4 billion in the country's agriculture sector over the next three years to boost grain yields. The investment will be used to improve soil fertility, increase irrigation and mechanize farming practices.
The Russian government is also exploring options to improve the country's food security. The government is reportedly considering the creation of strategic grain reserves to ensure a steady supply of food grains in case of any disruptions in global trade. The government is also planning to increase the country's domestic grain storage capacity to reduce dependence on imports.
The growing demand for feed grains is also highlighting the need for more sustainable farming practices. The livestock industry is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and the use of grain in livestock feed contributes to deforestation and other environmental problems. The Russian government is expected to promote sustainable agriculture practices, such as precision farming and improved feed management, to reduce the environmental impact of the livestock industry.
In conclusion, Russia's booming livestock industry is turning the country into a net importer of feed grains. The shortage of feed grains is likely to have a negative impact on the country's meat exports and raise concerns about the country's food security. However, the government's investment in agriculture and exploration of sustainable farming practices is a positive step towards addressing these issues.
