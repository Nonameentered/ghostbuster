Russia, the world's biggest wheat exporter, has been quietly importing grain from the West this year to offset meagre harvests due to poor weather conditions, according to industry sources. However, the country's economic situation means that it is not expected to be a large presence on the world grain market.
The move to import grain has been driven by the poor state of Russia's wheat crops. Unusually cold weather and drought during the growing season have led to below average yields, threatening to reduce the size of the harvest by up to 30%.
According to sources, Russian flour millers have been importing French and German wheat, as well as wheat from the Black Sea region, to ensure that they can meet demand for flour and avoid price hikes.
The Russian government has publicly stated that it does not plan to import grain, but industry insiders suggest that the reality of the situation is that imports have been happening since early this year.
"Imports are not officially allowed, but there is a need for it because of the poor harvest," a source at a Russian grain trading firm told Reuters news agency.
The situation is an unusual one, as Russia is usually a major exporter of grain – particularly wheat, which makes up the majority of the country's grain exports. In the 2019/2020 season, Russia exported a record 34 million tonnes of wheat, up from 31.5 million tonnes the previous year.
However, this year's poor harvest has forced Russia to look elsewhere for grain to meet domestic demand. Despite the imports, however, it is unlikely that Russia will be a major presence on the world grain market this year.
Russia's economic situation means that it is unable to offer prices that can compete with other major grain exporters such as the United States and Canada. The country's currency, the ruble, has lost around 20% of its value against the US dollar this year due to a combination of factors including the coronavirus pandemic and falling oil prices.
This has made imports more expensive for Russian buyers, and has also made it difficult for Russian exporters to compete with other countries. In addition, Russia is facing a number of trade restrictions from other major grain importers, including China and Egypt.
All of these factors mean that Russia is likely to be a smaller player on the world grain market this year, despite its usual status as a major exporter.
"Russia will import grain, but the volumes will not be significant," one trader told Reuters. "The country does not have the financial capacity to import large amounts of grain."
Despite this, there are some positive signs for Russia's agricultural sector. The country's government has launched a number of initiatives to modernize and improve the sector in recent years, including a ten-year plan to increase crop yields and implement new farming techniques.
In addition, Russia's wheat crop is expected to recover next year, with early estimates suggesting that the country could produce up to 78 million tonnes of grain in 2021 – up from around 74 million tonnes this year.
"Next year we will have a better crop, but this year we need to import," said a source at a Russian flour mill. "The situation is unusual, but we are doing what we can to make sure we can meet demand."
Despite these efforts, however, the fact remains that Russia's grain industry is facing significant challenges at present. The country's poor harvest this year – and the need to import grain – is one indication of the struggles facing the sector. Whether Russia can rebound and return to its previous position as a major player on the world grain market remains to be seen.
