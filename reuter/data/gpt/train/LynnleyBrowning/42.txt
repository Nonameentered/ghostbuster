The Russian metals sector is showing a varied response to the news of President Boris Yeltsin's illness. Some companies are showing cautious optimism, while others are expressing concern about the future of the industry.
According to a report by Interfax, the reaction in the metals sector is largely dependent on the company and the type of metal they produce. Companies that produce non-ferrous metals, such as nickel and copper, are showing a more positive outlook, as these metals have seen price increases in recent months.
One company showing optimism is Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium. The company's CEO, Vladimir Potanin, said in an interview with Interfax that he believes the market for nickel will continue to grow, regardless of Yeltsin's illness. He also said that he has confidence in the stability of the Russian government and expects the company's operations to continue without interruption.
However, other companies in the metals sector are expressing concern about the impact Yeltsin's illness could have on the industry. Aleksandr Kashuba, CEO of the steel company Severstal, said in a statement that he is "concerned about the potential impact of the president's health on the country's political stability," which could directly affect the steel industry.
The response of the Russian metals sector to Yeltsin's illness may also vary depending on how long the president is absent from his duties. If Yeltsin's illness is prolonged, it could lead to uncertainty and instability in the government, which could have a negative impact on the entire economy.
Despite this, some experts believe that the Russian metals sector has already weathered a number of challenges in recent years, including economic sanctions by the West. They believe that the industry is resilient enough to withstand any political instability caused by Yeltsin's illness.
Overall, the response of the Russian metals sector to Yeltsin's illness is varied, reflecting the complex nature of the industry and the wider economy. While some companies are showing cautious optimism, others are expressing concern about the future of their operations. Only time will tell how Yeltsin's illness will affect the Russian economy as a whole, and the metals sector in particular.
