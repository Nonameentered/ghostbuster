Russia has announced its readiness to collaborate with De Beers, the world's largest diamond mining and trading company, on an essential diamond market deal. The agreement aims to unlock the potential of diamond deposits in Russia and consolidate the country's position as a leading producer of rough diamonds.
The announcement was made by Sergey Ivanov, the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for Environmental Activities, Ecology, and Transport, during his recent visit to London. Ivanov revealed that the Russian Federal Agency for Subsoil Use (Rosnedra) had already launched a tender for the exploration and development of the Verkhne-Munskoe diamond deposit in the Yakutia region in eastern Russia.
De Beers, which has a long-standing partnership with Russia's diamond producer Alrosa, expressed interest in participating in the tender and collaborating with Russian companies on the Verkhne-Munskoe project. The move is expected to benefit both parties, with Russia gaining access to De Beers' advanced technologies and marketing channels, while De Beers can leverage Russia's massive diamond reserves to maintain its position as a global industry leader.
The collaboration is also expected to address the issue of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), an international initiative aimed at preventing the trade in "conflict diamonds" or rough diamonds that are mined and traded to finance armed conflict against governments. The KPCS, which was established in 2003, requires all diamond-producing countries to meet strict criteria for the production and trade of rough diamonds. The scheme has been a crucial factor in improving the transparency and accountability of the diamond industry.
Russia, which accounts for about a third of the global diamond production, has been an active member of the KPCS since its inception. However, there have been concerns about the lack of transparency in the country's diamond trade and the potential for conflict diamonds to enter the market. The collaboration with De Beers is expected to enhance the compliance of Russia's diamond industry with the KPCS's strict requirements.
"This deal will be a game-changer for both Russia and De Beers. We are confident that our collaboration will unlock the massive potential of Russia's diamond industry and cement our position as a leading diamond producer globally," Ivanov said in a statement. "We are committed to working with De Beers and other stakeholders to ensure that our diamond trade is transparent, responsible, and sustainable."
Meanwhile, De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver welcomed the opportunity to work with Russia on developing its diamond market. "We are pleased to participate in Russia's diamond tender and look forward to collaborating with Russian companies to extract the full value of their diamond deposits," he said. "We are committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in our diamond trade and working with our partners to promote responsible sourcing and sustainable practices."
