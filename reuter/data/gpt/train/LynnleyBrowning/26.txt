The Russian Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, has issued a warning to Norilsk Nickel, the country's leading nickel producer, to pay its overdue taxes.
According to Siluanov, Norilsk Nickel owes approximately 18 billion rubles (around $246 million) in unpaid taxes from 2016 and 2017. The finance minister said that the company had been given sufficient warnings and time to pay the overdue taxes but had failed to take any action.
Siluanov emphasized that this was not acceptable, especially given the current economic climate. The Russian government has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and is actively looking for ways to increase revenue through taxes. The finance minister noted that it was unfair for some companies to shirk their tax obligations while others were faithfully following the rules.
The warning came after the Russian government first issued an order for Norilsk Nickel to pay the overdue taxes back in December of 2020. At that time, the company was given a deadline of January 1, 2021, to pay the outstanding amount in full. However, Norilsk Nickel failed to meet the deadline, which prompted the latest warning from Siluanov.
Norilsk Nickel is not the first major Russian company to face tax issues. Last year, the Russian government also demanded that Gazprom, the country's largest gas company, pay 1.3 trillion rubles (around $17.7 billion) in back taxes. Gazprom initially disputed the amount but ultimately agreed to pay the full amount over a period of several years.
Siluanov did not say what actions the government would take if Norilsk Nickel continued to ignore the tax demands. However, he emphasized that the government would use all legal means at its disposal to ensure that the company paid what it owed.
Norilsk Nickel is the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium and is crucial to the Russian economy. The company has been in the spotlight in recent years due to a series of environmental accidents. In 2020, the company was responsible for a massive oil spill in the Arctic that caused severe damage to the ecosystem.
The company has also been criticized for its poor labor practices. In 2016, Norilsk Nickel was accused of exploiting workers, including some who had been forced to work in slave-like conditions. The company denied the allegations but ultimately agreed to pay a settlement of $2.5 million to the workers affected.
The tax issue is the latest in a series of problems for Norilsk Nickel. In addition to the environmental and labor issues, the company has also been hit hard by the global economic slowdown caused by the pandemic. The price of nickel, which is a key component of many industrial products, has fallen dramatically in recent months, which has hurt Norilsk Nickel's bottom line.
The company has said that it is working to resolve the tax issue with the government. In a statement, Norilsk Nickel said that it was committed to meeting its legal obligations and would continue to work with the authorities to find a mutually acceptable solution.
The finance minister's warning is likely to put pressure on Norilsk Nickel to resolve the tax issue quickly. Failure to do so could result in serious consequences for the company, including fines, legal action, and reputational damage. Norilsk Nickel will need to work closely with the government to find a way to pay the overdue taxes and prevent further conflicts with the authorities.
