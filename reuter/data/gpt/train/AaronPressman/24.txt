The Federal Reserve has voted to increase the revenue cap for bank subsidiaries' securities underwriting. This decision is expected to provide banks with more opportunities to generate revenue and expand their business.
Under the new rules, the Fed has raised the revenue cap for banks with assets over $250 billion to 5% of their total revenue. Previously, banks were only allowed to generate up to 4.5% of their revenue from security underwriting.
The decision to increase the revenue cap comes as a result of several banks requesting an increase in the cap due to the changing landscape of the financial industry. The banks argue that the current cap restricts their ability to compete with other financial institutions that are not subject to the same limitations.
The Federal Reserve Board's decision to approve the increase in the revenue cap is seen as a win for many in the banking industry. It is expected that this move will reduce the regulatory burden on banks and help them to better compete with non-bank financial institutions.
In a statement, the Federal Reserve Board acknowledged that the financial industry has undergone significant changes since the revenue cap was last reviewed. The Board noted that technological advancements have made it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with banks in the securities underwriting market.
This change in the revenue cap is expected to provide banks with a greater incentive to engage in securities underwriting, which will help to expand their businesses and generate more revenue. It is also expected to facilitate the growth of smaller banks, which have traditionally faced more regulatory hurdles in expanding their securities underwriting operations.
Overall, the Federal Reserve Board's decision to increase the revenue cap for bank subsidiaries' securities underwriting is seen as a positive development for the banking industry. The increased flexibility will enable banks to better position themselves to compete with non-bank financial institutions and further cement their position in the securities underwriting market.
The new rules on bank subsidiaries' securities underwriting will go into effect on January 1, 2021. Banks will have to adjust their security underwriting operations to the new rules, but the impact is expected to be relatively minor.
