The United States Commerce Department has issued final export rules that would require firms to get licenses to sell certain computer encoding products to other countries. The move has come despite criticism from the industry, which claims the regulations would harm both businesses and customers.
The Department claims the new rules are targeted at specific products that can be used in surveillance, intelligence gathering, and other security-related activities. Officials argue that the export of these products should be tightly controlled in order to prevent them from ending up in the hands of malicious actors who could use them to harm national security and U.S. economic interests.
The 87-page rule, which is set to take effect on March 6, 2021, replaces a two-decade-old system of export controls for encryption products that relied on a "mass-market" approach. Under the previous system, products were classified based on their strength, with strong encryption products restricted to certain countries. The new rule introduces a more nuanced system, taking into account factors such as whether the product is open source or proprietary, the level of encryption it contains, its intended end-use, and the destination of the export.
The new system has been criticized by tech firms, civil liberties groups, and privacy advocates, who have argued that it would harm innovation, increase costs, and lead to the erosion of digital security and privacy. Tech companies such as Microsoft, IBM, and Intel have claimed that the rule would force them to seek licenses for almost all of their products, increasing complexity and slowing down innovation. They also argue that the rule would make it difficult for them to provide global services to their customers, potentially harming their competitiveness and profitability.
"It's going to be a real burden to figure out which products need licenses and which don't," said BSA-The Software Alliance, a trade group representing software companies. "This is going to be a real challenge for small businesses in particular, who will be disproportionately affected by these regulations."
Privacy groups have also voiced concern, arguing that the rule would undermine user privacy and security. "Strong encryption is an essential tool for protecting sensitive information, financial transactions, and online communications," said Gennie Gebhart, associate director of research at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for digital rights. "This rule will harm users and businesses alike by weakening trust in online platforms and services."
Despite the controversy, the Commerce Department maintains that the rule strikes the right balance between security and economic interests, and that it was developed after extensive consultation with stakeholders. In a statement, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the rule is "integral to supporting law enforcement and national security interests of the United States."
The rule has also been modified in response to feedback. The Commerce Department made a number of changes to the draft rule that was published earlier this year, including clarifying the definition of "mass market" products, providing additional guidance on license applications, and allowing certain products to be exported without a license.
The Department acknowledged that the new rule would not eliminate all the concerns raised by industry and privacy groups, but said it was necessary to address the evolving threats to national security and commerce. "We understand that some in industry and civil society disagree with certain provisions in the rule," the Department said. "However, these concerns do not outweigh the need to protect our national security and economic competitiveness from the risks posed by uncontrolled exports of encryption products."
The final rule has been published in the Federal Register, and is set to take effect on March 6, 2021. Businesses that export encryption products are advised to review the rule carefully and seek legal advice if necessary.
