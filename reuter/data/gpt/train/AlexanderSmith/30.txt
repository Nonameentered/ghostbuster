3i Group Plc, the London-based investment company, has reported a rise in its net asset value for the first half of the year, despite challenges from a slowing European economy and a strong pound.
The company reported a net asset value of £7.8 billion ($10.1 billion) for the six months ended September 30, 2019, up from £7.6 billion ($9.9 billion) for the same period last year.
The increase in net asset value was driven by strong performance from 3i's private equity portfolio, which increased in value by 9% over the period, and its infrastructure portfolio, which increased in value by 7%.
However, the company's debt management business, 3iDM, saw a decrease in net asset value of 2%, reflecting the challenging environment for credit markets in Europe.
Despite these challenges, 3i Group CEO Simon Borrows remained optimistic about the company's prospects.
“Despite a more challenging economic backdrop, we have continued to execute on our strategy of focusing on mid-market private equity and infrastructure investments in northern Europe, and increasing our international footprint outside Europe," he said.
"We have also continued to strengthen our balance sheet and position ourselves for future growth, including investing in our existing investment teams, and acquiring new businesses to expand our capabilities in areas such as digital technology and healthcare."
Borrows added that the company's diverse portfolio and geographical reach were key factors in its ability to weather economic challenges and deliver strong returns for investors.
"Our portfolio is well-diversified across geographies and sectors, with an increasing focus on growth businesses in sectors such as technology and healthcare," he said.
"This diversification, coupled with our focus on operational improvement and value creation, has helped us to continue to deliver attractive returns for our investors.”
3i Group's success in the first half of the year was also reflected in its share price, which has risen by around 14% since the start of the year.
The company announced an interim dividend of 18.5 pence per share, up from 17.5 pence per share for the same period last year.
Looking ahead, 3i Group said it remained committed to its strategy of investing in mid-market private equity and infrastructure, and would continue to explore growth opportunities both in Europe and internationally.
The company also said it would continue to focus on operational improvement and value creation across its portfolio, with a particular focus on technology and healthcare.
