British property group MEPC has reported a 14 percent increase in its pretax profits during the last fiscal year, despite a drop in its net asset value due to the writedown of an investment in a Los Angeles shopping mall.
MEPC's annual results showed that the company's pretax profits had risen to £111.7 million ($144.5 million) for the year ended in March 2020, up from the previous year's figure of £97.6 million ($126.5 million). The increase was attributed to MEPC's strong rental income and cost-saving measures.
However, MEPC's net asset value dropped by 6.8 percent to £3.32 billion ($4.28 billion), down from £3.56 billion ($4.59 billion) the previous year. The decline was mainly due to a £131.7 million ($170 million) writedown of MEPC's investment in the Westside Pavilion shopping center in Los Angeles, which the group acquired in 2018.
MEPC said that the writedown was a result of an "adverse change" in the mall's occupancy and lease profile, as well as a reduction in its value. The company said that it had taken steps to address the mall's issues, including repositioning it as an office development and attracting new tenants.
Despite the decline in the net asset value, MEPC expressed confidence in its long-term prospects, citing its strong rental income and its portfolio of high-quality office and industrial properties. The group said that it would continue to invest in its assets and to pursue growth opportunities in its core markets in the UK and Europe.
In a statement, James Dipple, CEO of MEPC, said that the company had "delivered another robust set of results in what was a challenging year for the property market." He added, "Our focus on operational excellence and prudent financial management has enabled us to weather the storm and position ourselves for future growth."
Dipple said that MEPC's performance had been supported by high levels of occupancy across its portfolio, with the company's industrial properties reaching 99 percent occupancy and its office properties averaging 96 percent occupancy. He said that a diverse and well-located portfolio had helped MEPC to attract a mix of tenants, including major brands and SMEs, across different sectors.
MEPC also highlighted its sustainability initiatives, including the installation of solar panels and LED lighting across its properties and the development of green spaces and cycling routes. The group said that it was committed to reducing its carbon footprint and to promoting sustainable practices across the property sector.
MEPC is part of the Hermes Investment Management group, which is owned by the BT Pension Scheme. The company owns and manages a portfolio of properties, including office buildings, industrial estates, and retail parks, located primarily in the UK and Europe.
The property group's performance comes at a time of uncertainty in the property market, as the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted demand and caused many businesses to reevaluate their office space needs. MEPC said that it had taken steps to support its tenants during the crisis, including offering rent concessions and supporting remote working arrangements.
Looking ahead, MEPC said that it would continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on the property market and adjust its strategy as needed. The company said that it remained focused on delivering high-quality properties and services to its tenants and on creating value for its stakeholders.
In conclusion, MEPC's annual results show that the property group has weathered a challenging year in the property market and has delivered strong financial performance despite the impact of a significant writedown. The group's focus on operational excellence and sustainability, as well as its diverse portfolio and commitment to tenant support, provide a solid foundation for future growth and success.
