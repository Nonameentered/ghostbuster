According to a report by J.P. Morgan, European privatisations are set to reach a record high of $53 billion in 1997 with telecommunications and utilities leading the activity.
The report states that the European Union has been encouraging its member states to privatise state-owned enterprises and this has resulted in a surge in activity in the telecoms and utilities sectors.
In particular, the report highlights the UK and France as being at the forefront of the privatisation trend with both nations anticipating large-scale flotations during 1997. The UK government has already announced that it will sell its remaining 40% stake in British Telecommunications (BT) which is expected to generate approximately $8 billion. In addition, a number of regional electricity companies are also expected to be sold to the private sector.
France, on the other hand, is set to undertake the largest privatisation programme in its history with the sale of France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications company, and several regional electricity companies.
Other countries identified as being active in the privatisation market include Spain, Italy and Germany. In Spain, the government is expected to sell its remaining 22% stake in Telefonica, the country's largest telecommunications company. Italy has already begun privatising the energy and transport sectors, with more sales expected in the telecommunications and banking industries. Germany too is expected to step up its privatisation activity, particularly in the postal and telecommunications sectors.
The report also suggests that the privatisation trend is likely to continue into the next few years. It notes that governments are increasingly looking to the private sector to provide the necessary capital for infrastructure development and to help reduce budget deficits.
Commenting on the findings, John Smith, J.P. Morgan's European Head of Investment Banking, said, "We are seeing an increasing number of governments favouring privatisation as a way of raising capital and reducing public debt. The telecoms and utilities sectors are particularly attractive to investors, as they offer stable returns and long-term growth potential."
However, not everyone is convinced that privatisation is the best way forward. Critics argue that the rush to sell state-owned enterprises may result in a lack of competition and could lead to price hikes for consumers.
Despite these concerns, it seems that privatisation is set to continue as a key trend in the European economy. The J.P. Morgan report concludes, "Europe is undergoing a profound transformation as it shifts from a public to a private sector-led economy. The pace of this change is likely to continue, with telecommunications and utilities at the forefront of the transformation."
