Moneylenders Provide Service to 2 Million Britons, Despite Stigma and High Costs
Despite the negative stigma and high costs associated with their services, moneylenders are providing financial support to an estimated two million Britons who often cannot access other forms of credit. These lenders, often referred to as doorstep lenders, provide loans of small amounts – typically up to £1,000 – to individuals who may not qualify for more traditional forms of loans or who need cash quickly.
According to research from the University of Bristol’s Personal Finance Research Centre, there are around 1,600 home credit companies operating in the UK, with an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 agents working in the industry. The majority of their customers, around 70%, are women, and many live in areas of the UK where there is high unemployment, low income, and little access to mainstream banking.
Critics of doorstep lending argue that these companies charge exorbitant interest rates on their loans, with annual percentage rates (APRs) often exceeding 500%. They argue that the industry preys on vulnerable individuals who may not understand the terms of the loans they are taking out, and who often struggle to repay the high-interest loans.
However, supporters of doorstep lending argue that these companies are offering an important service to those who are often overlooked by traditional banks and lending institutions. They say that the loans provided by doorstep lenders can be a lifeline for individuals who need cash for unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, household emergencies, or medical bills.
One of the biggest criticisms of doorstep lending is the high costs associated with these loans. However, a spokesperson for the Consumer Credit Trade Association, which represents a number of home credit companies, argues that these costs are necessary to cover the expenses associated with running a small loan business. Doorstep lenders often have to pay their agents to travel to customers’ homes to collect payments, and they may have higher overhead costs than larger banks or lenders.
Despite these high costs, many individuals rely on doorstep lenders to help them manage their financial situations. Rita, a 56-year-old grandmother from Bristol, has used the services of a doorstep lender for several years to help her manage her finances. She says that the company she uses provides a valuable service to her community, and that the interest rates are fair given the risks that the company takes.
“They’ve helped me out when I’ve had to pay for unexpected things, like when my washing machine broke down,” says Rita. “I can’t always get a loan from the bank because of my credit score, so the doorstep lender has been a real lifesaver.”
Proponents of tighter regulation for the industry argue that the high interest rates charged by doorstep lenders put individuals in a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape. They say that many people who take out these loans end up borrowing more and more to pay off the original loan, leading to a spiraling cycle of debt and financial hardship.
However, others argue that the focus should not be on regulating doorstep lenders out of existence, but rather on providing individuals with better financial education and support so that they can make informed choices about accessing credit.
“There’s no doubt that some people who take out loans from doorstep lenders get into trouble,” says Jane Tully, director of external affairs at the Money Advice Trust. “But we need to acknowledge that these loans are a valuable source of credit for millions of people who may not have other options.”
Tully argues that rather than trying to drive these lenders out of business, regulators should focus on improving the regulation of the industry to ensure that these companies are providing loans that are affordable and fair to their customers. This could involve measures like capping the interest rates that these lenders can charge or requiring them to provide more information and support to customers before they take out a loan.
Regardless of the debate around the high costs and potential dangers of doorstep lending, the fact remains that these companies are a significant source of credit for many individuals in the UK. As long as there are individuals who are unable to access credit through traditional banks or lenders, doorstep lenders are likely to remain a part of the financial landscape – for better or for worse.
