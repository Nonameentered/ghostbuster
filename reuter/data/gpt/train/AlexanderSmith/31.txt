London-based private equity firm, 3i Group Plc, reported a healthy increase in net asset value (NAV) on Thursday, despite facing a significant setback in its European operations. The company's NAV at the end of the financial year on March 31, 2021, stood at £11.8 billion ($16.2 billion), up 17% from the previous year's figure of £10.1 billion ($13.9 billion).
The increase in NAV was primarily driven by the company's strong performance in its North American and Asian operations. The company's private equity portfolio generated a gross investment return of 25.7%, while its infrastructure business delivered a gross investment return of 12.5%.
However, the company faced a setback in its European operations, which saw its gross investment return decline to just 3.3%. The European operations suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a decline in economic activity and affected the performance of the company's portfolio companies in the region.
Despite the setback, 3i Group Plc's management remains confident about the future prospects of the company. In a statement, the company's CEO, Simon Borrows, said, "We are pleased to report a strong set of results for the year, driven by our North American and Asian operations. While our European operations faced a challenging year, we are confident that the region will bounce back as the pandemic subsides."
The company's management also highlighted the successful completion of several transactions during the year, which included the sale of its stake in Dutch retailer Action and the acquisition of Canadian software firm Mersive Technologies. The company's management said that these transactions demonstrated its ability to generate strong returns for its investors by making strategic investments in high-growth sectors.
Despite the healthy increase in NAV, the company's share price fell by around 2% in early trading on Thursday, as investors took note of the setback in Europe. However, the company's management said that it remained committed to delivering strong returns for its investors, and was optimistic about the future.
"We are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the market, and we remain committed to delivering strong returns for our investors. We believe that our focus on investing in high-growth sectors will continue to drive our success in the years ahead," said Mr. Borrows.
3i Group Plc is one of the UK's largest private equity firms, with a focus on investing in mid-market companies in Europe, North America, and Asia. The company has a diversified portfolio, which includes investments in sectors such as healthcare, technology, and consumer goods.
The company's strong performance in North America and Asia is a reflection of its focus on investing in high-growth sectors, which is expected to continue in the years ahead. However, its setback in Europe highlights the challenges that the company faces in a region that has been badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the company's management remains confident about the future, and investors will be hoping that its focus on high-growth sectors will continue to deliver strong returns in the years ahead.
