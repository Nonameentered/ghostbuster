The year 1997 saw the UK commercial property market showing signs of recovery after years of recession, but experts warned against expecting a return to the boom times of the 1980s.
According to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), commercial property values in the UK rose by 2.3% in the first quarter of 1997, the first increase since 1990. The RICS report stated that the improvement was driven by an upturn in the office and industrial sectors, with retail lagging behind.
"The commercial property market is starting to emerge from recession, with increased leasing activity and more investors coming into the market," said Jeremy Leaf of RICS. "The increase in values is a reflection of greater confidence in the market."
Leaf added that the upturn was likely to continue, although at a moderate pace. "It's not going to be a boom, but it is a solid recovery," he said. "It will take some time for rents and occupier demand to increase, but there's definitely a sense of optimism in the market."
The sentiment was echoed by other industry experts, who noted that the market had bottomed out and was showing signs of stabilizing. However, they warned against getting too excited, as the market remained susceptible to external factors such as interest rates, inflation, and global economic conditions.
"The market is still fragile, and any sudden shocks could derail the recovery," said Mark Farmer of property consultancy Styles & Wood. "We're not going to see a return to the boom times of the 1980s, but we can expect slow and steady growth over the next few years."
One area that continued to suffer in 1997 was the retail sector, which was hit hard by the rise of online shopping. While other sectors benefited from the recovering economy, retail faced an uphill battle to attract customers back to high streets and shopping centers.
"The retail sector is in a state of flux, as consumer habits change and retailers struggle to adapt," said David Williams of property consultants DTZ Debenham Thorpe. "There are winners and losers in this sector, with some retailers responding well to the challenge, while others are being left behind."
Williams added that the rise of online shopping had fundamentally altered the retail landscape, and that the sector would need to embrace technological advances in order to survive.
"The internet is a game-changer for retail, and those retailers that don't adapt will simply not survive," he said. "We're already seeing changes in the way that retailers use physical space, with more emphasis on experience and community engagement. This trend is only going to become more pronounced in the years ahead."
Despite the challenges facing the retail sector, 1997 saw some major deals in the UK commercial property market. The most high-profile involved the Canary Wharf complex in London, which was sold to Canadian company Olympia & York for £800m. The deal marked the end of a long-running ownership dispute over the iconic development, which had been in receivership since 1992.
Other major deals included the £200m acquisition of the Angel Centre in Manchester by property company MEPC, and the £180m purchase of the Bracknell Business Centre by DFI.
"The market is seeing some major deals, which is a sign of growing investor confidence," said Chris Barrow of chartered surveyors Weatherall Green & Smith. "Investors are looking for good quality stock in prime locations, and they're prepared to pay a premium for it."
Barrow added that overseas investors were particularly active in the UK market, drawn by the relative stability of the economy and attractive yields compared to other global markets.
"US, European, and Asian investors are all looking to invest in the UK, and we're seeing a lot of cross-border activity," he said. "This is only going to increase as global capital becomes more mobile."
Overall, the outlook for the UK commercial property market in 1997 was cautiously optimistic. While the recovery was expected to continue, experts warned against expecting a return to the boom times of the past.
"The market has changed fundamentally since the 1980s," said Williams. "We're not going to see a return to those heady days any time soon. But that's not necessarily a bad thing – slow and steady growth can be more sustainable in the long-term."
