The London Boat Show kicked off last week with a strong focus on safety and innovation. One of the show's highlights was Tony Bullimore's appearance, the legendary sailor famous for his survival in the treacherous Southern Ocean. The 79-year-old Bullimore recounted his incredible story of being trapped in his upturned boat for four days in icy waters and dense fog, surviving on just a small amount of food and water. He was eventually rescued by the Australian navy in a daring mission that many thought was impossible.
Bullimore, who has taken part in numerous global sailing races, spoke of the importance of having the right safety equipment onboard. "I've been in some hairy situations in my time, but my survival in the Southern Ocean was only possible because I had the latest technology and safety gear on my boat. It's crucial that every sailor has the best equipment available because you never know what could happen out at sea."
The London Boat Show showcased a wide range of high-tech safety equipment, from personal emergency beacons to state-of-the-art navigation systems. One of the most impressive stands was that of Ocean Signal, a leading supplier of marine safety equipment. Their range includes the award-winning rescueME MOB1, a personal man-overboard device that sends an alert to nearby boats and rescue services, along with GPS coordinates, helping to ensure fast and accurate rescue.
Another highlight was Raymarine's Axiom+ range of multifunction displays, which provide sailors with real-time information on weather, tides, and sea conditions. The system uses advanced mapping technology, allowing sailors to chart their course and navigate with confidence, even in the most challenging conditions.
Overall, the London Boat Show gave visitors a glimpse into the future of sailing, with a focus on safety and innovation. The event was a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of the sailing community, and a reminder of the risks involved in this exciting but unpredictable sport.
