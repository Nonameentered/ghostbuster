Investment watchdog fines Robert Fleming group for rule breaches, Hong Kong authorities secure nearly $20 million in voluntary compensation
Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has fined the Robert Fleming group HK$6 million ($768,691) for failing to adequately supervise its employees and breaches of money-laundering regulations.
The SFC said the Robert Fleming group, part of London-based asset manager C. Hoare & Co, breached anti-money laundering rules between 2012 and 2015 by not properly conducting customer due diligence, verifying the source of funds, and reporting suspicious transactions.
The SFC also found that the Robert Fleming group did not adequately supervise three of its traders, who conducted “wash trades” – trades with no change in beneficial ownership that may create misleading appearances of trading volume or market interest and may be used to manipulate prices – between January 2014 and August 2015.
In response to the SFC’s investigation, the Robert Fleming group voluntarily compensated more than 900 affected customers by HK$156 million ($19.9 million).
“This is a very serious matter, and we have taken strong and immediate action to address it. We accept our responsibilities and are deeply sorry for the impacts that our actions have had on our customers and on our reputation,” said the Robert Fleming group in a statement.
The SFC said the voluntary compensation by the Robert Fleming group was a factor in determining the level of the fine, and that it had taken steps to improve its compliance procedures.
“We expect licensed corporations to fully comply with their KYC and AML obligations. When a licensed corporation breaches these obligations, it undermines the integrity of the market and their customers’ confidence in the market. The SFC will take appropriate enforcement action,” said Ashley Alder, CEO of the SFC.
The Robert Fleming group has also implemented additional measures to enhance its anti-money laundering and supervisory controls, the SFC said.
The Robert Fleming group is not the first firm to be fined by the SFC for breaches of anti-money laundering rules. In December 2019, Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering regulator fined State Street Global Advisors Asia HK$4 million ($514,307) for breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations.
Hong Kong’s financial regulators are under increased scrutiny due to concerns about the city’s reputation as a global financial centre. Last year, the US Congress passed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which allows the US government to impose sanctions on individuals and entities who undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy.
The US last year blacklisted Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam and 10 other Hong Kong officials, accusing them of curtailing political freedoms in the city.
In response, Hong Kong’s financial regulators have stepped up enforcement actions against firms that breach regulatory requirements.
Earlier this month, the SFC said it had fined four financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs and UBS, a total of HK$350 million ($44.9 million) for failures in their IPO sponsorship work.
The SFC said the four firms had failed to conduct adequate due diligence on the companies they were sponsoring, leading to inaccurate financial disclosures.
Hong Kong’s financial regulator has also increased its scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance disclosures by firms listed in the city. Last year, the SFC published a set of guidelines for listed companies to improve their ESG reporting and disclosure.
The SFC is also pushing for mandatory climate disclosure by listed companies, in line with international standards.
“The SFC has made it clear that it expects listed companies to address and disclose climate-related risks and opportunities,” said Ashley Alder, CEO of the SFC, in a speech last month.
“As a matter of principle, we believe that climate risks and opportunities form part of a company’s mainstream financial risks and should be incorporated into existing company risk management processes and governance structures.”
