Institutional Shareholders Increasing Scrutiny of Top Company Players' Pay Packets
Large institutional shareholders are becoming increasingly concerned with the pay packets of top executives at some of the world's most successful companies. According to a report from the Investment Association, a UK trade body that represents institutional investors, almost a third of shareholders are now voting against executive pay plans, up from a quarter last year. The trend is particularly notable among large companies in the United Kingdom, where shareholders have been given greater powers to vote on executive pay in recent years.
The report indicates that shareholders are increasingly scrutinizing the performance measures used to determine executive pay, as well as the ratio of executive pay to that of the wider workforce. They are also taking issue with the use of bonuses and share options as a means of rewarding executives. In many cases, institutional investors are calling for executive pay to be linked more closely to long-term company performance, rather than short-term goals such as hitting quarterly targets.
One high-profile example of this trend is the recent vote against the pay package of Unilever CEO Paul Polman. Unilever, a global consumer goods giant, had proposed a pay package worth over £11m for Polman, including a £1.5m bonus and almost £9m in share awards. However, the company's largest investors raised concerns about the size of the payout, arguing that it was not aligned with the company's long-term performance.
As a result, over a third of Unilever's shareholders voted against the pay package at the company's annual general meeting in May, prompting the company to review its executive pay policy. Unilever subsequently announced that it would cap Polman's future pay at 11 times that of the average employee, and that it would scrap bonus payouts for executives who fail to meet the company's sustainability targets.
This reflects a wider trend in the business world, where companies are increasingly focused on environmental and social goals, as well as financial performance. Large institutional investors are now looking for executive pay policies that reflect this broader set of priorities. In particular, they are demanding that companies take a more long-term, sustainable approach to business, rather than simply maximizing short-term profits.
Another example of this trend is the controversy over the pay package of BP CEO Bob Dudley. Dudley's £14m pay packet in 2015 caused outrage among some shareholders, many of whom had seen their investments in the company plummet following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. Dudley's pay package was subsequently cut by 40% in 2016, after a majority of shareholders voted against the proposed payout.
This increase in shareholder activism over executive pay is a sign of growing dissatisfaction with the traditional approach to corporate governance, where executives are often rewarded for short-term performance at the expense of longer-term goals. Institutional investors are looking for companies to take a more holistic approach to business, which takes into account environmental, social and governance factors, as well as financial performance.
This trend is likely to continue, as investors become increasingly vocal about their concerns over executive pay. In response, companies will need to review their executive pay policies, to ensure that they are aligned with the broader priorities of the business.
Overall, it seems that institutional shareholders are becoming more concerned with the pay packets of top company players. They are increasingly scrutinizing the performance measures used to determine executive pay, as well as the ratio of executive pay to that of the wider workforce. Companies that fail to align their executive pay policies with the broader priorities of the business risk losing the support of their shareholders, and could face significant reputational damage as a result.
