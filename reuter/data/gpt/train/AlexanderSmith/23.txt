Hambros Reports Return to Profit in First Half Despite Calls for Breakup by Hong Kong Shareholder
Hambros, the UK-based banking and investment firm, has reported a return to profit in the first half of 2021, in spite of calls by a Hong Kong shareholder for a breakup of the company.
The bank, which has been owned by the Belgian family bank KBC since 1998, reported a pre-tax profit of £34.5m for the first six months of the year, compared to a loss of £14.6m in the same period in 2020.
The bank's solid performance in the first half of the year was driven by strong growth in its wealth management and private banking businesses, which helped to offset weakness in its investment banking and securities businesses.
In a statement, the bank's CEO, Peter Flavel, said that the bank's strong financial performance in the first half of the year was a reflection of the bank's "strategic focus on high-value clients and a disciplined approach to cost management".
While the bank's financial performance was strong, it was overshadowed by calls by a Hong Kong shareholder for the company to be broken up.
The shareholder, activist investor Norman Chan, who owns around 5% of the bank's shares, has been calling for a breakup of the company for several months, arguing that the bank's various businesses are not related and that a breakup would unlock value for shareholders.
In a letter to the bank's board earlier this year, Chan argued that the bank's wealth management and private banking businesses would be worth more if they were spun off from the rest of the bank and listed separately.
However, the bank's board has not been persuaded by Chan's arguments and has said that it believes that the bank's various businesses are complementary and that a breakup would not be in the interests of shareholders.
The bank's chairman, Charles VanderLinden, said in a statement that the board had carefully considered Chan's proposals, but had concluded that a breakup of the bank would not be in the interests of the wider shareholder base.
VanderLinden said that the board was committed to delivering long-term value to shareholders and that it believed that the bank's current strategy, which focused on high-value clients and cost management, was the best way to achieve this.
Despite the board's decision not to pursue a breakup of the bank, Chan has not given up his campaign and has called for a special meeting of shareholders to vote on his proposals.
In a statement, Chan said that he believed that a breakup of the bank was in the best interests of shareholders and that he was confident that he could persuade a majority of shareholders to support his proposals.
The bank's management has said that it will engage with Chan regarding his proposals, but has warned that a breakup of the bank would be a complex and risky process that would take time to execute.
The bank's performance in the first half of the year has also been overshadowed by ongoing concerns about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the wider economy.
The bank's CEO, Peter Flavel, said that while the bank had performed well in the first half of the year, it remained cautious about the outlook for the second half of the year and beyond.
Flavel said that the bank was closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on its clients and was prepared to take action if necessary to support them.
In conclusion, Hambros' return to profit in the first half of the year is a positive sign for the bank, but it remains to be seen whether the bank will be able to weather the storm of calls for a breakup by Hong Kong shareholder Norman Chan. The bank will need to carefully consider the best way forward for its shareholders, and engage with Chan in a constructive and productive manner.
