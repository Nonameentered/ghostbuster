Coopers & Lybrand, the former auditors of collapsed investment bank Barings, has issued third party proceedings against former directors and employees of the bank. The move comes as Coopers & Lybrand seeks to recover some of the money it paid out to Barings' liquidators.
In the court documents, Coopers & Lybrand alleges that the Barings directors and employees breached their duties of care and loyalty to the bank, which in turn led to its ultimate collapse. The auditing firm is seeking compensation from the former executives and employees for their alleged actions.
The collapse of Barings in 1995 sent shockwaves through the global financial industry. The bank had been one of the oldest and most prestigious in the world, but it was brought down by the actions of one rogue trader, Nick Leeson. Leeson had been able to run up massive losses in Barings' Singapore branch, which were not detected by the bank's auditors.
In the wake of the collapse, there was widespread criticism of both Barings and Coopers & Lybrand. The auditing firm was accused of failing to properly scrutinize Barings' accounts, while the bank was criticized for its lack of oversight of Leeson's trades.
Coopers & Lybrand paid out Â£70 million to the liquidators of Barings in 2004, in a settlement that was meant to draw a line under the affair. However, the auditing firm has now decided to take legal action against some of the former directors and employees of Barings, in an attempt to recover some of the money it paid out.
The third party proceedings name a number of former executives and employees of Barings, including Peter Norris, former chairman of the bank's finance committee, and Simon Jones, a former managing director of the bank. Coopers & Lybrand alleges that these individuals breached their duties to the bank by failing to properly oversee its activities and by allowing Leeson to run up massive losses.
In a statement, Coopers & Lybrand said: "We believe that the allegations against these individuals are serious and we are seeking compensation for the losses that we incurred as a result of their actions."
The move by Coopers & Lybrand has been criticized by some observers, who argue that the auditing firm should have done more to prevent the collapse of Barings in the first place. However, others argue that the actions of the former Barings executives and employees were the principal cause of the bank's demise.
The case is likely to be closely watched by other auditing firms, who will be keen to avoid a similar situation. The collapse of Barings was a watershed moment for the auditing industry, leading to increased scrutiny of auditors' activities and tougher regulation.
Coopers & Lybrand has now been absorbed into the larger accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, but the Barings case remains a blot on its reputation. By pursuing legal action against former directors and employees of the bank, the auditing firm is hoping to draw a line under the affair once and for all.
It remains to be seen how the case will play out in court. The defendants are likely to vigorously contest the allegations against them, arguing that they could not have foreseen the actions of Leeson and that they acted in good faith at all times.
In any case, the case is likely to be a protracted and complex one, with years of legal wrangling ahead. For Coopers & Lybrand, it is a chance to try and repair some of the damage done to its reputation by the Barings affair. For the former directors and employees of Barings, it is an unwelcome reminder of a dark chapter in their professional lives. And for the wider auditing industry, it is a stark reminder of the need for vigilance and care in the face of potential financial disasters.
