Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) members at Tradeteam are set to vote on whether or not to strike over proposed pay cuts, which could see some workers earning up to £5,000 less per year. The proposed cuts have been met with anger from the union and its members, who argue that they have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic and should be rewarded for their efforts, not punished.
Tradeteam is a logistics and supply chain management company that provides services to a range of businesses, including major brewing companies. According to the TGWU, the company has proposed a range of pay cuts for its workers, including those on basic salaries of less than £25,000 per year, as well as those on more substantial salaries.
The union claims that some workers could see their salaries cut by up to £5,000 per year, in a move that has been met with outrage from the workforce. The union has already held several discussions with the company in an attempt to resolve the issue, but negotiations have so far proved unsuccessful.
Now, the union has notified the company that it will ballot its members on whether or not to take industrial action, which could include strikes or other forms of protest. The ballot will take place over the coming weeks, and the results are expected to be announced in the near future.
In a statement, the TGWU said: "Despite our best efforts to negotiate with the company, it has become clear that they are determined to push ahead with these unfair and unnecessary pay cuts. Our members have already been working hard throughout the pandemic, often putting their own health at risk to ensure that the logistics and supply chain operations of the company ran smoothly.
"We believe that the company should be rewarding our members for their hard work and dedication, not punishing them with pay cuts. We hope that this ballot will send a clear message to the company that our members will not accept these cuts and that they are prepared to take industrial action if necessary."
The news of the proposed pay cuts and the prospect of strike action is likely to be a blow to the company, which has been under increased pressure in recent months due to the ongoing pandemic. However, it remains to be seen whether or not the union's members will vote in favour of industrial action, and what impact this will have on the company and its operations.
Whatever happens next, it is clear that this dispute is likely to rumble on for some time, with both sides seemingly unwilling to back down. The TGWU has already urged the company to reconsider its position and return to the negotiating table, but it remains to be seen whether or not this will happen. In the meantime, the union's members will be left to decide whether or not to strike in defence of their pay and conditions, in a move that could have far-reaching consequences for the logistics and supply chain industry as a whole.
