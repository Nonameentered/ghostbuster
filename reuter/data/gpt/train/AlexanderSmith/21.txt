Lloyd's of London, one of the biggest insurance markets in the world, has received an overwhelmingly positive response to its recovery plan from its members, including U.S. investors. The historic institution has been grappling with record losses due to a string of natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires, as well as a slowdown in global economic growth. The Covid-19 pandemic has also thrown another curveball for the 334-year-old institution.
Under its three-year strategy, which was launched in May, Lloyd's aims to modernize its structure, reduce costs, simplify procedures, and strengthen underwriting discipline. The plan also includes a goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in its operations by 2050 and to boost diversity and inclusion.  Lloyd's CEO, John Neal, said the strategy was a "call to action" for the industry to "re-make itself."
The reaction from the 90-plus syndicate members at Lloyd's has been overwhelmingly positive. According to a statement issued on Thursday, more than 98 percent of votes cast supported the plan, which means it has been approved with immediate effect. U.S. investors own around a third of the Lloyd's market, and some of the biggest names include Apollo and Blackstone.
"The strong support for the plan reflects the importance that our members attach to modernizing and securing the future success of this great market," said Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd's. "The plan is a critical building block in our response to the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world."
The vote is a significant milestone for Lloyd's, which had suffered criticism for its complex and outdated structure, which had made it difficult for members to assess the performance of the different syndicates. The plan will streamline the governance framework, reduce unnecessary costs and increase transparency. It is also designed to attract new capital into the market.
The modernization drive "will help to ensure that Delegated Underwriting Authorities (DUAs) can continue to operate at Lloyd's, establishing a more constructive and streamlined approach to market access," said Lindsey Davies, head of regulatory affairs at the British Insurance Brokers' Association.
The unanimous vote demonstrates the commitment of the market to take immediate action to improve its operations and increase its competitiveness, and follows a difficult year for the sector. The global pandemic has impacted many businesses, and the insurance industry has been no exception.
Lloyd's has not escaped the financial pressures resulting from the pandemic, and earlier this year, it reported a Â£1bn ($1.3bn) loss for 2019 due to an increase in natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes and wildfires, as well as claims related to Covid-19.
However, the results of the latest vote suggest that investors have confidence in Lloyd's ability to turn things around and position itself well for the future. Neal said the vote was "a hugely significant moment" for the market, adding that he was "thrilled with the level of support for the strategy that we have been working on for over a year."
"The journey ahead will be challenging, but I am confident that Lloyd's can navigate the road ahead to a stronger and brighter future," Neal said.
Investors have welcomed the vote, saying it is a positive step towards a more efficient and profitable market. Michael Kastner, co-president of the global insurance business at Apollo Global Management, said: "It's a good outcome, and it signals that there is a clear path forward for the market, which is important in terms of getting people to invest."
Overall, the vote is seen as a positive outcome for Lloyd's as it seeks to boost its competitiveness in an industry that is being affected by changing customer needs, digitalization, regulation, and new risks. It also demonstrates the importance of listening to members and engaging with them to build trust and support.
Lloyd's may have a long way to go, but the market is showing that it is prepared to face the challenges ahead and adapt to the changing environment. By modernizing its operations and adopting a more customer-centric approach, Lloyd's has the potential to strengthen its position as one of the leading insurance markets in the world.
