The board of directors of the Middle Eastern Petroleum Company (MEPC) has recently announced the financial results for the fiscal year 2020. The company reported a significant increase in its pre-tax profits, which stood at $2.3 billion, representing a 25% rise from last year's figure. However, the board expressed disappointment over the drop in the company's net asset value (NAV), which went down from $5.7 billion in 2019 to $4.9 billion in 2020.
MEPC is one of the largest oil and gas producers in the Middle East, with operations in several countries, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The company's performance is closely watched by industry analysts, investors, and stakeholders, given its strategic importance in the region.
The chairman of MEPC, Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, commented on the financial results, stating that the board was pleased with the increase in pre-tax profits, which demonstrated the company's resilience in a challenging economic environment. However, he also acknowledged the decline in NAV, which he attributed to several factors, including the drop in oil prices and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
"Despite the adverse conditions that we faced in 2020, we have managed to increase our pre-tax profits, which is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees. However, we are also aware of the challenges that lie ahead, especially in light of the ongoing pandemic, which has had a significant impact on our industry and our operations," said Al-Nasser.
According to the company's financial report, the increase in pre-tax profits was mainly driven by higher revenues from oil and gas sales, which rose by 12% to $10.7 billion. MEPC's upstream operations, which include exploration, production, and development of oil and gas reserves, contributed the lion's share of the company's revenues, accounting for 87% of the total.
The report also revealed that the company's downstream operations, which include refining, marketing, and distribution of petroleum products, saw a decline in revenues, dropping by 6% to $1.4 billion. However, the board stated that the downstream business remained a key strategic priority for the company, and they would continue to invest in it to improve its competitiveness and profitability.
Despite the increase in pre-tax profits, MEPC's net income was down by 6%, from $1.2 billion in 2019 to $1.1 billion in 2020. The board attributed this to several factors, including the increase in depreciation and depletion expenses, as well as the rise in finance costs, which were partly due to the higher debt levels the company incurred to fund its capital expenditures.
Moreover, the report showed that MEPC's net asset value (NAV) had declined, from $5.7 billion in 2019 to $4.9 billion in 2020, representing a drop of 14%. The board expressed disappointment with this decline, noting that it had affected the company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.
"The drop in net asset value is a concern for us, as it reflects the impact of external factors that are beyond our control. Nevertheless, we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders, and we will continue to invest in our operations and pursue growth opportunities that are in line with our strategic priorities," said Al-Nasser.
The board also provided an update on the company's capital expenditures, stating that it had invested $6.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 16% from the previous year. The majority of these investments were focused on upstream projects, with the aim of increasing the company's oil and gas production and improving its reserves base.
Looking ahead, the board acknowledged that the economic environment remained uncertain and challenging, given the ongoing pandemic and the geopolitical risks in the region. However, they expressed confidence in the company's ability to navigate these challenges and deliver sustainable growth and value to its stakeholders.
"Our focus remains on strengthening our operations, enhancing our competitiveness, and delivering value to our shareholders, while also contributing to the sustainable development of the communities in which we operate. We remain committed to our vision of being a world-class oil and gas producer, and we will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal," said Al-Nasser.
Overall, while MEPC's financial results showed a mixed performance, the board remained optimistic about the company's future prospects, noting that it had a strong portfolio of assets, a robust balance sheet, and a talented and committed workforce.
