Australian exporters of fresh food have been hit hard by the recent surge in the value of the Australian dollar and hikes in fuel prices, according to the CEO of the Australian Federation of International Forwarders (AFIF).
In an interview with ABC News, AFIF CEO Brian Lovell said that the combination of a stronger Australian dollar and higher fuel prices has forced many Australian exporters of fresh foods to cut back on their shipments overseas.
"Exporters are being hit hard by the stronger Australian dollar, which is reducing the competitiveness of their products in overseas markets," Lovell said. "At the same time, they are facing higher fuel prices, which are increasing the cost of transporting their goods to ports and airports."
Lovell added that many exporters are also struggling with the additional costs of complying with new health and safety regulations put in place by overseas governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
"These new regulations require exporters to take additional precautions to ensure the safety of their products, which is adding even more costs to the already high cost of exporting fresh foods," he said.
According to Lovell, many Australian exporters are also facing increased competition from other countries that are able to provide cheaper and more efficient shipping solutions.
"In particular, we are seeing more competition from countries like New Zealand, which has invested heavily in its transport infrastructure and is able to provide faster and more cost-effective shipping options," he said.
Despite the challenges facing the Australian fresh food export industry, Lovell said that there are still opportunities for exporters to succeed in overseas markets.
"Australian fresh food is known around the world for its high quality and freshness, and there is still strong demand for our products in many overseas markets," he said.
However, Lovell added that exporters will need to work together with the government and other industry stakeholders to address the challenges facing the industry and find innovative solutions to overcome them.
