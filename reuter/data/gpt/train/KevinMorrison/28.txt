James Hardie Industries, the leading global manufacturer of building products, is expected to announce a net profit of A$23-30 million for the first half of the financial year 1996/97. This comes as a pleasant surprise to investors, as the company has been facing a challenging market for the past few years.
The anticipated profit is a significant improvement from the H1 1995/96 results, where the company reported a net loss of A$582 million. The loss was mainly due to the establishment of the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund (AICF), which was set up to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases caused by the use of James Hardie's products. However, the company has made progress in meeting its obligations to the AICF, which has helped to decrease the compensation payments.
The expected profit for H1 1996/97 is a result of the company's successful cost-cutting initiatives and the rebound of the Australian economy. James Hardie's Chief Executive Officer, Louis Gries, attributes the company's success to the effective implementation of its operational improvement program, which has resulted in significant savings in the manufacturing process.
The company's Australian and New Zealand operations have shown strong growth, with a 12% increase in sales volume and a 4% increase in average selling prices. The growth in demand for James Hardie's products in these regions is attributed to the rise in new housing construction and renovations. The company has also benefited from the increased focus on energy-efficient building solutions, where James Hardie's products are in high demand.
James Hardie's North American operations have also shown improvement, with sales volume increasing by 9% and average selling prices increasing by 5%. The growth in demand for the company's products in North America is attributed to the increase in residential and commercial building activities in the region. The company's major customers in the North American market include home builders, contractors, and distributors.
Despite the positive results, James Hardie's European operations continue to face challenges. The sales volume decreased by 9%, and average selling prices decreased by 3%. The company's major market in Europe is the United Kingdom, where the company is facing intense competition from local manufacturers. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its impact on the economy has resulted in a slowdown in demand for building products in the region.
Looking forward, James Hardie is optimistic about its prospects in the second half of the financial year. The company expects the demand for its products to continue growing, driven by the rise in new housing construction and renovations in the Australian and North American markets. The company has also reiterated its commitment to meeting its obligations to the AICF and compensating victims of asbestos-related diseases.
In conclusion, James Hardie Industries is set to report a net profit of A$23-30 million for the first half of the financial year 1996/97, a significant improvement from the same period last year. The company's successful cost-cutting initiatives and the rebound of the Australian economy have contributed to the positive results. While the company's European operations continue to face challenges, the company is optimistic about its prospects in the second half of the year, driven by the growth in new housing construction and renovations in the Australian and North American markets. The company's commitment to meeting its obligations to the AICF and compensating victims of asbestos-related diseases remains firm.
