Westpac Banking Corp, an Australian financial services provider, has joined forces with Standard Chartered Bank, a British multinational banking and financial services company, for rapid expansion in the Asian banking sector. The alliance aims to provide clients with a wider range of services across the Asian market – which is one of the world’s fastest-growing regions.
Westpac plans to leverage Standard Chartered's established presence in key markets across Asia while also expanding its presence in the region by using the British bank’s global connectivity and specialist capabilities. The move will also provide Standard Chartered with an entry into the Australian market.
Under the agreement, the banks will collaborate on transaction banking, including trade finance, cash management, and foreign exchange, as well as other key areas of banking services in the Asia-Pacific region.
Westpac's CEO, Peter King, said that joining forces with Standard Chartered would allow the bank to access new clients and revenue streams across the Asia-Pacific region. Standard Chartered CEO, Bill Winters, echoed this sentiment, saying that the alliance will help Standard Chartered drive growth and provide clients with enhanced solutions across the Asia-Pacific region.
The alliance between Westpac and Standard Chartered is expected to allow the banks to grow their market presence in the region and compete more effectively with other banking heavyweights. Ultimately, it is the customers who will benefit the most from the partnership as they will have access to a wider range of banking solutions from both banks.
