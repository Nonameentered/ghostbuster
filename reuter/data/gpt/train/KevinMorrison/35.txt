Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd, the owner of the Star Casino in Sydney, is seeking a tax break from the Australian government in order to compete for the lucrative Asian high-rollers market.
The Star Casino, located in the heart of Sydney, is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. The casino has been operating in Australia for over 20 years and has become a major contributor to the local economy. However, in recent years, the casino has been facing increasing competition from casinos in other parts of the world, particularly in Asia.
To stay competitive, Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd is seeking a reduction in the tax rate on profits earned from international high-rollers. The company believes that this tax break will enable it to offer more attractive incentives to potential customers, such as free accommodation and other perks, and ultimately attract more high-rollers from overseas.
The CEO of Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd, John Oâ€™Neill, said that the tax break is essential for the company's long-term growth and competitiveness in the global gambling market. "If we want to remain competitive and attract high-rollers to Sydney, we need to offer incentives that are as attractive as those offered by other casinos in Asia," he said.
O'Neill also emphasized the significant economic benefits that the Star Casino brings to the local community. "The Star Casino is an important contributor to the Australian economy, employing over 3,000 people and generating millions of dollars in tax revenue for the government. A reduction in the tax rate on international high-rollers will enable us to continue to provide these economic benefits for the long-term," he added.
However, not everyone is in favor of the proposed tax break. Some critics argue that the government should not be giving tax breaks to a gambling company, especially at a time when Australia is facing economic challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
"The Australian government should be focusing on supporting small businesses and industries that are struggling due to the pandemic, not giving tax breaks to gambling companies that are already making significant profits," said Dr. Charles Livingstone, a gambling researcher from Monash University.
The Australian government has not yet indicated whether it will grant Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd's request for a tax break. However, the government has previously expressed support for the gambling industry in Australia, acknowledging its significant economic contributions.
The Star Casino is not the only Australian casino that is seeking to attract high-rollers from overseas. Crown Resorts, the owner of the Crown Casino in Melbourne, has also been targeting the Asian high-rollers market. In recent years, Crown Resorts has faced significant scrutiny from Australian regulators over allegations of money laundering and other illegal activities at its casinos.
Whether Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd's request for a tax break will be granted remains to be seen. However, it is clear that the competition for the lucrative Asian high-rollers market is heating up, and Australian casinos are looking for ways to remain competitive in this increasingly crowded market.
