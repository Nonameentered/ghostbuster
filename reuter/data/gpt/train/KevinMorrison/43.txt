British Airways is set to extend its global reach through franchising but has no plans for new alliances, according to the airline’s CEO and Chairman, Alex Cruz.
In an interview with Travel Weekly, Cruz said the airline will expand its presence in new markets through partnerships with local carriers, similar to the existing partnerships it has with Comair in South Africa and SUN-AIR in Scandinavia.
“We have a very active franchise programme and we’re always looking for partners,” Cruz said. “It gives us the ability to develop markets we might not be well-known in and it also gives us the ability to offer customers a seamless service across BA and its franchise partners.”
In March, British Airways announced a new franchise partnership with Fiji Airways, allowing customers to book flights to Fiji and the Pacific Islands on the British Airways website.
The airline has also recently announced a codeshare agreement with Indian carrier Vistara, enabling customers to book Vistara flights from eight Indian cities to London via Delhi or Mumbai.
However, Cruz ruled out any plans for new alliances with other airlines, stating that British Airways is “happy with the alliances we have in place.”
British Airways is a member of the oneworld alliance, which includes 12 other airlines such as American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Qantas and Qatar Airways. The alliance allows customers to earn and redeem frequent flyer points across the participating airlines and access airport lounges.
Cruz also discussed the airline’s plans to improve the customer experience on board, including the introduction of a new Club World business class seat in 2019. The new seat will feature direct aisle access and a flat bed, addressing criticism of the current Club World seating arrangement.
“We are taking a very long-term vision of how we will develop the product,” Cruz said. “We have taken customer feedback and we are making sure we are implementing it in the right way.”
Other improvements to the in-flight experience include the introduction of Wi-Fi on board and the rolling out of new catering options.
Despite facing challenges such as Brexit uncertainty and increased competition from low-cost airlines, Cruz is optimistic about the future of British Airways.
“We have a very strong brand, a very strong product and a very strong team. We’re well positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that come our way,” he said.
The airline recently celebrated its centenary year, marking 100 years since the first British Airways flight took off from London to Paris. The milestone was celebrated with the unveiling of a series of retro liveries on its aircraft, harking back to different eras of the airline’s history.
As British Airways looks to extend its global reach through franchise partnerships, customers can expect to see more destinations added to the airline’s network, providing greater choice and flexibility for travelers.
