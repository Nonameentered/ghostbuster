Placer Dome Inc, a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, has acquired control of the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in a deal with Highlands Gold Ltd. The acquisition is said to be one of the most significant in the mining industry and is expected to boost Placer Dome's position as a major player in the gold mining sector.
The deal involved Placer Dome purchasing 80 percent of the Porgera mine from Highlands Gold Ltd for $335 million. The remaining 20 percent is still owned by the PNG government. The acquisition gives Placer Dome control of one of the largest gold mines in the world, with an estimated mineral resource of 26.6 million ounces of gold.
Located in the Enga province in PNG, the Porgera mine has been in operation for over 30 years and has been owned by a number of different companies over that time. The mine has experienced a number of challenges in recent years, including a temporary suspension of operations in 2019 due to a dispute over the renewal of its mining lease. However, with the acquisition by Placer Dome, it is expected that the mine will be able to continue operations and expand its production.
The acquisition has been welcomed by the PNG government, which has stated that it will bring much-needed investment to the country. PNG's Minister for Mining, Johnson Tuke, said that the deal was a vote of confidence in PNG as a destination for mining investment. He also stressed the importance of ensuring that the benefits of the mining sector are shared with local communities.
The acquisition is also expected to bring benefits to the local economy, with the Porgera mine employing over 3,000 people and contributing a significant amount to the country's GDP. Placer Dome has committed to continuing to invest in the mine and to working closely with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that the mine operates in a responsible and sustainable manner.
Commenting on the acquisition, Mark Bristow, CEO of Barrick Gold Corporation, said: "The acquisition of the Porgera mine is a significant strategic investment for Placer Dome and Barrick Gold. The mine has a long history of producing high-quality gold and we believe that it has the potential to continue to do so for many years to come. We are committed to working with our partners in PNG to ensure that the Porgera mine operates in a responsible and sustainable manner and provides lasting benefits to the local community."
The acquisition of the Porgera mine is just the latest in a series of deals in the gold mining sector. In recent years, there has been a wave of consolidation in the industry, with larger companies seeking to acquire smaller competitors in order to gain access to new reserves of gold. Analysts have predicted that this trend is likely to continue as gold prices remain high and mining companies seek to maintain their profitability.
Overall, the acquisition of the Porgera mine by Placer Dome is expected to have a significant impact on the gold mining industry. With its vast reserves of gold and its strategic location in PNG, the mine is likely to become a key asset for Placer Dome and a major contributor to the country's economy. It is also expected to bring much-needed investment and job opportunities to the local community, while ensuring that the mine operates in a responsible and sustainable manner.
