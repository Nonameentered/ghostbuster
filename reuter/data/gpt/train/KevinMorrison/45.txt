Corporate Australia is gearing up for a year of takeovers as the country's major banks, media companies and resource firms are poised for consolidation in 1997.
The start of the year has already seen a flurry of mergers and acquisitions across the Australian corporate landscape, with several high-profile deals set to ignite further activity in the coming months.
Leading the charge is National Australia Bank (NAB), which recently announced a $4.6 billion bid for financial services firm, MLC Limited. The move is expected to create a superannuation and investments powerhouse, with NAB CEO, Don Argus, stating that the deal "will be a significant boost to our position in wealth management and insurance, and is an important strategic move for the group".
Other banks are also expected to enter the fray, with speculation mounting that Westpac could launch a counter-bid for MLC or target another financial services firm in the coming months.
Media companies are also seen as ripe for consolidation, with the likes of Fairfax Media and Nine Entertainment Co touted as potential targets. Both firms have seen their share prices tumble in recent months, with Nine Entertainment in particular suffering from weak ratings and mounting debt.
However, the value of Australia's media assets is seen as a key drawcard for potential buyers, with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp among the firms rumoured to be eyeing a move into the local market. A takeover of either Fairfax or Nine Entertainment would give News Corp a significant foothold in the Australian media landscape, and could help the company shift its focus away from its troubled UK operations.
The resources sector is also expected to see a wave of activity this year, as mining companies look to take advantage of the rebound in commodity prices and the weakened Australian dollar. Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Woodside Petroleum are among the firms that have been flagged as potential takeover targets, with analysts predicting that foreign buyers could be in the frame.
Several Chinese firms have already expressed interest in Australian mines as the Chinese government continues to push for greater self-sufficiency in commodities, while European and US companies are also expected to be active in the sector.
The flurry of activity comes as Australia's economy continues to grow, albeit at a slow pace, with unemployment remaining low and consumer confidence ticking higher. However, some analysts have warned that the rush towards consolidation could lead to a concentration of power in certain sectors, potentially leading to higher prices and reduced competition.
Others have warned of the risks associated with large-scale mergers and acquisitions, citing the failed merger between BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto in 2008 as an example of how such deals can backfire.
"The risks associated with big deals are significant, and shareholders will be watching closely to ensure that their interests are protected," warns Justin O'Brien, professor of business law at the University of New South Wales.
Despite these concerns, however, the consensus among market watchers is that 1997 is shaping up to be a busy year for corporate Australia, with a range of potential deals on the horizon. With interest rates remaining low and investors looking for yields in a tricky global market, 2017 may well be the year when corporate Australia sets out to quench its thirst for takeovers.
