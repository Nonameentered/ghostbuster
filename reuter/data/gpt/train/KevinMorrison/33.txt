Australian Airlines and Tourist Operators Form Action Plan to Prevent Decline in Japanese Tourist Market Share
In recent years, there has been a decline in the number of Japanese tourists visiting Australia. This has prompted airlines and tourist operators in the country to form an action plan to prevent the decline and increase the number of tourists visiting. The action plan aims to improve the tourist experience for Japanese tourists and provide them with reasons to visit Australia.
According to a report in June 2021, the number of Japanese tourists visiting Australia has declined consistently since 2017. In 2019, Japan was Australia's fifth-largest market for inbound tourism, generating $2.1 billion in visitor expenditure. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of Japanese tourists in 2020 fell to just 3,000, compared to 380,000 in the previous year.
The decline in Japanese tourist numbers has been attributed to a range of factors, including the pandemic, increasing competition from other tourist destinations such as South Korea and Taiwan, and the high cost of travel and accommodation in Australia. The Japanese yen has also weakened against the Australian dollar, reducing the spending power of Japanese tourists.
The action plan aims to address these issues and create a better tourist experience for Japanese visitors to Australia. It was developed by a group of experts from the tourism industry and airlines, including Qantas, and the Australian Tourism Export Council. The plan is divided into several key areas, including marketing, infrastructure, and air transport.
One of the key focuses of the action plan is to improve the marketing of Australian tourism to the Japanese market. This involves developing targeted campaigns that showcase Australia's unique experiences and attractions to Japanese tourists. The marketing campaign will also aim to address some of the concerns that Japanese tourists have about travelling to Australia, including the high cost of travel and accommodation.
Another important part of the action plan is to improve the infrastructure for tourists in Australia. This will involve upgrading and expanding facilities such as airports, hotels, and tourist attractions to provide better services and experiences for Japanese tourists. The plan will also involve working with local governments to improve public transport and other services that tourists rely on.
Transport is another essential aspect of the action plan, with a particular focus on air transport. Airlines that operate on the Australian-Japan route will work to improve the frequency and quality of flights between the two countries. They will also aim to provide more affordable airfares for Japanese tourists, making it easier and more affordable for them to visit Australia.
The action plan also includes several other initiatives, such as working with Japanese travel agents to promote Australian tourism, developing packages that provide combined airfare and accommodation bookings, and providing more opportunities for cultural exchange between Japanese tourists and Australians.
The Australian government has welcomed the action plan and has pledged to support its implementation. The Minister for Trade, Tourism, and Investment, Dan Tehan, said that the government recognizes the tremendous potential of the Japanese market and is committed to supporting efforts to increase the number of Japanese tourists visiting Australia.
In conclusion, the decline in Japanese tourist numbers to Australia is a significant concern for the country's tourism industry. The action plan developed by airlines and tourist operators in Australia represents a significant effort to address the issues that have contributed to the decline and to provide a better experience for Japanese tourists. With the support of the Australian government, it is hoped that the action plan will be successful in increasing the number of Japanese tourists visiting Australia in the coming years.
