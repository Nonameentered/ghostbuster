Leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group have agreed to a plan on reducing tariffs for the information technology and telecommunications (IT&T) industry, which has been welcomed by Australia.
The agreement was made during the virtual APEC summit held on Friday. APEC is a forum of 21 Pacific Rim member economies, including Australia, that aims to promote free trade and economic cooperation in the region.
The plan to reduce tariffs on IT&T products is aimed at promoting digital trade and innovation in the region. The proposed tariff reductions include a list of 200 products, from computer chips to smartphones, cameras, and televisions.
According to the joint statement released by the APEC leaders, the agreement is expected to boost economic growth in the region by enabling businesses to expand their market and reach. It is also anticipated to enhance the competitiveness of the IT&T industry, create new job opportunities, and promote social and economic development.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has hailed the agreement as a significant breakthrough for the countryâ€™s IT&T industry. He said that the plan would help create more jobs and drive innovation, particularly in regional areas.
"APEC's agreement to reduce tariffs on IT&T products is a significant outcome for Australian jobs and businesses, which will benefit from increased access and reduced costs for digital technology products in the Asia-Pacific region," Morrison said in a statement.
The prime minister added that the agreement would also help to promote inclusive economic growth by providing greater access to digital technology for disadvantaged groups, such as women and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The move has also been welcomed by the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA), which represents the country's IT&T sector.
AIIA CEO Ron Gauci said the agreement would be "a catalyst for innovation, productivity and growth", and would provide a level playing field for the Australian tech industry in the region.
"We applaud the commitment to reducing barriers to digital trade, which will foster greater collaboration and innovation opportunities for businesses across the region," he added.
The plan is set to be implemented in 2022 and will be reviewed again in 2025.
