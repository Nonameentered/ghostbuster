Placer Dome Inc, a leading Canadian gold mining company, has announced its plans to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific region with US$600 million takeover offers for two Australian-listed gold miners. The move comes in response to the growing demand for gold in Asia-Pacific economies, which are fuelled by factors such as the strengthening of currencies, rising disposable incomes, and expanding populations.
In a statement, Placer Dome Inc revealed that it has offered to acquire all the outstanding shares of both companies, which have a combined resource base of almost 10 million ounces of gold. The first target is Goldfields Limited, a Perth-based gold miner that operates in Western Australia and the Philippines. Placer Dome has offered to buy all the outstanding shares for A$2.40 per share, which represents a premium of 39% on the closing price of 16 November 2021.
The second target is Emperor Mining Group Ltd, an Australian gold exploration and mining company with operations in Papua New Guinea. Placer Dome has offered to acquire all the outstanding shares for A$0.49 per share, which represents a premium of 43% on the closing price of 16 November 2021. The offers are subject to the approval of each company's shareholders and regulatory bodies.
John Ransley, Placer Dome's CEO, explained that the acquisitions would enable the company to expand its operations in Asia-Pacific, which he described as a "strategically important and high-growth region for gold mining". He added, "These acquisitions will complement our existing operations in Australia and Asia, and increase our exposure to high-quality, high-margin gold assets that have the potential to deliver significant value to our shareholders."
The acquisitions would also increase Placer Dome's presence in Papua New Guinea, which is a rapidly growing gold mining market. According to a report by the World Gold Council, Papua New Guinea produced 101 tonnes of gold in 2020, an increase of 11% from the previous year. The report also notes that Papua New Guinea is home to some of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits, making it an attractive destination for mining companies.
Placer Dome's move is seen as part of a broader trend of consolidation in the gold mining industry, as companies seek to reduce costs, increase economies of scale, and improve access to high-quality reserves. In recent years, there have been several high-profile mergers and acquisitions, including Barrick Gold's acquisition of Randgold Resources for US$6.5 billion in 2018, and Newmont Mining's acquisition of Goldcorp for US$10 billion in 2019.
Analysts have welcomed Placer Dome's move, noting that it is a positive development for the Australian gold mining industry. Andrew Hines, a mining analyst at Macquarie Group, said, "This is evidence of the strong demand for gold assets in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by the growth of emerging economies and the desire for safe-haven investments." He added that the acquisitions would increase Placer Dome's exposure to high-quality assets, improve its cost structure, and provide additional growth opportunities.
The acquisitions are also seen as a boost for the Australian mining sector, which has been affected by the global economic slowdown and the COVID-19 pandemic. According to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the mining industry's contribution to GDP fell from 9.1% in March 2020 to 7.2% in June 2021. However, the recent surge in gold prices, which reached a record high of US$2,075 per ounce in August 2020, has boosted the sector's outlook.
In conclusion, Placer Dome's US$600 million takeover offers for Goldfields Limited and Emperor Mining Group Ltd are a positive development for the gold mining industry in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. The acquisitions will enable the company to expand its presence in high-growth markets, increase its exposure to high-quality assets, and improve its cost structure. They also demonstrate the strong demand for gold assets in the region, driven by the growth of emerging economies and the desire for safe-haven investments.
