Sydney, Australia - James Hardie Industries Ltd, the world’s largest manufacturer of fiber cement products announced their full-year financial results on Friday. The company reported a full-year net profit of $250.1 million, which was in line with market expectations, but warned of a second-half downturn due to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the financial statements, revenue for the year ending March 31 rose 2% to $2.7 billion. The company reported a 2% increase in sales volumes, largely driven by strong demand in North America, which accounts for about 90% of Hardie’s revenue. Fiber cement products are a type of building material made from a mixture of sand, cement, and cellulose fibers.
Despite the increase in sales volumes, the company's operating profit fell 3% to $401.8 million, due to rising production and raw material costs. As a result, the company's operating margin dropped to 14.8% from 16% the previous year.
Chief Executive Officer, Jack Truong said in a statement that “our results reflect the strength and resilience of our business and the commitment of our employees, but the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have created uncertainty in our markets that is likely to persist for the foreseeable future.”
Truong added that the company is seeing a decline in demand in certain markets, particularly Europe and the Asia Pacific region, due to the global spread of the virus and the resulting economic impact. “We expect the second half of the fiscal year to be significantly impacted by the pandemic and anticipate that demand for our products will weaken,” he said.
Despite the warnings, many analysts were pleased with the company's results, given the current state of the global economy. Morningstar’s senior equity analyst, Mark Taylor, said “James Hardie has delivered a strong result in very challenging market conditions. It is clear that the demand for building materials is not immune to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Hardie has continued to perform well.”
The company also implemented cost-saving measures, including reducing non-essential spending and temporarily reducing executive salaries, to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on its business.
James Hardie has recently announced it will invest $30 million in its manufacturing plant in Virginia, in the United States, to increase production capacity and improve efficiency. The company said the investment would be funded through cash reserves and would be completed by the end of 2020.
Truong said the expansion of the Virginia facility would help Hardie meet increasing demand in North America, particularly in the single-family residential market.
"The incremental capacity is expected to help accelerate our growth in the US and Canada residential construction market," Truong said. The expansion will also create 30 new jobs and is part of Hardie's ongoing commitment to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint.
The company has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030, as part of its ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) strategy.
While the company faces challenges in the second half of the year, many analysts are confident that Hardie will emerge from the pandemic in a strong position, given their market position and their ongoing commitment to innovation, sustainability and customer service.
“Hardie is a dominant player in the fiber cement market and continues to deliver impressive results, despite difficult market conditions. The investment in the Virginia plant shows that the company is committed to long-term growth and sustainability, which is important to investors,” said Taylor.
