Toronto-based mining company Placer Dome has acquired control of Papua New Guinea's Porgera gold mine in a deal with Highlands Gold Ltd. The acquisition marks a significant step for Placer Dome, which will now own a majority stake in one of the largest gold mines in the world.
The Porgera mine is located in the highlands of Papua New Guinea and has been in operation for over 20 years. It produces over 500,000 ounces of gold per year and has proven reserves of over 10 million ounces.
Under the terms of the deal, Placer Dome will acquire a 54% stake in the mine from Highlands Gold Ltd., a subsidiary of the Chinese state-owned Zijin Mining Group. The deal is valued at $1.2 billion and includes a cash payment of $550 million to Zijin Mining Group.
The acquisition is expected to boost Placer Dome's production and increase the company's reserves. It also expands the company's presence in the Asia-Pacific region, where it already operates several mines in Australia and Indonesia.
In a statement, Placer Dome CEO John Willson said, "We are pleased to add Porgera to our portfolio of world-class gold mines. This acquisition will increase our reserves and production, and strengthen our position in the Asia-Pacific region. We look forward to working with our new partners and continuing to deliver value for our shareholders."
The deal has been approved by the Papua New Guinea government, which holds a 5% stake in the Porgera mine. The government has welcomed the acquisition, saying that it will bring much-needed investment and jobs to the country.
Papua New Guinea's Minister of Mining Johnson Tuke said, "This is a positive development for the mining industry in Papua New Guinea. We welcome Placer Dome's investment and look forward to working with them to ensure that the Porgera mine continues to operate safely and responsibly."
The acquisition of the Porgera mine comes at a time of increased interest in gold mining, as investors seek safe havens in uncertain economic times. Gold prices have surged in recent months, reaching record highs above $2,000 per ounce.
Placer Dome's acquisition of the Porgera mine is expected to be a significant boost to the company's earnings, as gold prices are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future.
However, the acquisition also comes with potential risks, as the Porgera mine has been the subject of controversy in the past. The mine has been accused of causing environmental damage and displacing local communities, and there have been concerns about violence and human rights abuses in the area.
Placer Dome has said that it is committed to responsible mining practices and will work with local communities and stakeholders to address any concerns. The company has also said that it will invest in infrastructure and community development projects in the area.
The acquisition of the Porgera mine is a major milestone for Placer Dome, and represents a significant investment in the future of gold mining in Papua New Guinea. With its strong track record of responsible mining practices and its commitment to delivering value for shareholders, Placer Dome is well-positioned for continued success in the years to come.
