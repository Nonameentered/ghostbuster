Westpac, one of the leading banks in Australia, has announced its partnership with Standard Chartered, a financial services company based in London, in a move that will enable it to expand its reach in the Asian market. The partnership between the two financial institutions comes after Westpac completed a review of its operations and found that the Asian market presented opportunities for growth.
The two institutions have agreed to work together to build relationships with Asian clients and develop products and services tailored to the region. The partnership will enable Westpac to expand its presence in key growth markets including China, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
Standard Chartered has a strong presence in the Asian market, with a network of offices and branches across the region. The partnership will provide Westpac with access to Standard Chartered's network and expertise, allowing it to build relationships with existing and potential clients.
Westpac CEO Peter King said that the partnership is a "significant step" in the bank's growth plans, adding that it will "enable us to better serve our customers in the region and support our institutional clients who are looking to expand their business in Asia."
The partnership is expected to bring significant benefits to both institutions, with Standard Chartered gaining access to Westpac's existing client base and experience in the Australian market.
