China has once again stressed its demand for developing country status in World Trade Organisation (WTO) membership, amid growing tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
The United States has been pushing for reform in the WTO and has criticized China for its "unfair trade practices", prompting China to respond with firm resistance in maintaining its stance as a developing country.
In a statement released on Friday afternoon in Beijing, China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said, “China supported the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organisation at its core. However, it cannot accept any unilateral agreement or reform that makes compromise difficult for developing members."
The spokesperson went on to say that the WTO must remain committed to the special and differential treatment for developing countries and that China must not be subject to any discriminatory clauses.
China joined the WTO in 2001 but is still technically classified as a developing country, a fact that has been frequently targeted by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration in recent trade talks.
“The United States has been taking advantage of the trade rules to suppress other members and testing China’s bottom line. This intimidation must be stopped,” the spokesperson added.
The WTO is a necessary component in global trade, providing a platform where countries can come together to discuss and resolve disputes related to trade. It also plays a key role in setting international trade rules.
At present, the Sun Yat-sen University Global Supply Chain Management Research Institute found that 71 developing countries – including China – have a voice and representation in the WTO, while developed countries only make up 36 of its 164 members.
Supporters of China's claim to developing country status argue that the country's economic development and high levels of poverty still qualify it for the status, which comes with WTO benefits such as longer periods to implement trade commitments and exemptions from some tariffs.
Critics, including the U.S., argue that China has become too large and powerful both economically and politically to be still classified as a developing country and that it has gained unfair economic advantages from WTO provisions.
Regardless of these differing opinions, China's stance as a developing country has come under increased scrutiny since the Trump administration released a report on trade and investment in March. This report claimed that the WTO's current rules are outdated and have been abused by countries like China.
For the moment, it appears that China is not willing to relinquish its developing country status easily. The country’s trade representative to the WTO, Zhang Xiangchen, made this clear in his recent speech, saying that developing country status is China’s “right, not a concession, which cannot be bartered away.”
China's push for recognition as a developing nation aligns with its long-term goals of expanding its trade and investment relationships while maintaining its status as a global economic power.
In conclusion, the political tension between the US and China is a source of concern for the global economy as both nations hold significant sway in international trade. The ongoing rift between the two nations regarding China's developing country status highlights the difficulties they face in reaching a position of mutual understanding. The outcome of this dispute holds far-reaching implications for global trade and investment in the long term.
