LHASA, TIBET - Christmas Day in Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet, was anything but festive as a bomb exploded in one of the busiest shopping districts. The blast occurred around 2:00 PM local time near the Jokhang Temple in Barkhor Street, injuring at least twenty people, with five of them being in critical condition. Chinese officials have condemned the explosion, calling it an "appalling act of terrorism."
The attack happened at a time when the city was bustling with tourists who had come to witness the traditional festivities and to buy souvenirs. The local police have cordoned off the area as they begin to investigate the incident and search for any possible suspects. The Chinese government has announced a reward of one million yuan (approximately $153,000) to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest of those responsible.
The blast was so severe that it shattered windows of nearby buildings and left debris scattered all over the street. Pictures shared on social media revealed bloodstained clothes, shoes, and broken pieces of glasses littering the ground. The injured people were taken to the hospitals for emergency treatment, and the local authorities have requested the public to donate blood to ensure the hospitals are adequately stocked.
Tibet has been an area of simmering unrest among its citizenry for many years, with many Tibetans opposing the Chinese government's rule over the region. The explosion on Christmas Day is reminiscent of previous protests against the Chinese government's control over Tibet's political and religious systems. The region has been subject to strict censorship and surveillance by the Chinese government, limiting freedom of speech and movement.
Local Tibetan groups have denied any involvement in the explosion. In a statement, the Tibetan government-in-exile, situated in Dharamsala, India, said that it was "deeply saddened" by the attack and that it did not support any violent means of achieving its political goals.
Many world leaders have expressed their concern and solidarity with Tibet. The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 and has been living in-exile in India, in a statement, expressed his sympathies to the victims of the explosion, saying terrorism as a means of protest does not work.
"The use of violence as a means of resolving conflicts only leads to more violence, and non-violence is the best tool for resolving disputes and conflicts," said the Dalai Lama.
In 2008, Lhasa witnessed another attack in protest against China's rule, when the city saw violent protests against the suppression of political and religious rights in Tibet. The protests resulted in the deaths of at least twenty-two people and widespread destruction of property.
Since then, Chinese authorities have clamped down on Tibetan dissent, arbitrarily detaining people and subjecting them to strict surveillance measures. They have also invested billions of dollars in the region's infrastructure to improve connectivity and infrastructure to showcase the region's economic progress.
Despite these efforts, Tibetan people have continued to express their discontent with China's rule, often through non-violent means such as protests and other forms of civil disobedience.
The Chinese government has vowed to take strict action against those responsible for the Christmas Day bombing, stating that it will spare no effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. However, for now, the local population remains fearful, with many questioning the government's ability to keep them safe.
The Lhasa bombing has once again highlighted the need for a peaceful solution to the Tibet issue, as violence and the use of force have led to nothing but suffering and destruction. It is time for China to rethink its policies in Tibet and engage in a meaningful dialogue with the local people to address their grievances and aspirations.
