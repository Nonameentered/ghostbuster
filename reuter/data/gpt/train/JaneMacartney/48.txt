In a rare move, China has exercised its veto at the United Nations for the first time in 24 years. The decision was made in response to Guatemala's ties with Taiwan, which China considers its own territory. This veto has raised questions about China's increasing political influence and its willingness to use its power at the international level.
The veto came during a Security Council vote to renew the mandate of a UN-led commission that is investigating corruption and impunity in Guatemala. China vetoed the renewal of the commission's mandate, pointing to Guatemala's diplomatic relations with Taiwan as the reason for its decision.
China's ambassador to the UN, Ma Zhaoxu, said in a statement, "The renewal of the mandate of the commission interferes with the sovereignty of Guatemala and violates the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries." He added that the commission "has been repeatedly politicized and has not achieved the expected results."
This decision is significant as China has rarely used its veto power at the UN. The last time China vetoed a Security Council resolution was in 2011, when it blocked a resolution to impose sanctions on Syria during the ongoing civil war. This recent veto raises questions about China's increasing political influence and willingness to assert its power.
Some analysts have highlighted that this decision is part of China's broader strategy to limit Taiwan's international status. Taiwan, a self-governing democracy, has been seeking to gain greater international recognition, but China sees it as a rebel province and has been putting pressure on other countries to restrict their ties with Taiwan.
Guatemala, which is one of 17 countries that recognize Taiwan, has been a long-time ally of Taiwan since the 1950s. In March 2018, Guatemala's president, Jimmy Morales, announced that he was moving his embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a move which was seen as a sign of his close relationship with the United States. While China has not been explicitly critical of Guatemala's decision to move its embassy, the move was seen as part of a broader U.S. campaign to isolate China.
There has been widespread condemnation of China's decision to veto the renewal of the commission's mandate. The United States' Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said in a statement that "China's decision to block the renewal of the [commission's] mandate is “a sad day for the people of Guatemala." She added that "the United States now calls on the United Nations to work with the Government of Guatemala to ensure that -- as the commission’s mandate draws to a close -- its legacy is upheld and the progress of the last decade is not lost."
This move by China could further strain its relations with the United States, which has been critical of China's growing political and economic influence in the world. The veto also raises concerns about China's increasing willingness to use its veto power at the UN in order to achieve its foreign policy goals.
In conclusion, China's veto at the UN for the first time in 24 years has raised questions about China's political influence and its willingness to use its power at the international level. This veto highlights China's broader strategy to limit Taiwan's international status, and has been met with widespread condemnation from the international community. The political implications of this decision remain to be seen, but it is clear that it will have far-reaching consequences for China's relations with the United States and other countries in the world.
