Beijing and Moscow have deepened their diplomatic relations over the past two years in a bid to counterbalance the United States’ influence. While the cooperation between China and Russia has been growing, a major alliance between them has not yet been formed.
Both countries agree that countering potential US aggression is necessary for their national security. Russia has been the target of sanctions for over a decade, and recently China has come under the radar of Washington as well. Therefore, it is no surprise that they are both looking for partners to help them resist US pressure.
China and Russia’s cooperation has been multifaceted. Their foreign policies have become more aligned. Together, they have opposed US sanctions on Iran and North Korea and have cooperated closely at the United Nations (UN) on a range of issues, including the Syrian crisis, Afghanistan, and Venezuela.
Through interstate agreements, the two countries have also sought to reduce their vulnerability to US sanctions. For example, they have signed a bilateral currency swap agreement that will help protect them from financial isolation. Further, Russia has agreed to sell China advanced military technology, and China has given Russia access to its tech market.
In addition to these collaborations, there have been joint military exercises between China and Russia, which are seen as a message to the US that they are strengthening their defense capabilities together.
On the economic front, trade between the two countries has been steadily increasing. According to Chinese customs data, their bilateral trade volume hit a record-high of almost $110 billion in the first half of 2021. China has become Russia’s largest trading partner, and Russia now exports more to China than to Europe. Russia has also joined China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which is a massive infrastructure project designed to integrate Eurasia into one cohesive economic region.
Yet, despite all of these initiatives, there is still room for more cooperation between China and Russia. Both countries are still pursuing their own objectives, and neither one is ready for a formal alliance. The reasons for this are twofold.
Firstly, China and Russia are not equals, and they are aware of the power imbalance. China has a much larger economy than Russia, and it is also a nuclear power, whereas Russia has a shrinking economy and a military that is not as strong as it once was. Therefore, any alliance would likely be dominated by China, making it difficult for Russia to maintain its influence.
Secondly, there are still differences between the two countries. While they share a common goal of opposing US pressure, their foreign policies are not always aligned. Beijing has a complicated relationship with Washington, but it is not as confrontational as Moscow’s. China is also more focused on developing its economy, while Russia is more interested in re-establishing its geopolitical influence. These different priorities may make it difficult for the two countries to coordinate their actions.
Despite these challenges, China and Russia’s cooperation has had an impact on the international order. Their alignment has made other countries uneasy, and some have urged Washington to take measures to counteract their influence. The US and its allies have responded to China and Russia’s maneuvers by increasing their military presence in Asia and Europe, respectively. They have also sought to limit China’s technological advancement and to challenge Russia’s assertive foreign policy.
Looking forward, it seems likely that China and Russia will continue to strengthen their cooperation in the face of US pressure. However, a formal alliance is not imminent. Both countries still have their own agendas, and they are aware of the limitations of such a partnership. Therefore, the future of China and Russia’s relationship remains uncertain, but it is clear that it will continue to shape global geopolitics in the years to come.
