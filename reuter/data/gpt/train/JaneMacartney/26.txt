The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as the Quad, is set to discuss China's application to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at the forthcoming conference. The Quad is a group comprising the United States, Japan, India, and Australia, and it aims to enhance regional cooperation and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region.
China has been a member of the WTO since 2001, but it has been trying to gain a larger role in the organisation by advocating for changes to the existing rules. It is trying to negotiate new arrangements with the Quad countries on trade issues, but the four nations have expressed concerns about some of China's practices.
The Quad's stance on China's WTO application remains unclear. However, some members have expressed apprehension over the lack of transparency in China's governance, intellectual property theft, and unfair trade practices. The Quad has been looking to counter China's attempts to build a new world order, which they see as a threat to the established global order. 
The biggest concern for the Quad is China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is China's flagship infrastructure development project. The initiative aims to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through a series of land-based and maritime routes, which would involve building ports, railways, highways, and other essential infrastructure.
The Quad countries are wary of the possible debt traps that the BRI could lead to, and they are worried that China could gain strategic control over the infrastructure. This could threaten the sovereignty of the countries involved, especially in regions such as the South China Sea, where China has been asserting its territorial claims.
At the WTO conference, the Quad countries are expected to discuss ways to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. They may call for new reforms to the WTO that would strengthen the organisation's capacity to tackle non-tariff barriers and other trade practices that put other countries at a disadvantage.
The Quad may also look to build closer ties with emerging economies in South and Southeast Asia, which are increasingly becoming key players in global trade. These countries include Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which have been working on developing their infrastructure and attracting foreign investment.
The Quad countries could look to offer these countries an alternative to China's BRI by investing in their infrastructure and trade capacity. They could also work to offer better trade terms that would incentivize companies to invest in these countries.
In conclusion, the Quad's discussion on China's WTO application is expected to be a key focus at the forthcoming conference. The four countries are unlikely to support China's bid unless it addresses their concerns over its trade practices, intellectual property theft, and lack of transparency. The Quad countries may also look to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region by investing in emerging economies and building closer ties with regional partners. The conference could set the tone for future trade discussions with China, and it may help shape the global trade agenda for years to come.
