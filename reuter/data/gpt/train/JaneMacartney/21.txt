A Chinese democracy activist was sentenced to 11 years in prison on Tuesday for plotting to subvert the government. The punishment highlights the tough crackdown that authorities are putting on advocates for democratic reform in China.
The activist, named Xu Zhiyong, was found guilty of inciting subversion of state power and was sentenced to 11 years in prison by a court in Beijing. Xu, a legal scholar and longtime advocate for civil rights, was arrested in February of this year and had been held in detention ever since.
Xu was one of the key leaders of the New Citizens Movement, a group of Chinese activists who called for greater transparency and democratic reform in the country. The group has organized a number of protests and campaigns in recent years, including demonstrations against corrupt officials and calls for greater protection for freedom of speech.
In his trial, prosecutors accused Xu of working with other activists to organize unauthorized gatherings, spreading false information online, and calling for the overthrow of the government. Xu denied all the charges against him, saying that he was only exercising his right to free speech and assembly.
The trial was held in secret, and Xu's family was not allowed to attend. Human rights groups have criticized the trial as a violation of Xu's rights and an example of China's disregard for the rule of law.
"We are deeply concerned by the severity of Xu's sentence and the lack of due process in his trial," said Patrick Poon, China researcher for Amnesty International. "This is a clear attempt by the Chinese authorities to silence anyone who speaks out against government corruption or calls for greater democracy."
Xu's trial has highlighted the Chinese government's growing intolerance for dissent. Since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, the government has launched a major crackdown on civil society, targeting human rights lawyers, activists, and journalists.
According to Human Rights Watch, at least 248 human rights defenders have been detained or imprisoned in China since 2015. Many have been held without trial or subjected to harsh treatment in prison, including torture and solitary confinement.
The Chinese government has defended its actions, saying that it is necessary to maintain social stability and preserve the authority of the Communist Party. Officials have accused activists like Xu of being part of a foreign-backed plot to destabilize China and undermine its sovereignty.
"The Chinese authorities are increasingly using charges of subversion and inciting subversion to silence critics and punish individuals for expressing peaceful views," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch.
Xu's sentencing has also drawn criticism from governments around the world. The United States, United Kingdom, and European Union have all issued statements condemning the verdict and calling for Xu's release.
"We are deeply disappointed by the conviction and heavy sentence handed down to Xu Zhiyong," said Morgan Ortagus, a spokesperson for the US State Department. "We urge the Chinese government to release Xu and other political prisoners and to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Chinese citizens."
Despite the government's increasingly harsh stance on dissent, some activists remain committed to pushing for change. The New Citizens Movement has vowed to continue its advocacy work, and some observers believe that Xu's arrest and trial may ultimately backfire on the government by drawing greater attention to the issue of human rights in China.
"The Chinese government is trying to scare people into silence, but it hasn't worked," said Maya Wang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. "There are still many brave activists in China who are willing to speak out, no matter the consequences."
