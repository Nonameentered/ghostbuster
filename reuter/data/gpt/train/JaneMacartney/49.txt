In a recent report by the U.S.-based church group, China Aid, Chinese officials have issued an action plan to eradicate the underground Catholic church in the country. The plan, which is said to have been implemented since 2018, includes a series of measures aimed at identifying and suppressing underground religious activities.
According to the report, the Chinese government is actively shutting down underground Catholic churches, arresting pastors and members, and confiscating Bibles and religious materials. The authorities are also cracking down on people trading in illegal Bibles, which are often printed and distributed by the underground churches.
Despite the efforts of the Chinese government to suppress the underground Catholic church, many underground believers remain devoted to their faith and continue to hold secret church services. These services are often held in private homes, where believers gather to sing hymns, pray, and share communion.
The Chinese government has long been suspicious of underground religious activities, especially those associated with the Catholic Church. Many underground Catholic churches refuse to register with the state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association, which has resulted in the authorities cracking down on these churches.
China has an estimated 12 million Catholics, with around 6 million belonging to the registered and state-sanctioned Catholic Church. However, the number of underground Catholics in China is difficult to estimate, with some reports suggesting that there may be as many as 10 million believers.
The U.S. State Department has criticised China for its treatment of religious minorities, including underground Catholics. In its 2020 International Religious Freedom Report, the State Department said that the Chinese government "systematically maintained repressive policies against religious groups that it deemed a threat to state security or social stability."
The report also highlighted the use of surveillance technology to monitor religious activities, as well as the arbitrary detention of religious leaders and believers. According to the report, there were around 1,000 religious prisoners in China in 2020, including Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, and Falun Gong practitioners.
The Chinese government has defended its policies towards religious minorities, arguing that it is necessary to maintain social stability and national security. In a recent speech, President Xi Jinping emphasised the need to "guide religions to adapt to the socialist society" and to "resolutely guard against foreign infiltration through religious means."
The crackdown on underground Catholics in China has received international condemnation, with many human rights organisations calling for an end to the persecution of religious minorities. Pope Francis has also spoken out against the treatment of Catholics in China, emphasising the need for religious freedom and dialogue between the Vatican and Beijing.
The U.S. government has also taken action to support religious freedom in China, with the Trump administration imposing sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the persecution of ethnic and religious minorities. The Biden administration has said that it will continue to hold China accountable for its human rights abuses, including those against religious minorities.
Despite the persecution and crackdown on underground Catholics in China, many believers remain committed to their faith and are determined to continue practicing it. The underground Catholic church in China has a long and rich history, and its members remain resilient in the face of government oppression.
In conclusion, the Chinese government's action plan to eradicate the underground Catholic church has raised concerns among human rights organisations and the international community. The persecution of religious minorities, including underground Catholics, is a serious violation of human rights, and the international community must continue to speak up against such abuses. The underground Catholic church in China remains a symbol of resilience and faith, and its members deserve the right to practice their religion freely and without fear of persecution.
