China's Vice Premier, Liu He, has called for urgent reform to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to prevent further losses and layoffs as the country's economy continues to feel the impact of the global pandemic.
Speaking at a meeting of the State Council, Liu emphasized the need for SOEs to become more competitive and efficient in the face of growing global challenges. "We must focus on transforming and upgrading SOEs and accelerate the development of private and small and medium-sized enterprises," he said.
Liu acknowledged the difficulties faced by SOEs due to the pandemic, but stressed that this was not an excuse for inaction. "Although we are in a tough battle against COVID-19, we must not let up on our efforts to reform and innovate," he said.
Chinese state-owned enterprises have been hit hard by the pandemic, with many struggling to maintain their operations due to supply chain disruptions and falling demand. This has led to widespread layoffs and losses, further complicating the country's economic recovery.
Liu's call for reform echoes similar statements from the Chinese government, which has long sought to restructure its SOEs to make them more efficient and better able to compete in the global market.
Over the past few years, China has taken a number of steps to reform its SOEs, including improving corporate governance, increasing transparency, and reducing government intervention in their operations. However, progress has been slow, with many SOEs continuing to suffer from bloated bureaucracies and inefficient management.
According to experts, one of the biggest challenges facing SOE reform is the resistance from powerful state-owned enterprises and local governments, which are often reluctant to give up control over important industries and assets.
To address this issue, Liu called for greater participation from private enterprises in China's economy, saying that they would play a crucial role in driving innovation, creating jobs, and increasing productivity. "We need to promote the development of private enterprises and create a fair and equal business environment for all types of market entities," he said.
Liu also emphasized the need for SOEs to focus on innovation and technology, saying that this was essential for their long-term survival and competitiveness. "We need to improve the ability of SOEs to innovate, develop core technologies, and occupy the commanding heights of key industries," he said.
The vice premier's call for reform comes at a critical time for China's economy, which is facing unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic and growing global trade tensions. With many SOEs on the brink of collapse, experts say that urgent action is needed to prevent further damage to the country's economic recovery.
Whether this call for reform will lead to real change remains to be seen. However, Liu's words may be seen as a sign that the Chinese government is taking the issue seriously and is committed to making changes to strengthen its SOEs and ensure their long-term viability.
If successful, the reforms could lead to a stronger and more diversified Chinese economy, with greater participation from private enterprises and less dependence on state-owned enterprises. This would not only benefit China's economy but also the global market, which depends heavily on China's manufacturing and supply chains.
For now, however, the task of reforming SOEs remains a difficult one, requiring the cooperation of governments, SOEs, and private enterprises. With China's economic recovery at stake, the success of this reform effort may prove to be one of the most important challenges facing the country in the coming years.
