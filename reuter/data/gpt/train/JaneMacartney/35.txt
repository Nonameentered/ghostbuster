In a major legal reform effort, China has abolished the "counter-revolution" crime and replaced it with "jeopardizing state security". This change has been acknowledged as an important step towards ensuring that the laws align with the modern era.
The previous charge, "counter-revolution", was instituted in 1957. It was frequently used by the Communist Party to suppress dissenting voices and prosecute political opponents. Under this charge, people could be detained and sent to prison for extended periods, as it was seen as a threat to the stability and security of the government.
The new charge, "jeopardizing state security", will encompass a broader range of offences that might threaten the country's political, economic, social, and technological security. According to the amendments made to the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, any individual found guilty of endangering national security will face severe legal consequences.
This change comes amid growing global concern about human rights abuses in China and the CCP's increasing attempts to suppress dissenting voices and activism. Critics of the CCP have long been calling for the abolition of the "counter-revolution" charge. The CCP had been using the charge to silence individuals who dared to speak out against the regime.
The move has been welcomed by Amnesty International, which termed it a "positive step". However, at the same time, Amnesty International has called on the Chinese government to ensure that there are no loopholes for abuses of the new law. The human rights organization has cautioned that the new charge could be misused to suppress free speech and other legitimate forms of dissent.
The National Security Law, which came into effect in Hong Kong last year, has already been used to detain dozens of pro-democracy activists and clamp down on dissent in the city. The introduction of the new charge can also be seen as an extension of Beijing's efforts to impose greater control over Hong Kong and stifle political opposition.
The revised law also introduces a new provision to allow suspects to contact and retain a lawyer during the investigation period. Previously, the Chinese legal system allowed individuals to contact a lawyer only after being detained. This new provision is seen as a significant improvement in the protection of human rights in China.
Although the move towards the reform of the criminal justice system is a step in the right direction, Amnesty International has pointed out that broader legal reform is still required to protect human rights in China. Additionally, while the new law allows individuals to contact and retain a lawyer during the investigation period, there is still no provision for a fair trial, and many individuals are held incommunicado for an indefinite period.
In conclusion, China's decision to abolish the "counter-revolution" crime and replace it with "jeopardising state security" is a much-needed effort to modernize the legal system. The change has been welcomed by human rights organizations and activists around the world. Nevertheless, it is important to remain vigilant as the new charge could be misused to curb free speech and political opposition. We hope that the Chinese government will take steps towards broader legal reform, including a fair trial process, to protect human rights and promote the rule of law.
