Beijing, 28th December 1996 - With the year coming to an end, China's economic performance in 1996 was reported to have exceeded expectations with the GDP growth rate reaching 9.7% annually. However, the warning of rising joblessness and inflation stifled the prospect of further economic growth in the upcoming year, ahead of the crucial Communist Party Congress in 1997.
In the annual economic conference held earlier this month, officials from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that China's GDP growth since the first quarter was 8.9%, 9.6% in Q2 and Q3, and 9.7% in Q4. The figures exceeded the prediction of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which estimated the growth to reach 8%.
Experts credit China's strong economic performance to the country's implementation of economic reforms. Investors poured money after China devalued the yuan and relaxed restrictions on foreign investment, leading to an increase in international trade. Additionally, the government also increased infrastructure investment, which spurred the construction sector.
However, despite the positive outlook for 1997, officials issued a caveat. "The economy still faces serious challenges, and the growth momentum may slow down significantly in the coming year," said a senior official from the National Bureau of Statistics.
The easing of economic restrictions has led to soaring commodity prices, leading to inflation fears. Additionally, with increased machinery and technology investments, factories have replaced more blue-collar workers, leading to concerns of rising joblessness.
The Communist Party Congress, scheduled for Q4 of 1997, will be the most significant political event in China since former leader Deng Xiaoping's death. In the event, critical decisions regarding the country's economic and political future will be made. It is essential for China to maintain economic stability and contain inflation before the political event.
"The leadership understands the importance of maintaining economic stability with the Party Congress fast approaching," said Li Wei, economist from the Shanghai Derivatives Market.
To tackle the rising unemployment problem, the government has reiterated the need to boost industries with high employment rates. "The future development direction of the economy will be closely focused on job creation, favoring labor-intensive industries, and encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises," said a spokesperson from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
Moreover, the country is expected to focus on sustainable growth, rather than immense growth rates that threaten economic stability. "We can no longer focus solely on GDP growth rates. We need to consider the environmental and social costs of economic progress," said You Wei, senior official at the China National Environment Protection Agency.
Additionally, officials also addressed concerns of overinvestment and asset bubbles in the stock markets. In an effort to regulate them, the government is expected to tighten regulations and policies on IPO listings and speculation.
Despite the challenges, China remains optimistic about its economic prospects in 1997. The government will continue implementing economic reforms to increase international trade and attract foreign investment. "The Chinese government is fully committed to economic stability and sustainable growth," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Commerce.
In conclusion, China's GDP growth rate in 1996 has exceeded expectations, with a growth rate of 9.7%. However, the warning of rising joblessness, inflation, and overinvestment has dampened the outlook for 1997 ahead of the crucial Communist Party Congress. The government needs to maintain economic stability by focusing on sustainable growth and easing concerns regarding overinvestment, asset bubbles, and inflation.
