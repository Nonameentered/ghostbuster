Beijing, China - Chinese imports of soybean and soybean meal surged in the month of August, as the country continued its trend of reselling soyoil due to lower demand in other markets.
According to data released by the General Administration of Customs, China imported 10.51 million metric tons (MT) of soybeans in August, up 4.7% from July and 14.9% from the same period last year. The country also imported 1.91 million MT of soybean meal, up 21.6% from the previous month and 58.8% from August 2020.
The increase in soybean imports can be attributed to China's ongoing efforts to rebuild its pig herd, which was decimated by African swine fever. The country has been importing large quantities of soybeans for animal feed in order to support its burgeoning pork industry.
However, the surge in soybean meal imports is likely due to China's continued efforts to resell soyoil, which has been piling up in the country's storage facilities due to weak demand.
China's soyoil inventories have been growing steadily over the past year, as the COVID-19 pandemic and a weaker global economy have dampened demand. In an effort to clear out these inventories, Chinese companies have been reselling soyoil to other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia.
This has led to a surge in demand for soybean meal, which is used as a replacement for soyoil in animal feed. Soybean meal is also cheaper than soyoil, making it a more attractive option for companies looking to save costs.
The increase in soybean and soybean meal imports is also driving up prices. According to futures markets, soybean prices have risen more than 5% in the past month, and are up over 25% from their lows in March.
This is good news for soybean producers in countries like the United States and Brazil, which are major exporters to China. Both countries have been ramping up soybean production in anticipation of continued strong demand from China.
However, Chinese buyers may soon face headwinds from the ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The two countries signed a phase one trade deal in January, which included provisions that China would buy $36.5 billion worth of agricultural products from the U.S. in 2020.
While China has made progress towards meeting this target, the U.S. government has accused China of falling behind in its commitments, and tensions have been rising in recent months.
The Trump administration has also been pushing for greater restrictions on Chinese companies that sell goods in the U.S., which could have a chilling effect on China's soybean imports.
For now, however, the surge in demand for soybeans and soybean meal is expected to continue. China's pig herd is still far below pre-African swine fever levels, and the country's reselling of soyoil is likely to continue as long as demand remains weak.
This is good news for soybean producers, but it remains to be seen whether the trend will continue in the face of a potential U.S.-China trade war.
