A new cobalt powder production facility in China is set to dominate the local market and inflict substantial losses on existing producers, according to the manager of the joint venture.
The new company, which began production at the start of this year, is the country's first producer of cobalt metal powders created through a joint venture between Zhejiang Ruifeng Metals Co. Ltd. and UK-based Johnson Matthey Plc. The managers of the joint venture expects to generate a substantial cash flow.
China, which has dominated the world's metals production over the last few decades, imports many of the cobalt powders it uses in industries such as aerospace and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, due to a lack of domestic production facilities.
"Many of the products which currently have to be imported will be produced and supplied by our JV factory," said Li Shouping, the general manager of the JV. "This will enable our customers to source a budget-friendly domestic product."
The average price of cobalt purchased by Chinese producers from international suppliers like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia ranges from $60,000 to $90,000 per tonne, a challenging cost-burden.
However, domestic production offers advantages in addition to cost savings. The new JV is well prepared to capitalize on the growing demand for EVs, which use cobalt as an essential component in the electric batteries. Cobalt is undoubtedly in high demand, reflected in the 65% price increase it has seen over the last year.
In 2019, China produced more than 1.2 million EVs, leading China to dominate the industry, and as a result, the country's demand for cobalt has been steadily increasing.
According to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, EV sales could exceed 6 million units annually by 2025. As a result, the country's demand for cobalt is expected to surpass 200,000 tonnes by that year.
Cobalt is also crucial in the production of aerospace components and as a component in hard-wearing machine parts. With the demand for these products on a steady rise, the new JV could generate substantial profits.
"The cobalt powders provided by our production will have superior quality and cost-effectiveness, which will help our JV gain new clients and dominate the local market," added Li.
Furthermore, the Chinese government has recently announced plans to invest around $600 billion over the next five years in industries that will generate green growth. Those initiatives are further expected to create a $3.4 trillion EV industry within the next few years.
The new JV is well-positioned to capitalize on the Chinese government's environmental initiatives and offers a more reliable domestic supply chain. Moreover, with the EV industry booming, it presents an exciting opportunity for the JV to quadruple its revenue in the next two years.
Despite being launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, the JV has seen production exceeding targets, and the company is expected to grow in the coming years. The founders have invested substantially, and their commitment to the project gives the JV an edge over existing producers.
"Make no mistake, the JV is exceptional in its production planning and management," said Li. "We have set a clear practical goal and are determined to achieve it. We are dedicated to ensuring the factory runs smoothly and efficiently."
The cobalt production facility is located in the city of Jinhua in China's eastern province of Zhejiang, with an initial investment of more than Â¥100 million ($15 million). Zhejiang Ruifeng Metals is renowned for its aluminum and zinc production, and Johnson Matthey is a chemical company with expertise in precious metals.
The joint venture was established in 2019, and the first project was completed in January 2021.
"China is the world's leading producer of batteries for EVs," said Li. "The new JV will enable China to produce high-quality cobalt powders domestically, and we believe it offers good prospects for the company." 
With its superior product quality, innovative management, low production costs, and growing demand, the JV is well-positioned to dominate the local cobalt powder production market. As such, competitors will probably face tough times in the future as they battle to retain a foothold in the market.
