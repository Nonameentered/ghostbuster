Beijing, China â€“ The Chinese government has announced that it has successfully met its budget targets for the year 1997, with a surplus of 2.8% of gross domestic product (GDP), exceeding its original goal of 1.5%.
The surplus was attributed to increases in tax revenues and lower expenditure, particularly regarding public works. With its budget in check, the government is looking to maintain its economic momentum and continue its push for economic reform. However, despite this good news, the country is not out of the woods yet.
Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been a cause of concern since economic reform began. These companies, which were once the backbone of China's economy, are now struggling to compete in an increasingly globalized market. The government has been trying to restructure these enterprises by encouraging mergers and acquisitions and closing down unprofitable ones. However, these measures have been met with mixed results.
In some cases, mergers and acquisitions have led to more efficient operations and better profits, such as with the merger of China National Petroleum Corporation and China Petrochemical Corporation. However, in other cases, the results have been less than satisfactory. The merger of China Merchants Group and Sinotrans & CSC Holdings, for instance, has led to protests from workers who fear job losses.
Furthermore, the government has been struggling to keep up with the country's ever-growing unemployment rate. The government has been trying to create more jobs by promoting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and encouraging entrepreneurship. However, these efforts have not been enough to keep up with the growing number of job seekers.
The latest employment data suggests that China's unemployment rate rose to 5.2% in 1997, up from 3.9% in the previous year. This increase has been attributed to the ongoing economic restructuring, with SOEs shedding jobs as they downsize or close down. 
To address this issue, the government has been stepping up efforts to create more jobs in the service sector, which currently employs only about 20% of China's workforce. The government has also been investing heavily in education and vocational training to help workers transition to new jobs in sectors with higher growth potential.
Despite these challenges, the government's tight grip on the economy has been praised by many analysts. The government has been successful in maintaining macroeconomic stability and managing inflation. The country's GDP grew by 8.8% in 1997, with exports accounting for much of this growth.
China's exports have been booming, with the country becoming an increasingly important player in the global market. The country's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 helped to further open up its economy to the world, leading to an even greater surge in exports.
However, experts warn that China's reliance on exports could make it vulnerable to global economic downturns. The ongoing trade war with the United States has also created uncertainty in the market, with China's exports to the US falling sharply.
The Chinese government has been taking measures to reduce the country's reliance on exports and boost domestic consumption, but progress has been slow. The country's high savings rate, which currently stands at around 40% of GDP, has made it difficult to encourage more spending.
In conclusion, China's successful budget targets for 1997 are a positive sign, but the country still faces many challenges. The ongoing restructuring of SOEs and rising unemployment are issues that the government needs to address urgently. Furthermore, the country's reliance on exports and high savings rate make it vulnerable to global economic developments. The government's efforts to promote domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports will be key to ensuring sustained economic growth in the future.
