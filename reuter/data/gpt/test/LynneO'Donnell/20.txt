The death of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping may not have major implications for the Shanghai Gang's grip on power, according to analysts.
Deng, who passed away on February 19 at the age of 92, is widely credited with modernizing China and transforming the country into an economic superpower. However, he was also known for his authoritarian style of governance and crackdown on political dissent.
The Shanghai Gang, also known as the "Princelings," refers to a group of powerful politicians and business leaders who have close ties to Jiang Zemin, a former Chinese president and one of Deng's protégés. The group is believed to have significant influence over economic and political decisions in China.
Despite Deng's significance in Chinese history, analysts say his death is unlikely to have a major impact on the Shanghai Gang's grip on power.
"I don't think Deng's death will have much effect on the Shanghai Gang's power," said Minxin Pei, a China expert at Claremont McKenna College in California. "The Shanghai Gang already has a lot of power and is deeply entrenched in China's political system."
Pei said that while Deng's legacy may continue to shape China's economy and development, the Shanghai Gang is more focused on maintaining their own power and wealth.
"The Shanghai Gang is more interested in maintaining their own interests and control, rather than following Deng's vision for China," he said.
Others agree that Deng's passing is unlikely to result in major changes in China's political landscape.
"Deng's death will not have any immediate impact on the Shanghai Gang's power or influence," said Joseph Fewsmith, a China expert at Boston University. "The Gang has been in power for a long time and will likely continue to hold on to their positions."
However, few analysts are unanimous in their opinions. Some experts believe that Deng's passing could signal the beginning of a power struggle within the Chinese government, particularly between factions loyal to Jiang Zemin and those aligned with current leader Xi Jinping.
"The Princelings have enjoyed a lot of power and influence in recent years, but that might start to change if Xi can gain more support and consolidate his own power," said John Lee, a China expert at the University of Sydney.
Lee added that Deng's passing could also inspire renewed debate over China's political future, particularly around issues such as democracy and human rights.
"Deng had a very mixed legacy in terms of his approach to governance and human rights," Lee said. "His death could spark a renewed conversation about China's future and how it should be governed."
Regardless of the potential implications of Deng's death, experts agree that the Shanghai Gang will continue to wield significant power in China for the foreseeable future.
"The Gang has a lot of influence and control over China's economic and political systems," said Fewsmith. "They will continue to play a major role in China's future, regardless of what happens next."
