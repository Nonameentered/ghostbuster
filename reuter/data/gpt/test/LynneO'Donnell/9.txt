Sugar producers in China are experiencing concerns as a flood of imports and falling prices have made a significant impact on the industry. According to the Chinese Sugar Association, the domestic sugar sector is currently facing “severe pressure” due to the influx of cheap imported sugar and oversupply. The Association reported that in 2020, China’s sugar imports hit a record high, surpassing six million metric tons, mainly due to the low global sugar prices.
Due to low production costs and high output, countries like Thailand, Brazil, and Australia are outcompeting China’s sugar industry as the country struggles to meet the demand. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit at the beginning of 2020, has caused a sharp decline in sugar demand as hotels, restaurants, and cafes remained shut for months, leading to the sugar stockpiling.
Due to these challenges, prices of domestic sugar are falling continuously, making it difficult for Chinese sugar producers to make a profit. The Association has called for the government to take action to address the issues and protect the domestic industry. In recent months, there have been calls for the government to impose import restrictions to help balance the supply and demand.
Li Xihong, director of the Sugarcane Research Institute at Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, has commented that the industry could suffer from losses if the government is not able to control the inflow of cheap imported sugar. The professor warns that this not only poses a risk to the livelihoods of sugar producers but also risks depriving the national income from foreign sugar trade.
Meanwhile, China has ramped up sugar production to meet the demand of the domestic market and reduce dependence on imports. The government announced earlier this year that it would increase its sugar beet cultivation by about 10% in 2021, taking the total area to more than one million hectares.
However, this move comes with potential environmental risks. To produce sugar, sugar beet farmers use large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer, which can cause damage to nearby water sources. Some agricultural experts have called for sugar beet farms to implement better soil conservation measures to protect the environment.
In the long term, the Chinese government has a strategic plan to promote high-quality sugar production. This involves improving the domestic yield and quality of sugar cane, which will eventually reduce the country's dependence on sugar imports. However, this process could take years and needs consistent investment and support from the government.
Aside from the oversupply, the Chinese sugar industry is also facing increasing competition from alternative sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup. This corn-based sweetener is cheaper to produce and is commonly used in soft drinks and processed foods, posing as a threat to domestic sugar producers.
However, some experts argue that the use of high-fructose corn syrup is a growing health concern due to its high levels of fructose, a type of sugar that can raise the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. This has seen some consumers shift towards natural sweeteners like sugar and honey, which benefits the domestic sugar industry as it offers potential market demand.
In conclusion, China's sugar industry is currently in a challenging position due to a plethora of reasons. These include oversupply of cheap imported sugar, increased competition from alternative sweeteners, and the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on demand. Although the Chinese government's efforts to boost domestic production are commendable, they need to prioritize environmental conservation to ensure sustainable long-term growth of the industry.
With the implementation of better measures to protect the environment and manage the supply and demand of sugar domestically, the sector can recover and become competitive, providing a source of income for sugar producers and benefitting the wider economy. The government must act quickly to address the issues faced by the sugar industry and put in place a comprehensive plan that will ensure the long-term growth and profitability of this vital sector.
