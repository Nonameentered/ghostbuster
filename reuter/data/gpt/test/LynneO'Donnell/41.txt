Chinese Zinc Producers to Increase Output as World Prices Hit Four-Year Highs
China, the world's largest producer and consumer of zinc, is set to boost its output of the metal as global prices reach four-year highs. The move is expected to have a significant impact on the global zinc market, which has been struggling with supply shortages and rising demand.
According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG), China produced 5.8 million tonnes of zinc in 2020, accounting for more than 37% of the world's total. The country's production has been continuously increasing in recent years, with output rising by 4.3% in 2020.
Now, with zinc prices soaring to their highest levels in four years, Chinese producers are ramping up their output to take advantage of the spike in demand. Prices have surged by more than 50% since the start of 2021, driven mainly by supply constraints caused by mine closures and production cuts.
China's largest zinc producer, Huludao Zinc Industry Co Ltd, has announced plans to increase its output by 7% in 2021 to meet rising demand. Other major zinc producers in the country, including Yunnan Chihong Zinc and Germanium Co Ltd and Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co Ltd, are also planning to expand production.
The increase in Chinese production is expected to ease the current supply shortage in the global market. The ILZSG predicts that global zinc production will increase by 4.4% to 14.4 million tonnes in 2021, driven by growth in China and other Asian countries.
However, the rise in Chinese production could also put downward pressure on zinc prices, as the additional supply could lead to a surplus in the market. The sustainability of the current price rally will depend on the balance between supply and demand.
The surge in zinc prices has been driven by a number of factors. Firstly, the closure of major zinc mines in Peru and Australia last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in global supply. According to the ILZSG, global zinc mine production fell by 5.2% in 2020, with output in Peru and Australia falling by 20.6% and 14.4% respectively.
Secondly, rising demand for zinc from the construction and automotive industries has also contributed to the increase in prices. Zinc is used in the production of galvanized steel, which is widely used in the construction sector due to its corrosion resistance and durability. The automotive industry also uses significant quantities of zinc in the production of car bodies, engines, and other components.
The demand for zinc in the construction sector is expected to increase further in the coming years, driven by rapid urbanization and infrastructure development in emerging economies. The automotive industry is also expected to drive demand growth, as the shift towards electric vehicles is likely to increase the use of zinc in batteries and other components.
However, the global zinc market remains vulnerable to supply shocks, as the concentration of production in a few key countries increases the risk of disruptions. This was highlighted by the closure of mines in Peru and Australia last year, which caused significant price volatility and supply shortages.
To mitigate this risk, many companies are investing in new mines and exploration projects in different parts of the world. For example, Canada's Trevali Mining plans to invest in two new mines in Burkina Faso and Peru to increase its production capacity. Other companies are exploring new mining regions in East Africa and South America.
In conclusion, the increase in Chinese zinc production is a welcome development for the global market, which has been struggling with supply shortages and rising demand. However, the sustainability of the current price rally will depend on the balance between supply and demand, and the ability of the market to withstand future supply shocks. The ongoing investments in new mines and exploration projects are essential to ensure the long-term stability and growth of the zinc market.
