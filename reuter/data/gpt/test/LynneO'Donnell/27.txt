SHANGHAI, CHINA â€“ The city of Shanghai paid tribute to China's late leader Deng Xiaoping on Saturday, in a quiet ceremony that remembered his contribution to the city's development.
The event, held at Deng's former residence in the city, was attended by local officials and members of the public. It marked the 24th anniversary of Deng's death, who is widely regarded as the architect of China's economic reforms.
"Deng Xiaoping's contributions to China's modernization and economic development are immeasurable," said Wu Zhong, a local official who attended the ceremony. "His leadership was pivotal in China's rise to become a global economic powerhouse."
Deng played a key role in implementing reforms that transformed China's economy from a socialist planned economy to a market-driven one. He also played a key role in opening China to the world, paving the way for the country's integration into the global economy.
The quiet nature of the ceremony reflects the Chinese government's recent efforts to downplay Deng's legacy. In recent years, the official line on Deng's leadership has shifted, with some officials calling for a greater emphasis on socialism and state control in the country's economy.
However, for many in Shanghai, Deng's legacy remains an important part of the city's identity. The former leader lived and worked in Shanghai for many years, and was responsible for many of the city's economic successes during his time in power.
"Deng Xiaoping was a true visionary, and his leadership has had an enormous impact on the lives of people in Shanghai and throughout China," said Hu Guangwei, a local resident who attended the ceremony. "We will always remember his contributions to our city and our country."
The ceremony included a series of speeches and a wreath-laying ceremony, as well as a moment of silence in memory of Deng. Attendees also had the opportunity to visit Deng's former residence, which has been preserved as a museum and serves as a reminder of his time in Shanghai.
Despite the official downplaying of Deng's legacy, his contributions to China's economic development continue to be felt in the country today. Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has recently taken a more assertive and authoritarian approach to governance, has continued to emphasize the importance of Deng's reforms in shaping China's future.
As China continues to grapple with the challenges of economic growth and increased international competition, Deng's legacy remains a key part of the country's identity and a source of inspiration for its leaders and citizens alike.
