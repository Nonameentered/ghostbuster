With a firm belief in the future of China's auto industry, Ford Motor Company has decided to increase its stake in China's leading maker of commercial trucks, Jiangling Motors Corporation (JMC). In a statement on Monday, Ford announced that it would be spending $167.7 million dollars to buy an additional 2.9% stake in JMC, taking its total shareholding to 32%. This move reaffirms Ford's commitment to deepening its partnership with JMC, which has been going strong since 1995.
The decision comes at a time when the Chinese vehicle market has been facing a challenging time. New car sales in China fell for the second year in a row in 2019, with a decline of 8.2%. While the market had been struggling even before the coronavirus pandemic, the outbreak dealt another severe blow to the industry. However, despite the ongoing challenges, Ford is betting on the potential of the Chinese auto market in the long term.
"China remains a cornerstone of Ford's global strategy, and we are committed to further investing and growing our presence in this important market," said Jim Farley, executive vice president and president of Global Markets for Ford.
JMC, which is based in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, has a strong presence in China's commercial vehicle market, with a limited footprint in the passenger car segment. Ford's investment in JMC is expected to give it access to a larger customer base in China, particularly in the commercial truck and transit markets.
JMC has grown steadily in recent years, with its vehicle sales increasing by 25% in 2019. The company has been investing heavily in developing new products and technologies to meet the changing needs of consumers. In November last year, JMC launched its first electric-powered light truck, the Landwind EV, which is expected to be a game-changer in China's rapidly developing market for electric commercial vehicles.
Ford's increased stake in JMC is also seen as an effort to strengthen its supply chain in China, especially as the company shifts its focus more towards electric and autonomous vehicles. JMC has a strong presence in China's battery electric vehicle (BEV) industry, with a market share of around 14%. The company has been investing heavily in BEV production and technology, and Ford's increased investment is expected to give it access to JMC's expertise and capabilities in this area.
Furthermore, the Ford-JMC partnership has been crucial in helping Ford establish a strong foothold in China's growing pickup truck market. In 2019, Ford launched the Ranger pickup truck in China, which was produced in partnership with JMC. The Ranger has received a positive response from Chinese consumers, and the increased investment in JMC is expected to help Ford further expand its presence in the pickup truck segment.
The investment also comes as the US and China are continuing to negotiate a trade deal. Last year, Ford's CEO Jim Hackett had openly criticized the escalating tariffs imposed by both countries, stating that they had hurt the automaker's profitability. With the ongoing discussions between the two countries, it remains to be seen how the agreement will impact Ford's investment in JMC.
In conclusion, Ford's investment in JMC is a strategic move that underscores the potential of the Chinese auto market in the long term. While the market may be facing challenges in the short term, Ford is looking ahead and preparing for a future in which electric and autonomous technologies will play a significant role. By deepening its relationship with JMC, Ford is positioning itself to benefit from China's continued growth in the auto industry while also strengthening its supply chain and presence in the pickup truck and commercial vehicle segments.
