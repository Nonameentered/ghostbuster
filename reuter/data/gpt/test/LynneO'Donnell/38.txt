China's Ample Copper Supplies Could Eliminate Need to Buy on World Market, Traders Say
BEIJING - China's stockpiles of copper could allow it to eliminate the need to purchase the metal on the world market, according to traders in the country. The volume of copper held by the state reserves is the highest it has been in years, bolstered by increased domestic production and lower demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
China is the world's largest consumer of copper, using the metal to produce everything from household appliances to power lines and construction materials. The country typically imports around half of the copper it uses, with the rest supplied domestically.
However, the situation has changed in recent years as the Chinese government launched a series of measures aimed at boosting domestic production and stockpiling. As a result, China's copper production has surged to record levels, reducing the need for imports.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows that China produced 810,000 tonnes of refined copper in August, up 9.5% year-on-year. The country's copper imports also fell sharply in the same period, dropping by 38% year-on-year.
Traders say that ample stockpiles and domestic production could eventually allow China to become self-sufficient in copper, eliminating the need to buy on the world market. This would have significant implications for the global copper market, as China has been one of the biggest buyers of the metal in recent years.
"China's ample copper supplies mean that they could potentially stop importing copper from the international market," said Karen Wu, a senior analyst at Nomura Holdings in Hong Kong. "This could lead to a decline in global copper prices as China has been one of the biggest drivers of demand for the metal in recent years."
However, Wu cautions that the shift to self-sufficiency could take some time, as the country is still reliant on imported copper to meet some of its needs. "It will take some time for China to become completely self-sufficient in copper," Wu said. "But the trend is clear, and we expect to see reduced imports going forward."
The shift towards self-sufficiency has been driven by a number of factors, including government subsidies for domestic mining and the closure of small-scale mines in the country. In addition, Chinese companies have been investing heavily in copper mines overseas, giving them access to additional supplies.
In recent years, China has shifted its focus from copper imports to building up its stockpiles. The country has been buying copper at a record pace, with the state reserves holding around 1.56 million tonnes of the metal at the end of September.
The accumulation of copper stockpiles has been seen as a way for China to boost its strategic reserves and reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers. In addition, the move towards self-sufficiency has been driven by concerns about supply disruptions, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
China's ability to become self-sufficient in copper will depend on a number of factors, including continued government support for domestic mining and production, and the availability of overseas supplies. However, traders say the trend towards self-sufficiency is likely to continue, with potential implications for the global copper market.
