The global shortage of indium, a rare metal used in the production of flat panel displays, touch screens, and solar panels, has been causing concern for electronics manufacturers worldwide. According to industry experts, the shortage has been partly caused by Chinese producers hoarding their stocks and driving up prices.
Indium is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal that is used as a transparent conductor in thin films for electronic displays and touch screens. It is also used in the production of solar panels, as a sealing material in vacuum technology, and in the aerospace industry.
China is the largest producer of indium, accounting for over 50% of global production. The country's production and export of indium have been declining since 2015 due to stricter environmental regulations and resource depletion. This has led to a global shortage, and industry experts believe that Chinese producers are taking advantage of the situation by hoarding their stocks and driving up prices.
"Chinese indium producers are not releasing their stocks into the market as they normally would," said a trader based in Shanghai. "This has created a shortage and driven up prices by more than 300% in the past year."
Industry experts say that the global indium market is very opaque, and it is difficult to determine the exact levels of supply and demand. This has made it easier for Chinese producers to manipulate the market by limiting supply and driving up prices.
"Chinese indium producers are very secretive about their production and stocks, and it is very difficult to get accurate information," said a company executive in Japan. "This has made it very hard for us to plan our production and pricing strategies."
The shortage of indium has been causing concern for electronics manufacturers, who rely on the metal for their products. Flat panel displays and touch screens are used in a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and televisions. The shortage of indium has led to difficulties in the production of these devices, and manufacturers have been forced to look for alternative materials or ways to reduce their usage of indium.
"We have been struggling to secure a stable supply of indium," said a spokesperson for a Japanese electronics manufacturer. "This has affected our production of touch screens and has led to delays in the launch of our new products."
Solar panel manufacturers have also been affected by the shortage of indium. The metal is used as a component in the production of thin-film solar cells, which offer a more affordable and flexible alternative to traditional silicon-based solar cells. The shortage of indium has led to higher prices for thin-film solar cells, making them less competitive than silicon-based solar cells.
"The shortage of indium has affected our production of thin-film solar cells and has led to higher costs," said a spokesperson for a Chinese solar panel manufacturer. "This has made it harder for us to compete with traditional solar panel companies."
Industry experts say that the shortage of indium is likely to continue in the short term, as Chinese producers continue to hold onto their stocks. However, they believe that the situation could change if new sources of indium are discovered or if the demand for indium decreases due to the development of new materials.
"The shortage of indium is a concern for the electronics and solar panel industries, but it could also be an opportunity to develop new materials or technologies," said a researcher in Singapore. "We are working on developing alternative materials that could replace indium in electronic displays and touch screens, and this could lead to new opportunities in the future." 
The shortage of indium has been a major concern for electronics and solar panel manufacturers worldwide. Chinese producers have been accused of hoarding their stocks and driving up prices, leading to difficulties in the production of devices and panels. Industry experts say that the situation could change if new sources of indium are discovered or if the demand for indium decreases due to the development of new materials.
