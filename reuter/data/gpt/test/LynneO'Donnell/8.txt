Far East metal traders are warning of a possible supply squeeze and higher prices of zinc in China as the country's top producers have announced their plans to export more. The move is due to a surplus of production capacity of zinc in China, which has led to falling prices domestically.
According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG), China's zinc production increased by 9.4% in 2019, reaching 5.96 million tonnes. However, domestic demand for the metal has not increased at the same rate, leaving a surplus.
The rise of zinc exports from China has been noticeable in recent years. In 2020, China exported zinc at a rate of 426,000 tonnes per month, an increase of 38.4% compared to 2019, according to Chinese customs data.
China is the world's largest producer and consumer of zinc, accounting for around 40% of the global market. Its zinc production mainly comes from mining and smelting, with the major producers being Yunnan Chihong Zinc & Germanium Co, Ltd, Huludao Zinc Industry Co, Ltd, and Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co, Ltd.
The surplus of zinc production in China has caused prices to fall to the point where some companies are operating at a loss, prompting them to seek new markets abroad.
"The oversupply situation in China's zinc industry has led to extremely low prices and declining profits," said Song Xiaodong, head of the Shanghai-base metals futures department at Shanxi Securities. "Chinese producers must seek new markets abroad to alleviate the pressure, and the move will drive up prices at home."
However, Chinese zinc producers are not the only ones looking to export more. Other major zinc-producing countries such as India, Peru, and Australia are also increasing their zinc exports, according to ILZSG.
The increased zinc exports from China are expected to create a supply squeeze in the country, leading to higher prices and tighter supply. This could potentially result in higher production costs for companies that rely on zinc in their manufacturing process, such as those in the automotive industry.
"The increase in zinc exports from China will definitely have a significant impact on the market, and we expect to see a tightening of supply domestically," said a spokesperson for China's largest zinc buyer, Shandong Humon Smelting Co, Ltd.
The tightening of supply could particularly impact China's infrastructure projects, which rely heavily on zinc for construction materials such as galvanized steel. The domestic transportation sector, which accounts for around 40% of zinc consumption, is also expected to be affected by the price increase.
The higher prices of zinc may also affect the global market, as China's exports account for a significant portion of the world's zinc supply. This may lead to higher import costs for other countries, which could in turn impact their production costs.
Despite the possible impact on domestic industries, the increased zinc exports are seen as a positive move by China as it will help to reduce the country's surplus of metal production and generate revenue for the industry.
"Expanding exports of zinc is a necessary measure for China's zinc producers to alleviate the pressure created by oversupply," said Zhang Guilin, former chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association. "The move will also help stabilize global zinc prices and benefit the entire industry."
However, China's increased zinc exports may not be sustainable in the long term. The country's zinc industry is heavily reliant on imported raw materials such as zinc concentrate, and the rise of trade barriers and import restrictions by other countries may impact China's ability to sustain its current level of zinc production.
In addition, the global shift towards renewable energy and electric vehicles may reduce the demand for zinc, as the metal is mainly used in traditional internal combustion engines.
Despite these challenges, the increased zinc exports from China are expected to continue in the short term, leading to a possible supply squeeze and higher prices in the country.
