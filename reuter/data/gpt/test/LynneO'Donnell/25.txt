Shocking exhibitions and heartbreaking stories are being presented at a new exhibition in China, featuring a book by an author that exposes the truth about Japanese war atrocities in China. The special exhibition is being held in the country's northeastern city of Harbin, where visitors can learn how the Japanese Army brutally killed and tortured Chinese civilians during the Second World War.
The author of the book used to be a professor of the Institute of Japanese Studies at Northeast Normal University in China. He gathered rare photos and documents from archives and libraries around the world and compiled them into a book called "Encyclopedia of Japanese War Atrocities in China". This book is considered a masterpiece and has been translated into multiple languages.
The exhibition is based on the book and shows that between 1931 and 1945, the Japanese Army invaded and occupied large parts of China and committed numerous dreadful crimes, including mass killings, rapes, and forced labor. The Chinese government estimates that 35 million Chinese people were killed or injured during the eight years of the Japanese invasion.
The exhibition is divided into several parts, and each part focuses on a specific region or event during the war. Visitors can see pictures of the Nanjing Massacre, where Japanese troops killed more than 300,000 Chinese people in just six weeks. They can also see pictures of the Shandong Incident, where Japanese soldiers brutally executed more than 30,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians. The exhibition also includes photos and documents about the forced labor of Chinese people in Japan, where more than six million Chinese were sent to work as slaves.
One of the most shocking and heartbreaking parts of the exhibition is the section on women's abuse. During the war, Japanese soldiers forced Chinese women into sexual slavery, and these women became known as "comfort women". The exhibition features interviews with the few surviving comfort women, who tell their stories of being kidnapped, raped, and forced into prostitution. It was a dark and traumatic chapter in Chinese and Korean history, as the Japanese Army abducted women from these countries as sex workers at military brothels.
The author of the book said that he hopes this exhibition and book can help young Chinese people understand the reality of war and cherish peace. "We need to remember what happened during that time, and we need to cherish the peaceful life we have now," said the author. "We should never forget the sacrifice and efforts of the Chinese people who fought against the Japanese invasion, and we must work together to prevent war in the future."
Many visitors to the exhibition expressed their horror and sadness at what they saw, and some said that they had tears in their eyes. "It's heartbreaking and infuriating to see how the Japanese treated Chinese people during the war," said one visitor. "I think people need to know what happened during the war, so we can avoid repeating it in the future."
The exhibition has also attracted worldwide attention, and many foreign visitors say that they were shocked to learn about the atrocities that the Japanese Army committed in China. "I think it's important for people to know about this dark chapter in history, and to learn from it," said a foreign visitor. "This exhibition and book are important because they help people understand the reality of war and the importance of peace."
The exhibition will be open for several weeks, and organizers say that they expect thousands of visitors. The author of the book said that he hopes the exhibition will encourage people to learn more about China's history and to appreciate the sacrifices made by the Chinese people during the war.
In conclusion, this new exhibition in Harbin is a must-see event for anyone who wants to learn about the history of China and Japan during the Second World War. The book and exhibition provide detailed information and firsthand accounts about the atrocities that the Japanese Army committed during the war. The exhibition serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of cherishing peace and preventing war in the future.
