Far East Metal Traders, a leading supplier of non-ferrous metals in the Asian region, has reported that Chinese zinc producers are set to increase their exports in response to high international prices. This is likely to lead to a domestic supply squeeze and higher prices at home.
According to industry experts, zinc prices have surged in recent months due to a combination of factors, including increased demand from the construction and automotive industries, supply disruptions caused by COVID-19, and a shortage of raw materials.
Currently, zinc prices are trading at a 10-year high of around $3,000 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange (LME), which has prompted Chinese producers to ramp up exports to take advantage of these high prices.
This has already led to a shortage of zinc supply in the domestic market, with many Chinese manufacturers struggling to secure a steady supply of the metal.
"Chinese zinc producers have started to prioritize exports over the domestic market, as they can secure higher prices abroad," said a spokesperson for Far East Metal Traders. "This has created a supply squeeze in China, which is driving up prices for local manufacturers."
The impact of the supply squeeze is being felt across several sectors, with Chinese manufacturers of steel, brass, and galvanized products all reporting higher costs due to the scarcity of zinc. This, in turn, is likely to lead to higher prices for consumers.
"The rise in zinc prices is already starting to impact the cost of our products," said a spokesperson for a leading Chinese steel producer. "If this trend continues, we may have to pass on these cost increases to our customers."
The impact of the higher zinc prices is also being felt in neighboring countries, such as Japan and South Korea, which rely on Chinese imports for a significant proportion of their zinc supply.
"Japan is particularly vulnerable to the zinc supply squeeze, as we rely heavily on Chinese imports for our zinc supply," said a spokesperson for the Japan Zinc Association. "At present, we are closely monitoring the situation and working with Chinese suppliers to ensure a steady supply of the metal."
The high zinc prices are also having an impact on the global economy, with many industries starting to feel the pinch of rising costs.
"Higher zinc prices are likely to increase the cost of consumer goods, particularly in the construction and automotive sectors," said a spokesperson for a US-based industry association. "This, in turn, is likely to lead to lower consumer demand, which could slow down economic growth."
Despite the potential negative impacts of higher zinc prices, industry experts are optimistic that the market will balance out in the medium term.
"Over the next few months, we expect to see an increase in zinc production, as manufacturers respond to the high prices," said a spokesperson for the LME. "This should help to alleviate the supply squeeze and stabilize prices."
In the meantime, Chinese manufacturers are likely to face increased costs and supply chain disruptions due to the shortage of zinc. This highlights the importance of diversifying supply chains and ensuring a stable supply of raw materials in the face of volatile global markets.
