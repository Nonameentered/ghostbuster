According to Chinese copper trading sources, the world copper market is set for a correction due to the liquidation of long positions. The sources predict a sharp decline in copper prices in the near future as the market becomes oversupplied.
Copper prices have hit record highs in recent weeks, spurred on by global demand, a weak dollar, and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, investors have started to liquidate their positions, which has led to a drop in copper prices.
The Chinese sources say that the liquidation trend is expected to continue, as investors take profits and move on to other opportunities. As a result, copper prices are likely to experience a downward correction in the coming months.
However, the sources believe that this correction will not lead to a prolonged bear market for copper. They argue that the underlying demand for the metal remains strong, particularly in China, where infrastructure projects continue to drive demand for copper.
China is the world's largest consumer of copper, accounting for around half of global demand. The country is investing heavily in infrastructure, including high-speed rail lines, highways, and energy grids, all of which require significant amounts of copper.
The Chinese sources believe that the current liquidation-related correction is a healthy correction that will help to cool off overheated copper prices and allow the market to find a more sustainable level.
In response to the predicted correction, major copper producers such as Chile and Peru have already started to increase their output, hoping to take advantage of the high prices while they last. However, the Chinese sources say that oversupply is likely to become a problem in the coming months, putting further downward pressure on copper prices.
Despite the expected correction, copper remains one of the most popular commodities for investors, with many seeing it as a safe haven during times of uncertainty. While the current correction may lead to short-term pain for copper bulls, the long-term outlook for the metal remains positive, driven by China's continuing demand.
