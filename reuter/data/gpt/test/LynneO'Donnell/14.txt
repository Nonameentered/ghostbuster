As the Lunar New Year holiday approaches, Chinese sugar processors are taking advantage of low prices to hoard supplies. This is in anticipation of improved prices after the festivities when demand for the sweetener is expected to increase.
China is one of the world's largest sugar producers and, in recent years, the country has become a net importer of sugar due to increased demand. Domestic consumption of sugar has been on the rise as the country's middle class expands.
Sugar prices in China have been under pressure due to increased supply from overseas and bolstered stocks from the previous domestic harvest. However, the festive season is likely to result in higher demand, eventually leading to a price hike.
"The sugar refinery companies have been aggressively stocking up sugar in anticipation of a surge in demand after the Lunar New Year holiday," noted Mr. Chengwei Li, a commodity analyst with Shanghai WinFutures Consulting Co.
At present, sugar prices in China are around CNY 5,105 ($786) per tonne, a five-month low, according to data from commodity information provider CCM.
"The current sugar prices are very low, and the majority of refinery companies have taken the initiative to expand their purchase of low-priced sugar. They are preparing for the market demand that is going to increase from late April or May. As a result, it will support higher prices in the future," explained a sugar executive based in Jiangsu province, one of China's major sugar-producing regions.
The data from the National Bureau of Statistics indicates that sugar refinery enterprises in China produced 1.86 million tonnes of sugar in December, setting a new record for the production of the sweetener in the country.
Production in 2020 was also higher, up around 7.5 percent year-over-year. This was due to an increase in the sugar cane crops. The abundance of sugar in the market resulted in lower prices.
However, this recent development has encouraged Chinese buyers to import sugar, with some of the shipments scheduled to arrive after the holiday season.
According to Mr. Li, sugar prices are projected to rise after the Lunar New Year holiday due to higher demand. In fact, he expects the price to reach up to CNY 5,700 ($879) per tonne in the short term.
In conclusion, Chinese sugar processors are taking advantage of current low prices to stock up in expectation of an increase in demand after the Lunar New Year holiday. Although prices have been under pressure due to an increased supply of sugar, turning this trend around could lead to higher prices in the market. If this trend translates into reality, sugar prices could finally experience an improvement, leading to a positive trend for the commodity.
