The London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc prices reached a 4-1/2 year high on Thursday, surpassing $3,000 per metric tonne, as the global demand outlook improved amidst a global economic recovery. 
 
This surge in zinc prices comes even as China exports zinc to Japan. However, the supply is still tight and experts state that the Chinese exports will not flood the market as the global demand is expected to remain high and supply chains have been disrupted since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
The LME zinc price rose to $3,065 an ounce, an increase of almost 2% from the previous day. The rise has been attributed to a lack of available refined zinc supply, with some market participants suggesting that the demand for steel production could increase later this year, boosting the demand for zinc.
 
The rally in zinc prices is also being supported by a rise in the prices of other metals. Copper prices have reached a record high; aluminum and nickel have also been on the rise. Zinc's impact is felt when it comes to galvanization - the process where a protective layer of zinc or zinc alloy is applied to iron or steel to prevent rusting.
 
China is currently a major buyer of zinc, with a 40% share in global demand for the metal, and it is also a major supplier. However, there have been no indications that China’s exports of zinc have caused prices to drop. In fact, Chinese exports to Japan have been instrumental in curbing the price rise.
 
Some market analysts are optimistic about the zinc market, suggesting that prices could rise further due to the metal's strong fundamentals. A dwindling mine supply, coupled with a rising demand from the construction and infrastructure sectors, could drive zinc prices beyond the current record-high level.
 
In the same vein, market conditions are favorable for the base metal. Industrial production in China and the U.S. has rebounded significantly, leading to a surge in demand for base metals such as zinc. In addition, supply shortages have been persistent over the past 18 months.
 
Despite the rise in prices, there is no apparent shortage of zinc supply, nor is there any impending shortage. Zinc mines are currently operating at full capacity, and recyclable zinc products, such as batteries and construction waste, as well as imported concentrates, are all readily available. 
 
Furthermore, analysts have pointed out that there are sufficient zinc stocks in reserve, which, if released into the market, could alleviate potential price surges.
 
The LME warehouse stocks report for March 22 recorded 250,875 metric tonnes of zinc, an increase from the previous day. Yet, the tight supply and demand conditions remain in the market, and analysts predict the stocks could drop if prices continue to surge.
 
Many market participants are optimistic that the zinc market could help the mining industry recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to higher investment opportunities across the sector. At the moment, investors are cautious due to the unpredictability of the pandemic.
 
The zinc market is crucial to the economic development of several countries, particularly those with robust manufacturing and construction sectors. The metal is used in various industries, including the automotive, pharmaceutical, and electrical industries, making it a sought-after commodity.
 
In conclusion, the recent surge in zinc prices can be attributed to several factors, including demand growth, a dwindling mine-supply, and a surge in demand from the construction and infrastructure sectors. Despite China's prominent role in the zinc market, Chinese exports to Japan are not believed to have a significant impact on the current price surge. Analysts remain optimistic about the zinc market's future, and investors are cautiously watching price trends and market conditions.
