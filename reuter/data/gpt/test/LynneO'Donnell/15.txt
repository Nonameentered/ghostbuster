Copper and Zinc traders from the Far East are gearing up for the Lunar New Year celebrations amid supply concerns. A recent survey done by the Reuters news agency shows that the focus of these traders has shifted to the festivities and tight supply fundamentals, amidst a global pandemic that is still raging on.
The survey pulled responses from several copper brokers, traders, and smelters based in China, Japan, and South Korea. The traders stated that they had started winding down business activities in preparation for the lunar new year, which will begin on February 12. This is the time when many businesses in the region usually shut down, and people travel to visit their families and loved ones.
The traders will be keeping a close eye on supply fundamentals as they prepare for the holiday. Zinc, which is widely used in galvanizing steel, has seen supply disruptions due to coronavirus-related lockdowns and operational issues at mines and smelters. Additionally, strong demand from the manufacturing and construction industries has also put pressure on the supply chain. All of these factors have led to a surge in zinc prices, which is expected to continue in the short term.
In China, the world's largest consumer of copper, traders are also keeping a close eye on supply fundamentals. Copper demand in China has remained robust due to the country's ongoing infrastructural projects and the post-COVID-19 economic recovery. However, copper supplies have also been disrupted by operational issues at domestic mines, which have led to a tightening in the supply chain.
The demand for copper has also increased due to the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), which require more copper wiring than traditional cars. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, the number of electric cars on the road is projected to grow from around 10 million in 2020 to around 145 million by 2030. This will likely put additional pressure on copper supplies as the demand for the metal increases.
To keep up with demand, copper smelters in China have also agreed on annual treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) with mining companies. The TC/RCs are fees paid by miners to smelters for the processing of ore into refined metal. The charges usually reflect market conditions and supply levels. In 2020, the TC/RCs were at their lowest in over a decade due to tight supply conditions and rising demand.
Since the start of the year, copper prices have risen over 6%, while zinc prices have surged by over 11%. The supply concerns have also led to an increase in copper and zinc exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings, which rose to a record in January.
As the Lunar New Year celebrations begin, traders will be keeping a close eye on supply fundamentals to determine the direction of prices in the coming months. The demand for copper and zinc is expected to remain robust, driven by the post-COVID-19 economic recovery, rising demand for EVs, and increased infrastructure spending.
In conclusion, Lunar New Year celebrations are set to provide a welcome break for Far East copper and zinc traders, amidst concerns over supply fundamentals. Supply disruptions and demand pressures have led to a surge in prices that is expected to continue in the short term. The celebration presents a time of reflection that will help traders wind down during the downtime. However, they will remain alert to the potential impact of global events on supply chains.
