Shanghai mourns the passing of Deng Xiaoping, the man who is often credited as the architect of the city’s modernization and success.
Deng, who passed away on February 19, 1997, at the age of 92, played a key role in China's economic reform and opening-up policy in the late 1970s, which allowed the country to embrace the market economy and transformed it into one of the world's fastest-growing nations.
But it was his policies in Shanghai that had a profound impact on the city and its people. Deng was a champion of transforming Shanghai into a leading financial and commercial center, and he played a major role in making that vision a reality.
Under Deng’s direction, Shanghai saw its first Special Economic Zone (SEZ), which allowed the city to enjoy certain economic liberties not available in other parts of the country. This meant Shanghai had more flexibility in conducting international trade and investment, allowing it to become a hub for international business and finance.
Moreover, Deng was instrumental in developing Pudong, the area across from Shanghai’s historic Bund. “If we want to be competitive in the 21st century, we must develop Pudong,” Deng famously said.
In the late 1980s, Deng launched a massive construction project to develop 40 square kilometers of land in Pudong, turning it into a thriving financial district that boosted the city’s economy and status on the world stage. Today, Pudong is home to many of China's top banks, along with the Shanghai Stock Exchange and some of the tallest skyscrapers in the world.
Beyond his work in Shanghai, Deng played a crucial role in promoting China's economic growth and political stability. After Mao Zedong's death in 1976, Deng emerged as China's top leader and implemented a series of reforms that paved the way for China to become the world’s second-largest economy.
Some of Deng's major reforms included opening up China's economy to foreign investment, allowing private enterprise to flourish, and promoting technology and science. These policies helped lift hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty and put China on a path to become a global economic powerhouse.
In Shanghai, Deng was also instrumental in developing the city's transportation infrastructure, which contributed to its growth as an international economic center. The city's first subway line, which opened in 1995, was one of the many transportation projects Deng envisioned. The subway system has since grown to be one of the largest in the world, connecting millions of people across the city.
Deng's vision for Shanghai had a lasting impact on the city, not only in terms of its economic development but also in ways that affected the daily lives of its residents. Deng recognized that in order to attract entrepreneurs and investors from around the world, Shanghai needed to be livable and welcoming.
To that end, Deng invested heavily in improving Shanghai's infrastructure, including its parks, public spaces, and transportation networks. He also promoted cultural exchange and appreciation, encouraging traditional Chinese arts and music to thrive alongside modern-day business and commerce.
As the news of Deng's passing spread throughout Shanghai, locals began to gather in public spaces to mourn the loss of the man who had brought so much progress to the city. Residents of all ages spoke of Deng with reverence, citing his leadership and vision as the things that had made Shanghai into the dynamic and prosperous city it is today.
“Shanghai will always remember Deng Xiaoping,” said one local resident. “He put our city on the map and brought prosperity and stability to us all.”
Another resident summed up Deng’s legacy: “He was an amazing leader who made an enormous impact on our lives. We will always be grateful to him for all that he did for our city and our country.”
