China has resumed corn exports following a six-year hiatus, causing a stir in the global market and sparking a price war among producers.
In October, the country's Ministry of Commerce approved the resumption of corn exports, citing an adequate domestic supply and increased demand from other countries.
The move is expected to have significant implications for the global corn trade, as China historically has been a net importer of the crop. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), China imported more than 3.8 million metric tonnes of corn in 2019-2020, making it the world's fourth-largest corn importer.
Farmers in other countries, particularly the US and Brazil, which are the world's largest corn producers, are now worried that the resumption of Chinese corn exports will lead to oversupply and a drop in prices.
"These new (Chinese) corn exports could add to an already very bearish global supply and demand table," said Terry Reilly, a senior commodity analyst at Futures International.
Indeed, prices for corn futures fell sharply following the announcement of China's resumption of corn exports. On November 2, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) corn futures for December 2020 delivery fell to $4.02 per bushel, the lowest level in four months.
Some analysts predict that prices may drop even further in the coming months as China's corn exports gain momentum. The USDA projects that China will export up to 5 million metric tonnes of corn in the 2020-2021 marketing year, which runs from September to August.
"The looming threat of increased Chinese corn exports is a bearish development for producers in other countries, particularly the US," said Bryce Knorr, a senior market analyst at Farm Futures.
However, some experts argue that fears of oversupply are overblown. They point out that China's corn exports are likely to be focused mainly on the Southeast Asian market, where demand for the crop is high.
"The market is overreacting to the news of Chinese corn exports," said Dan Basse, the president of AgResource Company, a Chicago-based agricultural advisory firm. "China is not going to flood the global market with cheap corn. They will export selectively, targeting specific regions and customers."
Regardless of how the Chinese corn exports play out, there is no doubt that they will have a significant impact on the global corn trade. Some experts predict that the resumption of Chinese corn exports could lead to a restructuring of the market, with producers in other countries forced to adjust their strategies and search for new markets to sell their crops.
"The Chinese corn exports are a wake-up call for producers around the world," said Reilly. "They will have to become more competitive and innovative in their pricing and marketing strategies if they want to stay ahead of the game."
The resumption of Chinese corn exports also comes at a time of growing tension between the US and China over trade. The two countries have been engaged in a bitter trade war since 2018, with both sides imposing tariffs on each other's goods.
The Trump administration has frequently accused China of unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft, and has sought to reduce America's reliance on Chinese goods by promoting domestic production. In September, the US imposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including corn, as part of its ongoing trade dispute with China.
However, some experts predict that the resumption of Chinese corn exports could help to ease tensions between the US and China by creating a new avenue for trade.
"The resumption of Chinese corn exports could be a positive development for US-China relations," said Knorr. "It could create a new area of cooperation and trade between the two countries, which could help to ease tensions and build a foundation for future cooperation."
Overall, the resumption of Chinese corn exports is a significant development in the global corn trade, with far-reaching consequences for producers, traders, and consumers around the world. While there are risks of oversupply and a price war among producers, there is also potential for new opportunities and a restructuring of the market. It remains to be seen how the Chinese corn exports will play out in the coming months and years, but one thing is certain: they will be closely watched and closely scrutinized by all those with a stake in the global corn trade.
