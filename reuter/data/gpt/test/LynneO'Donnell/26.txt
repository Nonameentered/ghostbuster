As copper prices continue to surge, traders in the Far East are left wondering whether China will buy the valuable metal.
Reports suggest that copper prices began to rise in October 2020, and have continued to rise in an upward trend since. Copper, known as the 'metal with a PhD in economics', has seen a 70% increase in price since the start of the pandemic, as demand for the metal has shot up.
Traditionally, copper has been used in construction work, but in recent years its usage has diversified, with an increasing demand for the metal to be used in electric vehicles, renewable energy and high-tech gadgets.
Experts suggest that China, the world's largest consumer of copper, could be the key to the future of this valuable commodity. As the country continues to recover from the pandemic, many have speculated that China may begin to buy copper again.
However, the Chinese government has been committed to reducing pollution, which means that any move towards renewable energy and electric vehicles would require substantial amounts of copper. With China holding the majority of the world's copper reserves, many in the Far East are left wondering whether China will import more copper to meet its growing demand.
China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), has already expressed its concern about the rise in copper prices, indicating that the country's central government may intervene in the market to curb speculation and control prices.
The NDRC has been urging domestic mining companies to increase their output to meet demand from China's downstream industries. The Chinese government's commitment to energy efficiency, its ambitious climate targets, and its drive to decarbonise could see the country increase its demand for copper in the near future. Experts suggest that the Chinese government may have to import even more copper to ensure it has enough to meet its renewable energy targets.
However, there are some in the Far East who remain skeptical about China's future demand for copper. Some analysts point out that China, like many other countries, may be prioritising short-term economic recovery over long-term environmental goals.
Some experts have also suggested that the recent surge in copper prices could be a result of speculative trading rather than genuine demand for the metal. Speculative trading could create a bubble in the copper market, causing prices to rise artificially. If this is the case, then the recent surge in copper prices may not be sustainable in the long term.
Despite the uncertainty surrounding copper prices, some traders in the Far East remain optimistic about the future of the metal. South Korea, for example, is looking to move towards a more sustainable future, and has set a target of zero emissions by 2050. This could see the country increase its demand for copper, as it looks to invest in renewable energy.
Similarly, Japan is also looking to increase its use of renewable energy, and has pledged to become carbon-neutral by 2050. This could see Japan increase its demand for copper, as it looks to invest in wind and solar energy.
Overall, the future of copper prices remains uncertain. The surge in prices could be due to genuine demand for the metal, or it could be the result of speculative trading. China's commitment to decarbonisation could increase its demand for copper, but the government is also committed to achieving short-term economic goals. As countries in the Far East look to transition towards more sustainable futures, they could increase their demand for copper. However, if the recent rise in copper prices is due to speculative trading, then it may not be sustainable in the long term. For now, the fate of copper remains uncertain, and traders in the Far East will be keeping a close eye on China's next moves.
