Far East traders are looking at 1997 as an opportune time to import soybeans as China's domestic crop has fallen by up to a million tonnes. The decline in production has been attributed to inclement weather conditions and an outbreak of pests in some regions. This presents an opportunity for soybean exporters from countries such as Brazil and the US to increase their market share in China.
The decrease in soybean production in China is significant as the country is the world's largest consumer of soybeans. The crop is used in a variety of foods, such as tofu, and is also used as animal feed. China has traditionally relied heavily on soybean imports, but the country has been making efforts to increase domestic production in recent years. However, the recent decline in crop yields may set back these efforts.
The Far East traders who are eyeing 1997 for soybean exports are particularly interested in the Chinese market. This is because China is a major player in the global soybean market, with imports accounting for roughly two-thirds of the country's domestic consumption. The potential for increased demand from China is significant, as soybeans are also used in the production of biodiesel and other renewable energy sources.
The key players in the global soybean market are Brazil, the US, and Argentina. These countries accounted for 80% of global soybean production in 2019, and are well-positioned to capitalize on any increase in demand from China. Brazil, in particular, has been ramping up its soybean production in recent years and is now the world's largest exporter of the crop. The country could increase its market share in China by tapping into the gap left by the decline in domestic production.
The US is another major player in the global soybean market, accounting for roughly one-third of global production. However, the country has been facing a number of challenges in recent years, including disruptions to its trading relationship with China as a result of the ongoing trade war. This has led to a decline in US soybean exports to China, which fell by 20% between 2017 and 2018.
Despite these challenges, US exporters remain bullish about their prospects in China. The recent signing of the phase one trade deal between the US and China has led to renewed optimism about the potential for increased exports. The deal includes a commitment from China to purchase an additional $200 billion in US goods over the next two years, of which a significant portion is expected to be soybeans.
Argentina is a smaller player in the global soybean market, accounting for roughly 5% of global production. However, the country is a major supplier of soybean oil, which is used in a variety of products, including cooking oils and margarine. Argentina's soybean exports to China may increase if Chinese consumers shift away from traditional soy products and towards soybean oil.
Far East traders are also eyeing other markets in the region, such as Japan and South Korea. These countries are significant consumers of soybeans, albeit on a smaller scale than China. Japan is the world's third-largest consumer of soybeans and imports roughly 50% of its domestic consumption. South Korea is also a significant importer of soybeans, with the crop used in the production of a variety of foods, such as tofu and soy milk.
In conclusion, the decline in soybean production in China presents an opportunity for exporters from Brazil, the US, and Argentina to increase their market share in the country. The potential for increased demand from China is significant, as soybeans are used in a variety of products, including food, biodiesel, and other renewable energy sources. Far East traders are eyeing 1997 as an opportune time to increase soybean exports to China, as the country's domestic production has fallen by up to a million tonnes. Other markets in the region, such as Japan and South Korea, may also present opportunities for increased soybean exports.
