On Wednesday, China announced its decision to resume corn exports after a long pause amid concerns over food security. The news is likely to shake up the international corn market and trigger further price volatility.
As the world's second-largest corn consumer, China halted its corn exports in 2016 to prevent potential domestic food shortages. However, recently, the country has rapidly ramped up its crop production, with its grain output rising for the eighth straight year in 2020.
China's Agricultural Ministry stated that the country has approved licenses for four companies to export corn, adding that more firms would be permitted to sell abroad if they met the new regulations.
The resumption of corn exports by China is expected to upset producers worldwide, particularly in the US, which recently announced a significant export of corn to China. Traders and producers are now scrambling to adjust to the news as China's reappearance in the global corn market may result in a price war.
"We are leaving the door open to exporting relatively substantial amounts of corn to China, depending on trade flows," said Ben Brown, an agricultural economist at the University of Missouri.
The United States exported 12 million tonnes of corn to China from September to December last year, following a trade deal with Beijing aimed at reducing bilateral tensions.
US farmers are already under pressure from rising prices of fertilizers, seeds, and other inputs. The expectation of heightened competition from China could serve as further woes to US corn producers.
"China's move is devilish for US soybean prices," says Scott Irwin, a professor of agricultural marketing at the University of Illinois.
Moreover, other corn producers, especially from Argentina, Brazil, and Ukraine, would also be impacted by China's decision to export. These countries have been reaping the benefits of China's ban on corn exports, and with the resumption of trade by China, they face the prospect of being undercut in the global market.
Overall, it is expected that China's return to the corn market will put additional pressure on global supplies and may lead to an increase in prices in the short term, which could eventually impact food prices for consumers worldwide.
However, some analysts see this move as a positive development for the Chinese economy as it is expected to enhance the country's economic prosperity and reduce food inflationary pressures.
"China's imports have been driving up international commodity prices, and that has been pushing domestic inflation rates already much higher than the rest of the world," says Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
China's decision to export corn also signals its intent to strengthen its diplomatic ties with other countries and diversify its trading partners amid an uncertain geopolitical environment.
Overall, the announcement of China resuming corn exports comes at a time when food commodities are already under pressure from a combination of climate change, supply-chain disruptions, and surging demand. The move is likely to unsettle the international corn market and intensify competition among producers worldwide while also raising food prices. However, it is a positive development for China's economy and a signal of its willingness to engage in free trade and expand its diplomatic ties.
