China's aluminium can makers are facing a double whammy of surging metal prices and slowing domestic demand, which is putting pressure on their profit margins and causing some to reconsider their business strategies.
Aluminium, the main material used to make beverage cans, has risen by more than 20% in the past year, driven by a rally in the global metal markets and strong demand from China's construction and transportation sectors. The surge in prices is squeezing profits for can makers, who are struggling to pass on the higher costs to customers in the face of weak demand.
According to industry experts, the aluminium can demand in China is expected to grow at a slower rate this year due to a combination of factors, including a shift towards healthier beverages that are perceived to be better for the environment, and consumers cutting back on spending amid a broader economic slowdown.
"The overall demand for cans is weak, and it's not just about the price of aluminium," said Qiu Xiangdong, deputy secretary general of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association. "We need to innovate and come up with new products to capture the changing habits of consumers."
China is the world's largest producer and consumer of aluminium, and its can making industry accounts for about 10% of global aluminium consumption. The industry has been growing at an annual rate of about 15% in recent years, driven by rising incomes and changing lifestyles in the country.
However, the slowdown in demand is prompting some companies to reassess their strategies. Some are looking to diversify into other areas such as renewable energy and electric vehicles, while others are exploring new markets overseas.
One such company is Jiangsu Changjiang Steel Tube & Pipe, which recently forged a partnership with Swedish packaging giant Tetra Pak to develop a new type of carton package that is more environmentally friendly. The move is aimed at tapping into the growing trend of sustainable packaging, which is gaining momentum in China and around the world.
"We see a lot of potential in sustainable packaging, and we are looking to expand our business in that direction," said Cai Jianqing, general manager of Jiangsu Changjiang.
Another company, Sunwoda Electronic, which is mainly engaged in the production of batteries used in electric vehicles, has also entered the aluminium can market by acquiring a majority stake in Can-Pack China, a subsidiary of Polish metal packaging company Can-Pack.
"We see a lot of synergies between the battery and can businesses, and we believe there is good growth potential in the can market for high-end beverages and cosmetics," said Sunwoda Chairman Zhang Zhengyu.
Despite the challenges facing aluminium can makers, industry analysts remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for the sector, given the growing popularity of canned beverages and the increasing demand for sustainable packaging.
"We believe that the can-making industry in China will remain robust in the long term, as the demand for canned beverages is expected to continue to grow, especially in the health and wellness sector," said Guo Yi, an analyst at Shanghai Securities.
In addition, the Chinese government's push for cleaner and more sustainable economic growth is expected to provide a boost to the industry, as it seeks to reduce the use of disposable plastics in the country.
"The government is promoting the development of green industries, and the aluminium can industry fits well into that category," said Qiu. "We believe that with innovation and technological advancement, the industry will overcome the current challenges and continue to thrive in the future."
