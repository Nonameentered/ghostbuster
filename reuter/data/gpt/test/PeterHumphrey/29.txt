In his final budget speech before the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China, the city's finance chief, Sir Hamish Macleod, stressed the importance of maintaining fiscal independence. Despite pressure from Beijing to align its economic policies with those of mainland China, Macleod emphasized the need to protect Hong Kong's unique, capitalist system.
"The success of Hong Kong's economy has been based on its autonomy and competitiveness," Macleod said. "As we approach the handover, we must remain vigilant in upholding these principles and resisting any attempts to erode them."
Macleod, who has served as financial secretary for the past five years, outlined several measures aimed at boosting the city's economic growth and competitiveness. These included increased funding for education and training programs, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and investment in infrastructure projects such as the expansion of Hong Kong's airport and the construction of a new cross-harbor tunnel.
The budget also included several tax cuts, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate and an increase in personal income tax allowances. Macleod said these measures were designed to spur investment and encourage entrepreneurship in the city.
"We must create an environment that is conducive to business growth and innovation," he said. "This means keeping taxes low, reducing red tape, and investing in the infrastructure that is needed to support a modern, thriving economy."
However, the finance chief's speech was overshadowed by concerns over the looming handover of Hong Kong to China. Many residents are worried that Beijing will undermine the city's autonomy and erode its unique system of governance, which includes a free press, an independent judiciary, and the rule of law.
In recent months, Beijing has stepped up its efforts to exert greater control over Hong Kong. This has included the imposition of a national security law, which has been used to crack down on pro-democracy activists and limit freedom of expression.
The Chinese government has also pushed for greater integration between Hong Kong and mainland China, including the establishment of a high-speed rail link between the two regions and the development of a special economic zone in the nearby city of Shenzhen.
Many observers fear that these developments are part of a broader effort by Beijing to bring Hong Kong closer into the orbit of the mainland, and to undermine the city's unique status as a gateway to China for foreign investors and businesses.
Despite these concerns, Macleod struck a defiant note in his budget speech, emphasizing that Hong Kong's economic success was founded on its independence and ability to attract foreign investment.
"We must continue to defend Hong Kong's autonomy and competitiveness," he said. "This means resisting efforts to integrate us more closely with mainland China, and protecting our unique system of governance and economic freedoms."
Many observers praised Macleod's budget for its emphasis on economic growth and competitiveness, but expressed skepticism that these measures would be enough to protect Hong Kong from the pressures of mainland China.
"Sir Hamish has done an admirable job of promoting economic growth and competitiveness, but he can't do it alone," said Stephen Cheung, a professor of economics at the City University of Hong Kong. "Ultimately, the city's fate rests in the hands of Beijing, and it remains to be seen how much they are willing to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and independence."
Despite these challenges, many residents are cautiously optimistic about the city's future. Hong Kong's economy is still growing at a healthy pace, and the city remains a vital hub for global trade and finance. As the city prepares to enter a new era of Chinese rule, its people are determined to maintain its reputation as one of the world's most dynamic and entrepreneurial centers of commerce.
