Hong Kong’s Chief Judge, Andrew Cheung Kui-nung, has been urged to resign from his position in the judiciary following his announcement to run for the territory’s top post. The move sparked concerns about the judiciary’s impartiality and raised questions about Cheung’s ability to remain impartial in his current role. Critics argue that a chief judge who aspires to become a politician cannot maintain judicial independence and should step down.
Andrew Cheung declared his candidacy on October 18th, 2021, for the position of Hong Kong Chief Executive, in the city’s upcoming election. Cheung has been a judge in Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal since 2018 and was appointed its Chief Judge just last year. His decision to enter politics has drawn criticism from legal experts and human rights groups, who say he has created a conflict of interest.
The Chief Judge has made it clear that he will remain in his position during the election campaign. However, this has not stopped calls for his resignation. Critics argue that the judiciary requires impartiality to maintain the trust of the public. They say that Cheung, by entering politics, has compromised this trust and damaged the reputation of the judiciary.
“Allowing judges to contest an election is a risk to the integrity and independence of the judiciary,” said Mabel Au, the Director of Amnesty International Hong Kong. “There could be a perception of partiality, especially if a judge rules on a case that has implications on the candidate’s election. The judge must step down from his role as chief judge.”
Hong Kong’s judiciary has been under pressure in recent years, with concerns that the Chinese government is eroding the city’s autonomy and interfering in its legal system. Critics say that Cheung’s decision to run for election shows that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to assert its influence over the judiciary, and that Cheung’s candidacy is a ploy to ensure that its candidate wins the election.
A number of legal experts have expressed their concern over the Chief Judge’s decision to run for office, suggesting that he should step down to protect the integrity of the judiciary. They stress that the impartiality of the judiciary is essential to the rule of law, and that it is compromised if a judge seeks to become a political leader.
“The judiciary must remain neutral and above politics, and judges should not be involved in political activities,” said Barrister Wilson Leung, a former member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council. “The Chief Judge should step down to prevent any further damage to the judiciary’s reputation.”
Cheung has defended his decision to run for office, saying that he is entitled to participate in the election as a citizen and that he will continue to carry out his duties as Chief Judge impartially. He has reassured the public that he does not intend to use his position to further his political career, and that he will recuse himself from cases that might present a conflict of interest.
“The Chief Judge is entitled to participate in the election, but he should not do so at the expense of the judiciary’s impartiality,” said Willy Fu, the Chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association. “He faces a difficult balancing act between his duties as a judge and his aspirations as a politician. The Chief Judge must act to ensure that the judiciary remains independent and free from political interference.”
The controversy over Andrew Cheung’s candidacy highlights the delicate balance that must be maintained between the judiciary and politics. The judiciary plays a critical role in upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of individuals. It must remain impartial, independent, and free from political influence. When judges become politicians, this balance is disturbed, and the integrity of the judiciary is compromised.
The controversy also highlights the ongoing struggle for democracy and autonomy in Hong Kong. The city has been wracked by protests and political turmoil in recent years, as its people fight to protect their freedoms and resist the encroachment of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chief Judge’s decision to run for office is just the latest chapter in this struggle and underscores the importance of protecting the independence of Hong Kong’s legal system.
