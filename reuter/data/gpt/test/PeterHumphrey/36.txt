A Hong Kong-based human rights group has expressed scepticism over China's recent pledge to subscribe to the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a treaty that asserts the fundamental human rights of individuals.
China's commitment to sign the ICCPR was announced by Wang Yi, China's Foreign Minister, during his recent visit to the UN's headquarters in New York. The move has been welcomed by some Western governments and human rights groups as a significant step towards better protection of individual rights and freedoms in the country.
However, the Hong Kong-based group, Civil Rights Observer (CRO), has cautioned against hasty optimism. In a statement released on Wednesday, the group contended that there were no guarantees that China's rhetoric would translate into real improvements in the human rights situations of its citizens.
"The Chinese government has a long history of making promises to protect human rights, but little has been done in reality to fulfil these commitments," said CRO's spokesperson. "We are sceptical of China's pledge to adhere to the ICCPR, as it seems to be more of a statement of intent than a genuine desire to ensure human rights protection."
The CRO's statement cited numerous examples of China's human rights abuses, including the recent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, the internment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, and the suppression of Tibetans seeking greater autonomy.
These actions, according to the group, are a clear violation of the ICCPR's provisions on freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and religion. "China needs to address its own human rights violations before it can start talking about subscribing to international human rights treaties," added the CRO's spokesperson.
The CRO's scepticism echoes that of other human rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch, who have urged China to take concrete steps towards improving human rights in the country before signing up to international treaties.
Despite the concerns raised by these groups, however, China's commitment to the ICCPR has been widely seen as a positive development, given its previous reluctance to adopt international human rights standards.
Whether China's declaration will result in meaningful changes on the ground remains to be seen. For the CRO, the proof will be in the pudding. "We will be closely monitoring China's actions to ensure that it upholds its commitment to the ICCPR and to human rights more broadly," concluded the group's spokesperson.
