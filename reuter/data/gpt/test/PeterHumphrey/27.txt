Hong Kong's Democrats Vow to Fight Beijing's Plan to Limit Civil Rights Before Sovereignty Change
Hong Kong's Democratic parties are voicing their resistance to Beijing's plan to limit the civil rights of Hong Kong's citizens before the territory's sovereignty is transferred to China on July 1, 1997.
Pro-democratic officials and activists issued a joint statement protesting the decision made by China's National People's Congress to abolish the Hong Kong Legal Aid Scheme, which provides legal representation to poor residents, and to impose tight restrictions on the territory's foreign contacts. 
"We cannot allow China to roll back the progress that has been made in Hong Kong over the past decade," said Martin Lee, a prominent democracy activist and the chairman of the United Democrats of Hong Kong. "We will fight to preserve the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens have enjoyed under British colonial rule."
The statement, which was signed by 14 pro-democratic groups representing over 1 million members, calls on Beijing to reconsider its decision and to consult with Hong Kong's elected representatives before taking any action that affects the territory's autonomy.
Hong Kong's governor, Chris Patten, has also expressed his opposition to the moves by the Chinese government, calling them a breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which guarantees Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties. In a statement released on May 17, Patten accused China of breaking its treaty obligations and warned that the world was watching its actions.
"China needs to understand that the eyes of the world are on Hong Kong and that they will not be fooled by empty promises or false reassurances," Patten said. "The Sino-British Joint Declaration is a legally binding international treaty that must be respected."
Patten has also written a letter to China's President, Jiang Zemin, urging him to reconsider his government's position and to avoid damaging Hong Kong's future prospects. However, some activists are skeptical about the effectiveness of his strategy.
"Chris Patten has been a vocal critic of China's actions in Hong Kong, but we need more than just words," said Fiona Tang, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. "We need concrete actions to back up his rhetoric."
Meanwhile, pro-Beijing groups in Hong Kong have defended China's actions as necessary to maintain stability and national unity. They have accused Patten and the pro-democratic parties of stirring up trouble and jeopardizing Hong Kong's smooth transition to Chinese rule.
"The Hong Kong Legal Aid Scheme was just a tool for troublemakers to create chaos and undermine the rule of law," said Elsie Leung, a Hong Kong deputy to China's National People's Congress. "The Chinese government has every right to take steps to protect its sovereignty and maintain social stability."
However, many Hong Kong citizens remain wary of China's intentions and are concerned about the impact that the restrictions on civil liberties and foreign contacts will have on their daily lives. In recent weeks, thousands of people have signed petitions and attended rallies to voice their support for democracy and human rights.
"We are fighting for our future, our children's future, and the future of Hong Kong," said Jasmine Li, a student protester. "We don't want to live under a regime that doesn't respect our rights and freedoms."
Despite the challenges posed by China's assertion of authority, Hong Kong's democracy activists and their supporters are determined to continue their struggle for greater autonomy and civil liberties.
"Our fight is not over," Martin Lee said. "We will continue to advocate for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, even in the face of opposition and repression."
