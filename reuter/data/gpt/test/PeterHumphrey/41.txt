Hong Kong’s Democratic Party has welcomed a pledge by Chinese officials to preserve basic freedoms in the city after its 1997 handover. However, the party and other activists disrupted a public consultation on proposed curbs on free speech and assembly.
At the consultation, officials from the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said the city’s legal system, freedom of speech, and other basic rights would be protected under the “one country, two systems” principle that governs the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.
“We will unswervingly implement the principle of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ and the Basic Law,” said Wang Chen, vice chairman of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, referring to Hong Kong’s mini-constitution.
The assurances were met with skepticism by some in attendance, as China has been accused of undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and suppressing dissent in recent years.
“We heard a lot of promises and commitments, but in reality, the Hong Kong people have seen the erosion of our rights and freedoms, including the freedom of the press and the rule of law,” said Lo Kin-hei, chairman of the Democratic Party.
The consultation was part of a review of Hong Kong’s Basic Law, which sets out the city’s legal status and governing framework. Critics say the review could be used to further restrict civil liberties and autonomy in Hong Kong.
Protesters disrupted the event, holding up signs and chanting slogans calling for the protection of free speech and assembly.
“You can’t silence us! We need free speech!” one protester shouted.
The Hong Kong government and its supporters have accused the protest movement of being too aggressive and not engaging in meaningful dialogue. However, the Democratic Party and other activists say they have been shut out of the political process by Beijing and the city’s pro-Beijing government.
“We have been talking to the government for years, but they don’t listen to the people,” said Democratic Party member Wu Chi-wai. “We don’t want to be arrested or beaten up, but we will continue to fight for our rights.”
The political unrest in Hong Kong began in 2019, when millions of people took to the streets to protest a proposed bill that would have allowed people to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China. While the bill was eventually withdrawn, the protests continued and evolved into a wider pro-democracy movement.
Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing government and its supporters have cracked down on the movement, arresting activists and passing a national security law that criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.
Critics say the law is being used to silence dissent and suppress political opposition, and that it undermines Hong Kong’s autonomy and its legal system.
The Chinese government has defended the law, saying it is necessary to maintain stability and protect national security. Officials have also accused foreign countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, of interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs.
The Democratic Party and other pro-democracy activists have called on the international community to support their fight for basic rights and freedoms.
“We need the support of the international community to hold China accountable,” said Wu Chi-wai. “We don’t want to be a colony of China. We want to be a place where people can have basic rights and freedoms.”
The controversy over Hong Kong’s future has been a source of diplomatic tension between China and Western countries, particularly the United States. In response to China’s crackdown, the US has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials and companies and revoked Hong Kong’s preferential trade status.
The US has also expressed support for Hong Kong’s democracy movement and offered to provide asylum to Hong Kong residents who fear persecution.
However, critics say the US’ involvement in Hong Kong risks further inflaming tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
Despite the challenges, the Democratic Party and other activists remain committed to fighting for their rights.
“We will continue to resist,” said Lo Kin-hei. “We will never give up.”
