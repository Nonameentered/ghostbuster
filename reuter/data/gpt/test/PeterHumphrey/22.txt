Hong Kong Legislator Demands Clarity on Communist Party's Role in the Territory After Handover
A Hong Kong legislator has raised concerns about the role of the Communist Party in the city's affairs following the handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. The lawmaker, who wished to remain anonymous, called for greater clarity and transparency on the party's role in Hong Kong's governance.
The legislator said that despite the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, there were growing fears that the Communist Party was seeking to increase its influence in the territory. The lawmaker cited recent moves by the mainland Chinese government to tighten its grip on Hong Kong, including the introduction of a controversial national security law that many fear will curb freedoms in the city.
"There is a real danger that the party is trying to extend its control over Hong Kong and erode the city's autonomy," the legislator said. "We need greater transparency and clarity on the Communist Party's role in our affairs so that we can safeguard the freedoms and rights of Hong Kong people."
The lawmaker called on the Hong Kong government to provide more information on the party's role in the territory, including details of its activities and influence over key institutions such as the judiciary, media, and education system. The legislator also urged the government to ensure that any interference by the party in Hong Kong's affairs was kept to a minimum and that the city's autonomy was respected.
"The party has a role to play in national politics, but it must not be allowed to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms," the legislator added. "We need greater clarity and transparency on the party's activities and influence in the territory so that we can ensure that Hong Kong remains a free, open, and democratic society."
The issue of the Communist Party's role in Hong Kong has become increasingly contentious in recent years, particularly in the wake of the 2019 protests in the city over a proposed extradition law that many saw as an erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. The protests, which were met with a heavy-handed response from the police, led to widespread criticism of the government and calls for greater democracy and autonomy for Hong Kong.
The introduction of the national security law in June 2020 has further heightened concerns about the Communist Party's influence in the city. Critics of the law say it is overly broad and vague, and could be used to crack down on dissent and political opposition in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong government has defended the law, saying it is necessary to protect national security and stability in the city. The government has also sought to reassure residents and foreign investors that Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms will be upheld under the new law.
Despite these assurances, many in Hong Kong remain skeptical about the party's intentions and influence in the territory. The recent crackdown on pro-democracy activists and media outlets, as well as the disqualification of several pro-democracy lawmakers from the Legislative Council, has only served to fuel these fears.
With tensions running high in Hong Kong, the call for greater clarity and transparency on the Communist Party's role in the territory is likely to resonate with many residents. It remains to be seen whether the government will heed these calls and take steps to address these concerns, or whether Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms will continue to be eroded.
