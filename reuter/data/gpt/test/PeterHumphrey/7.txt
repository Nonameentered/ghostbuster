The democracy movement in Hong Kong has likened Beijing's plans to curb civil liberties to China's Cultural Revolution. The plans reportedly include the implementation of a national security law, which would effectively criminalize acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. The law is expected to be imposed on Hong Kong by the end of June.
The democracy movement believes that the law would undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and its status as a separate jurisdiction under the "one country, two systems" policy. They fear that the law would be used to target pro-democracy activists and further suppress political dissent. The pro-democracy camp has also criticized the lack of transparency in the drafting of the law, and the lack of public consultation.
Many believe that the move is a response to the protests in Hong Kong last year, which were sparked by the extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent to mainland China for trial. The bill was later withdrawn, but the protests continued, calling for greater democracy and autonomy for Hong Kong.
The democracy movement has drawn parallels between Beijing's plans for Hong Kong and the Cultural Revolution, a period of political turmoil in China from 1966 to 1976. The Cultural Revolution was initiated by Mao Zedong, the founder of the People's Republic of China, who sought to purge capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society.
During the Cultural Revolution, intellectuals, artists, and officials deemed disloyal to the Communist Party were targeted and persecuted. Many were subjected to public humiliation, torture, and even death. Schools and universities were closed, and the education system was restructured to promote revolutionary ideology.
The democracy movement in Hong Kong sees similarities between the Cultural Revolution and Beijing's plans for Hong Kong, in terms of the suppression of dissent and the imposition of a rigid political ideology. They argue that the national security law represents a threat to Hong Kong's civil liberties, and that it would erode the rule of law and the city's status as a global financial center.
The international community has also expressed concerns about Beijing's plans for Hong Kong. The United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom have issued a joint statement expressing their deep concern. The statement called for China to uphold its international commitments and respect Hong Kong's autonomy and the freedoms enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
The European Union has also issued a statement expressing its concern, and calling for a dialogue between Beijing and Hong Kong. The EU has urged China to respect the rights of Hong Kong's citizens, and to refrain from any actions that could lead to further polarization and violence.
In response to the criticism, China has accused the international community of meddling in its internal affairs. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry has stated that the national security law is necessary to safeguard national security, and that it would not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy.
The democracy movement in Hong Kong, however, remains resolute in its opposition to the national security law. Protests have resumed in the city, despite the public health risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The movement has called for international support and solidarity, and is urging the international community to exert pressure on Beijing to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties.
The democracy movement in Hong Kong is facing an uphill battle, as Beijing appears determined to implement the national security law. However, the movement's determination and resilience have earned it the admiration of many around the world, who see it as a beacon of hope in the face of authoritarianism and oppression. Whether the movement will ultimately succeed in its quest for democracy and autonomy remains to be seen, but its spirit is sure to endure.
