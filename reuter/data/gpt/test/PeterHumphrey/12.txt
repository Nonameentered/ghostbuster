Pro-China party leader Tsang Yok-Sing has for years been one of the most influential figures in Hong Kong politics, but few know just how he became the man he is today. Born in 1947, Tsang grew up in a city still recovering from the horrors of World War II. It was a time of uncertainty and change, as Hong Kong moved from colonial rule to a more independent status.
But it was the 1967 riots that left a lasting impression on the young Tsang. For him and many others, it was a turning point in Hong Kong's history, a moment when the people of the city rose up against the government and demanded change. And it was here that Tsang found his voice, and his political calling.
The riots began on 6 May 1967, when a labour dispute at a plastic flower factory in Kowloon escalated into violence. Over the following months, Hong Kong was rocked by a series of bombings, arson attacks and street battles, as left-wing groups fought against the colonial government and its police force.
Tsang was just 20 years old at the time, but he was already a student activist with the leftist Hong Kong Federation of Students. He quickly became involved in the protests, organising rallies and marches, and speaking out against what he saw as the government's oppressive policies.
"It was a very intense period," Tsang recalls. "We were young and idealistic, and we believed in the power of the people to bring about change. We wanted a fairer, more equal Hong Kong, and we were willing to fight for it."
Tsang's involvement in the riots brought him into contact with a range of left-wing groups, including the Communist Party of China and its Hong Kong branch, the Chinese Coordination Centre of Hong Kong and Macao. It was through these connections that Tsang began to see China as a potential ally in the struggle for Hong Kong's future.
"The Communist Party of China was at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle in Hong Kong," Tsang says. "They were supporting the left-wing groups, and they saw us as part of the revolution. It was a very exciting time, because we felt we were part of something much bigger than ourselves."
But as the riots dragged on, the violence escalated, and the government responded with even harsher measures. Thousands of people were arrested, and some were even killed in clashes with the police. It was a traumatic period for Hong Kong, and Tsang himself was not immune to the effects of the violence.
"I was arrested three times during the riots," he says. "I was beaten by the police, and I spent time in jail. It was a very difficult time, but it also made me more determined to fight for what I believed in."
After the riots ended, Tsang continued to be involved in left-wing politics, but he gradually became disillusioned with the direction the movement was taking. He felt that the Communists were too focused on the mainland, and that they were not doing enough to fight for the rights of the people in Hong Kong. And so, in the early 1970s, he left the movement and began to explore other political options.
It was around this time that Tsang became interested in the idea of a closer relationship with China. He saw the country not as a threat, but as a potential ally in the fight for Hong Kong's future. In 1974, he founded the Hong Kong Democratic Foundation, which advocated for greater autonomy for the city and closer ties with China.
"The idea of a 'one country, two systems' model was very attractive to me," Tsang says. "I believed that Hong Kong could have the best of both worlds â€“ a strong economy and a vibrant civil society, while still maintaining its distinct identity."
In the years that followed, Tsang continued to be a influential figure in Hong Kong politics. He served as a member of the Legislative Council, and he was one of the architects of the Basic Law, the document that outlined Hong Kong's status as a Special Administrative Region of China.
Today, Tsang is the chairman of the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), one of the largest political parties in the city. He remains a controversial figure, respected by some and reviled by others.
But no one can deny the influence that his involvement in the 1967 riots had on the man he is today. For Tsang, those riots were a formative experience, a moment when he found his political voice and his sense of purpose.
"I will always be grateful for that time," he says. "The riots made me who I am today, and I will always be proud of the role I played in fighting for a better Hong Kong."
