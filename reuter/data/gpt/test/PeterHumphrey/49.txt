Hong Kong democracy advocate urges new leader to match words with deeds on civil liberties plan
As Carrie Lam, the new leader of Hong Kong, begins her term in office, she faces mounting pressure from democracy advocates who are calling upon her to take decisive action to protect civil liberties in the territory. One of these activists, Joshua Wong, has issued a statement urging Lam to match her words with deeds when it comes to protecting Hong Kong's basic freedoms.
Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist who rose to prominence during the Umbrella Movement protests in 2014, has been a vocal critic of Lam's predecessor, Leung Chun-ying. He has accused Leung of using his position as chief executive to erode civil liberties in the territory and has called upon Lam to reverse this trend.
In his statement, Wong challenged Lam to live up to her promises to protect civil liberties, particularly those relating to freedom of speech and assembly. He called upon her to take concrete steps to address concerns about the erosion of these fundamental rights, and to ensure that Hong Kong continues to be a vibrant and open society.
"Carrie Lam has said that she supports civil liberties and freedom of expression, but we have yet to see any real action on her part to protect these values," Wong said. "We urge her to take decisive action to ensure that Hong Kong remains a free and open society, where people are free to express themselves and to protest peacefully."
Wong's statement comes at a time when many in Hong Kong are concerned about the erosion of civil liberties in the territory. The Chinese government has been exerting increasing pressure on Hong Kong in recent years, using a variety of tactics to suppress dissent and stifle free speech.
In particular, the Chinese government has sought to assert greater control over Hong Kong's political system, making it more difficult for pro-democracy activists to participate in the political process. This has led to widespread protests and calls for greater protection of civil liberties.
Wong and other activists have been at the forefront of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, using their high profiles to raise awareness of the issues facing the territory. They are determined to hold Lam accountable for her promises to protect civil liberties, and to ensure that Hong Kong remains a free and open society.
"We cannot afford to sit back and watch as our civil liberties are eroded," Wong said. "We must hold our leaders accountable and demand that they take concrete action to protect our freedoms."
Wong's statement has been widely circulated in Hong Kong, and has received support from many in the pro-democracy movement. It is likely to put additional pressure on Lam to take action to protect civil liberties in the territory, and to ensure that Hong Kong remains a vibrant and open society.
Lam has publicly expressed her commitment to protecting civil liberties in Hong Kong. In her inaugural address, she promised to uphold Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" principle and to ensure that Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life are preserved.
However, many in the pro-democracy movement remain skeptical of Lam's promises. They point to her record as chief secretary under Leung Chun-ying, which they say was marked by a lack of action to protect civil liberties in the territory.
As Lam begins her term in office, she will face intense scrutiny from democracy advocates who are determined to hold her accountable for her promises to protect civil liberties in Hong Kong. She will need to take action to address their concerns if she hopes to gain their trust and support.
The stakes are high for Lam and for Hong Kong. The territory's reputation as a vibrant and open society is on the line, and its future as a free and democratic society is at stake. If Lam is able to take decisive action to protect civil liberties in the territory, she could go down in history as a champion of Hong Kong's freedoms. If not, she risks being remembered as another leader who failed to live up to her promises.
