Amidst the ongoing territorial disputes over the South China Sea islands, and the rising nationalism in China, Hong Kong has witnessed anti-Japanese sentiment surfacing in recent weeks.
The growing tension between China and Japan over the sovereignty of the disputed islands in the South China Sea has resulted in a wave of anti-Japanese sentiment across China. With Japan seen as a historical rival for dominance in the region, the escalating tensions have led to calls for boycotts of Japanese goods and protests across the country.
In Hong Kong, where there is a significant Japanese community, the mounting tensions between China and Japan have resulted in anti-Japanese sentiment starting to surface. Local media reports and social media posts have recently highlighted incidents where Japanese tourists and businesses have been targeted by angry Hong Kong residents.
Earlier this month, a group of Hong Kong protesters gathered outside a Japanese department store in the city to denounce Japan's claims over the disputed islands. The protesters chanted slogans and carried signs urging a boycott of Japanese-made goods.
In another incident, a Japanese woman claimed that she was verbally abused by a group of Hong Kong residents on a train. The woman alleged that the group of Hong Kong residents had used abusive language against her and blamed her for the tension between the two countries.
According to some experts, the spike in anti-Japanese sentiment in Hong Kong can be attributed to the rising nationalism in China. The Chinese government has portrayed the territorial disputes as a matter of national pride, portraying Japan as a historical enemy and using the issue to rally support for the government.
The government's efforts have been reflected in China's media, which has played a significant role in amplifying anti-Japanese sentiment. The media has highlighted incidents where Japan has been seen as acting aggressively, contributing to public anger and calls for boycotts.
In Hong Kong, where there is a significant population of Chinese citizens, this rising nationalism has seeped into the city's politics and society. The growing anti-Japanese sentiment is seen as a result of this nationalism, with some residents blaming Japan for the territorial disputes and calling for a boycott of Japanese goods.
The Japanese community in Hong Kong has expressed concern over the situation. According to local media reports, some Japanese businesses in the city have seen a drop in customers, and some Japanese residents have reported receiving threats and abuse.
The Japanese consulate in Hong Kong has also raised concerns over the situation. In a statement, the consulate expressed concern over the incidents of “discrimination and other negative behavior” towards the Japanese community in the city. The consulate urged the Hong Kong authorities to take steps to ensure the safety and security of all foreign nationals in the city.
The Hong Kong government has condemned the incidents of anti-Japanese sentiment, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam stating that the “discrimination” against Japanese residents and tourists in the city was “unacceptable”. Lam urged Hong Kong residents to express their views in a peaceful and rational manner.
As tensions continue to rise over the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the situation in Hong Kong highlights the dangers of rising nationalism and the potential for it to spill over into neighbouring countries. With the Chinese government using the issue to rally support for its policies, and with the media amplifying anti-Japanese sentiment, it is crucial for governments and societies to remain vigilant and ensure that xenophobic behaviour is not tolerated.
