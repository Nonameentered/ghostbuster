China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has recently announced its plan to use Hong Kong to improve its negative image. According to the future garrison commander, this could result in more comprehensive integration between the PLA and the local community. This announcement comes amid international criticism of China's human rights record, particularly in regards to Hong Kong and its recent political unrest.
The future garrison commander, Major General Chen Daoxiang, made this announcement during an interview with Chinese media. He stated that the PLA's presence in Hong Kong will allow for "closer exchanges with the local people" and "joint efforts to promote social stability and prosperity." The idea is to foster a better understanding of the PLA and its mission, as well as to improve its overall reputation.
This move is part of a larger effort by China to change the narrative around its human rights record in Hong Kong. The PLA has often been accused of interfering in Hong Kong's political affairs and committing human rights abuses. These allegations have only intensified after the recent passage of the controversial National Security Law, which criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces in Hong Kong.
Despite these criticisms, Major General Chen believes that the PLA's presence in Hong Kong will have a positive impact on the local community. He highlighted the PLA's role in disaster relief and humanitarian aid, noting that the garrison has provided support during natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes. He also emphasized the PLA's commitment to upholding Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, stating that "We will never allow any troublemakers to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability."
The future garrison commander also commented on the role of the Hong Kong garrison in fulfilling the "one country, two systems" policy. This policy, which was established when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, is designed to allow Hong Kong to maintain its own legal and economic system while still being part of China. Major General Chen stated that the garrison is committed to upholding this policy and working with the Hong Kong government to ensure a smooth transition.
The announcement has been met with mixed reactions in Hong Kong. Some see it as an opportunity for better communication and understanding between the PLA and the local community, while others are skeptical that this move is simply a PR stunt to improve China's image. There are concerns that the PLA's presence in Hong Kong could further erode the city's autonomy and lead to greater restrictions on civil liberties.
Moreover, many Hong Kong citizens who participated in the pro-democracy movement of 2019 hold deep-seated grievances against the PLA, which they see as an occupying force rather than a benevolent protector. They fear that the PLA's involvement will only further fuel tensions in the city.
There is also skepticism about the PLA's ability to shed its bad image. Despite the organization's efforts to portray itself as a force for good, many critics see the PLA as an extension of the Chinese Communist Party, committed to maintaining authoritarian rule and suppressing dissent. The recent crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong has only reinforced this view.
Nevertheless, Major General Chen's announcement demonstrates that China is aware of the negative perception surrounding the PLA and its actions in Hong Kong. Whether this new approach will be successful in promoting a more positive image remains to be seen.
