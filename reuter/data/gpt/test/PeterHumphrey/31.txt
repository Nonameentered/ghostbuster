Hong Kong’s Democratic Party has launched a mission to the West to brief on China’s takeover of the city and how the Communist Party's actions undermine the “one country, two systems” principle that has been in effect since the handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. The delegation will consist of party members and activists who will meet with government officials, lawmakers, and civil society groups in the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The delegation will brief Western officials on how Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms have been eroded since the Chinese Government introduced a national security law in June last year. The new law has enabled Beijing authorities to crack down on the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, resulting in the arrest of opposition figures and activists. Scores of lawmakers and activists have fled Hong Kong in recent months for fear of persecution under the new laws.
The mission to the West is aimed at raising awareness about China's actions and garnering support for Hong Kong’s democratic movement. The delegation will also call for the international community to hold China accountable for its actions and for democratic governments to impose sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses.
"We need to let the world know that Hong Kong is not just a city; it is a symbol of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. We must fight for the survival of our city and our way of life,” Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist and member of the delegation said.
The delegation will also brief the Western officials on the impact of the new national security law on Hong Kong's economy and international standing. Many international businesses and financial institutions have their offices in Hong Kong, the world's leading financial hub. But the new law has cast a shadow of uncertainty over Hong Kong, and many firms have started to consider relocating to other cities in the region.
"Many foreign businesses are starting to re-evaluate their presence in Hong Kong as the city’s autonomy and rule of law have been eroded. The flight of businesses and capital is a major concern for Hong Kong's economy," said Emily Lau, a former lawmaker and member of the delegation.
The delegation will also highlight the human rights abuses taking place in Hong Kong, including the persecution of pro-democracy activists, journalists, and the lack of a fair trial. The Chinese Government's actions have been widely condemned by the international community with many countries expressing concern about the erosion of human rights in Hong Kong.
"The world has a moral obligation to stand with the people of Hong Kong and support their struggle for democracy and freedom. We call on democratic governments and civil society to speak out against China's human rights abuses and to impose targeted sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for these abuses," Andrew Wan, the party's deputy chairman and member of the delegation said.
The delegation will meet with officials from the United States, Canada, and Europe, where there is growing concern about China's aggressive behavior towards Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other neighboring countries. Many Western countries have expressed their support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and have condemned China's efforts to erode the city's autonomy.
The mission to the West comes at a time when China's relations with the West are strained due to a range of issues including trade, technology, and human rights. The United States has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the human rights abuses in Hong Kong, and there are calls for more countries to follow suit.
"The U.S. and other countries have taken some actions to hold China accountable for its human rights abuses, but there is more that needs to be done. We call on the international community to take a firm stand against China's aggression towards Hong Kong and to support the democratic movement in the city," said Nathan Law, a pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker, now in exile in London.
The mission to the West is expected to put a spotlight on the situation in Hong Kong and increase pressure on China to respect human rights and democracy. The delegation hopes that their trip will help to build international solidarity with Hong Kong and encourage governments around the world to support the democratic movement in the city.
