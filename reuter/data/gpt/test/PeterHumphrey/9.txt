The former British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has called on China to respect press freedom in the territory ahead of the 20th anniversary of its handover. In a speech on Friday, Patten expressed his concern over the deteriorating press situation in Hong Kong, which has led to tensions between the autonomous city and mainland China.
Patten, who was the last governor of Hong Kong during British rule from 1992 to 1997, said that the Chinese government should honor its commitment to maintain the city's autonomy and protect its freedoms, including freedom of the press.
"Hong Kong's success is based on its openness, its pluralism, its rule of law, and its freedom of expression. These freedoms are under threat," Patten said. "It's important that Hong Kong remains an example of how the rule of law and basic freedoms can work well in China."
Patten's comments come amid growing concerns about the fate of press freedom in the former British colony. Journalists have faced increasing pressure and intimidation from both local authorities and Chinese officials in the past few years, leading to a sharp decline in press freedom rankings.
According to the 2020 Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, Hong Kong dropped to the 80th place, down from the 18th in 2019, as a result of the city's deteriorating press situation. This is the lowest ranking that Hong Kong has ever received since the index's inception in 2002.
In his speech, Patten highlighted the case of Jimmy Lai, the founder of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong. Lai was arrested and charged under the national security law in August, and his newspaper has been forced to close down after its assets were frozen by the Hong Kong government.
"This is not an isolated case. Hong Kong journalists, many of whom have been working bravely to report on events in the territory, face increasing pressure, harassment and even violence, from both local authorities and mainland Chinese officials," Patten said.
Patten's speech has been widely welcomed by journalists and press freedom advocates in Hong Kong and around the world. The International Federation of Journalists issued a statement on Friday calling on Chinese authorities to "respect the basic rights of freedom of expression, assembly and association, and to stop the harassment of journalists."
The call for greater press freedom comes at a critical time for Hong Kong as it marks the 20th anniversary of its handover to Chinese rule on July 1. The city's autonomy and freedoms, including freedom of the press, were supposed to be protected under the "one country, two systems" framework agreed upon by China and Britain in the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984.
However, many in Hong Kong feel that the "one country, two systems" principle has been eroded in recent years, with the Chinese government exerting greater control over the city's political and social affairs.
The passing of the national security law last year, which criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, has heightened fears of a crackdown on dissent and freedom of the press in Hong Kong.
As the 20th anniversary of the handover approaches, there are growing calls for China to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms, including the freedom of the press. Patten's intervention is a timely reminder of the importance of these values to Hong Kong's success and to its position as a beacon of democracy and freedom.
"What happens in Hong Kong matters not only to the people of Hong Kong but to the people of the world who care about freedom," Patten said. "It's time for China to honor its commitments and respect the autonomy and freedoms of Hong Kong."
