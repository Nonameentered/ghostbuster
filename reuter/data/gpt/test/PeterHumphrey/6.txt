The UK and US have issued a warning to China to uphold its commitment to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy, freedoms and human rights after the handover in 1997. The statement comes after China passed a sweeping national security law for Hong Kong that critics say violates its promised "one country, two systems" framework.
The UK's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, along with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, released the joint statement on Tuesday, stating that "the United Kingdom and United States urge the Government of the People's Republic of China to respect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and rights and freedoms enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration."
The declaration was signed in 1984 by China and the UK, before the 1997 handover. It stipulated that Hong Kong would be governed under the principle of "one country, two systems," allowing it to maintain its capitalist economy, independent judiciary, and individual freedoms. However, fears have grown over the erosion of those freedoms since the introduction of the national security law.
The new law was enacted on June 30, soon after the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, despite opposition from many Hong Kong residents and the international community. The legislation criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, with maximum penalties of life imprisonment.
Critics argue that the law gives Beijing broad powers to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms, and that it goes against the spirit of the Joint Declaration. The UK and US statement expressed deep concerns about the legislation, saying it undermines Hong Kong's autonomy, erodes the city's freedoms, and is contrary to the Hong Kong Basic Law.
The statement also warned that the UK and US would "consider carefully appropriate measures to hold to account those responsible for the erosion of Hong Kong’s freedoms," without giving details of what potential measures could be taken.
On the same day, the UK announced that it would suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, as well as extending an arms embargo to the region. These measures were announced as part of a broader package of responses to the national security law, which also includes a new visa scheme for Hong Kong residents with British National (Overseas) status.
The Hong Kong government and China's foreign ministry have both criticized the UK's move, calling it a violation of international law and interference in China's internal affairs. China has also threatened retaliation if the UK interferes in its internal affairs, though it did not specify what form that retaliation might take.
The UK and US joint statement follows similar warnings from other countries and organizations, including Australia, Canada, the European Union, and the United Nations. The United States has also taken steps to revoke Hong Kong's special trade status and restrict travel visas for officials deemed responsible for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.
As tensions rise between China and the international community over Hong Kong, it remains to be seen how the situation will develop. China has shown no signs of backing down on the national security law, while the UK and US are under pressure to demonstrate their commitment to protecting Hong Kong's freedoms.
