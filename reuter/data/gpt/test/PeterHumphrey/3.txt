Recently, China has come under heavy criticism for amending Hong Kong's Basic Law- a set of laws that protect the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers, ahead of the territory's return to Chinese rule. This move represents a significant erosion of democracy and human rights safeguards in the semi-autonomous region, and many worry about the long-term implications of this decision.
Hong Kong's political system is unique within China. It enjoys a high degree of autonomy, a separate legal system, and a unique political structure with an elected Legislative Council and several elected district councils. When Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, both parties agreed that Hong Kong would retain its political system and legal framework under the principle of "One Country, Two Systems." This arrangement meant that Hong Kongers could enjoy greater democratic and human rights protections than mainland Chinese citizens.
In 2020, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has passed new laws and made changes to Hong Kong's Basic Law, which has significantly undermined these democratic and human rights safeguards in Hong Kong. The new laws allow Beijing to unilaterally disqualify lawmakers or candidates whom it deems insufficiently loyal to China, prohibit protests, and limit freedom of speech, assembly, and the press, among other changes.
Furthermore, the Chinese authorities have already begun restricting free speech and political activism in Hong Kong in the lead-up to the 2021 legislative elections. Last July, the Hong Kong government disqualified 12 pro-democracy candidates from running for office on the grounds that their political views went against the Basic Law. This decision effectively disqualified the pro-democracy opposition from having any say in the legislative body. Similarly, several pro-democracy activists have been arrested or detained for voicing their opinions on social media or holding unauthorized protests. These actions are undemocratic and violate the right to free speech, which Hong Kongers should be able to enjoy.
Many Hong Kongers fear that these changes will further restrict their civil liberties and that Beijing will not stop at censoring critical voices and disqualifying opposition candidates from running into the legislative council.
Some Hong Kong officials have argued that these changes were necessary to safeguard Hong Kong's security and stability. Critics of the new laws, however, have pointed out that they are being used to suppress political dissent and infringe on Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status. Additionally, they note that the region has been stable for over two decades, and these new restrictions are not necessary to maintain stability.
The international community, too, has been swift to condemn these changes. Since China is a member of the United Nations, it is bound by international treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The ICCPR upholds the rights of citizens to freedom of speech, assembly, and political participation. By restricting these rights, China is violating the human rights of Hong Kongers and breaking agreements it made with Britain in 1997.
Human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have warned that these changes will impact not only Hong Kongers but also Chinese citizens. Hong Kong has been an important hub for journalists, activists, and scholars covering China's human rights abuses, and many fear that the new restrictions will make it difficult for outsiders to have a voice in Chinese affairs.
In conclusion, China's recent amendments to Hong Kong's Basic Law are a significant erosion of democracy and human rights protections for Hong Kongers. The international community must take a stand and demand that China respect the rights of Hong Kongers. Governments worldwide need to urge China to repeal these new restrictions and respect its international human rights obligations. The world's most populous country must not be allowed to violate the civil liberties of others with impunity - especially when that country is a member of the United Nations and signed onto the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
