Hong Kong's former chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, has unveiled a new office in the city's central financial district, which is to be led by Confucian values and ethics. The move comes ahead of the planned shift of Hong Kong's sovereignty to Chinese rule in 2047.
The office space, located on the 27th floor of the Cheung Kong Center, boasts a stunning view of the harbor and waterfall at IFC Mall. In a statement to the press, Tung Chee-hwa said that the Confucian-led office will promote traditional Chinese values of morality, social order, respect for authority, and patriotism.
Tung, 84, is a Beijing-approved figure who served as Hong Kong's first leader after the city's handover from British rule in 1997. He is known for his close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and has been credited with championing the mainland's economic interests in Hong Kong.
In his new role, Tung will lead a team of experts in promoting Confucian values in Hong Kong and neighboring countries. The team members will come from various fields, including academics, civil servants, and business leaders.
The move has been praised by some, who see it as a way to reinforce Hong Kong's Chinese identity and reconnect with the mainland. However, others have criticized the move, saying that it is an attempt to suppress dissent and undermine Hong Kong's democratic values.
Hong Kong has a complex relationship with China, which has promised to uphold the 'one country, two systems' formula governing the city's autonomy until 2047. Critics say that China has increasingly encroached on Hong Kong's freedoms, with many residents expressing concern over the erosion of their civil liberties.
Protests in Hong Kong erupted last year over a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the protests continued, with many calling for greater democratic rights and autonomy.
The Confucian-led office comes at a time when Hong Kong is grappling with its relationship with China and seeking to assert its identity as a global financial hub. While some see it as a forward-looking initiative, others fear that it could be used to clamp down on political dissent and undermine Hong Kong's democratic freedoms.
Tung Chee-hwa has sought to allay these fears, saying that the office's primary focus is on promoting traditional Chinese values, not suppressing dissent. He added that the office would work closely with the community to ensure that its work is inclusive and beneficial to all.
The launch of the Confucian-led office has generated significant interest in Hong Kong and beyond, with many watching closely to see how it develops. Some are hopeful that it could provide a much-needed anchor and framework for Hong Kong's relationship with China, while others fear that it could mark the beginning of a new era of repression.
As Hong Kong prepares for Chinese rule, the role of traditional Chinese values and ethics is likely to become increasingly important. Whether the Confucian-led office serves as a model for the future or as a warning of what's to come remains to be seen.
