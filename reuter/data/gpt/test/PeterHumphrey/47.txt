Hong Kong, a vibrant city that has enjoyed a democratic way of life, is facing a new threat to its freedoms and human rights ahead of the Chinese rule takeover. This situation has been flagged by various rights groups. They are now warning about the possibility of serious threats to human rights in the city-state.
Activists fear that the new national security law in Hong Kong, which was passed by the Chinese government in June, could hinder opposition protests. This could further harm the civil liberties of the Hong Kong people. The law covers crimes categorized into subversion, secessionism, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces.
Human Rights Watch released a report last month highlighting the impact of the national security law and warned that the legal system's erosion was fundamental. This issue could result in the restriction and silencing of human rights activists and pro-democracy advocates.
The Hong Kong police have already used the new legislation to stage high-profile arrests. Since the announcement of the controversial security law, Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy tycoon and one of the most vocal critics of the Beijing government, was arrested. Other activists and opposition figures also received summons. Even if they comply with the rules, they risk being kept in custody without a fair trial. Moreover, it is feared that the new law will make it easier for the Chinese government to extradite Hong Kong people, and they will be charged with breaking Chinese laws.
Rights groups are concerned than the Chinese national security law will lead to the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has passed several laws that are demonstrably repressive. This includes restricting demonstrations and limiting freedom of expression.
Human Rights Watch pointed out in their recent report that "the national security law jeopardizes the effectiveness of Hong Kong's legal system as it empowers Beijing to bypass the Hong Kong Judiciary." This could have serious implications for the territory's commitment to safeguarding Rule of Law and its much-cherished judicial autonomy.
Forced disappearances are a widening concern in Hong Kong. In January 2018, Hong Kong's Causeway Bay Books, a bookstore specializing in books that were critical of the Beijing government, encountered some serious issues. The manager and booksellers all become missing. It is still unknown what happened to them today.
Rights groups also worry about the suppression of freedom of association. The freedom to form or join unions has been violated in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, where workers have filed labour disputes. Advertisements for civil society and cultural events are routinely censored in Hong Kong and Macau.
The United Nations, along with various human rights organizations, has recently expressed concern over the possible impact of the new security law in Hong Kong. The UN informed that the law's vague language could be abused to curb the rights of Hong Kong citizens and restrict their freedom of expression and assembly.
In the face of mounting repression, international intervention seems necessary now more than ever. The UK, for example, has promised to deliver a "path to citizenship" for approximately 3 million Hong Kong residents if they decide to leave the city. The issue has also been raised internationally, with US President Donald Trump signing an executive order last July officially ending the city's special status as a separate entity from China.
In conclusion, Hong Kong's future hangs in the balance. Its status as one of Asia's most dynamic cities is now in danger. The international community and the United Nationsmust work closely with the Hong Kong people and their democratic government to push back against China's repression and protect human rights and the Rule of Law. Only with such efforts can the world ensure Hong Kong's continued prosperity.
