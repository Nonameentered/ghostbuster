Britain and the United States have issued stern warnings to China over its proposed scrapping of civil liberties in Hong Kong. The move by Beijing is seen as a direct threat to the freedoms and autonomy that Hong Kong has enjoyed since the former British colony was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The Chinese government has proposed a new security law for Hong Kong that would criminalize activities seen as subversive, secessionist, or terrorist, and would allow Chinese intelligence agencies to operate in the territory. The proposed law has sparked widespread protests and drawn international condemnation.
The Chinese government has defended its plan, saying it is necessary to maintain stability and security in Hong Kong. However, the proposed law has raised concerns that China is seeking to undermine Hong Kong's democratic system and crack down on political dissent.
The British government has condemned the proposed law, calling it a "clear violation" of Hong Kong's autonomy. In a statement, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK was "deeply concerned by proposals to impose national security legislation in Hong Kong".
"We urge the Chinese government to respect Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and rights and freedoms enshrined in the Joint Declaration and Basic Law," Raab said, referring to the agreements that were signed between Britain and China ahead of the handover.
Raab also warned that if China went ahead with the proposed law, it would be a "grave step" and could lead to the UK reviewing its relationship with Hong Kong. The UK has previously warned that it would extend the right to settle in the UK to millions of Hong Kong citizens if China breached its international obligations.
The US has also condemned the proposed law, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying it would be a "death knell" for the autonomy that Hong Kong has enjoyed for more than two decades. Pompeo said that the US was "closely watching" the situation in Hong Kong and that Washington was considering measures to support Hong Kong's autonomy.
"Any effort to impose national security legislation that does not reflect the will of the people of Hong Kong would be highly destabilizing, and would be met with strong condemnation from the United States and the international community," Pompeo said.
President Donald Trump has also vowed to respond "very strongly" if China goes ahead with the proposed law. In an interview with Reuters, Trump said that he was "displeased" with China and that the US was "doing some things" that would be revealed in the coming days.
The proposed law has also drawn criticism from human rights groups, who say that it would be a severe blow to the freedoms and autonomy that Hong Kong has enjoyed since its return to Chinese rule.
"China's proposed national security law for Hong Kong would be a disaster for the territory's freedoms and autonomy," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "Beijing should abandon this proposal, and the Hong Kong government should protect its people's rights."
The proposed law has yet to be finalized, but it is expected to be passed by China's National People's Congress this week. The move has been met with protests in Hong Kong, with thousands taking to the streets to oppose the law.
The situation in Hong Kong is likely to be a major point of tension between China and the west. The proposed law is seen as a direct challenge to the democratic values that are championed by the UK and the US, and is likely to further strain relations between China and the western powers.
