Macau, China â€“ Edmund Ho, the former Chief Executive of Macau, has been tipped as a possible future leader of the territory following China's takeover of the former Portuguese colony. Mr. Ho, who served as Chief Executive from 1999 to 2009, is seen as a popular and capable leader who could successfully navigate the challenges facing Macau under Chinese authority.
China officially took control of Macau on December 20, 1999, ending more than 400 years of Portuguese rule. Since then, the territory has experienced unprecedented growth and development, driven largely by the gaming industry. Macau is now the world's largest gambling hub, with a gaming industry worth approximately $37 billion in 2019.
However, with this growth has come new challenges. Macau's economy is highly dependent on the gaming sector, which is vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy. The territory has also been hit hard by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with tourism levels plummeting and the gaming industry suffering a significant decline in revenue.
Despite these challenges, Edmund Ho is seen by many as the ideal candidate to lead Macau into the future. "He has a deep understanding of the territory and its people, and he has always demonstrated a strong commitment to Macau's development," said Ho Iat Seng, the current Chief Executive of Macau.
Mr. Ho's track record as Chief Executive is impressive. During his tenure, he oversaw significant improvements in education and healthcare services, as well as the construction of new infrastructure, including the Macau-Taipa Bridge and the Cotai Strip. He also implemented measures to diversify Macau's economy beyond the gaming sector, encouraging the growth of other industries such as tourism and finance.
Mr. Ho's leadership style has been described as calm, measured, and effective. He is known for his ability to build consensus and work collaboratively with different stakeholders, including the business community, lawmakers, and civic groups. His approach has been lauded for promoting greater transparency, accountability, and public participation in decision-making processes.
"He always listens carefully to the views of others and is willing to consider different perspectives," said Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of the Macao Government Tourism Office. "He is a true leader who can inspire confidence and trust among the people of Macau."
Mr. Ho's popularity has been reflected in several public opinion polls. A survey conducted by the Macau Daily News in 2019 found that 85% of respondents had a positive view of Mr. Ho, while only 3% had a negative view. Another poll conducted by the University of Macau in 2020 found that 88% of respondents believed that Mr. Ho had made a positive contribution to the development of Macau.
However, some have expressed concerns about the extent to which China will allow Mr. Ho to exercise his leadership skills in the future. China has been tightening its grip on Macau in recent years, cracking down on dissidents and tightening control over the territory's media and civil society organizations. Some observers worry that Mr. Ho may be constrained in his ability to promote greater democracy and human rights in Macau.
"Mr. Ho is undoubtedly a capable leader, but his ability to bring about meaningful changes may be limited by China's authoritarian approach to governance," said Wu Qiang, a political analyst based in Beijing. "He will have to walk a tightrope between serving the interests of the Chinese Communist Party and responding to the demands of the people of Macau."
Despite these challenges, many remain optimistic about Mr. Ho's prospects for the future. "He is a leader who can rise to the occasion, and we believe that he will be able to navigate the complexities and challenges of Macau under Chinese rule," said Mr. Ho Iat Seng.
Mr. Ho himself has remained relatively tight-lipped about his future plans. However, in a recent interview with the South China Morning Post, he expressed his commitment to the people of Macau and his willingness to serve the territory in whatever capacity he could.
"I have always believed that public service is a noble calling, and I am ready to contribute to the development of Macau in any way I can," he said. "I am optimistic about the future of Macau and confident that the people of Macau will continue to prosper and thrive under Chinese sovereignty."
Only time will tell whether Mr. Ho will be able to fulfill his potential as a leader of Macau in the coming years. However, one thing is clear: he has the skills, experience, and public support needed to shape a better future for the people of Macau.
