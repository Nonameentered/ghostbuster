China Plans to Roll Back Political Freedoms in Hong Kong Despite Opposition
China has announced plans to impose tough national security laws on Hong Kong, a move that critics say will limit the city's freedoms and could lead to a clampdown on pro-democracy protests.
The announcement was made on Friday at the opening of China's National People's Congress, the country's top legislative body. The move comes after months of protests in Hong Kong, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill that critics said would have undermined the city's legal system.
However, the proposed law goes much further than the extradition bill, extending China's reach into Hong Kong's legal system and potentially curtailing free speech and assembly.
Under the new law, Beijing could establish new security agencies in Hong Kong and prohibit acts of "secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference." It would also allow China's central government to override local government decisions.
The move has been widely condemned by human rights groups, pro-democracy activists and foreign governments.
"This is a significant step back for Hong Kong," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "Beijing is using security as a pretext to pursue an agenda that will erode the liberties and freedoms that Hong Kong residents have long enjoyed."
Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed back to China in 1997 under a "one country, two systems" agreement that guaranteed the city a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not seen elsewhere in China.
Under that system, Hong Kong has its own legal system, police force and a separate immigration and customs regime. However, activists say that China has been eroding those freedoms in recent years, particularly since Xi Jinping became president in 2013.
The latest move is likely to inflame already tense relations between China and the US. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose sanctions on China over its crackdown on Hong Kong, which he said was endangering the territory's "way of life."
"China has replaced its promised formula of 'one country, two systems' with 'one country, one system,'" said Trump. "The United States will take necessary steps to sanction any individuals or entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom."
The UK government has also condemned China's move, saying it breaches the terms of the handover agreement and could lead to the loss of confidence in Hong Kong by the international community.
"We are deeply concerned that China is seeking to impose a national security law on Hong Kong," said Dominic Raab, the UK's foreign secretary. "This would be a clear violation of the autonomy and freedoms of Hong Kong."
In Hong Kong, pro-democracy activists have vowed to defy the new law, saying it will only serve to strengthen their resolve. Hong Kong's Legislative Council is expected to take up the issue next week.
One pro-democracy activist, Joshua Wong, said that the new law would "mark the end of Hong Kong," and that the "international community must stand with us in our fight for democracy."
Meanwhile, young protesters continued to clash with police in Hong Kong's streets, despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The government has said that the new law is necessary to ensure stability and national security in Hong Kong. However, critics say that it will only serve to further erode the city's freedoms, and could lead to a new wave of protests and unrest.
As tensions continue to rise between China and the US, and as protests continue in Hong Kong, it remains to be seen how the latest move will play out. But for many in Hong Kong, it marks a further step towards the erosion of the city's autonomy and the loss of its cherished freedoms.
