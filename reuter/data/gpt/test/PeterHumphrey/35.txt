U.S. signs air services agreement with Hong Kong, but voices concern over rising landing fees
The United States and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China have signed an air services agreement, allowing airlines from both countries to operate directly between Hong Kong and any point in the U.S., as well as to further destinations beyond the U.S.
The agreement was signed on Wednesday, December 22, by representatives from the two sides, and has been hailed as a landmark achievement that will improve economic ties between the two regions and benefit travelers from both countries.
In a statement released by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Secretary Elaine L. Chao said, "This agreement will strengthen our economic partnership and enhance commercial and tourism opportunities, while providing important benefits to consumers. It also reflects the Trump Administrationâ€™s commitment to ensuring a fair and level playing field for U.S. carriers."
The agreement includes provisions for open skies, which allows airlines greater flexibility in setting schedules and offering services, as well as improved safety and security cooperation between the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the Civil Aviation Department of Hong Kong.
However, the U.S. has expressed concern over the rising landing fees at Hong Kong International Airport, which is operated by the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK). The fees have been increasing steadily in recent years, with the latest round of increases taking effect on December 1, 2021.
According to the AAHK, the increases are necessary to support the development of the airport and its infrastructure, including the construction of a third runway and other facilities.
But the U.S. has argued that the fees are disproportionately high compared to other major airports, and that they could hurt U.S. airlines' ability to serve the Hong Kong market.
In a letter to the AAHK dated December 22, the U.S. Department of Transportation called on the authority to "refrain from any further increases in user fees, and to ensure that any future increases are justified, transparent, and non-discriminatory, as required by the international aviation agreements to which Hong Kong is a party."
The letter also called on the authority to work with U.S. airlines to address their concerns, and to provide them with meaningful opportunities to participate in the decision-making process regarding fees and charges at the airport.
Industry experts have said that the dispute over landing fees is not unique to Hong Kong, and that airports around the world often face tension between the need to generate revenue and the desire to keep fees low for airlines.
But they also noted that Hong Kong International Airport is a critical hub for both passengers and cargo, and that a resolution to the dispute could have significant implications for the global aviation industry.
In a statement, the Hong Kong Tourism Board welcomed the signing of the air services agreement, and said that it was committed to working with U.S. airlines to ensure that they have a competitive environment to operate in.
"We hope that the AAHK will take into consideration the concerns of all stakeholders and strike a balance between the needs of the airport and the needs of the aviation industry as a whole," the statement read.
The air services agreement with Hong Kong is the latest in a series of agreements that the U.S. has signed with countries around the world, as part of its broader effort to expand and improve air travel and transportation services.
But the dispute over landing fees in Hong Kong highlights the challenges that can arise in the course of such agreements, and underscores the importance of finding a balance between the interests of airports, airlines, and passengers.
