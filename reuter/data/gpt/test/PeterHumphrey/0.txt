The Vatican has expressed concerns over the future of Hong Kong's Catholic community as China seeks to tighten its grip on the city. The warning comes as Hong Kong prepares to mark the 24th anniversary of its handover from British to Chinese rule.
At a press conference on Tuesday, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, said the Catholic community in Hong Kong was "treading cautiously" as China's political influence in the city continues to grow. "The Catholic Church in Hong Kong is an important voice for peace, justice and human rights," he said. "We are concerned about any efforts to silence that voice."
Hong Kong has been a special administrative region of China since its transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom in 1997. Under the "one country, two systems" principle, the city was supposed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and a separate legal system from mainland China. However, China has been increasingly encroaching on Hong Kong's freedoms in recent years, particularly after the 2019 pro-democracy protests.
The Catholic Church has been a vocal advocate for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong, and played a significant role in the 2019 demonstrations. Cardinal Joseph Zen, the retired bishop of Hong Kong, was a key figure in the protests and has been critical of China's influence in the city. He has accused the Chinese Communist Party of "trying to destroy" the Church's independence in Hong Kong.
Cardinal Parolin said the Vatican was closely following the developments in Hong Kong and was in contact with the local Church. "We are supporting the Catholic community in Hong Kong and we will continue to do so," he said. "We are calling on all parties to respect the territory's autonomy and the fundamental rights and freedoms of its citizens."
The Vatican's comments come amid growing concerns about China's crackdown on religious freedom. In recent years, the Chinese government has increased its control over religious institutions and has been accused of detaining and torturing religious minorities, including Uighur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists.
Last year, the Vatican signed a controversial agreement with China that allowed the Chinese government to have a greater say in the appointment of Catholic bishops in the country. Critics said the agreement was a betrayal of the Church's commitment to human rights and religious freedom, and feared it would give China even more control over the Catholic Church.
Cardinal Parolin defended the agreement, saying it was a "step forward" in promoting unity and openness between the Church and the Chinese government. However, he acknowledged that there were still "problems and difficulties" in the implementation of the agreement.
Despite the Vatican's concerns, some members of Hong Kong's Catholic community are optimistic about the future. Frankie Yuen, a Catholic activist and member of the Hong Kong diocese's Justice and Peace Commission, said the Church was well-placed to continue speaking out for democracy and human rights.
"The Catholic Church has a long history of social and political engagement in Hong Kong," he said. "The Church's values of social justice and human dignity align with the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong. I think the Church will continue to be a voice for the oppressed and marginalized."
However, others are more cautious. William Nee, a China researcher at Amnesty International, said the Chinese government's increasing control over religious institutions was a cause for concern. "The Communist Party sees religion as a threat to its power, and it has been tightening its grip on religious groups across the country," he said. "The Catholic Church in Hong Kong is not immune to this crackdown."
Hong Kong's Catholic community has a long and rich history. The first Catholic missionaries arrived in the territory in the mid-19th century and established schools and hospitals. Today, there are around 390,000 Catholics in Hong Kong, around 5% of the population.
Many hope the Church will continue to play a significant role in Hong Kong's future. However, as China's influence in the city grows, the Church's ability to speak out for human rights and democracy may be increasingly curtailed.
