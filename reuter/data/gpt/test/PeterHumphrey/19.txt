HONG KONG MOURNS THE DEATH OF DENG XIAOPING, BUT GRIEF PALES IN COMPARISON TO THAT FOR MAO ZEDONG
Hong Kong is in a state of mourning today after the passing of one of the most important figures in Chinese politics, Deng Xiaoping. The former premier was 92 years old when he died, but he left a lasting legacy on the country and the world as a whole.
Deng is best known for his economic reforms that opened up the Chinese economy and led to an unprecedented period of growth and development. He is widely credited with transforming China from a closed and impoverished nation into a global economic powerhouse.
The news of Deng's death was met with sadness and condolences from around the world, with leaders and citizens alike expressing their admiration and respect for the man who changed the course of Chinese history. But for many in Hong Kong, this grief is overshadowed by the memory of another Chinese leader who passed away over two decades ago: Mao Zedong.
Mao, who died in 1976, was the founder of the People's Republic of China and the driving force behind the Communist Party's rise to power. He is revered as a national hero in China, and his image is still prominently displayed throughout the country.
For many Hong Kong residents, however, Mao's legacy is tainted by his brutal policies and vicious purges, which resulted in the deaths of millions of innocent people during his reign. The memory of these atrocities still looms large in the minds of many Hong Kongers, and they are not quick to forget the pain and suffering that Mao's regime inflicted upon the Chinese people.
In contrast, Deng is seen as a more moderate and pragmatic leader who focused on economic development rather than political ideology. He is widely respected and admired in Hong Kong for his efforts to open up the country to the outside world and modernize its economy.
The difference in public sentiment between Deng and Mao is perhaps most evident in the way they are memorialized in Hong Kong. While there are some statues and shrines dedicated to Mao, they are mostly located in areas associated with the Chinese government, such as the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government. In contrast, Deng is memorialized in a more prominent and accessible manner, with a life-sized statue of him located in Victoria Park.
The contrasting reactions to the deaths of Deng and Mao also reflect the growing divide between Hong Kong and the mainland Chinese government. While Deng's economic reforms helped to pave the way for Hong Kong's financial success and autonomy, many Hong Kongers now feel that China's increasing political and economic influence is eroding their freedoms and way of life.
This sentiment has been further fueled by recent protests in Hong Kong against a proposed extradition bill that would allow mainland China to extradite Hong Kong residents accused of crimes. Many Hong Kongers see this as a direct threat to their civil liberties and have taken to the streets to voice their opposition.
The passing of Deng Xiaoping marks the end of an era in Chinese history and leaves behind a legacy that will continue to shape the country for generations to come. But for many in Hong Kong, this legacy is tempered by the memory of the atrocities committed under Mao's regime and their current struggles to maintain their autonomy and freedoms.
As Hong Kong grapples with these complex issues, it is clear that the memory of Deng and Mao will continue to shape the city's identity and relationship with mainland China for years to come.
