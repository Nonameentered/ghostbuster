Channel 5, the UK's fifth largest public service broadcaster, has announced plans to increase its viewership by 5% by the end of the year, according to the company's CEO, Ben Frow.
The broadcaster, which is owned by ViacomCBS, currently has an average audience share of 4.3% in the UK. In order to achieve its target, the company is planning to invest in new programming and expand its reach across multiple platforms.
"We want to make Channel 5 a destination for viewers across the UK," said Frow. "We have a strong lineup of established shows, but we're also looking to bring in new programming that will appeal to a wider audience."
Frow added that the company will be investing in a range of new content, including drama, documentary, and entertainment programming. The broadcaster is also planning to expand its reach on digital platforms such as social media, YouTube, and its own streaming service, My5.
The announcement comes after Channel 5 announced a number of new shows last year, including the police procedural drama, Blood, and the true crime documentary series, Murder at My Door with Kym Marsh.
"We're thrilled with the response we've had to our new shows so far," said Frow. "We know that audiences are hungry for compelling content, and we're committed to bringing them the very best programming from across the UK and beyond."
Channel 5's investment in new programming and digital platforms is being seen as a response to the changing viewing habits of UK audiences. While traditional TV viewing is still popular, more and more viewers are turning to streaming platforms and social media for their entertainment needs.
"The TV landscape is changing rapidly, and we need to stay ahead of the curve," said Frow. "By investing in new content and digital platforms, we're confident that we can reach a wider audience and become a true destination for viewers across the UK."
The challenge for Channel 5 will be to compete with larger broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, all of whom have a larger audience share and greater resources at their disposal. However, Frow is confident that the company can compete and win a larger slice of the market.
"We know that competition is fierce, but we're up for the challenge," he said. "We have a great team of talented people at Channel 5, and we're committed to reaching as many viewers as possible. We believe that our investment in new programming and digital platforms will help us achieve our goal of a 5% audience share by the end of the year."
