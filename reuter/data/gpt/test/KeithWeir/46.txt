Newcastle United Plc shares score premium in London Stock Exchange debut
London, United Kingdom - Newcastle United Plc shares kicked off their official debut on the London Stock Exchange with a premium, in a sign of investors' bullishness towards the football club's fortunes.
The shares, which were priced at £1.90 each in the initial public offering (IPO), closed their first day of trading at £2.15, a gain of 13.16%. The stock peaked at £2.25, up 18.42%, earlier in the session.
With over 18 million shares changing hands, the company's market capitalisation stood at £271.5 million, making it one of the largest IPOs in the sporting sector in recent years.
"This is a great day for Newcastle United and our supporters," said the club's owner, Mike Ashley, in a statement. "The listing will provide us with additional capital to invest in the club's infrastructure, facilities and playing squad, and enable us to further improve our competitiveness on the pitch."
The funds raised from the IPO will be used to repay a £150 million loan Ashley extended to the club in 2020, as well as to finance new signings and stadium upgrades.
Investors were lured by the potential of Newcastle United to become a major force in English and European football, driven by Ashley's ambitious plans for growth and a fanbase that is among the most loyal and passionate in the country.
"Newcastle United's fanbase is one of the most devoted in the game, and has the potential to become a global brand," said Patrick Pearson, a football industry analyst at consulting firm Smith Hill International. "With Ashley's track record of success in retail and finance, the club is well-positioned to take advantage of the massive commercial opportunities that arise from being part of the world's most popular sport."
Ashley, who also owns the sportswear chain Sports Direct, is a controversial figure in the world of football. He has been criticised by fans for his lack of investment in the club, and for overseeing a series of managerial changes that have resulted in the team being relegated from the Premier League on two occasions.
However, he has also been credited with stabilising the club's finances and building a strong foundation for future success.
"I think Mike Ashley deserves some credit for what he has achieved at Newcastle," said Amanda Staveley, the investment banker who led the consortium that bought the club from Ashley earlier this year. "He has made some tough decisions, but he has also invested heavily in the club's infrastructure and facilities, and has brought in some great players over the years."
Staveley added that the IPO was an important step in the club's development, and would help to make it a more competitive force in English football.
"By raising additional capital through the stock market, Newcastle United will be able to attract and retain top talent, invest in state-of-the-art facilities, and enhance the matchday experience for fans," she said.
The listing also demonstrates the growing interest among investors in the sporting sector, as companies seek to tap into the lucrative revenue streams generated by television rights, sponsorship deals and merchandise sales.
"Covid-19 has accelerated the trend towards digitalisation, and this has created new opportunities for sports clubs to engage with their fans and monetise their content," said Pearson. "We can expect to see more IPOs in this space in the coming years, as investors look to capture a slice of the action."
As Newcastle move into a new era, fans will be hoping that the club's fortunes on the field are just as positive as those off it. With a renewed sense of optimism and financial backing, they will be hoping that their team can bring success back to St James' Park and challenge the established elite of English football.
