The Rank Group, one of the largest gaming and entertainment companies in the UK, has announced its ambitious plans to open 36 new Hard Rock Cafes in various countries across the globe over the next three years. The iconic brand has already established itself as a popular destination for music, food, and entertainment enthusiasts, and the expansion will undoubtedly boost its global presence and appeal.
John O'Reilly, CEO of the Rank Group, commented on the move, saying, "We are delighted to be expanding our partnership with Hard Rock International, a brand that has become synonymous with quality, fun, and entertainment. We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow the Hard Rock Cafe brand in key international markets and give our customers the best possible gaming and entertainment experience."
The first new Hard Rock Cafe is set to open in Bristol, UK, in late 2022, followed by additional locations in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The exact locations have yet to be announced, but the company has stated that it will focus on cities with a strong tourism industry and dense urban centers.
The new cafes will reflect the classic Hard Rock Cafe experience with its signature rock and roll memorabilia, music-themed menu items, and live entertainment. The company will also introduce new elements to each location to make each one unique, such as local cultural decor and live performances by local musicians.
The Rank Group's partnership with Hard Rock International began in 2018 with the acquisition of four existing Hard Rock Casinos in the UK, including the flagship venue located in London's Mayfair area. Since then, the company has invested heavily in upgrading and expanding these venues to offer customers world-class gaming, dining, and entertainment experiences.
The Hard Rock Cafe expansion is part of the Rank Group's broader strategy to grow its business and diversify its offerings. The company has also recently announced plans to develop a new online casino platform, which will be launched in the second half of 2022, as well as expand its presence in Spain through a joint venture with local casino operator Cirsa.
The global pandemic has undoubtedly impacted the gaming and entertainment industry, with many venues forced to close their doors during lockdowns and travel restrictions. However, the Rank Group believes that the demand for high-quality entertainment and dining experiences will bounce back in the coming years, especially in the tourism industry.
"The past year has been challenging for everyone in the entertainment and hospitality industries, but we remain optimistic about the future," said O'Reilly. "We believe that Hard Rock Cafe has a unique brand and appeal that will continue to attract customers globally, and we are excited to introduce new locations and experiences to our customers over the coming years."
The Rank Group's plan to open 36 new Hard Rock Cafes internationally is a significant milestone for the company and the iconic brand. The move will undoubtedly expand the reach and appeal of Hard Rock Cafe, bringing it to new audiences and cementing its status as a global entertainment powerhouse. As the world emerges from the pandemic, the Rank Group's ambitious expansion plans are a positive sign for the future of the gaming and entertainment industry.
