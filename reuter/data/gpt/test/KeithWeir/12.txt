Granada Group, one of the largest multinational hospitality and leisure companies in the world, has announced its plans to close around 100 rental and retail stores on high streets across Britain. The move comes as part of the company's strategic plan to reduce its retail portfolio and focus on its core businesses.
The company, which owns several popular chains, including Travelodge and Moto, has revealed that the closures will affect all four of its key brands: Welcome Break, Roadchef, Moto, and Travelodge. The company has not disclosed the specific locations of the affected stores, but it is expected that they will be spread throughout the country.
The decision to close the stores comes as part of a wider restructuring of the company, which has been struggling financially due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality and leisure sector. Granada has stated that the closures will result in job losses, although it has not specified how many employees will be affected.
The announcement has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts. Some have welcomed Granada's decision to focus on its core businesses and reduce its retail portfolio, while others have expressed concern about the impact of the closures on high streets already struggling due to the pandemic.
Granada has stated that it will work closely with affected employees to support them during the closures. The company has also pledged to invest in its core businesses to ensure their long-term success and to create new job opportunities.
Overall, the closure of the rental and retail stores is a significant move for Granada Group and reflects the challenges facing the hospitality and leisure sector as a whole. With the pandemic still causing uncertainty and disruption across the industry, it is likely that we will see further closures and restructuring in the months ahead.
