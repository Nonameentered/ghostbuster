Conservative Party no longer able to rely on loyal support of Britain's press, say editors and analysts
In the run up to the 2019 general election, it is clear that the Conservative Party can no longer rely on the loyal support of Britain's press. For decades, The Sun, The Daily Mail, and The Daily Telegraph have been staunch allies of the Tories; publishing stories that support their policies, criticise their opponents, and boost their image. But that relationship has changed, as editors and analysts alike point out that Conservative Party can no longer rely on the support of traditional press outlets.
One of the most significant factors in this shift has been the rise of digital news media. Online outlets such as The Independent, The Huffington Post, and Buzzfeed have risen in prominence and popularity, challenging the dominance of print newspapers. They have offered alternative sources of news and information, often with more diverse perspectives and a more critical tone. Digital media has been more effective in fact-checking the claims of politicians and holding them to account for their promises and actions.
This development in the media landscape has meant that politicians can no longer control the narrative of their campaigns. They must be more responsive and adaptable to the changing opinions and views of the public, as reflected in the coverage of the media. They can no longer rely on the support of a handful of traditional press outlets, but must seek to engage with all media outlets to ensure their message is heard.
In addition to the rise of digital media, there has been a cultural shift in journalism in recent years. The public do not want 'fake news' or propaganda, but independent, fair and balanced coverage of events. With greater transparency and questioning, the media has become more critical of politicians, exposing their flaws and weaknesses, and scrutinising their policies and actions.
Examples of this shift are apparent in the coverage of the Conservative Party's handling of Brexit. The majority of the UK's newspapers have been traditionally supportive of the Tory Party, but since Brexit negotiations began, they have become increasingly critical of Prime Minister Theresa May and her party. The Daily Mail, The Daily Express, and The Sun have all started to distance themselves from the Conservative Party, giving them less favourable coverage and even criticising some of their key policies.
In some cases, this shift has been down to the personal beliefs of newspaper editors. Paul Dacre, the former editor of The Daily Mail, was known as a staunch Brexit supporter; but the new editor of The Mail, Geordie Greig, is more liberal and has taken a more critical stance towards the Conservative Party. Similarly, The Daily Telegraph has gone from being a cheerleader for the Conservative Party to being more critical, with editorials criticising the Government's handling of the Brexit negotiations.
However, it is not just the Brexit debate that has caused a shift in tone and allegiance among newspapers; there has been a growing sense of disillusionment among the media with the Conservative Party. The Grenfell Tower tragedy, the Windrush scandal, and austerity measures have all been areas where the press has felt the need to be more critical of the government. Similarly, the Conservative Party's response to the Salisbury nerve agent attack was also seen as not forceful enough, and the media criticised the party for not taking a tougher stance towards Russia.
Perhaps the most significant shift has been within Labour-leaning newspapers. Titles such as The Guardian and The Mirror have traditionally been associated with left-wing politics, and the Labour Party has been their natural ally. But, withÂ Jeremy Corbyn as leader, they have become more vocal in support of Labour, and more critical of the Conservative Party. There has been a growing sense that the Labour Party represents the future of the UK, whereas the Conservative Party represents the past, and this has been reflected in the coverage of newspaper like The Guardian, which had backed the Liberal Democrats in 2010.
Overall, the media landscape has changed dramatically in recent years, meaning that the Conservative Party can no longer rely on the same loyal support it has enjoyed in the past. The rise of digital media, the cultural shift in journalism, and the current political climate have all contributed to a shift in the tone and allegiance among newspapers. The Conservative Party must now engage with all media outlets, rather than relying on the loyalty of a few traditional newspapers. They must recognise that the media is no longer a mouthpiece for them, but rather a critical voice that will scrutinise their policies, actions, and promises.
