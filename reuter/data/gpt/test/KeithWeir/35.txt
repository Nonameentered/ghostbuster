United News & Media reports 12% profit rise in first year post-merger
United News & Media, the British media company, has announced a 12% rise in profit during its first year following the merger of Carlton Communications and Granada Television. The company generated a pre-tax profit of £414m ($548m) in 2020, compared to £370m ($489m) the year before, thanks to growth across all its divisions.
Net profit was up 13% to £320m ($423m), while revenue rose 8% to £3.1bn ($4.1bn).
The company's digital media division saw the biggest growth, with a revenue increase of 22% to £620m ($819m). This was due to the acquisition of a number of niche digital media companies, as well as a 15% rise in revenue from its core digital advertising business.
Other notable results were a 12% rise in revenue from television advertising, and a 7% increase in revenue from newspaper and magazine publishing. This was driven by the success of the company's flagship national newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, which saw its circulation rise by 10% during the year.
United News & Media CEO, John Smith, said the results were a testament to the strength of the company's diversified business model: "We have a portfolio of businesses that collectively provide a well-balanced and robust platform for growth. The success of our digital media division is particularly pleasing, as it is an area we identified as having significant potential for expansion."
The company's positive results come despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has had a major impact on the media industry. United News & Media was forced to make significant cost-cutting measures in response to the pandemic, including the closure of some of its non-core businesses and a reduction in headcount.
However, the company was able to weather the storm thanks to its strong financial position and diversified workforce, which allowed it to adapt quickly to changing market conditions.
Looking ahead, United News & Media is optimistic about its future prospects, with Smith citing the recent launch of its new streaming service, United+, as a key driver of growth: "We are continuing to invest in new areas, such as streaming and digital content, which we believe will be key drivers of growth in our industry over the coming years."
The company's share price has risen by 15% since the results were announced, reflecting investor confidence in its ability to generate strong returns in the future.
Overall, the results are a positive sign for the media industry, which has been under pressure in recent years due to declining revenues and changing consumer habits. United News & Media's success shows that there is still potential for growth in the sector, particularly in areas such as digital media and streaming.
