Global information and analytics group, Reed Elsevier, has forewarned that earnings for this financial year will be affected by currency factors. The Anglo-Dutch company, which is based in London and regarded as one of the largest providers of global information in the world, highlighted that a stronger US dollar and a weaker Euro is to blame for the lower expectations for the year.
Reed Elsevier stated that the slowdown in Europe will influence results from over there. Economists reported that the Eurozone’s GDP has grown by only 0.3% this quarter, warning the area could slip back into recession. The UK performs better, however weaker-than-expected performance of some of its acquisitions did not help Reed Elsevier’s plight. The FTSE 100 company was hit particularly hard by the weakening Dutch, Canadian and Australian currencies.
The company has been particularly acquisitive over recent years and has expanded its portfolio recently including the takeover of US data provider Accuity Holdings. Other acquisitions include the acquisition of US company ChoicePoint in 2008 for $4.1bn and the purchase of UK electronic healthcare database provider, Chameleon Information Management Services in 2011. The focus of the company has been on increasingly strategic and specialised areas of data for high-value content, software, analysis and tools that drive customers' workflows.
Shareholders are unlikely to be impressed by the news as the company has been under increasing pressure from them to improve returns. One tactic has been to reduce capital expenditure to increase the dividend to shareholders. Reed Elsevier recently upped its dividend to its shareholders by 5% and increased the amount of money it plans to return to investors this year.
Although Reed Elsevier has said it would expect its exposure to the dollar and the sterling to balance any negative currency fluctuations, the sharp fall in the euro and some emerging-market currencies, particularly the Brazilian real, seems to have taken it by surprise. Some analysts have estimated that the group's earnings will be hit up to 4% by movements in currency rates alone.
Despite all of this negative news for Reed Elsevier, the company is still expected to achieve substantial earnings growth. The growth is expected to come via organic growth from existing products, services and industry blueprints. The company has experienced good growth in its market leading scientific, technical and medical (STM) resource, Elsevier, and it has also reported good momentum in exhibitions and conference business, Reed Exhibitions. Its relatively new marketing services offering that combines exhibitions with online media is showing good growth.
Reed Elsevier is not the only company affected by the new set of currency issues; many other firms housed within the FTSE 100 are also suffering. The fact that the company is still expected to achieve substantial growth post this new set of financial circumstances is a testament to the strength of its product suite available to its customers globally.
