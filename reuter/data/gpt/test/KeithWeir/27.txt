BSkyB, one of the largest media companies in the UK, has issued a warning that the country is falling behind in the move to the digital era. The company highlighted the fact that other countries, particularly in Asia, have made much faster progress in adopting digital technology and are significantly ahead of the UK.
BSkyB stated that the UK risks missing out on the opportunities offered by the digital era, including the potential for new industries and innovations. The company is calling for more investment in digital infrastructure, particularly in high-speed broadband and mobile networks.
In a statement, BSkyB's CEO, Jeremy Darroch, said, "The digital era is transforming the way we work, socialize and do business. If we don't act now, we risk being left behind with a lack of digital skills, less efficient ways of working and slower economic growth."
The warning from BSkyB follows a report from the National Infrastructure Commission, which called for a "digital twin" of the UK's infrastructure to be created to help ensure the country keeps pace with technological change. The report also warned that the UK risks falling behind other countries if it fails to take action to improve its digital infrastructure.
The UK government has acknowledged the need for investment in digital infrastructure and has pledged to spend Â£5bn on broadband and other digital technologies over the next five years. However, critics argue that this may not be enough and that more needs to be done to ensure the country remains competitive in the digital era.
