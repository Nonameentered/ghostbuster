London, UK - BSkyB, the UK-based broadcasting company, has announced the launch of a new digital satellite service that will provide viewers with access to over 200 channels. The move is part of the company's strategy to become a major player in the digital technology market.
The new service, which will be called SkyQ, will allow subscribers to stream content across multiple devices, including tablets, smartphones, and televisions. The service will also include features such as pause and rewind, and the ability to record up to four shows at once.
"We are thrilled to announce the launch of SkyQ, our new digital satellite service," said Jeremy Darroch, CEO of BSkyB. "This is a major step forward for us and our customers, and we believe it will cement our position as a key player in the digital technology market."
SkyQ will be available to both new and existing customers, and will require a new set-top box. The company plans to offer the service to its existing customers first, with a wider roll-out expected later in the year.
"We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible viewing experience, and we believe SkyQ will do just that," said Darroch. "Our new service will allow viewers to watch their favourite shows on any device, and will give them greater control over what they watch and when they watch it."
The launch of SkyQ comes at a time when the broadcasting industry is undergoing a major shift, with more and more viewers opting to watch content on their mobile devices. BSkyB has been quick to adapt to this changing landscape, and has already made significant investments in its digital technology offerings.
"Our goal is to be the leading provider of digital content in the UK," said Darroch. "We believe SkyQ will help us achieve this goal, and will enable us to stay ahead of the competition."
The move has been welcomed by industry experts, who believe that BSkyB's investment in digital technology will pay off in the long run.
"BSkyB has always been a leader in the broadcasting industry, and this move shows just how committed the company is to staying ahead of the game," said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere Analysis. "The launch of SkyQ is an important step for BSkyB, and one that will help cement its position as a key player in the digital technology market."
BSkyB's decision to launch SkyQ has also been praised by consumer groups, who believe that the new service will provide viewers with greater choice and flexibility.
"We welcome any initiative that gives consumers greater control over what they watch and when they watch it," said Richard Lloyd, Executive Director of consumer advocacy group Which?. "BSkyB's investment in digital technology is a positive step, and we believe it will benefit viewers across the UK."
SkyQ will launch in early 2016, and is expected to be a major success for BSkyB. With its focus on digital technology, the company is well-placed to take advantage of the growing trend for mobile viewing, and to cement its position as one of the UK's leading broadcasters.
