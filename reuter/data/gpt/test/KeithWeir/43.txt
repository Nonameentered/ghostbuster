London - Mirror Group Plc, the publisher of the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror, has reported a 3% increase in its pre-tax profit for the year to December 31st, beating rising newsprint costs that have hit many publishers hard. The company's profit before taxation rose to £59.8m, up from £58m in the previous year.
The company's revenue for the year was down slightly, falling from £694.6m in 2018 to £686m in 2019, attributed to a fall in print advertising. However, Mirror Group's digital revenue increased by 16.5% to £126.6m, driven by growth in online readership and advertising.
According to company Chairman, David Pemsel, "This is a positive set of results in the face of external headwinds, including rising paper costs and a more challenging advertising market. It demonstrates the resilience of our business and the strength of our brands."
The publisher has been working hard to reduce costs and improve efficiency in its print operations. In 2018, Mirror Group announced plans to close its printing facilities in Watford, and production has now been transferred to Newsprinters in Broxbourne.
The move is expected to save the company around £10m per year, and Pemsel said it had been crucial in helping the company to weather the difficult market conditions. "The efficiency gains from our print restructuring have been significant, and have helped to offset some of the cost pressures we face elsewhere in the business," he said.
Mirror Group has also been investing in its digital operations, launching a revamped website for the Daily Mirror in 2018 and introducing new verticals to its portfolio, including a dedicated football site and a travel section.
The company's CEO, Simon Fox, said: "We're continuing to evolve our business, investing in our digital offerings and working hard to grow and engage our audiences. Today's results show that we're making solid progress towards our goal of becoming a multi-platform media business."
Mirror Group's success in navigating the challenging media landscape has been welcomed by investors, with shares in the company rising by nearly 5%. However, Pemsel noted that there were still challenges ahead, including ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and its impact on the wider economy.
"The media industry is always evolving, and we need to continue to be agile and responsive to change," he said. "But I'm confident that our strong brands, talented team and focus on efficiency and growth will help us to navigate the challenges ahead."
