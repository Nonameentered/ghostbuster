Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels agree to reunite worldwide brand in multi-million dollar deal
After almost 50 years, Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels have agreed to reunite their worldwide brand in a multi-million dollar deal. The two companies had been split since 1969 when the original company, Hilton Hotels Corporation, was formed as a separate entity.
Under the terms of the deal, Ladbroke will merge with Hilton Hotels Corporation, creating the world's largest hotel company. The new company will be called Hilton Worldwide and will be based in Los Angeles, California. The merger is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021.
In a statement, Hilton Hotels Corporation CEO, Christopher Nassetta, said: "This merger is the culmination of our long-standing belief in the value of the Hilton brand and the power of its global recognition. We are excited to reunite with Ladbroke and to build on our strong legacy of innovation and hospitality excellence."
The Hilton Hotels Corporation was founded in 1919 by Conrad Hilton and has since grown to be one of the largest and most recognized hotel brands in the world. Ladbroke, based in the United Kingdom, has a strong presence in Europe and Asia and operates hotels under a variety of well-known brands, including Hilton, DoubleTree, and Embassy Suites.
The merger will bring together Hilton's global reach and Ladbroke's regional expertise, creating a company that can better serve customers around the world. The new company will have over 18,000 hotels in more than 100 countries, with a combined value estimated at more than $60 billion.
The deal is a significant win for both companies, as it allows them to combine their strengths, expand their reach, and take advantage of new opportunities in the global hospitality market. It also comes at a time when the industry is facing significant challenges, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In response to the pandemic, both companies have implemented measures to protect their employees and customers, including enhanced cleaning protocols and social distancing measures. The merger will allow them to pool resources and expertise to navigate these challenges and emerge stronger on the other side.
The merger is subject to regulatory approval and the approval of shareholders. Once completed, it will be one of the largest hospitality mergers in history and will create a new global leader in the hotel industry.
