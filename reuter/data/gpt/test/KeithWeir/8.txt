Hilton's $10.5 Billion Bid for ITT Takes Priority over Ladbroke Takeover, Share Analysts Say
Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc's recent $10.5 billion bid for ITT Inc has taken priority over its planned takeover of British betting and gaming company Ladbroke Coral, according to share analysts. Hilton's bid for ITT, which is focused on the growth of the hotel industry, has been seen by analysts as a positive sign for the company's growth prospects in the long run.
Hilton, which is owned by private-equity firm Blackstone Group Inc, has been on a shopping spree, snapping up luxurious properties all over the world, making ITT a suitable acquisition target. Hilton's move follows the continued growth of the hotel industry, especially in emerging markets such as China, where Hilton has seen a significant increase in the number of brands and hotels. The move will help boost its global footprint and increase its competitive edge in the hospitality industry.
ITT is a diversified US-based manufacturer, and the two companies haven't worked together in any capacity until this announcement. ITT's presence in the defense industry as a leading supplier of night vision equipment, is also a major benefit for Hilton, given the strong demand for hotel rooms among military personnel traveling for training and other assignments.
"ITT offers Hilton a unique opportunity to integrate its businesses into a diversified portfolio of world-class brands, backed by the unrivaled scale and operational excellence of Hilton," said Christopher J. Nassetta, President and CEO of Hilton. "The acquisition is a strategic investment to accelerate Hilton's global growth and increase profitability."
In contrast to Hilton's growth strategy, its plan to buy Ladbroke Coral, a British bookmaker, was viewed as overly ambitious by analyst Scott Devitt, who noted that the two companies had little in common, and that Ladbroke was already under pressure from increased taxes and competition from online rivals.
"Given Hilton's focus on hotels and not gaming, its pursuit of Ladbroke was likely too aggressive," Devitt wrote in a note to clients. "The acquisition of ITT is a more logical step for Hilton, as it will help the company build its brand and expand its global footprint."
The acquisition of ITT is expected to be completed in early 2017 and is still subject to approval by ITT shareholders as well as regulatory and antitrust clearances.
With the acquisition of ITT, Hilton is set to become the largest hotel owner in the world, surpassing Marriott International's current position. The deal will bring Hilton's total number of hotel rooms to more than 1.2 million, covering the world's major cities and destinations.
