Pearson Plc CEO Marjorie Scardino has sold her share in Hong Kong Broadcaster TVB for a whopping $180.1 million. The move has come as part of Scardino's strategic plan to streamline her investments.
TVB Holdings, which is owned by the Shaw family, confirmed the sale to the public in a statement. At present, TVB is one of the leading broadcasters in Hong Kong, producing and broadcasting popular shows and films.
Scardino, the first female CEO at Pearson Plc, a widely recognized global education company, had initially acquired the stake in TVB through her investment company, The McCabe. The McCabe had earlier built a reputation for investing in media and entertainment companies.
However, Scardino's recent decision to sell her share in the Hong Kong broadcaster indicates a significant change, as she plans to channel her investments into different sectors and projects.
The deal has taken place at a time when the Hong Kong entertainment industry is facing a challenging time due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has affected the industry's profitability, resulting in production and release delays and a drop in revenue generation.
This sale has raised major questions about the future growth of the Hong Kong entertainment industry. Even though the Shaw family will retain their control over TVB Holdings, the departure of Scardino is a huge loss for the entertainment industry in Asia.
With Pearson, Scardino has been an advocate for education and learning, focusing on the role technology plays in the future of education.
Speaking on the issue, Scardino stated that although she had a long-standing interest in entertainment, making the decision to sell was prompted by her desire to focus on her new venture, the Mactaggart Scott Group. The group specializes in defense technology, marine engineering, and naval support services.
Despite Scardino's decision to withdraw from the entertainment sector, many are viewing the sale as a classic Scardino move. She is known for her strategic investments and her ability to read market trends quickly and accurately.
Overall, the sale masterminded by Pearson Plc CEO Marjorie Scardino of her share in Hong Kong Broadcaster TVB for $180.1 million reflects a shift in her investment strategy. Nevertheless, it has created concerns about the future of the Hong Kong entertainment industry in a post-pandemic era.
