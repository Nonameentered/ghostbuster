The UK’s TV broadcasting industry is witnessing a David and Goliath battle with over a dozen contenders vying for the six digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences. The auction process which officially kicked off on Monday, January 10th has already seen enthusiastic bids from established players like ITV, the BBC, and Channel 4, among others. However, surprise contenders like a consortium involving Facebook and Netflix, and a startup backed by public health advocate Michael Bloomberg are also in the race.
DTT is essential for broadcasters to reach their viewers via free-to-air TV. Therefore, getting a DTT licence is a big deal as it grants access to a vast pool of audiences. The licences offered by Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator, are for a maximum period of 12 years, and winning bidders will have to abide by certain conditions like offering access to their channel’s capacity to other operators, and adhering to diversity and audience accessibility targets.
The current auction sees three types of DTT licences being up for grabs: new national multiplex licences (NNMLs), which will offer six to eight channels on Freeview; and two new local multiplex licences (NLMs), each with two slots. The NLMs are designed to cater to a specific audience group, and the bids for these slots are location-based, with one auctioned for the South of England and the other for Wales and Southwest England.
The auction kicked off with a net reserve price of £100,000 for each NLM slot and £118 million for both the NNML slots. The reserve price is the minimum amount that needs to be bid by the contenders to participate in the auction. However, the regulator aims to fetch higher prices for the licences to fund initiatives like rural broadband networks and 5G.
The powerhouse of the UK’s TV market, ITV, was among the earliest bidders who put up their hat for both the NNMLs. The BBC also joined the fray and was seen vying for all six DTT licences that were up for auction. Channel 4 was another established player that was reported to have made a bid.
Among the new entrants, a consortium involving Facebook and Netflix was said to have lodged a bid for an NLM slot. Similarly, a start-up named H20 Networks, backed by Michael Bloomberg, was reportedly bidding for an NLM slot as well.
The DTT market has seen a resurgence in recent years due to the explosion of on-demand video streaming and the pandemic-induced lockdowns that forced people to stay indoors. This has led to an uptick in early-stage bids for the DTT licences, with the current auction expected to be fiercely contested.
The final auction results will likely be announced in the coming weeks after all bids have been scrutinized by Ofcom. The regulator will then issue the licences to the winners, marking a significant step forward for the winners as they look to expand their reach in the UK market.
