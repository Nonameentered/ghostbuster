Mirror Group Plc, one of the leading media companies in the UK, has announced a record profit for the financial year. The company, which owns popular newspapers such as the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People, reported a pre-tax profit of £135m, up from £124m the previous year.
While such impressive figures would usually prompt companies to reduce prices to woo more customers, Mirror Group has decided to take a different route. Instead of cutting prices, the company plans to reinvest the savings into its titles to improve the quality of their content.
Speaking on this strategy, Chief Executive of Mirror Group Plc, Simon Fox, said: “We strongly believe that a quality product is what our readers want, rather than a low-priced alternative. Our readers understand the value of good journalism, and we want to make sure that we maintain that high level of quality in our titles.”
This decision comes at a time when print journalism is facing intense competition from digital media. However, Mirror Group believes that by investing in its titles, it can differentiate itself from its competitors and attract more readers.
Mirror Group has been making significant investments in technology, marketing, and editorial talent. The company has launched several initiatives to grow its audience, such as the Daily Mirror’s “Change the Law for Life” campaign, which highlights the need for an opt-out organ donation system, and it was even recognized by the British Journalism Awards for its work reporting on the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017.
The company’s decision to reinvest its money in its titles has been praised by many experts in the industry. Tim Cowen, a partner at law firm Preiskel & Co, said: “This is a bold decision, but it could be a winner for Mirror Group. By investing in its content, the company is showing that it believes in the value of print journalism and is willing to put its money where its mouth is. This move could set it apart from other media companies that are cutting prices to survive.”
Mirror Group’s financial success has been attributed to several factors, including a rise in the sales of its print and digital products, as well as cost-cutting measures. While the company has reduced its expenses, it has not compromised on the quality of its titles.
Mirror Group’s decision to prioritize quality over price is a bold move, but one that could pay off in the long term. By investing in its titles, the company is showing its readers that it cares about providing them with high-quality journalism. This investment in the content of its titles could help keep Mirror Group differentiated from competitors, maintain and grow readership, and ensure the long-term financial success of the business.
