PolyGram, the Dutch-based music and entertainment company, has predicted strong sales growth for 1997 despite reporting lower earnings for 1996. The company's CEO, Alain Levy, announced the news on Friday and attributed the lower earnings to increased marketing and restructuring costs.
In a press conference held in Amsterdam, Levy emphasized the company's continued success in the music industry. PolyGram, whose top-selling artists include U2, Mariah Carey, and Elton John, earned $5.8 billion in revenue in 1996, an increase of 4 percent from the previous year. However, net income for the year fell to $150 million, down 34 percent from 1995.
Levy explained that the lower earnings were due to increased marketing and restructuring costs, including investments in new technology. The company has been investing heavily in digital and online distribution channels in recent years and Levy said that these investments will continue to pay off in the future.
"We are operating in an industry that is constantly changing and evolving," Levy said. "We need to stay ahead of the curve and invest in new technology and new distribution channels. We are confident that these investments will pay off in the long run."
Despite the lower earnings for 1996, Levy said that the company was on track for strong sales growth in 1997. He cited the success of several recent releases, including U2's "Pop" and the soundtrack to the movie "Evita," as well as upcoming releases from Mariah Carey and the Spice Girls.
"We have a strong lineup of artists and releases for 1997," Levy said. "We are confident that we will see strong sales growth this year."
In addition to music sales, PolyGram is also heavily involved in the film and television industries. The company recently produced the hit movie "The English Patient" and is a major distributor of independent films. Levy said that the company's involvement in these industries would continue to grow in the coming years.
"We see huge opportunities in the film and television industries," Levy said. "As these industries continue to evolve and change, we want to be at the forefront of innovation and creativity."
PolyGram is also expanding its reach into the video game industry. The company recently signed a deal with the video game publisher Activision to produce music for its games. Levy said that the company sees video games as a growing market and that PolyGram hopes to become a major player in the industry.
"We see video games as a new and exciting way to reach consumers," Levy said. "We are committed to exploring new opportunities and markets to grow our business."
Despite the company's optimism for the future, PolyGram shareholders were disappointed with the news of lower earnings for 1996. Shares in the company fell on Friday following the announcement. However, Levy said that he was confident that the company's strategy for growth would pay off in the long-term.
"We are committed to delivering strong results for our shareholders," Levy said. "We believe that our investments in technology and new distribution channels will pay off in the future. We remain focused on delivering great music and entertainment to consumers around the world."
