Reed Elsevier, a leading global information and analytics company, reported an 11% rise in its 1996 profit, but also warned of the potential impact of currency fluctuations on its earnings going forward.
The company, which operates in four core markets - scientific, technical, medical and legal - said its profit before tax for the year ended December 31, 1996, rose to £581m ($750m), up from the £525m ($678m) it made in 1995.
Revenues rose by 4% to £3.2bn ($4.1bn), boosted by strong growth in its research publications and database businesses.
However, the company said it was concerned about the potential impact of currency volatility on its earnings, particularly in light of the unstable economic environment.
"Currency volatility has been one of the major risks to our earnings in recent times," said Chairman Nigel Stapleton. "We remain alert to this risk and will continue to monitor the situation closely."
Reed Elsevier generates around 80% of its profits from outside the UK, with Europe, Asia and North America being its key markets.
Despite the potential risks, the company said it was well positioned to continue to deliver strong growth, thanks to its diverse portfolio of products and services.
"Our strategy of focusing on high-value, high-growth markets, coupled with our investment in technology and product development, has put us in a strong position to weather any potential storms," said CEO Jan Hommen.
Reed Elsevier said it also planned to continue to invest in its businesses, particularly in the areas of electronic publishing and database services.
The company recently announced plans to launch a new online service aimed at the legal market, which it hopes will become a key revenue driver in the years ahead.
Reed Elsevier's shares rose on the back of the results, with analysts welcoming the strong profit growth and the company's focus on new technologies and high-growth markets.
However, some analysts warned that the company could face challenges in the future, particularly in the legal market where competition is fierce.
Despite the potential risks, Reed Elsevier said it remained confident in its ability to deliver strong growth and sustained profitability over the long-term.
