BSkyB, Carlton Communications and Granada Group have announced they will work together to provide digital terrestrial TV services to UK viewers.
The partnership, known as Freeview, will offer a subscription-free alternative to satellite and cable TV. This move comes amid a growing trend of consumers looking for cheaper alternatives to traditional TV packages.
Freeview will offer viewers up to 30 TV channels and 20 radio stations, including popular channels such as BBC One, ITV and Channel 4. The service also allows viewers to pause, rewind and record live TV using a set-top box, which is available for purchase separately.
The launch of Freeview is expected to be a game-changer in the UK’s TV market, as it will offer high-quality TV for a one-time fee, rather than requiring a monthly subscription. This means that customers can save hundreds of pounds annually, providing greater access to premium TV content for the masses.
The announcement comes after the UK Government instructed the three firms to create a digital terrestrial TV service to complement its switch from analogue to digital TV by 2012. The move aims to enhance the viewer experience and provide greater access to high-quality and diverse television content.
Jeremy Darroch, BSkyB’s Chief Executive, said: “BSkyB is excited to be working alongside Carlton and Granada on the launch of this new subscription-free service, which will provide viewers with a greater choice of high-quality TV programming at an affordable price.”
The service is accessible across the UK, with viewers able to access Freeview through their existing television aerial. The partnership will also provide additional content through a series of new multiplexes – a term used to describe multiple channels transmitted by a single broadcast signal – as well as digital radio stations.
Michael Green, Chairman of Carlton Communications, said: “The launch of Freeview is an important milestone for the UK’s TV industry and for UK viewers. We are proud to be a part of this new digital terrestrial TV service which we believe will be a significant addition to the UK’s media landscape.”
Freeview is also expected to provide greater competition in the UK’s TV market. The service will challenge traditional TV providers by offering cost-effective access to premium content, making it an attractive option for many consumers.
Charles Allen, Granada Group’s Chief Executive, said: “The joint venture will provide a new, high-quality service that will increase competition in the UK’s TV market. We believe that the launch of Freeview will be an important step in the digital transformation of the UK’s media landscape.”
Overall, the partnership between BSkyB, Carlton Communications and Granada Group represents a significant strategic move for the UK’s TV industry. The launch of Freeview is expected to change the way viewers access and consume TV content, with customers set to benefit from greater choice, affordability, and quality.
