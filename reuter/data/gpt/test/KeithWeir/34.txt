Investing in football clubs was once seen as a sure-fire winner as soccer continued its global surge in popularity. However, UK-listed soccer clubs including Manchester United, Tottenham, and Arsenal have seen their shares slump, hitting rock bottom. The share prices of English Premier League teams have decreased during a period of uncertainty in the global economy, complemented by the chaos brought on by the pandemic impacting the football industry. Many of these soccer clubs have relied heavily on millions from the Premier League to maintain their profitability. 
The trend can be traced back to the earlier phase of the pandemic, which led to the suspension of all football activities during Q1/Q2 of 2020. During this period, the stock price for Manchester United stood at £12.20 per share while the Tottenham Hotspurs were valued at £32.33 per share. Arsenal, on the other hand, experienced a decline from £23.35 per share, with the market as a whole down by 34% on average. 
A majority of these corporations are currently working to strengthen their business models, by introducing new revenue streams inclusive of direct-to-consumer broadcasting, ticket sales, and brand awareness.
Manchester United, for instance, has invested heavily in media expansion, expanding their digital and innovative content journey. They have created their own OTT platform through MUTV, which is an attempt to increase fan base connectivity. This has resulted in a good retention strategy for the business as connecting with fans during the pandemic is more crucial than ever as live events have halted. Tottenham Hotspur, on the other hand, has been able to increase its revenue through expanding and upgrading their facilities by investing in the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, inclusive of having hosted the NFL games 3 years in a row, which while providing additional marketing opportunities, had to be cancelled in 2020.
While these football clubs have demonstrated their active approach through strengthening their businesses, certain clubs seem to continue facing adverse consequences due to the pandemic. 
Other teams have exhausted their funds following a sharp decrease in revenue generation over the past year as matches have remained behind closed doors. For instance, West Ham United are noted to have lost around £65m in revenue due to restrictions brought upon by the pandemic. Similar adverse effects were suffered by Chelsea and Manchester City, who saw a significantly greater loss due to the inability to generate match-day revenues.
Further considerations into a possible cause of the share price fall may be the long-term economic uncertainty that Brexit brings. Many of the teams are owned by billionaires, and as such, have seen the value of their shares decline by external factors. 
It is, however, worth noting that after losing an estimated £1 billion due to the pandemic, recent events have brought a sense of positivity to the region. Fans were allowed to return to the stands towards the end of last year, though capacity for games remain a concern due to new covid lockdown requirements.
In conclusion, as various teams displayed their ability to adapt and grow during the pandemic, investors were initially optimistic in holdings. The continued uncertain economic outlook, coupled with the ongoing effects of the pandemic, have seen a shift in investors prioritizing teams with a higher propensity to generate revenue and uphold long-term financial stability. In the end, the share price decline is indeed a strong indicator that all industries are vulnerable to the slightest changes in the economy and market inflections.
