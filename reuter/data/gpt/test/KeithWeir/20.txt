Rank Group Plc, the UK-based gambling and leisure company, has announced plans to create 3,000 full-time jobs in the country after undergoing a radical restructuring of its operations.
The company said that the new jobs would be created across its Grosvenor Casinos and Mecca Bingo brands, and would include roles in operations, customer support, and marketing.
The announcement came as part of a wider strategic plan that Rank Group has been implementing over the past few years, aimed at increasing its profitability and market share in the highly competitive UK gambling industry.
The restructuring has involved the closure of several unprofitable venues, as well as the development of new digital products and services, such as online bingo and casino games.
Rank Group CEO, John O'Reilly, said that the new jobs would be a "significant boost" for the UK's economy, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
"We're proud to be able to create so many full-time roles across our businesses at a time when job security is more important than ever," he said. "These jobs will provide career opportunities for people across the country, particularly in regions where employment opportunities may be limited."
O'Reilly added that the company was committed to supporting its employees and would provide them with "a generous benefits package, including healthcare, pension plans, and career development opportunities."
The news was welcomed by the UK government, which has been urging businesses to invest in job creation as the country seeks to recover from the economic impact of the pandemic.
"The creation of 3,000 full-time jobs is fantastic news for the UK and demonstrates the resilience of our economy," said Business Secretary, Alok Sharma. "Rank Group's commitment to investing in the UK is a great example of how businesses can support economic growth and job creation, and I hope to see other companies following their lead."
The UK gambling industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, thanks to the popularity of online betting and a relaxation of laws around gaming machines and casinos. However, the sector has also attracted criticism over concerns about problem gambling and the impact on vulnerable individuals.
Rank Group has said that it is committed to promoting responsible gambling and has implemented a number of measures to protect its customers, including self-exclusion programs and spending limits.
"We take our responsibilities as a gambling operator very seriously and are fully committed to promoting responsible gambling and protecting our customers from harm," O'Reilly said. "We believe that gambling can be a safe and enjoyable activity, but it's important to get the balance right and ensure that safeguards are in place to prevent harm."
