Last week, Channel 5 launched five new shows to great success, with each drawing in over a million viewers in their respective time slots. Network executives are overjoyed with the strong start, and have high hopes for the future of the Channel 5 lineup.
The first show, "The Cube," a game show that challenges contestants to complete physical challenges inside a cube-shaped arena, attracted 1.5 million viewers when it aired on Saturday night.
Sunday night's offering, "Our Yorkshire Farm," a documentary about a family living on a remote farm in the Yorkshire Dales, drew in 1.3 million viewers and quickly became the most watched show on Channel 5 for that night.
Monday night's "All Creatures Great and Small," a drama adaptation of the popular book series of the same name, drew in 1.2 million viewers, making it one of the most successful dramas on Channel 5 in recent years.
Tuesday night's "Inside the Zoo," a behind-the-scenes look at life at the Edinburgh Zoo, proved to be a hit with viewers, drawing in 1.1 million viewers, a strong showing for a nature documentary.
Finally, Wednesday's "Beat the Chasers," a spin-off of the popular game show "The Chase," drew in 1.4 million viewers, proving that the game show genre is still alive and well on British television.
Channel 5's director of programming, Ben Frow, expressed his delight at the success of the new shows, saying, "We're absolutely thrilled with the strong start that these shows have had. It's a testament to the hard work of our production teams and the strength of the content that we're able to bring to our viewers."
Frow also praised the Channel 5 audience, saying that the network had a "very loyal" and "very engaged" viewership that had helped to support the launch of these new shows.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the television industry, with many shows being delayed or cancelled due to production difficulties and reduced budgets, Channel 5 appears to be weathering the storm well.
In fact, Frow suggested that the pandemic may have actually been a catalyst for the network to invest in new, exciting programming, saying, "We've been able to be bold and take risks with our lineup, and I think it's paid off. We're always looking for new and exciting ways to engage our viewers, and I think these new shows are a great example of that."
Of course, it's still early days for these new shows, and it remains to be seen whether they will be able to maintain their strong viewership numbers over the coming weeks and months. However, the signs are certainly encouraging for Channel 5, and the network will no doubt continue to push the boundaries of programming in order to bring new and exciting content to its viewers.
