Hewlett-Packard (HP) has announced plans to purchase VeriFone Inc. for $1.18 billion in a bid to expand its presence in the e-commerce industry. The acquisition will allow HP to enter the growing market for mobile payments and financial technology solutions.
VeriFone, based in San Jose, California, is a leading provider of payment technology solutions used by merchants and financial institutions around the world. The company offers a wide range of products, including traditional point-of-sale systems, mobile payment solutions, and e-commerce platforms.
HP, a global technology company headquartered in Palo Alto, California, has been looking to expand its business beyond its core computing and printing businesses. The acquisition of VeriFone is seen as a key part of this strategy, which focuses on the growing trend towards digital payments and financial technology.
In a statement, HP said that the acquisition of VeriFone would give it a significant presence in the mobile payments space, which is expected to continue growing rapidly in the coming years. The acquisition will also allow HP to leverage VeriFone’s expertise in e-commerce and financial software, giving it a competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded market.
“With this acquisition, HP is taking a major step towards becoming a leading player in the e-commerce and mobile payments space,” said HP CEO Enrique Lores. “We believe that VeriFone’s technology and expertise will be a valuable asset as we seek to expand our capabilities and better serve our customers.”
The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval. Once the deal is finalized, VeriFone will become a part of HP’s Financial Services division, which offers a range of financial technology solutions to businesses and consumers around the world.
The move is the latest in a series of strategic acquisitions and partnerships made by HP in recent years as it seeks to diversify its business and position itself for future growth. Last year, the company acquired networking company Aruba Networks for $3 billion, and it has also invested heavily in other areas such as cybersecurity and cloud computing.
The acquisition of VeriFone comes at a time when the financial technology industry is undergoing a period of rapid expansion and consolidation. Traditional financial institutions are increasingly looking to partner with or acquire fintech startups in order to stay competitive, while tech giants like Amazon and Google are also entering the space.
“The financial technology industry is rapidly evolving, and we believe that this acquisition will allow us to stay at the forefront of these changes,” said Lores. “We are excited to welcome VeriFone into the HP family and look forward to working together to build a brighter future for our customers.”
The acquisition is also likely to have a significant impact on VeriFone’s current customers, who may be concerned about potential changes to the company’s products and services. However, HP has said that it will work closely with VeriFone’s team to ensure a smooth transition and continued support for existing customers.
“This acquisition is not only a great outcome for VeriFone shareholders, but also a testament to the hard work and dedication of our talented team,” said VeriFone CEO Mike Pulli. “We are thrilled to be joining forces with HP and look forward to continuing to deliver innovative payment solutions to our customers around the world.”
