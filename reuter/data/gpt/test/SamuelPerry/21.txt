High-tech industry executives see continued growth for leading companies despite the end of the Internet gold rush, indicating that the technology industry is not a bubble waiting to burst. The high-tech industry continues to generate impressive returns and create new opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs.
According to a recent study by McKinsey & Company, the global tech industry has consistently outperformed other sectors over the past two decades, with annual growth rates averaging 5.6% since 1995. In 2020, even with the pandemic, the tech sector has grown around 15% year on year in revenue, highlighting the resilience of the sector to economic downturns.
The pandemic has hastened the digital transformation of many companies, creating a significant boost in demand for technology. From cloud computing to 5G wireless networks, these technologies are not only in demand but have become increasingly strategic assets for companies of all sizes. This shift was particularly profound in the healthcare, education, and e-commerce sectors, where technology became an essential component of delivery channels.
"The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technologies by five years, and it's not going to slow down anytime soon," said Ginni Rometty, former CEO of IBM during a recent executive roundtable conversation. "The digital transformation has been top of mind for every senior executive and board leader, and we believe it will continue to be a priority," she added.
Furthermore, several analysts predict that the industry will continue to benefit from strong earnings growth over the next few years, as existing technology giants enjoy ongoing market dominance and new companies create innovative products and services. "Despite concerns over regulation and antitrust, many leading technology firms are trading at relatively low multiples as compared to other sectors," said Blackrock CIO-Larry Fink.
In particular, the adoption of cloud computing has been a game-changer for the technology industry. While the major tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Oracle, took early advantage of this trend, newer players such as Snowflake and Datadog are now emerging as disruptive challengers. The trend towards cloud computing is unlikely to end anytime soon, with many enterprises starting to migrate to public or hybrid clouds over the next five years.
Moreover, new segments such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming increasingly significant as they create new opportunities for innovation, growth, and profitability. McKinsey predicts that these segments could generate $13 trillion of additional economic value per year by 2030, with AI alone contributing up to $7 trillion.
The high-tech industry's continued growth, even after the end of the Internet gold rush, is also attributed to its ever-expanding role in the global economy. Technology is reframing how we conduct business, interact with each other and understand the world around us. The industry's impact is felt in every aspect of our lives, from healthcare to education, to work-life balance and entertainment.
As the industry continues to evolve, executives are aware that they must address concerns about their practices. The U.S. government's regulatory crackdown on leading technology companies — particularly on competition issues, data privacy, content moderation and social media addiction — has been prominent in recent years.
Industry players have also begun to work on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) credentials, given the high-profile environmental debates, the desire to attract and retain talent and investors, the need to build resilience, and heightened underlining macroeconomic vulnerabilities such as cybersecurity risks.
In conclusion, the technology industry's continued growth is not a surprise, but it is encouraging given the past few years' global economic challenges. The continued growth of leading firms despite the end of the Internet gold rush and the increased demand for technology during the pandemic illustrates the sector's fundamental strength. However, this should not mask some fundamental governance challenges, which we need to address as the industry continues to shape society. Despite this, the technology industry's consistently high performance and growth potential are optimistic signs that are only set to continue.
