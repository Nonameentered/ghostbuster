CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Inc. is seeking outside investment for its struggling Newton computer group, with a focus on the eMate product aimed at students and educators.
The Newton division, responsible for the short-lived personal digital assistant (PDA), has been struggling for years. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in March that the company is "not interested in being in the PDA market," and Newton has seen its share of the market dwindle over the years since its introduction in 1993.
But Apple isn't giving up on Newton just yet. The company is looking for outside investors to help support the eMate product, which is a portable, durable computer designed for classroom use. Apple is believed to have been testing a new eMate model with improved hardware and software, but without significant outside funding, it's unclear if the company will be able to bring the product to market.
Apple is hoping that the eMate will be a hit with students and educators, who have long been a core market for the company. By targeting the education sector, Apple may be able to carve out a niche for Newton in an increasingly crowded market.
The eMate has some unique features that could make it an attractive option for educators. The device is rugged and durable, meeting military standards for drop and shock resistance. It also has a long battery life, with up to nine hours of use on a single charge.
But the eMate has also faced some challenges. Despite its rugged design, the device is bulky and heavy, weighing in at over four pounds. And while it was designed to run Apple's proprietary Newton operating system, it also supports third-party software, including a version of the popular word processor Microsoft Word.
Apple's decision to seek outside investment for Newton is a sign that the company is committed to the eMate product, despite its struggles. But it's unclear how successful Apple will be in finding investors willing to take a chance on the division.
Apple has been facing increased competition in the education market, with Google's Chromebook dominating sales in schools. And while Apple's iPad has been popular with students and educators alike, the device is significantly more expensive than competing products.
Investors may be reluctant to put their money behind Newton, fearing that the division may not be able to compete with other players in the market. But Apple remains optimistic, and is hoping that the eMate will be a success with educators and students.
Apple has a history of seeking outside investment for its products, with a notable example being the 1997 investment from Microsoft that helped save the company from bankruptcy. But the eMate may be a harder sell, given the division's history of struggles.
Apple declined to comment on its search for outside investment, but analysts say that the company is likely hoping to find a partner that can help support the eMate and Newton division as a whole. With the education market becoming increasingly important, Apple will need to find a way to stay competitive in order to succeed.
It's unclear when a new eMate model will be released, or whether it will be a success in the education market. But Apple's decision to seek outside investment shows that the company is serious about trying to make Newton a viable business once again. And with the eMate's unique features, there's certainly potential for success if Apple can find the right investors to back the project.
