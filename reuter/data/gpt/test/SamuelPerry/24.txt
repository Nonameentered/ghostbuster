Eric Schmidt, the renowned software engineer and entrepreneur, has been named the new CEO of Novell Inc., a leading provider of enterprise software solutions. The announcement was made by the board of directors of Novell, through a statement released on Tuesday.
Schmidt is a veteran of the tech industry, having spent over 20 years leading some of the most prominent companies in the field. He is perhaps best known for his role in building Sun Microsystems’ internet strategy, which laid the foundation for the rise of the World Wide Web in the 1990s. During his time at Sun, Schmidt worked closely with Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web, and helped develop some of the earliest web technologies, including Java.
After leaving Sun in 1997, Schmidt held senior executive positions at a number of other firms, including Novell’s competitor, IBM. He eventually landed at Google, where he served as CEO for over a decade, overseeing the company’s meteoric rise to become one of the most powerful and influential firms in the world.
Now, Schmidt is returning to his roots in the enterprise software space, as he takes on the challenge of leading Novell into the next era of business technology. In his new role as CEO, he will be responsible for steering the company’s product development, sales and marketing efforts, and overall strategic direction.
Commenting on his appointment, Schmidt said, “I’m excited to join Novell at this critical juncture in the industry, as businesses around the world are grappling with the challenges of the digital age. Novell has a strong legacy of innovation in enterprise software, and I look forward to continuing that tradition and helping our customers thrive in the years ahead.”
Novell’s board of directors expressed their confidence in Schmidt’s ability to lead the company to success, citing his proven track record of building and scaling successful businesses. In a statement, they said, “We are thrilled to welcome Eric to Novell, and we believe that his deep knowledge of the enterprise software market and his passion for innovation will be invaluable assets as we seek to drive growth and deliver value for our shareholders.”
For his part, Schmidt will have his work cut out for him as he takes the helm of Novell. The company has been facing a number of challenges in recent years, including increased competition from cloud-based software providers and ongoing disruption in the enterprise IT landscape. But with his extensive experience and industry expertise, Schmidt is well-positioned to help Novell navigate these challenges and emerge stronger than ever.
