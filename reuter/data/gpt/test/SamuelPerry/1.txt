Hewlett-Packard (HP) has announced a dramatic price cut of up to 41% on its workstations, in an effort to wrest back market share from its rival, Sun Microsystems.
In an official statement, HP said that the price cuts were necessary to ensure that its workstations remained competitive in the market, and to provide its customers with the best possible value for money.
"HP is committed to providing high-quality workstations at affordable prices," the statement read. "We understand that our customers are looking for the best possible value for their investment, and we are confident that these price cuts will help us to maintain our position as a market leader in the workstation industry."
The price cuts will be applied across HP's entire range of workstations, including its renowned Z-series and xw-series models, which have long been the industry standard for professional users across a range of sectors, from media and entertainment to scientific research and design.
This move comes in response to a series of aggressive pricing strategies employed by Sun Microsystems in recent months, which have seen the company grab a bigger slice of the workstation market from HP.
Sun Microsystems, which was recently acquired by Oracle, has been pushing hard to expand its presence in the workstation market, and has been offering deep discounts on its high-end models in an effort to lure customers away from HP.
However, HP's new price cuts are expected to level the playing field, and make its workstations once again the go-to choice for professionals looking for the best possible performance and reliability.
Industry insiders have welcomed the move, with many analysts predicting that HP's new pricing strategy will help to solidify its position as the leading supplier of workstations to professional users across the globe.
Overall, this is great news for customers looking to invest in top-of-the-range workstations, as well as for the industry as a whole, which will benefit from increased competition and innovation as a result of this latest development.
