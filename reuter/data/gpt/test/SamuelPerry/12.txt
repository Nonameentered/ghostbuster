E*Trade CEO Reports Consistent 8-10% Monthly Growth in Subscribers & Record Stock High Amid Integration with Microsoft.
E*Trade, the online trading platform, has reported record stock high amid integration with Microsoft with consistent 8-10% monthly growth in subscribers.
The company's CEO, Michael Pizzi, said E*Trade had seen a month-to-month revenue growth of 8-10% for several months. He also noted that since the integration with Microsoft, E*Trade has seen a significant increase in new subscribers.
"This is an exciting time for E*Trade. Our integration with Microsoft has given us a huge advantage in the marketplace and has allowed us to grow our customer base significantly," Pizzi said.
E*Trade recently partnered with Microsoft to integrate its trading platform with the Microsoft Teams collaboration app. The integration allows E*Trade customers to receive real-time market updates and alerts directly within Teams.
The integration also allows customers to execute trades directly within Teams, making it easier for them to manage their investment portfolios while keeping up with their daily work routines.
"We have seen a lot of interest in the integration with Microsoft Teams. It's a great way for our customers to stay on top of their investments while they work," Pizzi said.
The company also reported record-high stock prices, surpassing previous highs set back in 2000 and reaching a new all-time high of $61.91 per share. The stock price increase followed strong quarterly earnings, which saw revenue increase by 15% to $669 million and earnings per share rise 10% to $1.03.
Pizzi credits the company's successful quarter to the integration with Microsoft and the continued growth of its customer base.
"Our partnership with Microsoft has been a game-changer for us. It has allowed us to reach a wider audience and strengthen our position in the market. We're excited about what the future holds," Pizzi said.
E*Trade's success comes at a time when the online trading industry is seeing significant growth. As more investors turn to online platforms to manage their investments, companies like E*Trade are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
"We believe that the future of investing is online, and we're committed to being at the forefront of this industry," Pizzi said.
Despite the growth in the online trading industry, there are concerns about the impact of the current economic crisis on the market. Pizzi acknowledges these concerns but remains optimistic about E*Trade's prospects.
"We're certainly aware of the challenges facing the industry right now, but we believe that we're in a strong position to weather this storm. We have a great team in place and a solid strategy for growth," Pizzi said.
As E*Trade continues to grow and innovate, the company looks set to remain a force to be reckoned with in the online trading industry. With the integration with Microsoft and record-high stock prices, the company appears to be on the right track for continued success.
