Hewlett-Packard (HP) is set to acquire payment-processing company VeriFone for $1.18 billion, as it looks to tap into the burgeoning e-commerce market. The deal is expected to bring HP's technology expertise and VeriFone's payment-processing capabilities together, creating a formidable player in the mobile payments space.
The acquisition comes at a time when the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital payments, with more consumers turning to online shopping and contactless payments. According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global mobile payments market is expected to reach $12.06 trillion by 2026, from $601.32 billion in 2017.
In a statement, Enrique Lores, HP's President and CEO, said the acquisition would "create an industry-leading payment platform that delivers differentiated solutions at scale in more than 100 countries."
VeriFone, founded in 1981, has a strong presence in the payment-processing industry, providing payment services such as credit card processing, mobile payments, and contactless payments. The company's payment terminals are used by merchants in over 150 countries, making it a valuable asset for HP as it looks to expand its reach.
"This acquisition represents an important step forward for our payment business, expanding our global footprint and enabling us to provide a complete set of payment and commerce solutions to merchants and retailers worldwide," said VeriFone CEO, Michael Pulli.
The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.
The move by HP follows a trend among tech giants seeking to expand their presence in the e-commerce industry. In 2020, Square acquired Australian fintech firm Afterpay for $29 billion, while PayPal acquired Honey Science Corp for $4 billion. Both deals were aimed at expanding their respective companies' e-commerce offerings.
HP has been trying to diversify its business beyond personal computers and printers, which have seen declining sales in recent years. In August 2021, HP announced that it would separate its printing and computing businesses, with the latter focused on new growth opportunities in areas such as gaming, software, and services.
The acquisition of VeriFone is part of HP's broader strategy to expand its offerings and tap into new markets, said Lores. "We are accelerating our strategy and expanding our addressable market to capitalize on opportunities in hybrid and distributed work, emerging technologies and services, and edge computing," he added.
The acquisition of VeriFone is a significant move for HP, which has traditionally been known for its hardware products. With the addition of VeriFone's payment-processing capabilities, HP is now well-positioned to expand its offerings in the growing e-commerce market.
The deal also represents a significant opportunity for VeriFone, which has been struggling in recent years amid increasing competition from other payment-processing companies. By joining forces with HP, VeriFone gains access to new resources and technology, enabling it to better compete in the evolving payments landscape.
In summary, the acquisition of VeriFone by HP is a significant move for both companies, creating a formidable player in the mobile payments space. It is also a reflection of the growing importance of e-commerce in the current business landscape, with more companies seeking to expand their offerings in this area to meet changing consumer preferences. With the deal set to close later this year, both HP and VeriFone will be looking to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the rapidly evolving e-commerce market.
