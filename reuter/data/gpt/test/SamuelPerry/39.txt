Intel, the American multinational corporation, is challenging the networking equipment market with its aggressively priced products. The company announced new products, including Intel Atom® Processor C3000 and Intel Xeon® Processor D-2100, which promise to deliver high-performance features at compelling costs.
The move by Intel comes as the market for network equipment continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. According to a recent report by Grand View Research, the global networking equipment market size is expected to reach $94.24 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 7.6% from 2019 to 2025.
With its new range of products, Intel is aiming to grab a share of this burgeoning market by challenging the likes of Cisco, Juniper Networks, and Arista Networks, who have been dominating the market for years.
Intel's latest Atom® Processor C3000 and Xeon® Processor D-2100 series processors are designed to provide a balance of performance, power, and cost-efficiency to the networking equipment market. The Atom® Processor C3000 series is aimed at edge applications such as routers, gateways, and wireless access points, while the Xeon® Processor D-2100 series is targeted at the core and edge systems of data centers, network function virtualization, and software-defined networking.
The Atom® Processor C3000 series features up to 16 cores and comes with Intel QuickAssist Technology, which accelerates data encryption and compression rates. Additionally, it provides virtualization support for up to 64 VMs (Virtual Machines).
On the other hand, the Xeon® Processor D-2100 series is built on Intel's 14nm technology and features up to 18 cores with Intel Hyper-Threading Technology. This series is designed to provide higher performance at a lower wattage than existing systems, making it ideal for network function virtualization applications.
In addition to the new processors, Intel also announced the Intel Ethernet 700 Series Network Adapters, which provide up to 2x throughput improvement and are optimized for Intel processors.
"Intel is committed to helping our customers modernize their network infrastructure to enable new capabilities and drive their business forward faster," said Sandra Rivera, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's Network Platforms Group. "Our latest Intel Atom® Processor C3000 and Intel Xeon® Processor D-2100 series deliver key processing and platform improvements, and are designed to enable more intelligence at the edge of the network, supporting a broad range of high-growth network needs."
The launch of the new products has been met with a positive response from industry experts, who have hailed Intel's move as a potential game-changer in the networking equipment market.
"Intel's new processors have the potential to disrupt the networking equipment market, which has been dominated by a small group of vendors for many years," said Simon Stanley, founder and principal consultant at Earlswood Marketing. "Intel has a strong reputation for providing high-quality, cost-effective products, and it is likely that these latest products will have a significant impact on the networking equipment market."
The aggressive pricing strategy adopted by Intel is expected to attract a wide range of customers, particularly in the SMB and mid-market segments, who are looking for affordable yet high-performance networking equipment.
According to a recent report by IDC, the SMB market is expected to be a key driver for growth in the networking equipment market in the coming years. The report states that SMB spending on networking equipment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.7% to reach $24.8 billion by 2020.
Given the growth potential of the SMB market, Intel's move to aggressively price its products is likely to provide a significant boost to its market share in the networking equipment market.
However, Intel faces stiff competition from established players such as Cisco and Juniper Networks, who have a strong presence in the enterprise market. The challenge for Intel will be to convince enterprises to switch to its products by highlighting the benefits of its performance and cost-efficiency.
Overall, Intel's move to challenge the networking equipment market with its aggressively priced products has the potential to disrupt the market and provide a viable alternative for customers looking for high-performance networking equipment at affordable prices. With the adoption of 5G technology and the growth of the IoT market, the demand for networking equipment is expected to continue to grow, making it an attractive market for Intel to target.
