Despite investor worries about product upgrades, Netscape Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: NSCP) has announced impressive financial results that have surpassed Wall Street's expectations.
For the fiscal quarter that ended March 31, the company reported revenue of $150 million and earnings of $0.11 per share, beating analysts' expectations of $144 million and $0.09 per share. The results are a significant improvement over the same period last year when the company reported revenue of $65.1 million and a loss of $0.16 per share.
The strong showing was due in part to sales of the company's flagship product, Netscape Navigator, which saw a 29 percent increase over the previous quarter. The company's enterprise software products also saw significant growth, with sales rising 75 percent over the previous quarter.
Despite the impressive results, some investors remain concerned about the company's ability to maintain its market position in the face of stiff competition from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). Netscape's shares fell by 5 percent in early trading following the announcement.
The drop in share price may also have been due to concerns over the company's decision to delay the release of its new browser, Netscape Communicator 5.0, until the third quarter of this year. The delay means that Netscape is likely to miss the important back-to-school market and could lose ground to Microsoft, which has already released its latest browser, Internet Explorer 4.0.
Netscape officials, however, remain upbeat about the company's future prospects. In a conference call with analysts and reporters, President and CEO Jim Barksdale stressed that the company's strength lies in its focus on enterprise solutions and its ability to deliver powerful software products.
Barksdale also expressed confidence in Netscape's ability to maintain its market position in the face of Microsoft's aggressive tactics. "We're not going to let Microsoft destroy us," he stated. "We're going to compete, and we're going to win."
Analysts are divided over the company's prospects. Some see Netscape as vulnerable to Microsoft's growing dominance of the market while others see the company's focus on enterprise solutions as a key differentiator. Many also believe that Netscape's decision to open-source Communicator could give the company a competitive advantage over Microsoft.
"By making the source code freely available, Netscape has tapped into the power of the open-source movement," said Brian Behlendorf, a software engineer and open-source advocate. "This could give them a significant edge in the battle against Microsoft."
Netscape's strong financial performance was also felt by its employees, many of whom received stock options as part of their compensation packages. The company's success has made many Netscape employees overnight millionaires, with some estimates putting the number at over 800.
The company's profits have also had a positive impact on the local economy in Silicon Valley, where Netscape is headquartered. The company's success has helped to create a thriving technology industry in the area, with many start-ups and other companies benefitting from the influx of talent and capital.
Despite the challenges that lie ahead, Netscape officials are optimistic about the company's future. They see the shift towards enterprise solutions and the adoption of open-source technology as key factors in the company's continuing success.
"We're in the middle of a revolution," said Barksdale. "This is not just about technology, it's about changing the way we do business. And I believe that Netscape is leading the way."
