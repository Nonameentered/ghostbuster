HP Unveils New PhotoSmart Line for Consumer Digital Photography Enthusiasts
On Wednesday, HP announced the launch of its new PhotoSmart line of products for consumer digital photography enthusiasts. The range includes cameras, printers, and software designed to enhance the overall photography experience.
"We are excited to introduce the new HP PhotoSmart lineup, aimed at empowering consumers to express their creativity and capture their most cherished moments," said David Laing, Vice President and General Manager of HP's Consumer Personal Systems division. "With features like Bluetooth connectivity and advanced print technologies, this new range delivers an unparalleled experience for photography enthusiasts."
The PhotoSmart cameras come in three different models: the HP PhotoSmart 930, HP PhotoSmart 735, and HP PhotoSmart 430. All three models are equipped with high-resolution lenses and advanced features like image stabilization and facial recognition. Additionally, they offer Bluetooth connectivity, allowing users to share their images wirelessly with other Bluetooth-enabled devices.
HP also introduced two new printers under the PhotoSmart line â€“ the HP PhotoSmart 7760 and HP Photosmart 7450. Both printers feature advanced print technologies, including HP's exclusive Vivera ink that produces true-to-life, long-lasting colors. They also support a wide range of printing media, including plain paper, glossy photo paper, and even transfer paper for T-shirt printing.
To further enhance the user experience, HP has also launched new software for both Mac and PC users. The HP ImageZone software, available for free download, offers advanced image editing, printing, and sharing tools. The software includes features like red-eye removal, photo album creation, and one-click image optimization.
The launch of HP's new PhotoSmart line comes at a time when the digital photography market is experiencing significant growth. According to recent statistics, the global digital camera market is projected to reach $20.3 billion by 2023, fueled by increasing demand for high-quality images and the popularity of social media platforms like Instagram.
"With the new HP PhotoSmart line, we are catering to a growing demand from consumers who want to capture and share their memories with ease," said Laing. "These products offer an intuitive, seamless experience that enhances the creative possibilities of digital photography."
The PhotoSmart line is now available for purchase both online and in stores, with prices ranging from $149.99 for the HP PhotoSmart 430 to $399.99 for the HP PhotoSmart 7760.
