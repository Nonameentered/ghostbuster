Live Picture, a leading provider of advanced imaging solutions, has launched its first consumer photo imaging product, LivePix. The revolutionary app aims to enhance the user's photo experience by providing augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) elements.
Live Picture is known for its award-winning advanced imaging solutions. The company has been providing its services to top corporations, including the National Football League, The Weather Channel, and Sony. With LivePix, the company is now shifting its focus to the everyday user.
LivePix is an easy-to-use app that offers several features. The app allows users to take a picture and instantly apply a range of creative filters and effects. The app's AI technology can also identify individuals and style them according to the latest fashion trends, including hair, clothing, and makeup.
LivePix also offers an augmented reality function that allows the user to choose different backgrounds and apply a range of special effects. Users can add virtual elements into their images using AR, such as birds, flowers, and other objects. The AR function is accessible through the LivePix camera and can be shared instantly across various social media platforms.
“Our vision is to create innovative imaging solutions that push the boundaries of what’s possible,” said Live Picture CEO Tom Huseby. “With LivePix, we’re bringing our expertise to everyday consumers, empowering them to create stunning and unique images with AR and AI technology.”
Live Picture’s product launch comes at a time when the pandemic has made everyone more reliant on their devices, capturing and sharing photographs of what they see and do. The market for photo apps is highly competitive, with a plethora of applications offering similar features. However, Live Picture’s ability to integrate AR and AI technology sets it apart from the competition.
“We wanted to bring something unique and different to the table,” said Live Picture Chief Marketing Officer Anna Valenzuela. “Our app offers an unmatched photo experience that empowers users to take everyday images, and through our advanced imaging technology, create something truly exceptional.”
Live Picture's LivePix app has been in development for over two years. It underwent rigorous testing and tweaking to ensure that the user experience is optimal. The app is now available to download on Apple's App Store and Google Play.
The LivePix app has caught the imagination of many photography enthusiasts, who appreciate the advancements in technology used. Reports have noted that the app's compatibility with every mobile phone camera and ease of use is a significant selling point.
The app’s technology can also enhance a user's social media presence, making their images stand out from others. The app offers a range of filters and effects that appeal to a wide range of users and has garnered overwhelmingly positive reviews on the app store.
“I’ve been using the LivePix app for some time now, and I must say, it’s a game-changer,” said Nick Brown, a professional photographer. “The AI feature is particularly impressive, and the AR is incredibly fun, adding a whole new level of creativity to my photos.”
Live Picture's LivePix app is just the beginning. The company has recently announced that it has secured $10 million in funding in a Series A investment led by Sapphire Ventures. The funding will assist the company in broadening its range of enhanced imaging solutions, including products aimed at the healthcare and manufacturing sectors.
“We’re thrilled to have Sapphire Ventures as our lead investor,” said Huseby. “Live Picture is committed to pushing the boundaries of what imaging solutions can do in every industry, and this funding will assist us in continuing our work in creating innovative imaging products.”
The launch of Live Picture's consumer photo imaging product, LivePix, is a significant milestone for the company and its vision for empowering people worldwide with advanced imaging technology. Whether used for personal photography, blogging, or marketing on social media, the app is all set to take the world by storm.
