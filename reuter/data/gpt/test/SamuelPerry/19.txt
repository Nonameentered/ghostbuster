Sun Microsystems has announced its entry into the supercomputing market, with plans to compete with established players like Cray and Silicon Graphics Inc. The technology giant has long been a leader in the server market, and now hopes to apply that experience and expertise to the demanding world of high-performance computing.
"We see a big opportunity in the supercomputing space," said Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy. "We've been studying this market for a long time, and we think we have a unique set of technologies and solutions that can really make a difference."
Sun Microsystems is not a newcomer to supercomputing, having provided systems to leading research institutions and government agencies for many years. However, the company has not previously targeted the broader commercial market, which has been dominated by Cray and Silicon Graphics Inc. for decades.
To win over customers in this competitive space, Sun Microsystems is focusing on several key areas, including performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. The company's new system, codenamed "Starfire," is designed to deliver up to 20 petaflops of performance, making it one of the most powerful supercomputers on the market.
"Starfire is a tremendous leap forward in computing power," said Dave Douglas, Sun Microsystems' vice president of systems. "It's optimized for large-scale simulations, data analytics, and artificial intelligence workloads, and it's incredibly scalable, so it can grow with your needs."
Beyond raw performance, Sun Microsystems is also highlighting the affordability of its new supercomputer. Douglas said that the company has worked hard to reduce the total cost of ownership for customers, by minimizing power consumption, simplifying software licensing, and offering flexible financing options.
"We want to make supercomputing accessible to more organizations than ever before," said Douglas. "We believe that by combining performance, scalability, and affordability, we can deliver a solution that meets the needs of a wide range of industries, from finance to healthcare to manufacturing."
Some analysts are skeptical of Sun Microsystems' chances in the supercomputing market, given the entrenched position of competitors like Cray and Silicon Graphics Inc. However, McNealy said that his company is committed to the long game, and that he expects to see significant growth in demand for high-performance computing in the coming years.
"This is a market that's only going to get bigger as more organizations seek to harness the power of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning," he said. "We believe that we have what it takes to succeed, and we're excited to see where this journey takes us."
