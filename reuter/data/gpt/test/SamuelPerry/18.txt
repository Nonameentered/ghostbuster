Sun Microsystems, a leading provider of servers and storage systems, has announced its entry into the field of supercomputing, a move that could seriously disrupt the long-established dominance of Cray Research in the market.
According to Sun, its new supercomputing system, code-named "Blackbox," is an innovative, groundbreaking solution that will enable researchers and scientists to tackle the most complex and demanding problems in science, engineering, and business.
The Blackbox system is designed as a complete, self-contained unit, encased in a shipping container and equipped with advanced cooling, power management, and remote monitoring capabilities. It can be deployed in virtually any location, whether on land, at sea, or in the air, and can be up and running within hours of delivery, significantly reducing the time and cost associated with traditional supercomputing systems.
"We believe that Blackbox will revolutionize the way supercomputing is done today," said Neil Knox, Sun's executive vice president for volume systems products. "For too long, the supercomputing market has been dominated by a handful of specialized vendors, offering expensive, purpose-built systems that are hard to deploy and maintain. Blackbox changes all that, offering a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solution that can be tailored to the needs of any user."
The Blackbox system is based on Sun's advanced server technology, including the Solaris operating system, the latest AMD Opteron processors, and high-speed networking components. It is capable of running a wide range of applications, from scientific simulations and data analysis to business intelligence and e-commerce.
Sun said that it has already received orders for Blackbox from a number of leading organizations, including the Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories, the University of Tokyo, and the U.S. Navy. The company expects to begin shipping the systems later this year.
The entry of Sun into the supercomputing market is a bold move that is likely to provoke strong reactions from Cray Research and other established players. For decades, Cray has been a dominant force in supercomputing, producing systems that are widely regarded as the fastest and most powerful in the world.
However, in recent years, Cray has faced increasing competition from other vendors, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell, who have all developed their own supercomputing solutions based on commodity hardware and open software standards.
Sun's decision to enter the market is a sign that the trend towards "commoditization" is accelerating, as more and more customers demand flexible, cost-effective solutions that are easy to deploy and maintain.
"Sun's entry into supercomputing is a clear indication that the market is changing rapidly, and that traditional strategies and business models are no longer sufficient," said Debra Goldfarb, vice president of research at IDC. "Sun is taking a bold step by introducing a new, disruptive technology, and it remains to be seen how the established players will react."
While it is too early to say whether Sun's Blackbox system will be successful, analysts say that the company's reputation for innovation and expertise in high-performance computing could be a significant advantage. Sun has a long history of delivering cutting-edge solutions, from its early work on network file systems and Java programming language to its recent forays into grid computing and virtualization.
Moreover, Sun's embrace of open standards and its support for emerging technologies such as cloud computing and web services are likely to resonate with customers who seek a more flexible, agile approach to computing.
"Cray and other established vendors have a strong track record, and they are not going to disappear overnight," said Goldfarb. "But Sun has a unique combination of technology, expertise, and vision that makes it a formidable challenger in the market."
For now, Cray and Sun are unlikely to face each other directly, as they serve slightly different market segments. Cray's systems are geared towards the high-end of the market, serving the most demanding scientific and engineering applications. Sun's systems, on the other hand, are targeted at a broader range of users, from academic researchers to commercial businesses.
However, as the market for supercomputing continues to grow and evolve, it is likely that the two companies will compete more directly for customers and market share. In such a scenario, Sun's Blackbox system could prove to be a formidable challenger to Cray's established position.
