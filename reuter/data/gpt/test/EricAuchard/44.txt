AT&T Corp. Q1 profits fall 17% due to competition and new investments, warns of potential weak Q2 results. Meanwhile, BellSouth Corp. reports strong growth in customer lines and wireless operations with an 11% rise in operating earnings.
AT&T Corp. has reported a drop of 17% in its Q1 profits. The decline in profits has been attributed to increasing competition and new investments made by the company. AT&T Corp. also warned that its Q2 results may not be up to the mark due to weak demand.
The company posted a net income of $3.41 billion, or $0.57 per share, for the first quarter, which ended on March 31. In comparison, the company's net income was $4.1 billion, or $0.67 per share, in the same quarter last year. The company's revenue rose slightly from $39.3 billion in Q1 2020 to $43.9 billion in the most recent quarter.
AT&T Corp. also faced a decline in subscribers for its linear TV services. The company lost 620,000 subscribers in the quarter due to increased competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+.
The company has been investing in its 5G network to compete with its rivals in the telecom industry. AT&T Corp. said it had invested $2.4 billion in the first quarter, up from $1.2 billion in the same quarter last year.
John Stankey, the CEO of AT&T Corp., said that the company is making progress towards its long-term goals. “We are pleased with our progress on our fiber and 5G rollouts, and our strong customer growth in our market-leading mobility business,” he said.
However, he warned that the company's Q2 results may be affected by weak demand in some of its businesses. “We are seeing some impact to demand from COVID-19, and believe the economic environment remains uncertain," he said.
Meanwhile, BellSouth Corp. reported strong growth in its customer lines and wireless operations. The company's operating earnings rose 11% to $2.4 billion in the first quarter, up from $2.2 billion in the same quarter last year.
BellSouth Corp. added 235,000 new postpaid wireless customers in the quarter, taking its total number of wireless subscribers to 80.8 million. The company's prepaid wireless subscribers also witnessed a rise, with 116,000 net additions in the quarter.
BellSouth Corp.'s customer lines business, which provides landline telephone services to homes and businesses, added 13,000 net new subscribers in the quarter, taking the total number of subscriber lines to 45.2 million.
The company also witnessed a sharp rise in its entertainment business, with net subscriber additions of 81,000 for its DirecTV and U-Verse TV services.
"We delivered solid first-quarter results with excellent subscriber growth across our wireless and customer lines businesses," said Randall Stephenson, the CEO of Bell South.
The company's strong financial performance is expected to continue in the coming quarters. BellSouth Corp. raised its full-year earnings outlook due to its strong performance so far this year.
Like AT&T Corp., BellSouth Corp. has been investing in its 5G network to compete with its rivals in the telecom industry. The company announced that it had launched its 5G Evolution and Mobile 5G networks in select markets.
BellSouth Corp. also announced plans to expand its fiber optic network to reach an additional two million customer locations by the end of 2020. The expansion will bring BellSouth Corp.'s total fiber network to more than 14 million customer locations.
The telecom industry has been witnessing significant changes in recent years with the rise of streaming services and the rollout of 5G networks. Companies like AT&T Corp. and BellSouth Corp. are competing to stay ahead of their rivals by investing in their infrastructure and providing better services.
While AT&T Corp. has faced a decline in profits due to increased competition, BellSouth Corp. has reported strong growth in its customer lines and wireless operations. The two companies are expected to continue investing in their 5G networks in the coming years to keep up with the changing demands of their customers.
