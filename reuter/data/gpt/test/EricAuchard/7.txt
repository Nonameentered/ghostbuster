Shares of Cascade Communications Corp plummeted today amid concerns over the company's earnings. The telecommunications giant, which reported record profits last quarter, saw its stock price drop by more than 10% as investors worried about declining revenue and slowing growth. Analysts say that the company's recent investments in new technologies and acquisitions may not be paying off as quickly as investors had hoped. Cascade Communications executives have not yet commented on the company's financial performance this quarter, but analysts say that investors will be closely watching for any updates in the coming days and weeks.
