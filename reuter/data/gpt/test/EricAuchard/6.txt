Despite suffering in other areas of its business, Cascade Communications Corp's frame-relay business has continued to experience hyper-growth rates, according to company executives.
"While our overall business may have seen some challenges, our frame-relay business has been a bright spot for us," said Cascade Communications Corp CEO, John Smith. "We continue to see tremendous growth in this area, and expect that trend to continue moving forward."
Frame-relay is a technology that is used to transmit data over a wide area network (WAN). It allows for the creation of virtual circuits that connect various locations. According to Cascade Communications Corp executives, the demand for frame-relay services has been growing rapidly over the past few years.
"Our clients are looking for reliable, high-speed connections that allow them to transmit data quickly and efficiently," said Smith. "Frame-relay provides them with just that, and we have been able to meet that demand with our services."
Cascade Communications Corp's frame-relay business has been so successful that the company has had to expand its network and increase its capacity to keep up with demand. The company has also invested heavily in research and development to ensure that its frame-relay services remain cutting-edge.
"Overall, we are very pleased with the growth of our frame-relay business," said Smith. "We remain committed to providing our clients with the best possible service, and we are confident that we will continue to see strong growth in this area moving forward."
