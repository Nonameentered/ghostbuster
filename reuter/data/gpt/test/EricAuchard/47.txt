AT&T has withdrawn their application for the license to launch next-generation communications satellites. The move has shocked the industry as the company was chasing SpaceX's enthusiasm for satellite internet.
AT&T had submitted an application for permission to launch low-orbit satellites for its communication service to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) last year. Still, now it has withdrawn the application. The company would have used its satellites to offer high-speed internet service to people in isolated areas.
The cause for AT&T's step is currently unclear, but analysts suggest that the company was trapped in regulatory hurdles and technological challenges. Another possibility could be the company's policy; it needed to cut costs to make up for the drop in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
AT&T is the second significant telecommunications company to withdraw the plan for low-orbit satellites this year, as OneWeb reportedly going through bankruptcy and seeking a buyer. SpaceX's Starlink is currently the only active player in the low-orbit satellite broadband space.
OneWeb had initially planned to launch 600 satellites, but it later revised its goal to 48,000 satellites. Starlink, on the other hand, already has over 500 satellites in orbit and aims to launch up to 42,000 satellites. AT&T's license application proposed deploying 12 satellites at a proposed altitude of 1,200 km (745 miles).
AT&T's withdrawal will no doubt be a massive boost for Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has already launched nearly a thousand satellites and received a license from the FCC to launch over ten thousand more. The race to launch satellites for fast internet speed is a crowded one, with many players, but SpaceX has gained an early lead worth noting.
According to SpaceX, Starlink aims to offer global high-speed internet coverage throughout this year, and many areas of the US are already getting the service. SpaceX is to be considered with a new power that is now influencing the internet service.
The FCC's firm approach to regulating the industry is likely to culminate in a clear success for SpaceX ahead of other leading rivals, leaving them struggling in the market. While AT&T's exit from the low-orbit satellite broadband market is likely to engage FCC's attention and raise questions about the future sustainability of its internet service for low-affluent families in the US.
