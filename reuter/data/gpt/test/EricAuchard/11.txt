IBM Gives Stock a Cosmetic Boost with Two-For-One Split but Faces Pressure to Revive Core Business Growth
IBM announced a two-for-one stock split on Tuesday, July 20th, which led to a surge in share prices. This rare move by the technology giant is aimed at providing investors with an opportunity to get in on the ground floor, as the split would cut the share price in half, immediately doubling the number of shares outstanding.
The action is just the latest step in a prolonged makeover effort for the company, as they have been struggling to revive their core business growth for years. IBM has been under immense pressure from competitors such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft, whose cloud divisions have been drawing more and more business from IBM's own cloud services.
With the stock split, IBM hopes to appeal to a wider range of investors, particularly smaller retail investors who may have shied away from their stock due to its high price point. This move is expected to boost the trading volume, liquidity, and overall appeal of IBM's stock.
However, the stock split is only a cosmetic measure and does not necessarily address the underlying issues that have been plaguing IBM for years. In an era of digital transformation and disruptive technologies, IBM has struggled to keep pace with the competition, leading to a decline in revenues and profits.
IBM's cloud business has been a particular point of concern for investors and analysts, as the company has been losing market share to AWS and Microsoft. In the first quarter of 2021, IBM's cloud and cognitive software segment reported revenues of $5.4 billion, down 1% year over year.
To address these challenges, IBM has been undergoing a significant transformation, focusing on high-growth areas such as hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has been working to streamline the company's operations and shift its focus towards these emerging technologies, hoping to drive growth and regain market share.
Under Krishna's leadership, IBM recently made a bold move by announcing its plans to spin off its legacy Managed Infrastructure Services unit into a new public company, to be named Kyndryl. This new entity will focus on managing IT infrastructure for businesses, allowing IBM to focus on its core growth areas.
The spinoff is expected to be completed by the end of 2021, and IBM has been ramping up investment in its cloud and AI businesses to support its growth strategy. In June, IBM announced plans to acquire Turbonomic, a cloud management software provider, to bolster its cloud offerings.
Despite these efforts, IBM faces a challenging road ahead. The company's revenue growth has been sluggish, and its margins have been under pressure due to intense competition. IBM's stock price may have received a temporary boost from the two-for-one stock split, but investors are unlikely to be satisfied with cosmetic measures alone.
To truly revive IBM's core business growth, the company will need to demonstrate that its transformation strategy is working, and that it can compete effectively in the cloud and AI markets. With its focus on emerging technologies and a streamlined operating model, IBM has the potential to succeed in these areas, but it will require sustained investment and execution.
In conclusion, the stock split is a positive sign for IBM's investors, as it provides an opportunity for retail investors to own a piece of the company. However, the real challenge for IBM lies in reviving its core business growth and competing effectively in the cloud and AI markets. With its transformation strategy in place, the company has a chance to succeed, but it will need to demonstrate that its investments are paying off in the months and years ahead.
