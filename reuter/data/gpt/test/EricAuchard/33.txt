New York State regulators have greenlit the merger of Bell Atlantic and NYNEX, two of America's largest telecommunications companies, in an announcement made on Friday.
In a statement, the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) said that they would approve the deal with conditions that focus on protecting consumers and ensuring the continuation of vital services.
Under the agreement, the companies must promise to invest in and expand their networks, improve customer service, and keep rates affordable for all customers.
The merger is significant for both companies. Bell Atlantic is one of the nation's largest telecommunications companies, while NYNEX is one of the largest local phone companies in the Northeast. The merger would create a giant telecommunications company that could dominate the Northeast region.
The decision by the PSC comes after months of investigation and review of the proposed merger. The commission reviewed the financial implications of the deal, as well as the potential impact on consumers, competition, and the telecommunications industry.
The PSC's decision has been widely anticipated, with industry experts and analysts predicting the merger would receive regulatory approval.
The PSC has imposed a series of conditions on the merger that focus on ensuring that consumers are protected. The companies must invest in their networks, improve customer service, and keep rates affordable for all customers.
As part of the agreement, the new company must also provide discounted services to low-income customers. Additionally, the company must maintain its current levels of service, including its 911 emergency services and its support for New York's Lifeline program, which provides discounted phone services for low-income households.
The PSC has also imposed conditions on the new company's expansion into new markets. The company must submit to PSC approval if it wants to expand into new markets or acquire new companies.
The companies are also required to file regular reports to the PSC, including financial information, consumer complaints, and progress on meeting the merger's conditions.
"We have taken a close look at this merger and found that it is in the public interest," said John B. O'Mara, Chairman of the PSC. "But we are also taking steps to ensure that consumers are protected and that vital services are maintained."
The approval of the merger has been welcomed by both companies. Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith said the merger "will enable us to create a company that will compete aggressively providing customers with the latest cutting-edge services while continuing to provide high-quality, reliable, and affordable service."
NYNEX Chairman Ivan Seidenberg added: "The merger is an important step in delivering the benefits of competition to our customers. We are committed to working closely with the PSC to ensure that our customers continue to receive high-quality service at a reasonable price."
The announcement comes just days after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the merger on a national level, subject to certain conditions.
The FCC's conditions require the new company to provide discounted services to schools and libraries, and to expand its network to underserved communities. The company must also maintain a level of competition in the industry.
The merger is expected to create a telecommunications giant with a combined market value of around $50 billion. The company will be based in New York and will have around 135,000 employees.
The Bell Atlantic/NYNEX deal follows a series of mergers in the telecommunications industry over the past few years. Earlier this year, SBC Communications and Ameritech merged, creating the largest telecommunications company in the United States.
The merger between Bell Atlantic and NYNEX is expected to be completed early next year, pending final approval from other regulatory bodies.
As one of the largest mergers in the history of the telecommunications industry, the Bell Atlantic/NYNEX merger is expected to have far-reaching implications for the industry and its customers. The conditions imposed by the PSC and the FCC are designed to protect consumers and ensure continued competition in the industry.
