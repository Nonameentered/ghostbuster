New York, NY - Shareholders for MCI and British Telecom (BT) are expected to overwhelmingly approve the proposed merger of the two telecommunications giants on Friday, creating a multi-billion dollar giant in the communications industry.
The merger, which was announced in June, would create a company with a combined market value of over $50 billion and operations in over 180 countries. It is expected to create a more competitive player in the global market, challenging rivals like Verizon Communications and AT&T.
The merger comes at a time when the telecommunications industry is in the midst of rapid change. New technologies, like 5G networks and the Internet of Things, are creating new opportunities for companies to expand their reach and capabilities. The MCI-BT merger is seen as an attempt to keep up with these changes and remain competitive in the market.
"The proposed merger brings together two of the world's leading telecommunications companies to create a powerful and competitive force in the global market," said John Duffy, MCI CEO, in a statement. "Our combined capabilities will enable us to deliver innovative solutions and services to our customers around the world, while driving long-term growth and value for our shareholders."
Both MCI and BT have a long history in the telecommunications industry. MCI, originally known as Microwave Communications Inc., was founded in 1963 and became one of the world's largest long-distance telephone companies before filing for bankruptcy in 2002. It was acquired by Verizon Communications in 2006 and then sold to private equity firm, Apollo Global Management, for $6.5 billion in 2020.
BT, on the other hand, was formed in 1980 after the UK government privatized the state-owned telecommunications company, British Telecom. It has since expanded its operations to become a global telecommunications giant with interests in TV, broadband, and mobile services.
The merger is expected to bring together MCI's strong presence in the US and Latin American markets with BT's extensive network and expertise in Europe and Asia. The combined company will offer a wide range of products and services, including fixed-line and mobile services, data services, cloud services, and more.
Despite concerns over potential antitrust issues and the impact of the merger on jobs, most analysts expect the merger to be approved by shareholders. The two companies have already received regulatory approval from a number of countries, including the US, UK, and Australia.
If approved, the merger is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022. The newly merged company would be headquartered in London with a significant presence in the US.
"The merger of MCI and BT is a bold move that reflects the changing nature of the telecommunications industry," said Mark Langshaw, a telecommunications analyst at GlobalData. "It shows that companies are willing to take risks and make big investments to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market."
