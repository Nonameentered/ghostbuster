Stamford, Conn. – Xerox Corporation (XRX.N) announced higher fourth-quarter profits, in part due to increased sales of digital products and its acquisition of unified insurance solutions provider, TALIX Intelligence Group (Talegen). The report highlights the company’s progress towards its goal of becoming a leader in digital transformation, and its commitment to developing innovative products to meet the evolving needs of its customers.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, Xerox reported a net income of $249 million, up from $818 million in the same period in 2019. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.04 per share, beating Wall Street expectations of 92 cents per share. Fourth-quarter revenue also increased to $1.93 billion, from $1.76 billion a year earlier.
“Our fourth-quarter results demonstrate our ability to execute our plan, despite challenging market conditions,” said Xerox CEO John Visentin. “We delivered strong earnings and cash flow, amplified our sales pipeline, and continued to invest in our growth strategy.”
Digital products and services were a key driver of Xerox’s higher profits, with sales in its software segment accounting for 20% of the company's total revenue in the fourth quarter. Xerox has been investing in its digital portfolio, focusing on cloud-based document management solutions and artificial intelligence-powered software.
“We are seeing strong customer demand for our digital products, particularly our cloud-based solutions, as organizations continue to accelerate their digital transformations,” Visentin said. “As we move into 2021, we will continue to invest in new digital products and services to drive growth and better serve our customers.”
The company’s acquisition of Talegen Group in December 2020 also provided a boost to Xerox’s fourth-quarter profits. Talegen Group provides insurers with a suite of digital tools and services for underwriting, policy administration, and claims processing. The acquisition expands Xerox’s presence in the insurance and financial services industries, which have been increasingly turning to digital solutions to streamline their operations and improve customer experience.
“With the addition of Talegen Group, Xerox is now able to offer a more comprehensive suite of digital solutions to the insurance industry, including AI and machine learning-powered tools to streamline and automate business processes,” Visentin said.
The company’s document technology segment, which includes printers and copiers, also saw a decline in revenue in the fourth quarter, as remote work and reduced office occupancy rates have led to lower demand for printing and copying equipment. However, Xerox has been working to diversify its revenue sources and reduce its reliance on traditional printing equipment sales.
“We are continuing to adjust to the changing market conditions and evolving customer demands,” Visentin said. “While there may be short-term headwinds in our document technology segment, we are confident in our ability to drive long-term growth through our digital products and services.”
Looking ahead, Xerox expects to continue its positive momentum into the new year, as it focuses on driving growth through digital product innovation and strategic acquisitions.
“We are well-positioned to deliver value for our shareholders and customers in 2021,” Visentin said. “Our robust pipeline of digital products and services, combined with our strong financial position, puts us in a solid position to continue to grow and expand our market share.”
Xerox also plans to maintain its commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices in the coming year, as it continues to invest in renewable energy, reduce its carbon footprint, and improve the welfare of its employees and communities.
“Our long-term success as a company depends on our ability to operate responsibly and sustainably,” Visentin said. “We are committed to playing our part in addressing key global challenges, such as climate change, and creating a brighter future for all.”
Overall, Xerox’s fourth-quarter earnings report highlights the company’s strong focus on digital transformation, innovation, and responsible business practices. Its success in the digital products and services segment, as well as its strategic acquisition of Talegen, demonstrate its commitment to emerging industries and evolving customer needs. As Xerox looks to the future, it is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory and strengthen its position as a leader in the digital age.
