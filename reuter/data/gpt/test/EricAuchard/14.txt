NCR Corp, the leader in consumer transaction technologies, has just unveiled a revolutionary new system designed to transform the way people shop: a do-it-yourself retail checkout system that promises to eliminate long lines and wait times at grocery stores.
The system, named "Scan, Bag, Go," allows shoppers to use their smartphones to scan items as they shop, then check out using a self-checkout station before leaving the store. With this technology, shoppers can simply bypass long checkout lines and enjoy a faster, more efficient shopping experience.
NCR Corp. has been developing Scan, Bag, Go for quite some time, and they are excited to finally make it available to the public. The system has already been piloted at several grocery stores across the country, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Shoppers are taking advantage of the ease and convenience that the new technology offers.
"The system is so easy to use," said Jane Smith, a loyal customer at a participating grocery store. "I just scan the items as I'm shopping, and then I'm ready to check out in seconds. It's like having my own personal checkout aisle."
The technology behind Scan, Bag, Go is both innovative and simple. The shopper downloads a free app to their smartphone, which they can then use to scan barcodes as they add items to their cart. As they scan, the app keeps a running total of their purchases, so they always know how much they're spending.
Once the shopper is ready to check out, they simply head to one of the self-checkout stations located throughout the store. The stations, which resemble traditional self-checkout kiosks, are equipped with specialized hardware that allows the shopper to quickly and easily pay for their purchases.
NCR Corp. has emphasized that the new system is not designed to replace traditional checkout lanes but rather to enhance the overall shopping experience. According to the company, Scan, Bag, Go allows shoppers to take control of their shopping experience and tailor it to their individual needs.
"Customers today are looking for flexibility and convenience," said Dusty Lutz, Vice President of NCR Retail. "Scan, Bag, Go offers them the ability to shop at their own pace, check out quickly, and be on their way in no time."
The new system is expected to be a hit with busy shoppers who want to avoid long lines and spend more time doing the things they love. With Scan, Bag, Go, NCR Corp. has taken a major step forward in the retail industry and has revolutionized the way people shop for groceries.
