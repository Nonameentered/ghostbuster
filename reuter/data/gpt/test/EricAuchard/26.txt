3Com to Acquire Modem Giant U.S. Robotics in $6.6 Billion Deal to Challenge Cisco Systems Inc.
In a move aimed at taking on Cisco Systems Inc. as a leader in the computer networking market, 3Com Corporation announced on Tuesday that it has agreed to acquire modem giant U.S. Robotics in a deal worth $6.6 billion. U.S. Robotics is a leading provider of dial-up and broadband modems, while 3Com is a major player in the networking and computer communication space. 
According to industry experts, the deal will create a formidable competitor to Cisco, which currently holds a substantial market share in the networking and communication sectors. The acquisition, which is expected to close in the second half of the year, will give 3Com a stronger foothold in high-growth areas such as internet telephony, wireless networking, and internet access. 
The acquisition will also expand 3Com's presence in international markets, as U.S. Robotics has a major presence in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The deal is structured as a stock-for-stock exchange, and U.S. Robotics shareholders will receive 1.75 shares of 3Com for each share of U.S. Robotics they own. 
In a joint statement, the two companies said that the merger will enable them to "deliver superior end-to-end networking solutions to customers around the globe." The statement also noted that the combined company will be "well-positioned to ride the explosive growth in demand for networked communications and data services."
Analysts say that the deal is a win-win for both companies. U.S. Robotics has been struggling in recent years as the demand for dial-up modems has declined, and the company has been trying to shift its focus to broadband and wireless technologies. The acquisition by 3Com will give U.S. Robotics the financial and technological resources it needs to make that transition successfully. 3Com, on the other hand, has been looking to expand its product offerings and enter new markets, and the acquisition of U.S. Robotics will enable it to do so rapidly. 
Industry experts also believe that the deal will be a significant challenge to Cisco. Although Cisco is currently the leader in the networking market, it has faced increasing competition in recent years from companies such as Alcatel, Lucent, and Nortel. The 3Com/U.S. Robotics merger will give those companies another formidable competitor, and could help to drive down prices in the market. 
"3Com is definitely a challenger to Cisco," said Scott Reynolds, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. "This acquisition will make them more of a competitor, particularly in areas like internet telephony, wireless networking, and broadband access."
However, some analysts are skeptical of the deal, saying that it may be too late for 3Com to catch up to Cisco. Cisco has a significant lead in the market, with more than 70% of the router market and about 60% of the switch market. In addition, Cisco has a strong brand and a large installed base of customers, which would be difficult for 3Com to replicate. 
"You can't just buy your way into the networking market," said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group. "It takes years to develop the kind of brand loyalty and customer base that Cisco has."
Despite these concerns, industry experts say that the 3Com/U.S. Robotics merger is a clear indication that the networking market is changing rapidly. As businesses increasingly rely on networks to transmit voice, video, and data, the competition between networking providers is likely to intensify. In addition, the growth in wireless and broadband technologies is creating new opportunities for companies in the networking space. 
"Networking is becoming the central nervous system of the economy," said Enderle. "The companies that provide the infrastructure for the network - like 3Com - are going to become increasingly important."
The 3Com/U.S. Robotics deal is expected to close in the second half of the year, pending regulatory approval. Once the transaction is completed, the combined company will have annual revenues of more than $8 billion and a workforce of approximately 20,000 employees.
