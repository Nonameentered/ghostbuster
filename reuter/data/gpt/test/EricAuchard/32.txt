In a controversial move, the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) has approved the $23 billion merger between telecommunications giants Nynex and Bell Atlantic. The PSC voted 3-2 in favor of the merger, despite protests and concerns from consumer groups.
The merger, which was announced in 1996, will create a new company called Verizon Communications Inc. The new company will serve over 100 million customers in the United States and will be the largest telecommunications company in the country.
Consumer groups protested the merger, arguing that it would create a monopoly in the telecommunications industry, leading to higher prices and reduced competition. The PSC has attempted to address these concerns by imposing a number of conditions on the merger.
Under the conditions, Verizon will have to invest $500 million in the state's telecommunications infrastructure to increase access to high-speed internet and expand broadband services in rural areas. The company will also have to create a low-cost service for low-income households and small businesses.
The PSC's decision was met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the merger argue that it will bring benefits to consumers and the economy in New York State. They point out that the new company will be able to offer new services and invest in new technologies, which will benefit consumers in the long run.
Opponents of the merger, however, are disappointed with the decision. They argue that the conditions imposed by the PSC do not go far enough in protecting consumers and promoting competition in the telecommunications industry.
"Some of the conditions are positive, but overall, we're disappointed with the ruling," said Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group. "We believe that the merger will lead to higher prices and reduced competition, and the conditions don't do enough to address those concerns."
Verizon has also expressed its disappointment with the conditions imposed by the PSC. In a statement, the company said that it believed the conditions were unnecessary and would place an undue burden on the company.
"We are disappointed with the conditions imposed by the PSC," the statement read. "We believe that the merger will provide significant benefits to consumers and the economy in New York State, and we are committed to meeting the conditions imposed by the PSC."
The merger has been subject to regulatory scrutiny for several years, with a number of conditions imposed by state and federal authorities. In addition to the conditions imposed by the PSC, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required Verizon to sell some of its assets to other telecommunications companies to promote competition in the industry.
Despite the concerns raised by consumer groups and the conditions imposed by regulators, the merger is expected to move forward. The creation of Verizon Communications Inc. will create a new era in the telecommunications industry, bringing together two of the largest companies in the U.S.
The merger is expected to have a significant impact on the telecommunications industry, as well as consumers and the economy in New York State. While some are optimistic about the future of the new company, others remain skeptical about the impact of the merger on consumers and competition in the industry.
