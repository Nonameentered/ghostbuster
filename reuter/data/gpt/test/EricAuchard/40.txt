Philadelphia, PA -- Bell Atlantic Corp. announced on Thursday that it had a strong first-quarter earnings report, as its telephone and cellular businesses boosted its profits. The company reported a net income of $3.3 billion or $1.04 per share, an increase of 12% compared to the same quarter last year.
The telecommunications company said that its revenues from wireline services increased by 2.1% to $6.2 billion, while wireless revenue grew by 5.2% to $7.5 billion. In addition, Bell Atlantic's broadband services generated $33 million in sales, an increase of 14.6%.

"Our wireless business remains a strong growth engine for us, and we continue to build on that momentum with investments in our network and by offering innovative new services that meet the needs of our customers," Seidenberg said.
