Computer Associates International Inc. (CA) has recently experienced an unexpected decline in its mainframe computer revenues, leading to a drop of over 6% in the company’s stock price. The American multinational corporation, specializing in information technology management software, announced the decrease in revenue during its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday.
According to the report, CA’s mainframe computer revenues dropped by 8% in comparison to the previous year, which is an unforeseen decrease compared to the consistent growth the company has experienced in recent years. The company’s total revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 2% from the same period last year. However, the drop in mainframe computer revenues has affected the stock price, which rapidly fell 6.4% to a low of $68.90.
The sudden decrease in revenue has left investors worried about the future of the company and its ability to maintain profits in an increasingly competitive market. CA has been one of the largest players in the mainframe computer business but has faced stiff competition in recent years from companies such as IBM and Oracle.
"After several quarters of solid growth, we experienced an unexpected decline in our mainframe business driven primarily by fewer large deals than we expected," said Mike Gregoire, CA CEO. “We are taking proactive steps to address this and remain confident that our business model and market position will enable us to continue to deliver strong results over the long term."
Analysts have also noted the decline in mainframe computer revenues and have suggested that CA needs to focus on diversifying its product offerings in order to compete with other industry players. The company is looking to invest in newer areas of technology such as AI, machine learning and cybersecurity. CA’s management team has also indicated that they will be taking proactive steps to drive growth in the company’s existing businesses and explore new business opportunities.
The unexpected decline in mainframe computer revenues has caused some concern amongst investors, but the company’s management team is confident that they will be able to address the issue and continue to deliver strong results in the long run.
