Online communities have grown exponentially in the past few years, and with it, advertising has emerged as a primary source of revenue for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Now, America Online (AOL), one of the oldest and most successful internet companies in the United States, is joining the fray. The company is planning to monetize its chat rooms by placing advertisements in them.
AOL has been around since 1985, and for a long time, the company was synonymous with dial-up internet. However, with the rise of broadband, AOL's subscriber base began to decline, and the company has had to adapt. In recent years, the company has focused on becoming a media and advertising company. AOL owns popular websites like The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, Engadget, and others.
Now, AOL is looking to expand its advertising business to include its chat rooms. The company currently operates several chat rooms, including ones for sports teams, music genres, and movies. These chat rooms attract a diverse group of people who are passionate about specific topics.
In an interview with CNBC, Tim Armstrong, CEO of AOL, said, "We're the only company in the world that has a permission-based chat community that's high-scale, and we think the advertising opportunity is really significant." Armstrong added that the company was testing different ad formats, including ones that would allow advertisers to interact directly with chat room users.
AOL's chat rooms are not new, but the company has not monetized them before. Instead, AOL has relied on subscription fees for revenue. However, as the internet has evolved, subscription models have become less popular, and advertising has become the primary source of revenue for many online businesses. AOL's decision to place ads in its chat rooms is a sign that the company is looking to diversify its revenue streams.
According to eMarketer, the US digital advertising market is expected to reach $130 billion in 2019. By placing ads in its chat rooms, AOL can tap into this huge market and increase its advertising revenue. Advertising in chat rooms is not a new concept, but it is one that has not been widely adopted. By being one of the first major companies to do so, AOL can potentially gain a competitive advantage.
However, placing ads in chat rooms can be tricky. Chat rooms are often viewed as private spaces where people can talk freely without being interrupted by ads. If AOL does not handle the ads properly, it could alienate its chat room users, who might feel like their conversations are being invaded.
AOL is aware of this risk and is taking steps to address it. In a blog post, the company said, "We're also being careful with how we introduce ads to chat room users. We want to ensure that the ads are relevant and don't detract from the chat experience." AOL is also testing different ad formats to see what works best.
Overall, AOL's decision to place ads in its chat rooms is a smart move. The company has a large, engaged user base that advertisers will be eager to reach. By expanding its revenue streams beyond subscription fees, AOL is ensuring that it remains relevant and competitive in the years to come. However, the company must be careful not to alienate its chat room users in the pursuit of more advertising revenue. If AOL can strike the right balance between ads and user experience, it could become a model for other companies looking to monetize their online communities.
