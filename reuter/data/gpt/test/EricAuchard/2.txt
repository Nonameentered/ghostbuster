"We understand the importance of complying with local tax regulations and we take our tax responsibilities very seriously," said Sullivan. "We believe that by having a strong tax governance framework and investing in the right technology and processes, we can ensure that we remain compliant and avoid any unnecessary tax liabilities."
Sullivan also addressed concerns about NCR's profitability goals. The company has traditionally focused on providing hardware and software solutions for the financial services industry, but has recently expanded into other areas such as retail and hospitality.

"We are committed to driving operational excellence across the organization," said Sullivan. "We believe that by optimizing our operations and reducing costs, we can improve our profitability and continue to invest in our strategic initiatives."
Analysts on the call were generally positive about NCR's plans, but some expressed concerns about the company's ability to execute on its growth strategy given the competitive landscape.
Sullivan acknowledged that the market is highly competitive, but he emphasized that NCR has a strong track record of innovation and a deep understanding of its customers' needs.
"We have been in business for over 135 years and have a long history of innovation," said Sullivan. "We believe that our deep industry expertise and our focus on customer-centric solutions will enable us to succeed in today's rapidly changing business environment."
Overall, the conference call provided valuable insights into NCR's efforts to address tax issues and achieve its profitability goals. While there are challenges ahead, the company's strong leadership and strategic initiatives give reason for optimism about its long-term prospects.
