The merger promises to be a game-changer for both companies. U.S. Robotics brings to the table a significant customer base of small and medium-sized businesses and home users, while 3Com offers industry-leading networking products such as switches, routers, and wireless solutions. Together, they aim to provide an end-to-end networking solution, from the modem and broadband connection to the devices that run on the network.

"By combining our strengths, we can provide a complete end-to-end solution that meets the evolving needs of small businesses and home consumers."
The companies plan to leverage U.S. Robotics' strong modem and broadband reputation to gain market share in the small business and home markets. These markets are growing rapidly, driven by increased demand for high-speed internet and connected devices. As more businesses and homes rely on the internet for essential functions, the need for reliable and secure networking solutions becomes more critical.
"U.S. Robotics' leadership in the modem and broadband markets provides us with an excellent opportunity to expand our reach and provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers," said Murray. "We are excited about the potential to bring our industry-leading networking technology to a broader range of customers."
The merger is expected to generate significant synergies and cost savings for both companies. By combining operations and streamlining processes, they hope to reduce operating expenses and increase efficiency. This will enable them to focus on accelerating growth and innovation in their core markets.
"We are confident that this merger will create a stronger, more competitive company that can better serve its customers and drive long-term value for shareholders," said Murray. "We look forward to working with the talented team at U.S. Robotics to bring our vision of connected and collaborative networks to a broader range of customers."
The acquisition comes at a time when both companies are experiencing strong growth. 3Com has been expanding its presence in the enterprise market, while U.S. Robotics has been focused on providing innovative modem and broadband solutions to small businesses and consumers. The merger will enable them to combine their complementary strengths and accelerate their growth in new markets.
In conclusion, the merger between 3Com and U.S. Robotics promises to be a boon for the small business and home markets. By bringing together their respective strengths, they aim to provide a complete end-to-end networking solution that meets the needs of their customers.
