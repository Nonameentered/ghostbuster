AT&T Profits Fall 17% in Q1, Warns of Weak Q2 Results; BellSouth Shows Strong Q1 Growth
AT&T, the American telecommunications giant, has posted a 17% drop in profits for Q1 2021, as the company continues to struggle with the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has warned of weak Q2 results as well, as the pandemic and its economic fallout continue to impact the telecom industry.
According to AT&T's latest financial report, the company reported earnings of $0.86 per share for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $1.04 per share in the same period last year. This marked a decline of 17.3%, and also missed analysts' estimates of $0.88 per share.
Revenue for the quarter was $43.9 billion, which was up 2.7% compared to the same period last year. However, this also fell short of analysts' expectations of $44.5 billion.
The poor performance was largely attributed to the slowdown in AT&T's wireless business, which was hit hard by the pandemic. The company said that its wireless net additions were down 58% year-over-year, and that postpaid phone net adds declined by 338,000.
AT&T's WarnerMedia division also saw a decline, with total segment revenues falling by 8.5% to $7.8 billion. This was attributed to the delay of several movie releases due to the pandemic, which affected both box office revenues and HBO Max streaming subscriptions.
However, the company's broadband and video business saw growth, with total broadband revenues up 4.8% and total video revenues up 2.0%.
Despite the weak Q1 results, AT&T maintained its full-year guidance, projecting revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits and adjusted earnings per share to be stable with 2020 levels.
However, the company warned that Q2 results could be weak, citing ongoing pandemic-related challenges. "The lingering effects of the pandemic are causing further reductions in business activity and mobility, which are expected to negatively impact our wireless service revenues and subscriber volumes, particularly in the second quarter," said CEO John Stankey.
Additionally, the company said that it expected to see a revenue decline in its Entertainment Group, which includes its linear video services, as more customers switch to digital video.
AT&T's weak Q1 performance was in stark contrast to BellSouth, the Atlanta-based telecom company that is partly owned by AT&T. BellSouth reported a strong Q1 2021, with operating revenues of $4.4 billion, up 2.3% from the same period last year.
The company attributed its strong results to growth in its fiber and fixed wireless business, with net broadband additions up 26% year-over-year.
BellSouth also reported strong growth in its business segment, with operating revenues up 2.8% to $2.2 billion. The company said that this was driven by increased demand for wireless and IP-based services.
BellSouth's performance was a bright spot for AT&T, which has struggled to maintain growth in recent years. The company has been under pressure to reduce its debt load, which has ballooned to over $150 billion in recent years.
AT&T has also faced challenges in its media business, with the failure of its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner and ongoing struggles at its WarnerMedia division.
The company has been surging forward with plans to spin off WarnerMedia into a separate company, a move that is expected to be completed in mid-2022. However, some analysts are concerned that this move may not be enough to jumpstart growth at AT&T, which still faces a challenging wireless market and intense competition from rivals Verizon and T-Mobile.
Nevertheless, the company remains focused on its long-term growth prospects, with Stankey saying that AT&T is "confident in our ability to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value as we continue to invest in our network, our customer experience, and our media and entertainment offerings."
