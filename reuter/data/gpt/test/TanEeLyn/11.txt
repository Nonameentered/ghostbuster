China and Britain have reached an agreement to station Chinese troops in Hong Kong for 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty back to China on July 1, 1997. The agreement is seen as a compromise between the two countries’ differing views on the issue.
China, which has long considered Hong Kong to be a part of its territory, was initially opposed to the presence of foreign troops in the region. However, Britain, the former colonial power in Hong Kong, argued that the presence of its troops was necessary to ensure the protection of the territory’s citizens and the rule of law.
Under the agreement, China will station 10,000 troops in Hong Kong, which will be reduced to 6,000 by 2001. The troops will be responsible for defense and will not be involved in law enforcement or internal security matters. Britain, which has been responsible for Hong Kong’s defense since 1841, will withdraw its troops from the territory by the time of the handover.
The agreement has been welcomed by both China and Britain. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen called it “an important achievement,” while British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said it was “a significant step forward.”
However, the two countries remain divided over the issue of residency rights for Hong Kong residents after the handover. China has proposed that all Hong Kong residents will be granted Chinese nationality after the handover, while Britain has suggested that a system of British nationality be retained for those who wish to maintain their ties with Britain.
The issue of residency rights is of particular concern to Hong Kong’s large community of ethnic Chinese who hold British passports and fear they will lose their right to live and work in the UK after the handover.
Britain has also expressed concern over the future of Hong Kong’s legal system after the handover. The territory’s legal system is based on British common law and is widely seen as a model of judicial independence and impartiality.
China has pledged to maintain the legal system, but some experts have raised doubts over whether this can be guaranteed given China’s record on human rights and the rule of law.
The issue of Hong Kong’s future has been a source of tension between China and Britain for many years. Britain first acquired Hong Kong as a result of the First Opium War in 1841 and gradually expanded its control over the territory until it was returned to China in 1997.
Since then, China has implemented a “one country, two systems” policy in which Hong Kong is allowed to retain a high degree of autonomy and its own legal and economic systems. However, there are concerns over the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy in recent years, with the disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers and the alleged interference of the Chinese government in Hong Kong’s affairs.
The agreement on Chinese troops in Hong Kong is seen as a positive step towards the transfer of sovereignty, but the issue of residency rights and the future of Hong Kong’s legal system is likely to be a source of ongoing tension between China and Britain.
