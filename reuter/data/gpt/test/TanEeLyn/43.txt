Publisher and Activists Release Compilation of Letters and Essays by Chinese Dissident Wei Jingsheng, Sparking Anger from Beijing
A new compilation of letters and essays by Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng has been released, sparking anger from the Chinese government. The collection, entitled "Holding Up Half the Sky: Selected Letters and Essays by Wei Jingsheng," was published by Human Rights Watch, PEN America, and Open Society Foundations on Wednesday.
Wei, now 67 years old, is one of China's most prominent democracy activists. He first gained notoriety in 1979 for his writings advocating for political reform, including his famous essay "The Fifth Modernization," which called for democracy as a necessary component of China's modernization efforts. He was subsequently arrested in 1979 and spent the next 18 years in prison, during which time he became an icon of the pro-democracy movement, both within China and abroad.
Since his release from prison in 1997, Wei has continued to speak out against the Chinese government's human rights abuses and call for democratic reforms. He has also become a prominent supporter of other dissidents, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in custody in 2017.
The new compilation includes a selection of Wei's letters and essays from the past four decades, providing a comprehensive overview of his political views and activism. The book is edited by Perry Link, a professor of Chinese language and literature at the University of California at Riverside, who has known Wei for over 40 years and served as his translator on many occasions.
In a statement accompanying the release of the book, Human Rights Watch's China director Sophie Richardson said, "Wei Jingsheng's ideas and bravery inspire many Chinese activists and human rights defenders to this day. His writing highlights the courageous voices that fight against authoritarianism and advocate for political change in China."
However, the Chinese government has been quick to denounce the book, with the country's foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian calling it a "malicious attack on China's political system and other major issues." He also accused the book's publishers of being "anti-China forces" and attempting to "undermine China's stability and development."
The Chinese state media has also been critical of the book, with official newspaper Global Times publishing an editorial on Thursday calling Wei a "criminal" and accusing him of "harming China's national security and the overall interest of the Chinese people."
The release of the book comes at a time of heightened tension between China and the West, particularly over issues of human rights and political freedoms. Many countries, including the US, have recently imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over their treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, while protests in Hong Kong have also sparked international concern.
In response to the Chinese government's criticism of the book, editor Perry Link told The Guardian, "It's easy for Chinese officials to denounce Wei Jingsheng, but that does not change the fact that he was a leading figure in China's pro-democracy movement and influential among Chinese intellectuals, whose own human rights are being suppressed every day."
The book has been released in both Chinese and English, and is available for purchase online and in select bookstores. Despite the Chinese government's accusations of anti-China sentiment, the book has received widespread support from human rights groups and democracy activists around the world.
