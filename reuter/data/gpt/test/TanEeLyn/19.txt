The luxury property market in Hong Kong is going through a phase of consolidation before a Q3 recovery, according to experts. Real estate analysts and experts have predicted that the market will experience a period of consolidation before it picks up again in Q3.
Hong Kong has long been considered one of the most desired property markets in the world, with soaring prices that have continued to rise year after year, making it a hotspot for investors. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the real estate market all over the world, and Hong Kong is no exception.
The pandemic has brought a great deal of uncertainty to the luxury property market in Hong Kong, with many investors and buyers now weighing their options more carefully before making a purchase. With global economies facing significant challenges, buyers are expecting more favorable conditions before investing, and the property market in Hong Kong is no exception.
Experts believe that the consolidation period will bring about a much-needed correction in the market, rebalancing the demand and supply of homes. The oversupply problem in the market is one of the major reasons for the prices being stagnant, said experts.
"Prices have hit a ceiling. We are in a phase of consolidation, and prices are not likely to go up. The oversupply of homes in the market is one of the reasons for stagnation," said a real estate analyst.
The experts further opined that buyers will eventually return to the market, but the purchase decisions would be more cautious and selective. Buyers will focus on what they actually need and invest in properties that offer good value at the right price, said experts.
Several changes in the regulatory environment have also played a significant role in the consolidation process, according to real estate experts. The recent announcement of the new national security law, which will come into effect in just a few weeks, has led to a sense of uncertainty amongst buyers, and is likely to impact the market.
However, experts believe that the imposition of the national security law will not be a significant deterrent for the luxury property market. They believe that the market will gradually recover in the coming months, and prices will pick up pace by Q3.
The government's initiatives to stimulate the property market are beginning to bear fruit, as seen in the recent rebound in property sales in May 2020, which increased month-on-month by nearly 40%.
"The government's measures to moderate the pressures on the housing market have been effective and have already led to a surge in property sales over the past few months. The luxury property market is no exception and is expected to rebound in a matter of weeks," said a real estate investment consultant.
Overall, the experts believe that the luxury property market in Hong Kong is going through a crucial consolidation phase that is expected to set the stage for a robust market recovery in the coming months. The market once stabilized, will open up opportunities for buyers looking for long-term investment in Hong Kong luxury property.
