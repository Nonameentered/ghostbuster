The future of Hong Kong seems bleak as a majority of its newly-elected lawmakers pledge their support to Beijing-backed plans that aim to dilute civil liberties of the territory. The move is viewed as a heavy blow to the pro-democracy movement and could mean large-scale changes in Hong Kong's legislative landscape.
For years, Hong Kong has been a centre for political activism and free speech, mainly because of its autonomy under the "One Country, Two Systems" policy. However, the Chinese government has been chipping away at Hong Kong's freedoms, and the new national security law enacted in June 2020 has significantly curbed political expression in the territory.
Now, with future lawmakers backing Beijing's revisions to the Basic Law, Hong Kong's constitution, there are growing concerns that the city's freedom and autonomy may be entirely stripped away. Many pro-democracy activists fear that the proposed amendments will serve to suffocate any opposition or dissenting voices and curb the right to protest.
These proposed reforms first surfaced in a statement released by the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) in November 2020. The statement outlined several proposed changes concerning Hong Kong's electoral system, which the Hong Kong government has agreed to consider.
According to the NPCSC statement, the proposed changes aim to improve the nominating committee system that selects Hong Kong's chief executive, lawmakers, and other key officials. They also propose changes to the composition of the Legislative Council, expanding its size and giving a greater say to patriotic organisations.
The current Legislative Council has 70 seats, with half of them directly elected and the rest chosen by various interest groups. However, the proposed revisions would increase the number of seats to 90, with 40 reserved for members of the Election Committee and 30 for District Council seats.
Under the proposed amendments, the Election Committee, which ensures that only "patriots" hold public office in Hong Kong, would become bigger and more influential. The National Security Law defines patriots as those who love China, respect the People's Republic of China, and do not endanger Chinese national security.
Critics of the proposed changes argue that they are designed to curb the power of opposition parties and stamp out political dissent, as the new rules would make it harder for pro-democracy candidates to get elected. While the city's lead executive, Carrie Lam, has defended the reforms, saying they would ensure that Hong Kong's political landscape is made up of "patriots," many believe the changes would suffocate any opposition or dissent in the territory.
The new proposals have further intensified the already tense relationship between China and the US. The US already imposed trade sanctions on Chinese officials in response to the implementation of the national security law. With the proposed rule changes threatening Hong Kong's autonomy, the US is expected to take a more hardline stance against Beijing.
As the world looks on as events in Hong Kong unfold, many have criticised the lack of intervention by the international community. Advocates of democracy have called on democratic nations to stand up in defense of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms and hold China accountable for violating Hong Kong's Basic Law.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has expressed concern about the proposed changes, with member states calling on China to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties. Moreover, the UK government has offered citizenship to millions of Hong Kong citizens in response to the clampdown in the territory.
In conclusion, the future of Hong Kong hangs in the balance as the government considers the proposed changes to the Basic Law. With a majority of future lawmakers backing Beijing's plans, the independence and autonomy of Hong Kong may be threatened. The international community must continue to monitor the situation closely, hold China accountable for its actions, and ensure that the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong's citizens are protected.
