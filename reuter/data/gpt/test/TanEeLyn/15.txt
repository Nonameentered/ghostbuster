Hong Kong's Future Leader Tung Chee-hwa faces mounting woes before Handover to China
As Hong Kong prepares to hand over its sovereignty to China on July 1, many in the city wonder what the future holds. Amidst mounting tension, Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa is facing a growing number of challenges, not least of which is the question of how to appease the city's pro-democracy protesters.
Tung Chee-hwa was chosen by China to lead the city after the Handover, but his leadership has been anything but smooth. His main challenge has been the city's pro-democracy movement, which has been agitating for greater autonomy from China. The movement has grown increasingly vocal in its demands, and many believe that Tung Chee-hwa's hands are tied when it comes to the question of Hong Kong's future.
The protesters argue that Hong Kong should be allowed to develop its own political system, separate from China's authoritarian regime. They have also called for the release of those arrested during the recent pro-democracy protests, which were often met with violent police crackdowns.
Despite the mounting pressure, Tung Chee-hwa has remained steadfast in his commitment to the "one country, two systems" policy, which guarantees Hong Kong a certain degree of autonomy from China. However, he has also made it clear that he will not tolerate any attempts to undermine China's authority over the city.
Another major challenge facing Tung Chee-hwa is the city's faltering economy. Hong Kong's economy has been in decline for several years now, and many blame the city's over-reliance on the financial sector. Tung Chee-hwa has promised to diversify the city's economy and to create new opportunities for young people, but it remains to be seen whether he will be able to deliver on these promises.
The future leader also faces challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic that is ravaging the world. The pandemic hit Hong Kong late and has led to a lowered GDP, which has left many businesses struggling. Tung Chee-hwa has promised to ramp up the city's vaccination program and to keep businesses afloat, but these promises are yet to be fulfilled.
As Tung Chee-hwa struggles with these challenges, many in Hong Kong wonder whether he is up to the task of leading the city through this challenging period. Despite his assurances, there are concerns that he may be too closely aligned with China to be an effective leader for Hong Kong.
Nonetheless, Tung Chee-hwa remains committed to his vision for the city and has promised to work tirelessly to ensure its continued success. As Hong Kong faces an uncertain future under Chinese rule, the challenges faced by Tung Chee-hwa will likely only become more daunting in the months and years to come.
