Hong Kong activists gathered outside the Japanese Consulate on Saturday to condemn the landing of Japanese nationalists on the disputed Diaoyu Islands, known in Japan as the Senkaku Islands, located in the East China Sea. Protesters accused Japan of territorial aggression and called for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing dispute.
Tensions between China and Japan over the Diaoyu Islands have been simmering for decades, but have escalated in recent years as China has grown more assertive in asserting its territorial claims. The islands are situated near rich fishing grounds and possible oil and gas reserves, making them a highly valuable asset.
Earlier this week, a group of Japanese nationalists landed on one of the islands, sparking outrage from Chinese officials and activists. China claims that the Diaoyu Islands have been part of its territory for centuries, and accuses Japan of illegally occupying them since the 1970s.
In response to the landing, Hong Kong activists organized a demonstration outside the Japanese Consulate in the city's central business district. Protesters carried signs and shouted slogans denouncing Japanese aggression and calling for the islands to be returned to Chinese control.
"Japan has no right to the Diaoyu Islands. They belong to China, and we will not allow Japan to continue its illegal occupation," said one protester, who identified herself only as Sally.
Others voiced concerns about the potential for military conflict between China and Japan over the disputed islands. "We don't want war. We want peace. Japan needs to respect China's sovereignty and work towards a peaceful settlement," said another protester, who gave her name as Rose.
The protest comes amid a growing wave of anti-Japanese sentiment in China, fueled by memories of Japan's brutal occupation of China during World War II and ongoing territorial disputes in the East China Sea. Chinese officials have also been vocal in their criticism of Japan's recent military expansion and efforts to build up its navy and air force.
The dispute over the Diaoyu Islands is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, but activists in Hong Kong and elsewhere remain committed to raising awareness about the issue and advocating for a peaceful solution. As tensions continue to simmer in the region, the stakes are high for all sides involved.
