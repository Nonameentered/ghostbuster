In recent years, Chinese "red chip" stocks have been a popular investment choice among many investors due to their high potential returns. Red chip stocks refer to stocks of Chinese companies incorporated outside of the country but listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. However, a senior economist has warned of the risky nature of these stocks, particularly in light of the poor health of mainland state-owned companies.
State-owned companies (SOEs) make up a significant portion of China's economy, with sectors such as energy, telecommunications, and banking dominated by these companies. However, many SOEs have been struggling with debt, low profitability, and overcapacity, leading to concerns about China's financial stability.
"We are seeing a trend of SOEs expanding their operations into overseas markets, including Hong Kong. While this may seem like a positive development, it also raises concerns about the financial risks posed by these companies," said the senior economist.
According to data from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the bad debt ratio of SOEs was 8.5% at the end of 2020, compared to 1.5% for private companies. This indicates that SOEs are more likely to default on their loans, which could have serious repercussions for investors.
The senior economist also pointed out that red chip stocks are often owned by Chinese SOEs, which means that investors are indirectly exposed to the risks of these companies. "Red chip stocks are not immune to the financial troubles faced by their parent companies. In fact, they may be even more vulnerable, as they are often smaller and less diversified than the state-owned companies they are linked to."
The warning comes after a series of high-profile scandals involving Chinese red chip stocks in recent years. In 2018, shares of Chinese technology giant ZTE plummeted after the US government imposed a seven-year ban on American companies selling components to the company. This was due to allegations that ZTE had violated US sanctions against North Korea and Iran.
Similarly, in 2019, shares of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi dropped after the company was accused of violating US sanctions on Iran. While the company denied any wrongdoing, the incident highlighted the risks of investing in red chip stocks.
"To invest in red chip stocks, investors must carefully evaluate the financial health of the companies behind these stocks. This includes looking at their debt levels, profitability, and management quality," said the senior economist.
He added that investors should also be aware of the geopolitical risks associated with investing in Chinese stocks, given the current tensions between the US and China. "We have seen how political tensions can lead to trade restrictions and other measures that hurt the financial performance of Chinese companies."
Despite these warnings, red chip stocks continue to be popular among investors who are looking for high potential returns. However, the senior economist advises investors to exercise caution and carefully assess the risks before taking the plunge.
