Hong Kong, China - The British Army has officially packed up its studio in Hong Kong ahead of the city's handover to China later this week.
The studio, known as "Hong Kong Forces Broadcasting Service" (HKFBS), was established in 1954 and has been broadcasting news and entertainment programs to British troops stationed in Hong Kong.
With the handover of the city to China on July 1, the British Army has decided to close down the service and withdraw its military personnel from the area.
"Due to the end of UK sovereign responsibility for Hong Kong, the British Army will no longer be required to provide services such as HKFBS," said Lieutenant Colonel Tim Purbrick, Director of Army Communications.
"The studio has served an important role in keeping British soldiers and their families informed and entertained during their time in Hong Kong. However, as part of the handover agreement, it is time for the British Army to leave and let the people of Hong Kong determine their own future."
The closure of HKFBS has been met with mixed reactions from the British and Hong Kong communities.
Some British troops who served in Hong Kong have expressed nostalgia for the service, with one former soldier saying that "it was an important link to home while we were stationed so far away."
However, some Hong Kong residents have criticized the move, claiming that the closure of HKFBS is a symbol of the declining influence of the UK in the region.
"The closure of HKFBS is a sad reminder that Hong Kong was once a British colony, and now it is no longer," said pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong.
Others are optimistic about the future and see the handover as a chance for Hong Kong to define its own identity.
"This is a historic moment for Hong Kong, and while we appreciate the contributions of the British Army and HKFBS, it is time for us to move forward and shape our own future," said local businessman Peter Cheung.
With the departure of the British Army from Hong Kong, the city is set to undergo a major political and cultural shift as it transitions to Chinese rule. For many, the closure of HKFBS signals the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in Hong Kong's history.
