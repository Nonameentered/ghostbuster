The Chinese army’s advance party arrived in Hong Kong on Sunday ahead of what is expected to be a controversial transfer of power to Beijing. The arrival of the troops has sparked fears of a crackdown on democracy in the semi-autonomous territory, which has been rocked by months of pro-democracy protests.
The Chinese army’s advance party is responsible for logistics and protocol preparations ahead of the transfer of power scheduled for Tuesday. The troops will be stationed at the People’s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong.
The transfer of power is set to take place on July 1, marking the 23rd anniversary of the former British colony’s return to Chinese control. However, this year’s transfer of power is likely to be more contentious than previous years, as the Chinese government seeks to exert greater control over Hong Kong.
The Chinese government’s controversial national security law, which was imposed on Hong Kong last month, has sparked widespread protests. The law criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, and has been criticized as a tool to suppress political dissent.
Some analysts have suggested that the presence of the Chinese army in Hong Kong could be used to quell any protests that may arise in the coming days. Hong Kong’s police force has already stepped up security measures, with checkpoints and barricades erected around key government buildings.
Pro-democracy activists have voiced concerns that the Chinese army’s presence in Hong Kong could lead to a repeat of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, in which Chinese troops opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.
“This is a very challenging moment for Hong Kong,” said Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist. “The Chinese army’s presence is a clear sign that Beijing is determined to crack down on our democracy movement.”
Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, has sought to allay fears that the Chinese army will interfere in Hong Kong’s affairs. In a televised speech on Monday, Lam said that the Chinese army’s presence was “routine” and that the troops were there to support local authorities.
“The Hong Kong government will continue to defend our way of life, our freedoms, and our rights in accordance with the law,” she said.
However, Lam’s assurances have done little to assuage fears among pro-democracy activists, who have called for mass protests on Tuesday to mark the transfer of power. Groups such as the Civil Human Rights Front have organized rallies and marches across the territory, despite calls from the police to cancel the events due to concerns over public safety.
The international community has also weighed in on the situation in Hong Kong. The United Kingdom has offered a pathway to citizenship for up to three million residents of the territory, while the United States has announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials responsible for the implementation of the national security law.
In a statement on Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the Chinese government’s actions in Hong Kong.
“The United States condemns China’s decision to impose the national security law on Hong Kong,” he said. “We will continue to take action to hold accountable those involved in extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom.”
The Hong Kong government has accused the US of interfering in its internal affairs, and has criticized the visa restrictions as “barbaric and rude.”
As Hong Kong prepares for the transfer of power, the world watches with bated breath. The Chinese army’s presence has heightened tensions in the territory, where pro-democracy protesters have vowed to continue their fight for freedom and democracy. With the eyes of the world on Hong Kong, the coming days are sure to be fraught with tension, as the battle for democracy in the territory continues.
