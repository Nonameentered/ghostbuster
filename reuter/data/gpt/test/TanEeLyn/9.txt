Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region in China, has warned Beijing against enacting any new laws that could threaten the city's freedoms, ahead of the 20th anniversary of the 1997 British handover of the territory to China.
The warning, issued by Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, comes as China's ruling Communist Party prepares to celebrate the anniversary of the handover on July 1. Lam said that any attempt to change Hong Kong's laws without the consent of the people could undermine the territory's autonomy and would be met with resistance.
"We have always respected the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle," Lam told reporters in Hong Kong on Wednesday. "I hope the central authorities can respect this principle and refrain from taking actions that could affect Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy."
Under the "One Country, Two Systems" principle, Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy, including a separate legal and economic system, as well as civil liberties that are not enjoyed in mainland China. However, concerns have been raised in recent years about Beijing's growing influence over the region.
Lam's warning comes as China's parliament is expected to pass a new law that would make it a criminal offense to insult the Chinese national anthem. Critics say the law, which would be enforced in Hong Kong as well as mainland China, is a violation of free speech and could be used to suppress dissent.
Lam said that while she supports the national anthem law, she also believes that Hong Kong should have the right to draft its own laws. "This is a matter of principle and we don't want to see any infringement on our rights and freedoms," she said.
The warning also comes amid growing tensions between China and the United States over trade and North Korea. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, and has accused China of not doing enough to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
Some analysts believe that Beijing may use Hong Kong as a bargaining chip in its negotiations with Washington. "China could use Hong Kong to show that it is willing to compromise on some issues, while maintaining its overall position on trade and North Korea," said Joseph Cheng, a political analyst at City University of Hong Kong.
However, others say that Beijing is unlikely to make any major concessions on Hong Kong, as it sees the territory as a crucial part of its "red line" in relations with the West. "For China, Hong Kong is not just a city, it is a symbol of its legitimacy as a great power," said Willy Lam, an expert on Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Despite the warning, Lam said that she remains committed to maintaining Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub and a gateway to China. "We have a lot to offer the world, and we are determined to continue to build on our strengths," she said.
The warning also comes as Hong Kong marks the anniversary of the pro-democracy protests of 2014, known as the "Umbrella Revolution." Thousands of people took to the streets to demand greater democracy and civil liberties, but the movement was met with a violent crackdown by police and security forces.
Some activists say that the warning from Lam is too little, too late, and that Hong Kong's autonomy has already been eroded. "We need to be vigilant and demand that our rights and freedoms are protected," said Joshua Wong, one of the leaders of the Umbrella Revolution. "We cannot allow Beijing to destroy the one thing that makes us unique."
