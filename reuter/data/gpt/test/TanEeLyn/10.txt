Hong Kong's colonial government has issued a stern warning to Beijing not to enact any laws for the territory before the handover, amid concerns that the city's unique identity and freedom could be jeopardized. The warning comes as the Chinese government prepares to take control of the former British colony on July 1, 2022, under the "One Country, Two Systems" framework.
In a statement released on Wednesday, Hong Kong's colonial government urged Beijing to "respect Hong Kong's tradition of the rule of law and the existing legal institutions." The statement also called on Beijing to "refrain from imposing any laws that may jeopardize Hong Kong's status as an international city and its unique way of life."
The warning comes as Beijing reportedly prepares to enact a national security law for Hong Kong, which has been met with widespread international criticism. Critics say the law could be used to crack down on dissent and undermine the city's pro-democracy movement, which has been a thorn in Beijing's side for years.
"If Beijing goes ahead with this national security law, it would be a serious blow to Hong Kong's autonomy and to the rule of law," said Michael Davis, a professor of law and international affairs at the University of Hong Kong. "It would be a clear signal that Beijing is not respecting the principle of 'One Country, Two Systems' and that Hong Kong is no longer a separate entity under Chinese sovereignty."
The statement from the colonial government also comes as Hong Kong prepares for its own election on Sunday, which will elect a new legislative council. The election has been marred by controversy and accusations of suppression, with several pro-democracy candidates barred from running. Amnesty International has called for the election to be postponed due to concerns over COVID-19.
"The government has been using the pandemic as an excuse to suppress the opposition and silence dissent," said Lam Cheuk-ting, a pro-democracy lawmaker who was ousted from office in 2019. "This election will be a test of whether Hong Kong people still have the right to choose their own representatives and whether we still have a functioning democracy."
The tension between Beijing and Hong Kong has been brewing for years, with pro-democracy protests erupting in 2014 and again in 2019, which saw violent clashes between protesters and police. The protests were sparked by a proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China, which many Hong Kongers saw as an erosion of their freedoms and a threat to their autonomy.
Despite the backlash, the proposal was eventually passed by the Hong Kong government, but the protests have continued to rage on. The upcoming election is seen as a crucial test of support for the pro-democracy movement, which is calling for greater autonomy and democracy for the territory.
As Hong Kong prepares for the handover, Beijing has been ramping up its rhetoric, warning that it will not tolerate any challenges to its authority, and that it has the right to use force to maintain order. The warning from Hong Kong's colonial government is seen as an attempt to push back against Beijing's aggressive stance and protect the city's autonomy and unique identity.
"This is a critical moment for Hong Kong," said Davis. "The city is at a crossroads, and the decisions made in the coming months and years will determine whether Hong Kong remains a vibrant, international city as it has been for decades, or whether it becomes just another Chinese city under the thumb of Beijing."
