Hong Kong â€“ A second wave of Chinese soldiers arrived in Hong Kong on Monday, ahead of the city's handover from the United Kingdom to China. The soldiers arrived just a few days after the first wave of troops landed in the territory, which has been under British rule since 1842.
The soldiers were welcomed by officials from China's Central Military Commission and by local officials from the Hong Kong government. They were then transported to various locations across the city, including the headquarters of the Hong Kong Garrison of the People's Liberation Army.
The arrival of the second wave of troops is another sign that the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China is drawing closer. The handover will take place at midnight on June 30, 1997, when Britain's 99-year lease on the territory expires.
According to the Joint Declaration signed by China and the UK in 1984, Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative Region of China, with a high degree of autonomy and its own legal system. The soldiers are being sent to Hong Kong to protect Chinese sovereignty and maintain stability during the transition period.
The deployment of Chinese troops in Hong Kong has been a sensitive issue for some residents of the territory, who fear that their freedoms and human rights may be threatened by Beijing's rule. However, Chinese officials have assured the public that the troops will not interfere with Hong Kong's internal affairs or the rights of its citizens.
The United States and other Western countries have expressed concern about the situation in Hong Kong, and have urged China to respect the rights and freedoms of the territory's residents. Some members of the US Congress have proposed legislation that would give Hong Kong residents the right to emigrate to the US if their rights are violated by China.
The Chinese government has rejected such proposals, and has warned the US and other countries not to interfere in its internal affairs. Chinese officials have said that Hong Kong's autonomy and the rights of its citizens will be protected under Chinese law.
Despite these assurances, many Hong Kong residents remain skeptical about China's intentions. Some have already emigrated to other countries in anticipation of the handover, while others are planning to stay and fight for their rights and freedoms.
The arrival of the second wave of Chinese troops in Hong Kong has intensified these fears and uncertainties. As the handover date approaches, tensions are likely to rise between supporters of Beijing's rule and those who want to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom.
It remains to be seen what the future holds for Hong Kong, but one thing is certain: the city, which has been a bastion of Western-style capitalism and democracy in Asia, is about to undergo a dramatic transformation as it comes under Chinese rule.
