Hong Kong has always been a hub of political activity, especially during times of turbulence and change. The most recent waves of political unrest in China's special administrative region have brought back the prominence of old veterans in the pro-democracy movement.
One such veteran is none other than the founding chairman of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, Martin Lee. In recent weeks, Lee has emerged as the leading voice of opposition against future leader Tung Chee-hwa, who is widely seen as a Chinese puppet who will limit the freedom of Hong Kong's residents.
Lee's efforts to rally support for Hong Kong's push for political freedoms recently garnered the attention of authorities in the United States. A virtual meeting arranged by the Center for International Private Enterprise of the National Endowment for Democracy gave Lee an opportunity to showcase his campaigning.
During the meeting, Lee highlighted the importance of maintaining a high degree of autonomy in the city, which has been guaranteed under the "one country, two systems" framework agreed between the UK and China in 1997.
"The system has not changed since then, and if it falls apart, Hong Kong may never regain its democratic rights again," Lee said.
He also called upon the international community to put pressure on the Chinese government to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and the basic freedoms enjoyed by the people.
Lee's call for the international community's intervention gained support from US lawmakers who are reportedly considering sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials involved in suppressing democracy in the region.
The recent events in Hong Kong have been a test of China's adherence to international law and agreements. In the run-up to the 1997 transfer of sovereignty, China promised to allow the residents of Hong Kong to enjoy a high degree of freedom under the Special Administrative Region status.
However, in recent years, the Chinese government has been accused of eroding Hong Kong's autonomy and clamping down on political dissent. Pro-democracy activists have been jailed, and opposition politicians barred from running for office, while the press has come under increasing pressure.
Lee's recent appearance in the United States is just one of the moves by the Hong Konger opposition to gain international support for the cause. In recent years, this support has been joined by more vocal dissenters in the city itself.
Earlier this year, over 600,000 Hong Kongers voted in primaries arranged by the opposition parties, despite warnings from the authorities. The landslide victory of the pro-democracy camp sent shockwaves through the establishment and drew strong criticism from Beijing.
However, as China moves closer towards asserting its power over Hong Kong, the pro-democracy movements have become increasingly vocal and defiant.
Martin Lee, now in his 80s, represents a generation of Hong Kongers who have seen the city's political landscape shift dramatically since the 1997 handover. He has been a consistent and vocal figure in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and is widely respected for his advocacy of the rule of law and democratic values.
Although currently facing a number of charges related to his participation in a protest in 2019, Lee continues to be a leading voice in the fight for Hong Kong's political freedoms. His appeals for international support and recognition have brought renewed attention to the plight of the Hong Kongers and their struggle for democracy.
