Hong Kong's Future Leader Plans Controversial Changes to Curb Demonstrations and Foreign Funding Ahead of Handover to China
With Hong Kong's handover to China fast approaching, its future leader, Carrie Lam, has unveiled plans to implement controversial changes aimed at curbing the city's democracy movement and foreign funding. The move comes amid growing concerns over Beijing's tightening grip on the autonomous region and its pro-democracy activists.
Lam, who is set to take the reins of Hong Kong as its chief executive on July 1, 2017, revealed her plans at a press conference on Friday. She outlined a series of measures that would restrict the activities of pro-democracy political parties and NGOs, limit access to foreign funding for civil society groups and widen the scope of the city's national security laws.
The changes have drawn criticism from opposition lawmakers and human rights groups who fear that they will undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and jeopardize the freedoms enjoyed by its citizens. The move has also sparked concern from the United States and other Western countries, who have expressed fears that the changes could erode Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub.
Under the new proposals, Lam plans to extend the city's national security laws to cover activities that undermine the authority of the central government and promote the idea of Hong Kong independence. The laws, which are currently used to target terrorism and organized crime, would be amended to include offenses such as sedition, subversion and secession.
Lam also plans to impose new rules on political parties and NGOs, requiring them to submit details of their funding sources and activities to the government. The proposals would allow the government to refuse registration to groups that are deemed to be a threat to national security, and would make it illegal for these groups to receive funding from foreign sources.
Critics say that the new rules could effectively silence opposition political parties and NGOs, and would be used as a tool to shut down pro-democracy groups. "These changes will make it practically impossible for civil society groups to operate independently," said Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist. "It is clear that the government is intent on suppressing dissent and tightening its grip on Hong Kong's civil society."
The proposal to restrict foreign funding for civil society groups has also raised alarm bells. "This move is a blatant attempt to stifle the voices of those who are critical of the government and its policies," said Mabel Au, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong. "It would limit their ability to operate and undermine their ability to hold the government to account."
The announcement of the new measures has sparked protests and rallies across the city. Hundreds of people gathered outside the Legislative Council building on Friday night, chanting slogans and holding up signs denouncing the changes. "These measures are a clear violation of our rights and freedoms," said one protester. "We will not rest until our voices are heard and our freedoms are restored."
The proposed changes have also drawn international condemnation. The US State Department has expressed concerns over the measures, warning that they could threaten Hong Kong's status as a global financial center. "It is important that Hong Kong's autonomy and rights are protected," said a spokesperson for the State Department. "We will be closely monitoring the situation."
The European Union has also criticized the changes. "We are concerned about the potential impact of these measures on civil society and freedom of expression," said a spokesperson for the EU. "We call on the Hong Kong government to ensure that these proposals do not undermine the city's autonomy or its global reputation."
As the handover to China approaches, tensions are rising in Hong Kong. The city's pro-democracy movement has been growing in strength in recent years, with activists demanding greater autonomy, democracy and civil liberties. However, the Chinese government has been tightening its grip on the city, and the new measures proposed by Carrie Lam are seen by many as a worrying blow to Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy.
