Hong Kong's property sector has condemned the government's new measures to curb the skyrocketing housing prices in the bustling city. The new rules were announced on Tuesday, and they include raising stamp duties by up to 15% for non-permanent residents purchasing homes. The move has been met with fierce criticism from real estate experts who argue that it would hinder investment and worsen the housing crisis.
Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, and property prices have soared despite the pandemic's economic fallout. The average price for private homes reached a new high last month, with a 5.3% increase in March alone. Many people, especially young professionals and low-income families, have been priced out of the housing market. The current measures are aimed at making homes more affordable for the middle-class and first-time buyers.
In the new rules, the government has also waived stamp duties on homes priced below HK$2 million. This move is expected to encourage developers to build more affordable housing. The government has also introduced measures to increase land supply and urged developers to speed up the construction of flats.
However, the measures were not well received by the property sector. "The government is treating the property sector like a cash cow," said Thomas Lam of property firm Everbright Sun Hung Kai. "We urge the government to reconsider these punitive measures, which will have a devastating impact on the housing market and the wider economy."
Lam argued that the stamp duty increase would deter foreign investment and harm Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub. He also warned that many property owners would be forced to sell off their assets to avoid paying the new tax, which could lead to a collapse in the property market. "The government should be encouraging investment in the city, not punishing those who have contributed to its success," he added.
The real estate sector's criticism was echoed by lawmakers who argued that the new measures were too harsh. "The government's approach is too one-sided," said Lam Cheuk-ting, a pro-democracy lawmaker. "They are placing all the burden on buyers and developers, without addressing the root causes of the housing crisis. The government needs to consider innovative and sustainable solutions to this problem."
Hong Kong's government has defended the new measures, saying they are necessary to curb the housing crisis and create a fairer housing market. "We are taking a holistic approach to address the housing shortage and make homes more affordable," said Financial Secretary Paul Chan. "We understand that these measures may not please everyone, but they are necessary steps to ensure that Hong Kong remains a livable and sustainable city."
Despite the criticism, some experts believe that the new measures could be effective in controlling the housing crisis. "The stamp duty increase could dissuade speculative investment in the housing market and stabilize prices," said Victor Lui, executive director of Sun Hung Kai Properties. "We support the government's efforts to create a more stable and affordable housing market, but we urge them to monitor the situation closely and make adjustments as necessary."
Hong Kong's housing crisis has been a long-standing issue, and resolving it will require a multifaceted approach that involves private-public partnership, policy reforms, and innovative solutions. While the government's new measures may not be perfect, it is a step in the right direction towards creating a fairer and more sustainable housing market.
