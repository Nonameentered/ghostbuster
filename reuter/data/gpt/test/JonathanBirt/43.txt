The UK chemical industry has warned of a further three years of sluggish investment and job losses due to Brexit uncertainty.
A survey conducted by the Chemical Industries Association (CIA) revealed that investment in the sector had dropped by more than 50% in the past two years.
The study showed that 80% of companies in the sector had been affected by the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union, with a majority citing concerns over tariffs, customs checks and regulatory divergence as their biggest worries.
Many firms have been forced to hold off on investments and expansion plans until they receive more clarity on the UK's future relationship with the EU, which has been put into question by the recent resignation of Brexit Secretary David Davis.
The CIA's Director of Policy, Rhys Williams, said: "This survey confirms that Brexit uncertainty is causing significant damage to the UK chemicals industry. The government must act now to provide a clear pathway forward for the sector."
The UK's chemical industry is a crucial part of the country's economy, generating more than Â£18bn in exports and employing over 130,000 people across the country.
However, the sector has seen a decline in activity in recent years, due to a combination of factors including the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, increased global competition and a lack of investment.
To address these issues, the CIA is calling on the government to provide greater support for businesses in the sector, including measures to boost investment, streamline regulation and increase access to global markets.
Williams added: "We need to see a clear plan from the government that will help to safeguard the future of the UK chemicals industry. This includes support for innovation and research, investment in infrastructure and a clear vision for the UK's place in the global market."
The warning from the CIA comes just days after the UK's car industry also expressed concerns over the impact of Brexit on investment and job stability.
In a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May, the UK's biggest car manufacturers, including BMW, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover, warned that a no-deal Brexit would be "catastrophic" for the industry, with the potential to cost tens of thousands of jobs.
Despite these warnings, the UK government has continued to reassure investors that it is working towards securing a positive outcome for all industries in the country.
In response to the CIA survey, a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: "We recognise the importance of the chemical industry and are working closely with the sector to ensure it continues to grow and prosper." 
The spokesperson added: "We are committed to delivering a Brexit deal that works for all sectors, including chemicals, and will be discussing the sector's priorities as part of our ongoing negotiations with the EU." 
However, with just nine months left until the UK's scheduled departure from the EU, the clock is ticking for businesses in the country, who are increasingly urging the government to provide greater clarity on the future of trade, investment and regulation in the post-Brexit landscape.
