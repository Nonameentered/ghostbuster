Consumer goods giant, Unilever, has announced plans to sell off the majority of its speciality chemicals businesses in a disposal programme worth multi-billion pounds. The move is part of a strategic shift for the company towards fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), as it looks to focus on categories that are more aligned with its core business.
Unilever’s speciality chemicals businesses include well-known household names such as Persil, Domestos and Comfort. The company aims to generate around €6 billion through the sale, with proceeds being used to return cash to shareholders and invest in further acquisitions.
Paul Polman, Unilever CEO, said: “With the disposal of our speciality chemicals businesses, we are strengthening focus on our core business, accelerating growth and driving shareholder value."
The speciality chemicals industry is highly competitive, and Unilever has struggled to make a significant impact in this space. The company’s decision to sell off these businesses is in line with its broader strategy of reducing its portfolio to concentrate on core FMCG, which includes brands such as Lipton, Dove and Knorr.
Unilever has already made significant progress in this area, divesting its margarine business earlier this year for €6.8bn and snapping up premium skincare brands such as Carver Korea, which was acquired for $2.7bn in September 2017.
The speciality chemicals businesses being sold by Unilever are a mix of consumer products and industrial components, including ingredients used in food processing, fragrances, and detergents; as well as chemicals used in agriculture and paint manufacturing.
Industry experts predict that the sale of Unilever’s speciality chemicals businesses will create opportunities for competitors to acquire new assets and make strategic acquisitions of their own. Many expect the sale to be highly attractive to large chemical producers looking to expand and strengthen their existing portfolios, while also paving the way for smaller, innovative players to forge a foothold in key markets.
The global speciality chemicals industry is expected to exceed $1tn in value by 2020, according to industry analysts, with Asia, the Middle East and Africa set to become major growth areas over the next decade.
The announcement of Unilever’s disposal programme came as the company released its latest earnings figures, which showed a 2.6% increase in underlying sales growth for the third quarter of 2017. The company’s CEO attributed this performance to a combination of strong volume growth and higher prices, particularly in emerging markets.
Unilever’s shares have risen by over 25% since the start of the year, with analysts suggesting that the company’s focus on returning cash to shareholders is likely to boost investor confidence further.
Despite Unilever’s recent success in divesting non-core businesses, the company faces ongoing challenges, including increased competition from e-commerce giants such as Amazon, and ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
However, with a strong focus on core FMCG and a commitment to innovation and product development, Unilever is set to be well-positioned for growth in the fast-changing consumer goods industry.
