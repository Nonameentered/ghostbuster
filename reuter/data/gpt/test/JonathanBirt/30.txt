Rentokil Initial, the British pest control and hygiene services company, has announced a sharp rise in sales and profits for 2020, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's revenue increased by 9.4% to £2.79 billion ($3.6 billion), while its pre-tax profit jumped by 13.5% to £355.3 million ($460 million).
The strong financial performance was mainly attributed to the acquisition of US rival Terminix in 2018, which helped Rentokil Initial to expand its presence in the lucrative North American market. However, concerns have been raised about the heavy reliance of the company on another recent acquisition, British pest control firm BET.
Rentokil Initial bought BET in April 2020 for £40 million ($52 million), in a move aimed at strengthening its position in the UK market. While the acquisition has boosted the company's sales and profits in the short-term, some analysts have warned that the heavy dependence on BET could backfire in the long run.
"The performance of the company seems to be linked to the recent acquisitions, and there is a concern that they may not be sustainable going forward," said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets.
Rentokil Initial CEO Andy Ransom acknowledged the concerns but argued that the company's strategy of growth through acquisition was paying off.
"We have demonstrated that our strategy works, both in the UK and internationally," he said. "While we appreciate the concern about our reliance on newly-acquired businesses, we are confident that we have the expertise and resources to continue to grow and develop our operations."
The company has also benefited from the increased focus on hygiene and sanitation during the pandemic, as businesses and households have become more aware of the risks posed by pests and germs. Rentokil Initial has been actively promoting its disinfection services and providing advice on preventing the spread of COVID-19.
The company's shares have performed well in the stock market, rising by over 35% in the last year. However, there is still uncertainty about the future, as the pandemic continues to disrupt economies and businesses around the world.
Rentokil Initial is optimistic about its prospects, but it remains to be seen whether its reliance on acquisitions and the current demand for pest control and hygiene services will continue to drive its growth in the years to come.
