In a recent interview, outgoing CEO of Coats Viyella Plc, Neville Bain, revealed that he believes the company is poised for growth in the coming years. The textile manufacturing company, which has been in business for over 250 years, has faced its fair share of challenges in recent years, but Bain is confident that the company is on the right track.
Bain, who will retire in June of this year, has been with Coats Viyella for over 30 years and has been at the helm as CEO since 2013. During his time as CEO, Bain has overseen a period of significant change for the company, which has included the sale of several non-core businesses and a refocusing on its core operations.
According to Bain, these changes have put the company in a strong position for growth. "We've been through a period of restructuring and refocusing, and now we're in a position where we can really start to grow again," he said in the interview. "We have a solid foundation in place, and I believe we're well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the market."
One of the key opportunities that Bain highlighted is the growing demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly textiles. Coats Viyella has been working to develop a range of sustainable products, including recycled polyester and eco-friendly dyes.
"We're seeing a real shift in the market towards more sustainable and responsible products," said Bain. "Consumers are increasingly aware of the impact their purchasing decisions have on the environment, and we want to be at the forefront of meeting that demand."
Another area of potential growth for Coats Viyella is in the digital space. The company has been investing in its digital capabilities, including the development of a new e-commerce platform and the use of data analytics to better understand customer needs.
"We're seeing more and more customers moving online, and we want to be able to offer them a seamless experience," said Bain. "We're also using data to better understand what our customers want and how we can meet those needs more effectively."
Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Bain is optimistic about the future of Coats Viyella. "The pandemic has had an impact on our business, like it has for many others, but we're in a strong position to weather the storm," he said. "We've taken steps to protect our workforce and our business, and we're confident that we'll come out of this stronger than ever."
Coats Viyella Plc employs over 18,000 people in more than 50 countries worldwide and has a rich history as one of the world's leading textile manufacturers. With a new CEO set to take over in June, the company will look to build on the strong foundation laid by Neville Bain and continue its focus on growth and innovation in the years ahead.
