Coats Viyella, the UK's largest textiles group, has reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits for the financial year 1996, reflecting the impact of a tough trading environment and increased competition in its core markets.
In its annual report released today, the company revealed that its pre-tax profits had fallen 22% to £87.1m ($116.7m) for the year ended December 31, 1996, down from £111.1m ($148.8m) in the previous year.
The company's sales had also dropped slightly, from £1.88bn ($2.52bn) in 1995 to £1.85bn ($2.48bn) in 1996, reflecting the difficulties faced by the textile industry as a whole.
Coats Viyella, which makes sewing thread, zips, and wool for the clothing industry, had been hit by the strong pound, which had made its products more expensive in overseas markets, as well as by the continued decline of the UK textile industry.
In addition, the company faced increased competition from low-cost producers in the Far East, which had put pressure on prices, margins, and profitability.
Despite the difficult trading environment, the company said it had continued to invest in new products and technologies, such as its Coats E-Threads range, which uses micro-encapsulated technology to provide anti-microbial and deodorising properties to textiles.
It also highlighted the successful launch of its new YKK Excella zip range, which had been well received by customers, and said it remained committed to developing innovative products that would meet the changing needs of its customers.
Commenting on the results, Coats Viyella's chief executive, Colin Maddocks, said: "1996 was a challenging year for the company, but we have continued to invest in the business to ensure we remain at the forefront of the industry."
He added: "Despite the difficult trading conditions, we have achieved some important milestones, including the successful launch of new products, the implementation of cost reduction programmes, and the restructuring of certain parts of the business."
Investors, however, were disappointed by the results, and shares in the company fell by nearly 10% on the news.
Analysts said the results were in line with expectations, but highlighted the continued challenges the company faced in an increasingly competitive global market.
Martin Evans, analyst at stockbrokers Morgan Stanley, said: "The figures were disappointing, but not unexpected given the tough trading conditions. The key issue for Coats Viyella is to find ways to remain competitive in the face of increasing global competition."
He added: "The company is doing the right things in terms of investing in new products and technologies, but it needs to continue to focus on cost reduction and efficiency to improve its margins and profitability."
Coats Viyella said it remained optimistic about the future, but warned that the trading environment was likely to remain difficult in the short term.
The company said it would continue to focus on driving efficiencies, expanding its product range, and developing new markets to deliver sustainable growth over the long term.
It also highlighted the importance of its recently announced joint venture with YKK Corporation, which would give it access to new technology and markets in the fastening solutions sector.
"We believe the joint venture with YKK gives us a strong platform for growth in this important area of the business," Maddocks said.
"We remain committed to delivering sustainable growth and value for our shareholders, and we believe that with the right strategy and focus, we can position ourselves at the forefront of the global textiles industry."
