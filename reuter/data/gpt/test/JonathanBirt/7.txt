Peptide Therapeutics, the London-based biotechnology company that specializes in the development of peptides for the pharmaceutical industry, has signed its second major deal in just a matter of weeks, as SmithKline Beecham announced that it is investing in the firm's allergy vaccine program.
The deal, which is reportedly worth millions of pounds, will see Peptide Therapeutics develop allergy vaccines for SmithKline Beecham, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies. The two firms have agreed to jointly develop and commercialize the vaccines, which are designed to treat allergies such as pollen, pet dander, and food allergies.
The investment by SmithKline Beecham comes just weeks after Peptide Therapeutics signed a major deal with a consortium of Japanese pharmaceutical companies to develop a new treatment for cancer.
Commenting on the new deal, Peptide Therapeutics CEO, Dr. Laura Rivinoja said: "We are delighted to be partnering with SmithKline Beecham, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies. The investment will allow us to further develop our allergy vaccine program and bring innovative treatments to patients suffering from allergies."
Dr. Rivinoja went on to say that Peptide Therapeutics' technology, which uses peptides to trigger an immune response against specific allergens, has shown promising results in clinical trials.
"We have already shown that our technology can be used to treat allergies in small-scale clinical trials, and we are confident that with SmithKline Beecham's support we can develop a range of effective and safe allergy vaccines for patients around the world," she said.
According to the World Allergy Organization, allergies affect up to 30% of the global population, making them one of the most common chronic diseases. However, existing treatments such as antihistamines and steroids only alleviate the symptoms of allergies, rather than addressing the underlying cause.
Allergy vaccines, also known as immunotherapy, work by training the immune system to tolerate the allergen over time. This involves administering small amounts of the allergen in increasing doses, which gradually desensitize the immune system.
However, existing allergy vaccines are often time-consuming and require regular injections over several years. Peptide Therapeutics' technology aims to offer a more convenient and effective alternative, by using peptides to trigger an immune response specific to the allergen.
SmithKline Beecham's investment in Peptide Therapeutics' allergy vaccine program is a significant step for the biotech firm, which was founded in 2019 and has since attracted strong interest from investors and pharmaceutical companies.
The firm's focus on peptides, which are short chains of amino acids that are an essential building block of proteins, has been key to its success. Peptides offer numerous advantages over conventional drugs, including greater specificity, reduced toxicity, and improved pharmacokinetics.
Peptide Therapeutics' latest deal with SmithKline Beecham is a further indication of the growing interest in peptide-based drugs and the potential for these molecules to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry.
As part of the deal, SmithKline Beecham will provide funding and expertise to Peptide Therapeutics to advance the development of its allergy vaccine program. This will include the design and synthesis of peptides, preclinical testing, and clinical trials.
The investment is also expected to support the growth of Peptide Therapeutics' research and development team, which includes some of the world's leading experts in peptide chemistry, immunology, and drug development.
Overall, Peptide Therapeutics' success in attracting major investors and pharmaceutical partners highlights the enormous potential of peptide-based drugs to address unmet medical needs and drive innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. With the support of SmithKline Beecham, the firm is well-positioned to advance its allergy vaccine program and develop new treatments for patients around the world.
