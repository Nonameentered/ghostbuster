Zeneca Group Plc, one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the UK, has reported its highest-ever sales of over £5 billion and profits of over £1 billion for the first time. The company's outstanding performance was driven by strong demand for its oncology and respiratory drugs, as well as its continued focus on innovation.
The results, which were released on Wednesday, highlight Zeneca's resilience in the face of a challenging global economy and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company's CEO, Pascal Soriot, praised the efforts of his team in delivering these impressive results.
"I am incredibly proud of our people and our products. Despite the difficulties that many of our customers and employees have faced over the past year, we have continued to work tirelessly to serve the needs of patients and healthcare providers around the world," Soriot said.
The company's oncology portfolio was a major contributor to its success, with sales of its blockbuster drug Tagrisso reaching £2.13 billion, up by 32% from the previous year. The drug, which is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer, has been one of the company's most successful products in recent years.
"We are seeing a significant increase in demand for oncology treatments, and Tagrisso is at the forefront of this trend. We are committed to continuing to invest in innovative therapies that can make a real difference to patients' lives," Soriot said.
Zeneca's respiratory portfolio also performed well, with sales of its asthma drug Fasenra increasing by 57% to £830 million. The company's other respiratory products, including its COPD drug Bevespi and its inhaler device Duaklir, also saw strong sales growth.
"These results reflect our commitment to improving the lives of people with respiratory conditions. We are constantly researching and developing new treatments to meet unmet needs in this area," Soriot said.
In addition to its strong product portfolio, Zeneca's success can also be attributed to its focus on innovation and collaboration. The company has been working with a range of partners, including academic institutions and other pharmaceutical companies, to develop new treatments and technologies.
"We believe that collaboration is key to advancing medical science and improving patient outcomes. By working with others, we can bring together the best minds and resources to solve some of the most pressing health challenges of our time," Soriot said.
Looking ahead, Zeneca remains committed to investing in innovation and building on its successes. The company has several promising products in the pipeline, including its COVID-19 vaccine, which was approved for emergency use by regulatory authorities in the UK in December.
"We are proud to be playing a role in the fight against COVID-19, and we are committed to ensuring that our vaccine is accessible to people around the world. We believe that by working together, we can overcome this global health crisis and emerge stronger than ever," Soriot said.
Overall, Zeneca's record-breaking results demonstrate the company's strength in a highly competitive industry. Its focus on innovation, collaboration, and patient-centered research has helped it to stand out in a crowded market and deliver real value to patients around the world.
"We are thrilled to have achieved these results, but we know that there is still much work to be done. We remain focused on our mission to improve the health and well-being of people everywhere, and we are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead," Soriot concluded.
