Coats Viyella Plc, the multinational textile and clothing manufacturer expects to see a significant bounce back to profits in 1997 following the company's decision to strip down its business and restructure its operations. The announcement was made at the company's Annual General Meeting yesterday in London.
Coats Viyella, which has several marquee brands such as Jaeger, had undertaken a major overhaul in the past few years. Underperforming businesses were sold off, and the company focused on knitting yarns, threads, and other products. This restructuring has had a major impact on the company's bottom line, but the management was confident that the company would see a turnaround starting in 1997.
The announcement sent a wave of optimism among the shareholders, who have seen the company struggle to stay afloat in a fiercely competitive industry. The company's stock jumped by 7% to close at 112.5 pence. The management's optimism is underpinned by several factors which the CEO, Mr. Peter Jarvis, outlined in his address.
Firstly, the company has reduced operating costs by almost 30% due to the restructuring. The cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 1997 was down by 22% compared to the same period last year. Secondly, the company has successfully diversified its product line. The industrial thread, accessories, and zips business had a stellar performance last year, and the company expects that trend to continue in 1997. Thirdly, the company has spent heavily on research and development, and the fruits of that labor will start to show in 1997. Coats Viyella has invested in cutting edge technology that will reduce dependence on labor and improve operating efficiencies.
Mr. Jarvis warned that the European market continues to be challenging, with competition from Asia, Africa, and the Americas. There are also concerns about the impact of Brexit on the company's European operations. Mr. Jarvis spoke about the company's strategy to mitigate potential risks, including increasing its presence in emerging markets such as Asia and Africa. This strategy will be underpinned by a $200 million investment in India, China, and Malaysia.
The shareholders were impressed with Mr. Jarvis's strategy and his optimism for the future. One shareholder commented, "It's good to see that the management is taking a proactive approach to the challenges facing the company. The emphasis on diversifying the product line and investing in technology is a step in the right direction."
Coats Viyella has a long history, dating back to the 1750s, and has weathered several economic cycles. The management is confident that the company will weather the current cycle and bounce back in 1997 and beyond. The shareholders were left with a sense of optimism and hope for the future of the company.
