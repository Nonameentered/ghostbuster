In what can be termed as a major victory for SmithKline Beecham, their antidepressant drug Paxil/Seroxat is all set to become the company's best-selling drug by the end of the year. This is significant considering that the drug has been around for over two decades and sales have been robust since it first hit the market.
The drug, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been a top performer in the industry since its launch in 1992. Despite facing criticism in recent years regarding its safety and efficacy, sales of Paxil/Seroxat have continued to soar, thanks to the large patient base it has already created. 
Dr. Shehla Quraishi, a medical expert, explained the success of Paxil/Seroxat by stating, "In the early 1990s, there were very few drugs available for the treatment of depression. Paxil/Seroxat emerged as the silver bullet that worked well for many patients, without the strong side effects associated with other antidepressants."
According to recent reports, Paxil/Seroxat sales have risen by 9% compared to the previous year, and the drug is set to overtake Advair as the company's best-selling product by the end of the year. This is despite the fact that Advair, which is used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, had sales of $4.2 billion in 2020, while Paxil/Seroxat generated $3.8 billion in the same year.
Despite the success of the drug in the market, Paxil/Seroxat has had its fair share of controversies over the years, particularly regarding its safety. In 2012, the company was ordered to pay a $3 billion fine following accusations of promoting the drug for unapproved uses and paying kickbacks to healthcare professionals.
Additionally, the drug has been linked to a number of side effects, including withdrawal symptoms, suicide, and birth defects. However, SmithKline Beecham has always maintained that the drug is safe and effective when used as directed, and many patients and healthcare professionals continue to use and prescribe it.
As per industry experts, the success of Paxil/Seroxat can be attributed to the fact that depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the world, affecting over 300 million people globally. With an increasing awareness of mental health and a growing number of patients seeking treatment, the demand for antidepressants like Paxil/Seroxat is expected to rise further in the coming years.
In conclusion, Paxil/Seroxat's position as SmithKline Beecham's best-selling drug is symbolic of its continued popularity despite controversies regarding its safety and efficacy. Regardless of the criticism, the drug's success can be attributed to its effectiveness in treating depression, which remains a significant public health issue.
