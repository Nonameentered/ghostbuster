The company reported a pre-tax profit of £180 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, up from £140 million in the previous year, exceeding expectations. This success can be attributed to the continued growth of its specialty chemical divisions.

In addition to its strong performance in China, Laporte has also reported growth in its European and North American markets. The company has been investing heavily in research and development, and has launched a number of new products that have been well received by customers.
"Our continued focus on innovation and product development has helped us to remain competitive in a rapidly changing market," said Smith. "We are committed to investing in our business, and we believe that this will enable us to continue to grow and deliver value to our shareholders."
Looking ahead, Laporte is optimistic about its prospects for the coming year. The company expects to benefit from further growth in China and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as continued growth in its European and North American markets.
"We are confident that our business is well positioned for continued growth," said Brown. "We believe that the investments we have made in our operations, combined with our focus on innovation and product development, will enable us to continue to deliver strong results for many years to come."
In conclusion, Laporte Plc has delivered higher-than-expected annual profit thanks to strong demand for its specialty chemicals, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.
