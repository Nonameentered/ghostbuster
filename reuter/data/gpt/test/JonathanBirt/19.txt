The pharmaceutical industry in Britain, which has been described as "world-beating" by politicians and industry leaders, is under serious threat, with the country's science base deteriorating rapidly, according to major companies in the sector.
The pharmaceutical industry is one of the UK's most valuable sectors, generating an estimated £30.4 billion ($41.4 billion) in turnover in 2019, but some of the biggest names in the industry have warned that its future is uncertain, as the science base that underpins it is in decline.
Several major pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer, have expressed concern over the state of the UK's scientific research capabilities. They have warned that the deterioration in the science base could make it more difficult for the industry to innovate, discover new drugs and therapies, and ultimately remain competitive in a rapidly changing global market.
There are several factors that have contributed to the deterioration of the UK's science base. One of the biggest issues is the decline in funding for science research and development. According to a report by the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE), government spending on science research and development has been shrinking in real terms since 2010, with a 20% reduction in funding for scientific research over the past decade.
Furthermore, there is increasing competition for research funding from other countries, particularly China, which is rapidly becoming a major player in the global pharmaceutical industry. As China invests heavily in science research and development, the UK risks falling behind in terms of innovation and discovery.
Another issue is the lack of investment in science education and training. According to a recent report by the Royal Society, just 35% of science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) teachers hold a relevant degree, and only 23% of physics teachers have an undergraduate degree in physics. This lack of qualified teachers could lead to a shortage of skilled workers in the pharmaceutical industry.
Companies are also concerned about the impact of Brexit on the pharmaceutical industry. The uncertainty surrounding the UK's future relationship with the EU has already led to some companies moving their operations and research facilities out of the country, and others have warned that the ongoing uncertainty could make it difficult for the industry to attract and retain foreign talent.
In addition to these issues, there is also a growing concern about the UK's intellectual property regime. The pharmaceutical industry relies heavily on intellectual property protection to ensure the development and commercialization of new drugs and therapies. However, some industry leaders have warned that the UK's intellectual property laws are inadequate and could be damaging to the industry in the long term.
These concerns have been echoed by several major industry bodies. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) has called for urgent action to be taken to address the decline in the science base, warning that the industry could lose its competitive edge if these issues are not addressed.
In a statement, the ABPI said: "The UK's pharmaceutical industry has long been a jewel in its crown, but the world is changing rapidly and Britain risks being left behind. We need urgent action to address the issues that are putting our science base at risk, including funding for research and development, investment in science education and training, and a robust and effective intellectual property regime."
The government has responded to these concerns by pledging to increase funding for science research and development, as well as investing in science education and training. In November 2020, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a significant increase in funding for science research, with an extra £400 million ($548 million) set to be invested in research and development over the next four years.
However, some experts have warned that these measures may not be enough. John Womersley, the CEO of the Science and Technology Facilities Council, said that the UK's science base had been "seriously eroded" over the past decade and warned that significant investment would be needed to reverse this trend.
Speaking to the Financial Times, Womersley said: "The science base has been seriously eroded over the past decade, and it's going to require an awful lot of effort and an awful lot of investment to get it back to where it should be. The UK risks falling behind in innovation, which in turn will affect the industries that rely on it."
Despite the concerns raised by industry leaders, there are many who believe that the UK's pharmaceutical industry still has an incredibly bright future. With a world-class workforce, cutting-edge research facilities, and a track record of innovation and discovery, there is no doubt that the UK has a lot to offer the world of pharmaceuticals.
However, if the challenges facing the industry are not addressed, the UK risks losing its competitive edge and falling behind in the global race for innovation and discovery. As such, it is essential that urgent action is taken to address these concerns and ensure that the UK remains a leader in the world of pharmaceuticals for years to come.
