London-based pharmaceutical giant Glaxo announced a pre-tax profit rise of 18% for the year 1996, bringing in a staggering £3.14bn. Glaxo has managed to maintain its position as one of the world's largest drug companies despite fierce competition. However, the company may face lean years ahead as one of its most lucrative products, the acid-reflux drug Zantac, is set to lose its patent protection in the US by July. 
Zantac has been one of Glaxo's most successful products, bringing in £1.3bn in 1996 alone. It accounted for more than one-third of the company's US sales last year. The loss of patent protection will allow other pharmaceutical companies to produce and sell generic versions of the drug, cutting into Glaxo's profits significantly. 
The patent loss will also impact Glaxo in another way. The company has been fighting lawsuits alleging that Zantac causes cancer, and losing patent protection will make it less appealing for Glaxo to settle these cases. Some of the lawsuits date back to the 1980s and have yet to be resolved. 
Despite these challenges, Glaxo's management remains optimistic. "We have a solid pipeline of new products, and we will continue to focus on research and development to bring innovative treatments to patients," said Glaxo CEO Robert Ingram. Indeed, the company has invested heavily in research and development in recent years, and has several promising new drugs in the pipeline. 
One of these drugs is lapatinib, which is in the final stages of clinical trials and is expected to receive FDA approval later this year. Lapatinib is a treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer, a type of cancer that affects approximately 20% of women with breast cancer. It works by inhibiting two proteins that are responsible for the growth of cancerous cells. 
Another promising drug is eltrombopag, which was approved in November 2018 as a treatment for thrombocytopenia, a condition in which the body doesn't produce enough platelets. Eltrombopag stimulates the production of platelets and has shown promising results in clinical trials. 
Glaxo's management also plans to streamline the company's operations and focus on its core products. The company has already sold off some of its non-core businesses, such as its animal health unit and its oncology products, to streamline its operations. 
While Glaxo's management is optimistic, analysts warn that the loss of patent protection for Zantac will be a significant blow to the company's profits. "Zantac has been a cash cow for Glaxo," said Richard Eastman, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Losing patent protection will hurt them, but they have other products in the pipeline that could make up for some of the loss." 
Glaxo's management is also facing pressure from investors. The company's share price has been underperforming compared to its competitors, and some investors are calling for a change in leadership. However, Glaxo's management has reiterated its commitment to the company's long-term strategy. 
"We are confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and to continue to deliver value to our shareholders," said Ingram. "We have a strong foundation, a talented team, and a clear vision for the future of our company." 
In conclusion, Glaxo's pre-tax profit rise of 18% in 1996 is an impressive feat in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry. However, the loss of patent protection for Zantac and ongoing lawsuits alleging that Zantac causes cancer will pose significant challenges for the company. Glaxo's management is optimistic about its future prospects, but analysts warn that the company's profits will be impacted by the loss of patent protection. The pharmaceutical giant's ability to innovate and bring new drugs to market will be crucial in maintaining its position as one of the world's leading drug companies.
