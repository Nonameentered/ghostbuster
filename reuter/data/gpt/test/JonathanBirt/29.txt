Rentokil Initial, the British commercial pest control company, has announced a sharp increase in sales and profits in the first quarter of 2021, driven by a surge in demand for its services during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company reported a 12.4% rise in organic revenue growth in Q1, up from 6.9% growth in the same period last year. Rentokil's pre-tax profits also jumped by 16% to £104.4m ($143.6m), up from £90m ($123.7m) in Q1 2020.
However, concerns have been raised over the company's heavy reliance on its newly-acquired subsidiary, California-based pest control firm, BET.
Rentokil completed the £3.9bn ($5.4bn) acquisition of BET in January 2021, making it the world's largest pest control company. BET contributed £545.5m ($749.7m) to Rentokil's Q1 revenue, accounting for almost half (45%) of the company's total revenue of £1.2bn ($1.6bn).
Analysts have warned that Rentokil's heavy reliance on BET, coupled with the high price it paid for the acquisition, could leave the company vulnerable if BET's performance were to falter in the future.
In response to concerns, Rentokil CEO Andy Ransom insisted that the acquisition of BET was a "game-changer" for the company, providing a strong platform for growth, particularly in the US market.
"We have integrated BET quickly and efficiently, and we are already seeing significant benefits from the acquisition, with new business wins and improved operational efficiencies," Ransom said.
Rentokil has also sought to alleviate concerns by diversifying its portfolio of services, with the company expanding its offerings beyond pest control to include hygiene, cleaning, and disinfection services.
"We have worked hard to build a portfolio of services that meet our customers' evolving needs, particularly in the context of the pandemic, where cleanliness and hygiene are more important than ever," Ransom said.
Rentokil's success in the first quarter has been driven by a surge in demand for its services during the COVID-19 pandemic, as businesses and households seek to protect themselves against the spread of the virus.
The company's disinfection services, which help businesses and public spaces to sanitize their premises, have been particularly in demand, with Rentokil reporting a 43% increase in sales in this category.
Rentokil's success in Q1 has prompted the company to raise its full-year profit guidance, with the firm now forecasting a pre-tax profit of between £355m ($487m) and £375m ($514m) for the year.
The company is also investing heavily in digital technologies, with a recent partnership with Microsoft to develop new AI-powered pest control solutions.
Rentokil's success in the first quarter of 2021 is a positive sign for the company, which has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic better than many other businesses. However, the company's heavy reliance on BET, despite its significant contributions to Rentokil's revenue, represents a potential risk for the company's future growth.
