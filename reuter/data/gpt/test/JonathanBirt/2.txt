BOC Group, a leading provider of industrial gases, has announced the launch of its new breathable, liquefied air technology. This innovative technology is designed to provide an efficient and cost-effective solution for temporary cold storage and aircraft engine testing.
The new technology uses a unique process to create a liquefied form of air that can be used as a coolant in temporary cold storage. It is also ideal for use in aircraft engine testing where a highly precise and stable cooling source is required.
According to BOC Group, this new technology has a number of advantages over traditional cooling methods. For one, it is much more efficient. The company claims that its breathable, liquefied air can provide up to three times the cooling power of traditional methods, while using less energy.
In addition, the technology is highly flexible and scalable. It can be used in a range of different applications and can be easily adapted to suit the needs of different industries.
Commenting on the launch of the new technology, BOC Group CEO, John Smith, said: "We are very excited to be introducing this innovative new product to the market. Our breathable, liquefied air technology is a game-changer for the industry, offering a highly efficient and cost-effective solution for temporary cold storage and aircraft engine testing."
The new technology has already been received with enthusiasm by a number of leading companies. Among these is the aerospace giant, Airbus, which has already signed up to use the technology in its engine testing facilities.
"We are always looking for innovative solutions to help us improve efficiency and reduce costs," said an Airbus spokesperson. "BOC Group's breathable, liquefied air technology is an exciting new development that we believe will help us achieve these goals in our engine testing facilities."
BOC Group is now rolling out the new technology to customers around the world. With its many advantages over traditional cooling methods, it is expected to become a key player in the industrial gases industry in the years to come.
