Prague, Czech Republic – The Czech finance ministry announced on Thursday that the country’s trade deficit had widened beyond forecasts in December 2020. According to official data, the country's trade gap reached a record high of CZK 28.35 billion ($1.3 billion) last month, increasing from CZK 13.4 billion in November.
Analysts had expected an increase in the country's trade gap in December due to the pandemic's impact on global demand, but the actual figure was significantly higher than expected. The ministry said the shortfall was mainly driven by lower automotive exports, which fell by 28% YoY, while imports remained largely stable.
Despite the widening deficit, experts are predicting that the Czech crown will hold steady against other currencies. The initial nervousness among investors has subsided as they view the situation as temporary.
"The widening trade deficit is largely caused by the ongoing economic scars of the pandemic, and we expect the situation to improve as the global economy recovers," said analyst Jiri Polansky of brokerage firm Patria Finance.
He added that the central bank's monetary policy could also help stabilize the currency as it continues to engage in quantitative easing to support the struggling economy.
The central bank has been keeping interest rates near zero and buying government bonds to provide liquidity to the banking system. It purchased CZK 35 billion worth of bonds in December to increase the balance sheet to CZK 2.67 trillion.
On the other hand, Finance Minister Alena Schillerova has emphasized that the government needs to focus on a sustainable economic recovery by increasing exports and investing in innovation and research.
"We need to take a long-term approach to strengthen the economy and reduce our dependence on imports," she said in a statement.
The Czech Republic, which is heavily dependent on exports, has been hit hard by the pandemic, with a sharp drop in demand for its goods from key trading partners in Europe and elsewhere. The country's GDP shrank by 5.5% YoY in the third quarter of 2020, the largest decline in 24 years.
Despite the challenges, Czech officials remain optimistic that the country's economy will rebound in the coming months, helped by vaccine rollouts and a recovery in global demand.
