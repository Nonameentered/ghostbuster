Czech Trading Firms Warn of Impending Trade Deficit as Covid-19 Takes Its Toll
Prague: Czech trading firms are sounding a warning of an impending trade deficit amid the ongoing pandemic. While the country's economy has performed better than expected in 2020 when compared to other EU countries, there is deep concern among businesses that the pandemic's impact on the global economy is likely to hit them hard.
According to the new data gathered by the Czech Republic's Trade and Industry Chamber, the country's trade deficit is predicted to nearly double in the first quarter of 1997. This follows a 2020 Q4 deficit of more than €2 billion, and reflects the ongoing impact of Covid-19 restrictions and global trade tensions.
The data predicts that the country’s trade imbalance with the EU will expand from €3.3 billion at the end of 2020 to €5 billion by the end of Q1 1997. A similar trend is expected in regard to the country’s trade with non-EU partners where the deficit may grow from €2.2 billion to €3.3 billion in the same period.
The main reason for the impending trade imbalance is the country's dependence on technological equipment and energy imports. With many companies unable to maintain regular production due to restrictions arising from the pandemic, there has been a reduction in export volumes. The subsequent drop in the sale of manufactured goods has led to a sharp decline in the country's revenue, leading to the increase of the trade deficit.
This also comes amid growing trade tensions and increased customs duties on key export goods such as aluminium and steel products. The U.S. is currently the Czech Republic's largest market for these goods, a situation that further compounds the country's economic decline.
In response to the data, experts have called for effective policies that can help cushion the effects of the decline on the country's economy. Among the proposed measures are the creation of incentives and subsidies, aimed at helping boost the export of goods as well as measures that can support the reshaping of trade policies which will help diversify the economy.
According to Ondrej Koc from the Czech Consulate in Paris, the country should focus on developing new trade links with emerging markets, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, which are less affected by the ongoing repercussions of the pandemic.
Since the onset of the pandemic, the Czech Republic has had to adapt to a completely new economic reality; many predicted that the country's economy would suffer further from the pandemic. However, the country has canceled thousands of customs duties, implemented new initiatives such as non-refundable subsidies for struggling businesses, and invested heavily in healthcare, all aimed at softening the impact of the pandemic on the economy.
The government has also been working on new foreign trade strategies – for instance, the recent partnering of the Czech Republic with France and Germany in the fight against Covid-19. Nevertheless, there is much more work to be done, given the current trade deficit situation.
In conclusion, while the past year has been challenging for Czech businesses, the upcoming year continues to pose even greater challenges. Effective policymaking, such as initiatives like broadening exports into emerging markets, is a critical strategy in navigating the current crisis. Ultimately, the government and private sectors must continue to work together, now more than ever, to maintain the country's economic health.
