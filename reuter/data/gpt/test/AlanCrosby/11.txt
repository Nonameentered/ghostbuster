Bass plc, the British multinational brewing company, has increased its stake in Czech brewer Radegast by 10%. The acquisition solidifies Bass’ position as one of the largest players in the beer market in Central and Eastern Europe.
Radegast is one of the oldest and most well-known breweries in the Czech Republic, with a history dating back to the 19th century. The company produces a range of popular beers, including Radegast Premium and Radegast Birell, which have a loyal following among Czech beer drinkers.
Bass first acquired a stake in Radegast in 2016, and the latest acquisition brings its total holding in the company to 51%. The move is part of Bass’ strategy to expand its presence in the growing beer market in the region and capitalize on the increasing demand for premium beers among consumers.
“Radegast is a fantastic brand with a rich history and a loyal customer base,” said Bass CEO, John Smith. “We are delighted to increase our stake in the company and strengthen our position in the Czech beer market.”
The acquisition is expected to have a positive impact on Radegast’s operations, with Bass bringing its expertise in marketing and distribution to the table. The deal also provides an opportunity for Radegast to expand into new markets, particularly in Western Europe, where demand for premium Czech beer is on the rise.
“We are thrilled to have Bass as a majority shareholder,” said Radegast CEO, Tomas Vaclavicek. “Their experience and resources will be invaluable in helping us to grow our business and reach new customers.”
The beer market in Central and Eastern Europe has seen significant growth in recent years, with consumers increasingly willing to pay a premium for high-quality beer. With its increased stake in Radegast, Bass is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and drive further growth in the region.
