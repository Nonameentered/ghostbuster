The Czech Republic's trade deficit has doubled in January due to a slowdown in exports. The country's Statistics Office disclosed that the deficit surged to CZK 22.1 billion (USD 1 billion) as of January 2021, from CZK 10.7 billion (USD 492 million) in the same month last year. This marks the highest trade deficit recorded since May 2020, when the country was severely affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The deficit was attributed to a decrease in exports, which remained stagnant due to the reduced demand for goods caused by the current economic downturn in Europe. Total exports dropped by 1.3% in January, as the decline in energy products, motor vehicles, and machinery and electrical equipment sales outstripped the marginal gains in pharmaceuticals and chemicals sales. In contrast, imports surged by 1.7% year-on-year due to lower prices of imported goods, notably oil.
According to the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade, the country's manufacturing sector, which accounts for 80% of total exports, suffered the most, with a 4.1% decline in sales, as external demand dropped due to the coronavirus crisis. Within the manufacturing sector, motor vehicles and related parts contributed the most to the decline in exports, falling by almost a quarter year-on-year. Crises in the country's major trade partners such as Germany, Slovakia, and Poland have also hampered the export performance of the Czech Republic.
Despite the lackluster performance in exports, the services sector has remained relatively stable, with trade balances in services remaining positive in January as the country's information and communication sectors continued to thrive. Also, the country continues to record a surplus in its trade with non-EU countries, with exports rising by 1.9% compared to a 13.7% decline in exports to EU-member states.
Experts fear that the sluggish export performance could continue, as recent data shows a deterioration in domestic demand due to the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Several countries have imposed strict restrictions and lockdowns, leading to a decline in economic activity and a decrease in consumer confidence. Also, the recent depreciation of the Czech koruna could also weaken the country's competitiveness by increasing import prices and reducing export earnings.
In response to these challenges, the government, through the Ministry of Industry and Trade, has initiated several measures aimed at boosting exports. These measures include supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in accessing export markets, promoting the country's tourism industry, and investing in research and development to boost manufacturing productivity and competitiveness.
In conclusion, the Czech Republic's trade performance has taken a hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent economic downturn in Europe. The sluggish export performance has led to a trade deficit in January, which is expected to persist in the short term. However, the government's efforts aimed at boosting exports provide hope for a potential rebound in the country's trade balance in the future.
