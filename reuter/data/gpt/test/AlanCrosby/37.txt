Prague Stock Exchange Slips from Year High on Profit-Taking, But Analysts Remain Bullish
The Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) retreated from its year high on Thursday as investors took profits. However, analysts on the street are still bullish, seeing potential for further growth.
During trading, PSE's main index slipped by 1.56 percent to 1,022.96 points. In spite of this decline, the index is around 21% higher than it was at the start of the year.
The benchmark index had reached its highest level since 2008 on the day before, thanks to dramatic gains by a few stocks. Eclectic energy holding CEZ AS, lender Komercni Banka AS, and Prosiebensat1 Ptnr SE fared best.   The momentum slowed down the following day, with all three companies falling in value.
Analysts attribute the drop to profit-taking by investors who had taken long positions in anticipation of the annual results. They also point to some nervousness fed by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
"Given the rise in prices in the last six months, one can say that it was only a matter of time before the market succumbed to profit-taking," said Jan Strejc, an analyst with Patria Finance. He further stated that investors took the opportunity to sell and reap their profits.
Nonetheless, analysts remain upbeat about the PSE's prospects. They suggest that the present dip in stock prices presents a buying opportunity. They underscored positive expected outcomes for this year, including healthy profit margins, steady economic growth, and attractive valuations.
"Apart from the Covid-19 and political uncertainty, the sentiment and outlook for the Czech market remain constructive. The Czech Republic is becoming a cheaper hub for investment as a secondary destination compared to the core markets," maintained Strejc.
Jan Vejmelek; an analyst with Komerční banka, argued that the stock prices were not excessively high, given solid economic data and appreciable growth.
"Accumulated corporate earnings in Czech companies in 2019 are expected to bring a 4% growth in profits, which, apart from 2017, would be the highest rate since 2008," he added.
The positive economic outlook is fed by consumer confidence and a stable labor market; all indications of steady growth. Vejmelek also emphasized that, despite the dip, the stock prices were still within the bounds of previously predicted rates.
Another factor to consider is the drop in lending rates. Vejmelek mentioned that even with the news that the Czech National Bank had held rates steady, lending rates had dropped due to the economic downturn.
Analysts are keeping a close eye on future developments, primarily because of the unpredictability of the ongoing pandemic. They also caution investors to make informed decisions and not be swayed by short-term fluctuations.
"The factors that brought about the rise in prices before the decline have not vanished. Thus, there is no reason to panic," concluded Vejmelek.
