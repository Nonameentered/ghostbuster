Czech Blue Chip Shares Close Higher, Spurring Prague Stock Exchange to Third Consecutive Advancing Session
The Prague Stock Exchange closed with gains on Tuesday, marking its third consecutive advancing session, buoyed by blue chip companies that closed higher. The PX index ended the day with a 1.2% rise to 1,087.53 points.
Shares of the conglomerate PPF Group advanced 2.6%, while the largest Czech bank, Ceska Sporitelna, rose 3.1%. Its rival, Komercni Banka, increased by 1.5%, and the insurer VIG rose by 1.4%.
The Czech economy is rebounding from the pandemic, with analysts expecting a GDP growth of 3.7% this year, driven by domestic demand and in line with estimates of the European Commission. However, they also warn of a possible slowdown in the coming months due to rising Covid-19 cases in the Czech Republic and around the world.
Investor sentiment is also buoyed by the European Central Bank's decision to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy. The ECB announced last week that it would increase its bond-buying program in an effort to support the region's economic recovery.
The Prague Stock Exchange's solid performance mirrors the positive trends seen in other European indices. The Stoxx 600 index, which benchmarks Europe's largest companies, advanced on Tuesday by 0.66%. Germany's DAX index also gained, rising by 0.49%.
The strong performance of Czech blue chip companies is a reflection of the country's robust economic fundamentals and promising prospects for growth. Analysts note that the country has emerged as one of the most attractive investment destinations in Central Europe.
The Prague Stock Exchange is expected to continue its upward trend, with investors poised to benefit from the country's economic rebound and overall favorable investment climate.
