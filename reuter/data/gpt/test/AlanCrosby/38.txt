Prague, Czech Republic- The Czech Republic’s inflation trend continues its descent, with August’s headline inflation at 2.9% year-on-year, down from July’s 3.3%, according to the statistics released by the Czech Statistical Office on Monday.
The drop in the inflation rate was due to slower growth in food prices, as well as a decline in fuel prices. Prices of vegetables fell by 2% compared to July, while oil prices decreased by 8%, contributing to the decrease in fuel prices.
However, despite this downtrend, the country’s central bank is still expected to keep its monetary policy tight, as it seeks to push inflation back to its 2% target and prevent economic overheating.
At the end of June, the Czech National Bank raised its key interest rate to 0.75%, marking the first increase since 2008. The move was meant to keep inflation from spiraling out of control; the rate hike came despite government warnings that it could harm the country’s export-driven economy.
In the past few weeks, the central bank has again been the focus of public and political attention due to its supposed readiness to continue its hard-line course despite signs of weakening consumer demand.
On September 1st, the bank’s governor, Jiri Rusnok, warned that it could raise rates again soon if inflation doesn’t slow down. He emphasized, however, that any monetary policy change would depend on the outlook for the domestic economy.
“It´s very important to emphasize that before we consider raising interest rates again, we need to see how the economy develops in coming weeks or months,” Rusnok said.
Nevertheless, many economists predict that the central bank will keep its benchmark rate unchanged, or may cut it slightly, at its next meeting in September.
“The inflation trend is lower than the central bank expected, and the growth outlook is mixed,” said Radomir Jac, Chief Economist at Generali Investments CEE. “Therefore, we think the central bank will not raise rates again this year and may even lower them by only 0.25 percentage points.”
Jac added that further headwinds for the Czech economy came from the worsening global trade environment, which was slowing growth in exports, the country’s main growth driver.
“Looking forward, the central bank will be watching the inflation outlook closely, especially with the expectations of lower energy prices in the coming months,” Jac said. “We believe that the central bank will be more dovish in its approach and may moderate its expectations for inflation in 2020.”
Meanwhile, Czech political leaders have warned the central bank against a too-tight monetary policy stance, arguing that this could potentially damage the country’s economy, which is driven mainly by exports.
Prime Minister Andrej Babis has raised concerns that the rate hike could harm small businesses and lower-wage earners by increasing borrowing costs, which may also eventually lead to a slowdown in consumer spending and a loss of jobs. 
Despite vocal criticism, the bank has remained firm on its monetary policy stance, stating that it remains committed to combatting potential inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, the central bank has left the door open for further adjustments to its policy, provided that it will not harm the domestic economy.
The Czech Republic has enjoyed a robust economic expansion in recent years, driven largely by strong growth in the auto manufacturing and technology sectors. However, the country’s economy has shown signs of slowing down, as exports to key trading partners like Germany and China have declined.
At the same time, the bank’s latest move to tighten monetary policy has brought it into the spotlight and could hamper the country's economy. Yet, the central bank remains determined to and has been vocal in maintaining a reputation of being one of the most prudent, among the central banks in Europe.
