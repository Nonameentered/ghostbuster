The East European markets have been on a roll recently, soaring to new highs as foreign investors push prices up. This surge in the markets has been driven by a range of factors, including increased demand for goods and services, a growing middle class, and a general sense of optimism among investors.
In recent months, the Warsaw Stock Exchange in Poland and the Bucharest Stock Exchange in Romania have both hit record highs. Other markets in the region, including Hungary and the Czech Republic, have also seen strong gains.
According to experts, the surge in foreign investment is a major driver of this growth. In particular, investors from Western Europe and the United States are increasingly turning their attention to East European markets in search of higher returns.
One factor that has contributed to this trend is the relatively low valuations of East European stocks. According to data from Bloomberg, the MSCI Emerging Markets Eastern Europe Index trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 9.9, compared to a ratio of 14.8 for the broader MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
This lower valuation has made East European markets more attractive to foreign investors, who are looking for opportunities to earn higher returns. In particular, investors are interested in the region's fast-growing tech sector, which has produced a number of successful companies in recent years.
One such company is Allegro, an e-commerce platform based in Poland. The company went public on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in October 2020, raising $2.3 billion in an initial public offering. The IPO was the largest in the history of the exchange and was seen as a major milestone for the Polish tech industry.
Other tech companies in the region have also seen strong growth. For example, CEE-focused venture capital firm Earlybird Digital East recently invested in a number of promising startups, including Budapest-based music tech company Impulse Labs, and Slovakian cybersecurity firm Eset.
The growing popularity of East European markets has also been driven by a growing middle class in the region. As incomes have risen, consumers in countries like Poland, Romania, and Hungary have become more willing to spend on goods and services. This has led to increased demand for a range of products, from cars and electronics to luxury goods and travel.
As a result, a number of companies in the region have seen strong growth in recent years. Examples include Wizz Air, a low-cost airline based in Hungary, which has seen its profits rise steadily in recent years, and Emerging Europe Properties Fund, a real estate investment trust based in London that invests in retail properties in the region.
Despite the strong growth in East European markets, some analysts warn that there are risks involved in investing in the region. In particular, political instability in countries like Poland and Hungary could pose a threat to investors, as could economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nevertheless, many investors remain bullish on the region's prospects. Sean Darby, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, recently told CNBC that he sees "lots of opportunities" in East European markets, thanks to the region's strong economic growth and relatively attractive valuations.
"East Europe is probably the cheapest and most attractive region within emerging markets," he said. "On a relative basis, the returns could be quite good."
Overall, it seems that East European markets are poised for continued growth in the coming months and years. With foreign investors increasingly turning their attention to the region, and a growing middle class driving demand for goods and services, the outlook for these markets looks bright. However, investors should be aware of the risks involved and should approach these markets with caution.
