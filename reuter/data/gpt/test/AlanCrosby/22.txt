Eastern European stock markets have surged with strong foreign buying, leading Poland and Hungary to reach their year-highs. Analysts suggest that the surge is due to investors’ preference for emerging markets and a weaker US dollar. 
The Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) has been on a rally since the beginning of the year and is currently up by 6.2%. Hungary's benchmark stock index, the BUX, is up by 6.7%. Other markets in the broader Eastern European region have also soared, with Czech Republic’s PX index up by 5.2% and Romania’s BET index up by 8%.
The buying spree by global investors has caused the foreign holdings in Polish shares alone to reach a record high of 59.9%, which is up from the 50% recorded in 2015. In Hungary, foreigners own more than 50% of listed equities, which means that they are increasingly becoming the dominant force in the local markets.
Market analysts believe that the surge in Eastern European markets is largely due to improved European economic conditions, which have boosted investor confidence. Over the past few years, Eastern Europe has struggled with an economic slump that has resulted in low growth rates.
However, the region is now benefiting from a rebound in the global economy, which has led to stronger demand for its commodities and services. Eastern Europe enjoys the advantage of a low-cost advantage in the manufacturing and services sector, which makes it more attractive to foreign investors.
Apart from this, the region has also been benefiting from the weaker US dollar. Investors are looking to emerging markets for better returns, as valuations in developed markets have become increasingly expensive. This is good news for Eastern Europe, as its stocks offer better value than those in the US or Europe and are therefore attracting attention from global investors.
Poland and Hungary are leading the pack in terms of investor appetite. Poland’s rising markets have been attributed to the country’s strong macroeconomic data, which has bucked the trend in the region. Solid economic growth, low unemployment, and rising consumer confidence have all helped to boost investor sentiment in the country.
In Hungary, the government has been implementing policies aimed at attracting foreign investment, and this has paid off. The country’s track record in cutting its budget deficit, improving public services and strengthening its financial regulation has had a positive impact on investor sentiment.
Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, recently stated that net foreign direct investment in Hungary this year is likely to be above €4 billion, which is a record high for the country. The government has also introduced tax incentives aimed at encouraging large multinationals to set up shop in the country.
Despite the strong performance of the Eastern European markets, there are still uncertainties that could limit the rally. For instance, there are concerns that the ongoing trade disputes between the US and China could have negative implications for global markets.
Moreover, investors are keeping a close eye on the central banks in the region. The European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to start raising interest rates next year, which could have a negative impact on the performance of the Eastern European markets. A stronger euro could make the region's assets less competitive for foreign investors.
Despite these uncertainties, analysts expect the Eastern European markets to remain attractive to global investors. The region’s low-cost advantage and its position as an emerging market make it a compelling investment opportunity. Moreover, the strong macroeconomic indicators, coupled with government policies aimed at attracting foreign investment, suggest that the region is ripe for growth.
The rally in the Eastern European markets is a promising sign for the region, which has been struggling to recover from the economic slump of the past few years. Poland and Hungary’s strong performance is indicative of a broader resurgence of the region, which could see it emerge as a global investment hot spot in the coming years.
