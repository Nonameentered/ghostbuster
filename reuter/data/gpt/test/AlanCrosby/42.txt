Prague, Czech Republic - The Czech crown sees its exchange rate rebounding as foreign currency selling bolsters the market. However, dealers remain cautious amid uncertainties in the global economy and domestic politics.
The Czech crown, since the conversion to a free-floating currency, is known for its volatility. Its exchange rate against the euro dipped below the 27 crowns per euro mark last week, lowest since December last year. But, in the past few days, selling of foreign currency by local exporters and investors boosted the crown, which traded at 26.6 to the euro on Monday.
The country's central bank has been monitoring the crown's exchange rate since 2013. On that year, they shifted their policy towards maintaining low inflation and not targeting a specific exchange rate, including for the crown.
However, the bank has intervened in the currency market several times since, both to prevent the crown from appreciating too fast as well as from depreciating too much. The most recent intervention was in May when the central bank sold the equivalent of $1.3 billion in May to prop up the crown.
"The crown's exchange rate is primarily influenced by the state of the global economy, the development of risk sentiment and the domestic political situation," commented Lukas Kovanda, an analyst at Cyrrus, a brokerage firm.
Kovanda added that the trade war between the U.S. and China, along with the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, remains the most significant external factors that could negatively impact the Czech economy.
Moreover, the Czech Republic has its own political challenges. The minority government led by Prime Minister Andrej Babis recently faced a vote of no-confidence, which the government survived. The political situation adds another layer of uncertainty to an already turbulent economic environment.
Investors worldwide are increasingly opting for safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen or the Swiss franc amid the tensions. The Czech crown and other emerging market currencies remain outside investors' radar, making it vulnerable to sudden changes in market sentiment.
"Czech data should remain supportive, meaning that the best case for the CZK will be to maintain the status quo - a relatively weak but stable exchange rate," said Petr Kocourek, an analyst at Komercni Banka.
Kocourek added that a sudden appreciation of the crown may lead the central bank to intervene, as it would threaten the country's export industry, which thrives on a weak exchange rate.
The Czech Republic is highly dependent on exports, which accounted for more than 80% of the country's gross domestic product last year. The automotive industry is one of the leading export industries in the country, with production representing around 10% of the country's GDP.
Despite the recent rebound of the crown's exchange rate, dealers remain cautious, aware of the potential risks that could affect the Czech economy.
"The Czech crown's exchange rate remains vulnerable to sudden changes in market sentiment, as well as to any escalation of global trade tensions and the political situation domestically," Kovanda concluded.
