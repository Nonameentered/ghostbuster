Prague, Czech Republic - The Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babis, has voiced his support for the creation of a market regulator in the country to increase transparency and boost confidence in the Prague bourse.
In recent years, the Czech market has struggled to attract foreign investment due to concerns over corruption and a lack of oversight. Babis, a billionaire businessman who was elected to office in 2017, has made the need to bolster the country's economic credibility a top priority of his administration.
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Babis said that the creation of a market regulator would be a crucial step in improving the reputation of the Czech Republic's financial markets.
"We need a strong and independent regulator that can ensure that our markets are transparent and fair," he said. "Investors need to know that when they put their money into the Czech Republic, they are doing so in a safe and secure environment."
Babis added that the government was currently working on a plan to establish a market regulator, which would oversee the activities of the Prague bourse and other financial institutions in the country.
However, Babis also acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the confidence of investors in the Czech market. He noted that while the country's economy had shown signs of improvement in recent years, there were still significant challenges that needed to be addressed.
"We need to create a more business-friendly environment in the Czech Republic," he said. "We need to reduce bureaucracy, improve infrastructure, and make it easier for companies to do business here."
Babis also said that the country needed to do a better job of promoting itself as a destination for foreign investment. He noted that while there were many advantages to investing in the Czech Republic, such as its skilled workforce and low labor costs, these assets were not being fully utilized by companies interested in doing business in the country.
"We need to be more proactive in promoting the Czech Republic as an attractive investment destination," he said. "We need to showcase our strengths and create an environment that makes it easy for companies to set up shop here."
Despite these challenges, Babis remained optimistic about the prospects for the Czech market. He noted that the country's GDP had grown by 2.4% in 2019, and that the government had implemented a number of reforms aimed at boosting economic growth.
"The Czech Republic is in a good position to attract investment," he said. "We have a stable economy, a skilled workforce, and a strategic location in the heart of Europe. We just need to do a better job of promoting ourselves and creating an environment that is conducive to investment."
In conclusion, the creation of a market regulator is an important step in improving the transparency and credibility of the Czech market. However, more needs to be done to address the challenges facing the country, such as corruption, bureaucracy, and a lack of promotion. With the right reforms and a proactive approach to attracting investment, the Czech Republic has the potential to become a leading destination for foreign investors in the years ahead.
