The Czech Statistical Bureau has predicted an economic upturn in the country, but has also warned over growing trade and current account deficits.
According to the bureau, the Czech economy is expected to grow by 2.9% this year, compared to 2.4% in 2016. This growth is largely due to strong domestic demand, which is being driven by rising wages, low unemployment and increased spending.
However, the bureau also raised concerns over the country's growing trade and current account deficits. In the first quarter of 2017, the trade deficit widened to CZK 44.1 billion ($1.8 billion), compared to CZK 27.9 billion in the same period last year. Meanwhile, the current account deficit reached CZK 13.9 billion, compared to a surplus of CZK 12.4 billion in the first quarter of 2016.
The bureau said that the growing deficits were largely due to a rise in imports, particularly of raw materials and energy. This has been partly caused by the booming manufacturing sector, which is driven by the country's export-oriented economy.
"While it is positive to see the economy growing, we must be cautious about the risks posed by rising trade and current account deficits," said the bureau's spokesperson, Karel Havlicek. "We need to ensure that we maintain a good balance between imports and exports, and focus on developing our export capabilities in new markets."
Indeed, the Czech Republic is heavily reliant on exports to the European Union, with around 80% of its exports going to the bloc. This leaves the country vulnerable to any disruption to trade caused by Brexit or the rise of protectionism.
To counter this, the bureau is urging the government to focus on diversifying its exports, particularly to emerging markets in Asia and Africa. It is also calling for greater investment in research and development, as well as in infrastructure, to help support the manufacturing sector.
In addition, the bureau is proposing a number of measures to help tackle the growing trade and current account deficits, including the introduction of incentives for companies to invest in more energy-efficient equipment and the implementation of measures to encourage greater use of renewable energy sources.
The bureau's forecast comes amid growing concerns over the impact of Brexit on the Czech economy. The UK is the country's fifth-largest export market, with around 6% of Czech exports going to the UK. Any disruption to trade with the UK could have a significant impact on the country's economy, particularly in the manufacturing sector.
However, the bureau's spokesperson said that the impact of Brexit on the Czech economy was still unclear, given the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations.
"At this stage, it is difficult to predict the exact impact of Brexit on our economy, given that the negotiations are ongoing," said Havlicek. "But what is clear is that we need to be prepared for all eventualities and ensure that we diversify our exports and continue to invest in our manufacturing sector."
Despite the challenges posed by the growing trade and current account deficits, the outlook for the Czech economy remains positive, according to the bureau. However, it warned that the government must act quickly to address these issues if it is to sustain the country's economic growth in the long term.
