In a closely contested Davis Cup tie, the Czech Republic emerged victorious over India. The final score was 3-2, with the Czech team winning both of the singles matches and one of the doubles matches.
The first singles match between Jiri Vesely of the Czech Republic and Prajnesh Gunneswaran of India went to a fifth set, with Vesely ultimately prevailing 6-4, 2-6, 6-7(6), 7-6(6), 6-4. In the second singles match, Lukas Rosol of the Czech Republic defeated Ramkumar Ramanathan of India in straight sets, 7-6(2), 6-4, 6-3.
India fought back in the doubles, with Gunneswaran and Divij Sharan defeating Vesely and Rosol of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-7(6), 7-6(5), 6-4. This sent the tie to a deciding fifth rubber, with both teams needing a win to advance to the next round.
In the final singles match, Sumit Nagal of India faced Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic. Machac won the match in four sets, 6-1, 1-6, 6-4, 7-5, clinching the tie for his team.
However, the win came at a cost for the Czech Republic. Sebastian Korda, the team's top player who had won his singles match on day one, was forced to withdraw from the rest of the tie due to injury. Korda had been scheduled to play in the doubles match on day two, but was replaced by Rosol.
The injury is a blow to Korda's promising start to the season. The 20-year-old had won his first ATP title in January at the Delray Beach Open, and had reached the fourth round of the Australian Open before losing to Rafael Nadal. He is currently ranked 104th in the world, and is seen as one of the rising stars of men's tennis.
The Czech Republic will now advance to the World Group Qualifiers, where they will face either Croatia or Australia in September. The winners of the Qualifiers will advance to the 2022 Davis Cup Finals in Madrid.
India, meanwhile, will have to try again in the Group I Asia/Oceania zone in September. They will face either Uzbekistan or South Korea, with the winner advancing to the Qualifiers.
Despite the loss, India can take heart from their performances in this tie. They pushed the Czech Republic to the limit, and came within a whisker of causing an upset. With a little more luck, they could have easily won the tie themselves.
For the Czech Republic, the win is a sign that they remain a force to be reckoned with in Davis Cup competition. Despite the absence of Korda, they showed great resilience and depth, and will be hoping to carry that form into the Qualifiers.
