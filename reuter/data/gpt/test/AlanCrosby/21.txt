Prague, Czech Republic - The Czech Republic's economic outlook remained bleak as a new report projected December's trade deficit to rise, thereby marking the end of the nation's worst trading year in recent history.
According to data from the Czech Statistical Office, December's trade deficit is expected to climb to 14.1 billion crowns ($627.56 million) from November's 6.2 billion, driven by a surge in imports and surging demand for consumer goods. The report projects exports to grow by 1.3 percent, while imports are anticipated to increase by 8.9 percent.
This new data shows that the country's economy is struggling to recover from its worst trading year since the global financial crisis hit the country in 2009. The year-long trade deficit is estimated to be around 182.6 billion crowns ($8.1 billion), an increase of nearly 76 percent compared with the previous year.
Capital Economics, a UK-based consultancy firm, stated that the December trade data placed the Czech Republic's economy on a weaker footing heading into 2021, with the country's automotive and machinery industries continuing to grapple with anemic global demand and supply chain disruptions.
The Czech Republic, a major exporter of goods, was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which battered trade with Germany, the country's biggest trading partner. Furthermore, the country has been forced to endure several rounds of lockdowns due to the pandemic, which have severely affected its tourism and hospitality sectors.
Despite these setbacks, the country has been successfully expanding into new markets, as exports to China increased by 34 percent from January to November of last year, with shipments to Vietnam and Kazakhstan also rising. However, business activity has been stagnant overall, and while some factories and firms have restarted production, others are still struggling to operate at full capacity.
"Czech exporters are dependent on a relatively high degree of automation in their production processes, which is why they cannot fully appreciate the benefits of the gradual reopening of stores and restaurants," said David Marek, an economist at Deloitte.
The Czech government, which has spent a significant chunk of its fiscal buffers to provide support to local businesses and households, recently announced a series of measures aimed at fostering economic growth. These measures include reducing social security contributions and corporate income taxes and investing in infrastructure.
"The national road agency's program is crucial. Our public budgets must first and foremost focus on future investments, large-scale infrastructure projects, and R&D," said Prime Minister Andrej Babis.
The government also pledged to provide further financial assistance to sectors hit the hardest by the pandemic, including tourism and hospitality.
Despite these initiatives, the Czech Republic's economy is still projected to shrink by around 5.5 percent in 2020, marking its worst contraction in over 30 years.
In light of this, experts have urged the government to prioritize investment in innovation and technology, which they believe will be fundamental in spurring a sustainable economic recovery.
"The pandemic has highlighted the need to focus on investing in key areas, such as innovation and research. These are essential in driving economic growth because they help foster new industries and support technology transfer," says Jan Machacek, an economist at Raiffeisenbank.
In conclusion, the Czech Republic's economy is facing significant headwinds as it enters the new year. While the government has implemented several measures aimed at stimulating economic growth, experts are urging the authorities to invest more in innovation and technology, which they believe will be vital in jumpstarting a sustainable recovery.
