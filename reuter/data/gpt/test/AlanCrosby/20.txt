Budapest, Hungary - The Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE), Hungary's primary stock exchange gained record high on the back of a surge in foreign buying. The BSE index, which closed at 43,576 last week, recorded a significant increase of 1.7%, the highest in six months. The surge in foreign buying from institutional investors encouraged optimism, signaling a potential rebound in Hungary's stock market.
The Hungarian market has been unstable in recent years, but foreign investors' confidence in the economy has gradually improved. The government's strategic plans to attract foreign investments and pursue greater economic growth through foreign direct investments helped to attract global investment funds. According to Budapest strategist Andor Racz, the inflow of foreign capital in the stock market is driving the economic growth of the country, and the trend is expected to continue over the long-term.
The past year has seen an inflow of foreign investment that has resulted in a marked improvement in the overall economic growth of the country. According to the Central Statistical Office (KSH), the Hungarian economy grew at a better-than-expected rate of 11.5% in the second quarter of 2021, driven both by strong exports and a marked uptick in consumer spending. The KSH attributed the growth to the easing of pandemic restrictions, which allowed for a more robust performance across virtually all sectors of the economy.
Furthermore, the Hungarian government's focus on improving the country's business environment has been successful. Hungary ranked 62nd on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, up eleven places from last year. The government has led multiple initiatives to make it easier to stablish foreign-owned businesses in Hungary. For example, Hungary has introduced tax incentives, such as a reduced corporate tax rate of 9%, one of the lowest in Europe.
The improved economic condition is attracting institutional investors to invest in the country, which is driving the stock market to new records. According to market indicators, institutional investors' interest in the Hungarian stock market has grown since the pandemic. Many investors believe that Hungary has a lot of potential for growth, especially in the tech sector, which is considered a high-growth area for the country.
Foreign investors increased their position in the country after they learned that Hungary had managed to attract major companies to invest in Hungary. For instance, the German-based automobile manufacturing company BMW and the Korean based automobile company Samsung chose Hungary for their businesses. Approximately two years ago, Samsung decided to invest around €300 million in a battery factory located in Göd, Hungary. Similarly, BMW decided to build a factory in Debrecen, Hungary, which will cost around $1.2 billion.
In addition to these global brands, Hungary has also attracted a significant number of successful start-ups from Europe and Asia. Start-ups such as Balazs Paroczay's Umnai, a chatbot for recruitment, and AI-powered insurtech Yukka Lab, which applies AI on financial legal textual analysis, have gained global recognition. The Hungarian government's supportive approach towards technology start-ups, such as tax incentives and funding from the Central European Venture Cup, has fostered an environment conducive to innovative entrepreneurial ventures. Such favorable market conditions help to attract additional foreign investors, adding to the growth momentum.
The favorable economic condition has even prompted bond investors to turn to Hungary. The country managed to sell €1.5 billion worth of Euro bonds last year. The success of the bond issue indicates that investors regard Hungary as a healthy emerging market economy with considerable potential for growth.
The positive trend in the BSE Index signifies that investors are optimistic about the economy's future. It's a good indication that even if global investors are somewhat cautious, they are confident in Hungary's economic direction. There are still risks involved in investing in emerging markets, but the Hungarian Government has established policies that are supportive of its domestic market, the benefits of which have created an optimistic market outlook.
Conclusion:
Foreign investors' optimism about Hungary's economic progress is increasingly apparent. Continued investment inflows have reached record highs, buoying up the stock market to new highs. This trend of foreign investment reflects the success of the government's strategic approach to attracting FDI and creating a more favorable business environment. With Hungary's growth potential proving attractive to institutional investors, capital inflows are providing the necessary investment pool for the country's economic development. For investors in Hungary, the future is looking bright, and further optimistic growth is predicted in the near future.
