The Czech crown has continued to strengthen in recent weeks, causing speculation that the Central Bank of the Czech Republic may intervene to prevent any further appreciation.
As of Tuesday, the Czech crown was trading at 21.76 against the euro, its strongest position since late 2018 and representing a gain of more than 5% in the past two months.
Analysts are attributing the rise of the Czech currency to several factors, including strong economic data, rising inflation expectations, and the recent agreement on the European Union's COVID-19 recovery fund.
"The Czech economy has been performing really well lately, with strong readings on industrial output, retail sales, and other key indicators," said Petr Zamrazil, chief economist at Patria Finance. "There's also a sense that the European Union is getting its act together, which is good news for Czech exporters."
However, the sharp rise in the Czech crown has some worried that it may damage the country's competitiveness and hurt its vital export sector.
"Czech companies are already struggling with higher commodity prices and supply chain disruptions, and a strong currency will only make things more difficult," said Petr Fabus, CEO of the Czech Confederation of Industry. "We need the central bank to step in and prevent this appreciation from going too far."
The central bank has so far been quiet on the issue, but some analysts believe it may intervene soon to cool off the currency's rise. The bank has a history of using interventions to prevent excessive currency appreciation, having sold the crown in 2013 and 2017 to weaken it.
"The central bank has a lot of tools at its disposal, including interest rate cuts and currency interventions," said Jan Cernohorsky, chief FX strategist at Komercni Banka. "If the crown continues to strengthen, it's very possible that the bank will act to prevent any further appreciation."
Despite the potential for intervention, some market participants remain bullish on the Czech crown. The country's strong economic fundamentals and relatively low debt levels have made it an attractive destination for investors seeking higher yields.
"Czech assets are really standing out right now," said Ondrej Klingsporn, head of fixed income at Liontrust. "We're seeing a lot of inflows into Czech bonds and equities, which is supporting the currency."
Others caution that the rally could be short-lived, especially if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens or if global trade tensions escalate.
"The situation is still very fragile, and there are still a lot of risks on the horizon," said Zamrazil. "We need to be vigilant and not get too carried away by short-term market movements."
For now, the Czech crown continues to climb higher, with some analysts predicting that it could reach 21.50 against the euro in the coming weeks. Whether the central bank will intervene to put a cap on the currency's rise remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the Czech economy is on the upswing and investors are taking notice.
