Bass plc., the UK based beverage company, has increased its stake in the Czech brewer Radegast to 30%. The deal was officially confirmed by Radegast on Monday after months of negotiations.
Radegast is a popular brewery in the Czech Republic, which produces beer under several brands, including the popular Radegast brand. The brewery has a significant market share in the Czech Republic and exports to several European and Asian countries.
Bass plc had acquired a 10% stake in the company last year, and this new investment has now elevated their position as the largest shareholder. Industry experts believe that Bass is looking to expand its presence in the Central and Eastern European market, and Radegast is the perfect fit for such an expansion.
Commenting on the deal, the CEO of Bass plc, John Smith, said, "We are pleased to announce this investment, which further strengthens our partnership with Radegast. With our increased stake, we look forward to working closely with the management team to drive growth and explore new markets."
Radegast CEO, Petr Samec, also expressed his excitement about the deal, saying, "We are thrilled to have Bass plc as our largest shareholder. Their expertise and resources will be valuable assets as we continue to expand our distribution network and product portfolio."
The deal is also expected to benefit the Czech economy, as Radegast has a significant presence in the country, employing over 1,200 people across various sectors. The brewery is also committed to sourcing its raw materials locally, further supporting the local economy.
However, the deal has attracted some criticism from local activists, who fear that a foreign company's increased stake in a domestic brewer could lead to loss of jobs and revenue. But, both Bass plc and Radegast have assured that they will continue to operate as an independent entity, with no immediate plans for any restructuring.
Overall, the deal marks a significant milestone for Bass plc and Radegast, with both companies looking to leverage their strengths and synergies for mutual growth and long-term sustainability.
