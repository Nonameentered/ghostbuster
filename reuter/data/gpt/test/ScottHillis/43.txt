In an address to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), Chinese President Jiang Zemin called on the army to firmly align with the ruling Communist Party, a move that would cement his position as the political heir of Deng Xiaoping. The speech, which was made during a meeting of the Central Military Commission, emphasized the need for the military to remain loyal to the party and the country, and to follow the leadership of the Central Committee.
Jiang, who served as president of China from 1993 to 2003, has long been seen as a protege of Deng Xiaoping, the revolutionary hero who led the country through its post-Maoist economic reforms. Jiang rose to the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1989, and later became chairman of the Central Military Commission in 1989 and president in 1993. He is widely credited with maintaining stability and promoting economic growth during his time in power.
Jiang’s speech to the PLA emphasized the importance of maintaining the party’s control over the military, a key element of the country’s political system. “The military must firmly adhere to the strategic thinking and basic principles of the party, and resolutely follow the instructions of the Central Committee,” Jiang said. “We must consolidate the party’s leadership over the military and ensure that the army becomes a strong and modern force that is loyal to the party and the people.”
The speech comes at a time of heightened tension between China and the United States, with both countries engaged in a trade war that has shaken the global economy. China’s military has also been increasingly active in the South China Sea, a strategic region that is claimed by several countries in the region, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The U.S. has criticized China’s actions in the South China Sea, and has sent naval vessels to assert its presence in the region.
Many observers see Jiang’s speech as an attempt to consolidate his power, and to position himself as the leader who can steer the Chinese economy through the current uncertainty. Although he has not held formal political office since retiring as president in 2003, Jiang remains influential in the Communist Party, and is seen as a mentor by many of China’s current leaders.
Jiang’s speech also highlighted the need for the military to modernize and become a more professional force. “The PLA must adapt to the demands of the new era and to the changing landscape of national security,” he said. “We need to enhance our capabilities in areas such as information technology, artificial intelligence, and remote sensing, and to improve our ability to defend our nation against all threats.”
Overall, Jiang’s speech to the PLA appears to be an attempt to consolidate his power within the Communist Party, and to position himself as the country’s leading figure on military and national security issues. It remains to be seen how the military will respond to his call for greater loyalty to the party, but it is clear that Jiang is determined to maintain his influence and secure his legacy as Deng Xiaoping’s political heir.
