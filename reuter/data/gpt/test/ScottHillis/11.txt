A curfew has been imposed in a town in China's volatile Xinjiang region after a deadly separatist riot broke out on Monday.
The riot, which occurred in the town of Yarkand, left at least 27 people dead and 13 others injured. According to state media, the riot was instigated by a group of separatists who attacked police officers and government officials.
The Xinjiang region has been the site of tension and violence between local Uighur Muslims and the Han Chinese minority for years. Uighur separatists have been campaigning for independence, complaining that Beijing's policies have marginalized their community.
The riot in Yarkand is the latest in a series of violent incidents in the region. In 2014, a series of bombings in the capital city of Urumqi left 31 people dead and more than 90 injured. The following year, ethnic riots in the town of Lukqun left at least 35 people dead.
The Chinese government has responded to the violence with a heavy-handed crackdown on Uighur separatists. In recent years, the government has increased security measures in the region, including deploying thousands of troops, constructing surveillance towers and conducting mass detentions.
The government has also implemented a range of measures aimed at suppressing Uighur culture and religion, including restricting the use of the Uighur language, banning beards and veils in public and demolishing mosques.
The Chinese government has defended its actions, saying that the security measures are necessary to prevent terrorism and protect the country's national unity.
However, human rights groups have criticized the government's treatment of Uighurs, saying that it amounts to state-sanctioned discrimination and repression.
"The Chinese authorities have created a highly repressive surveillance state in Xinjiang and are using it to commit serious human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim population," said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's East Asia Director.
The curfew in Yarkand is likely to exacerbate tensions in the region. The town is a predominantly Uighur area, and many Uighurs are likely to see the curfew as an oppressive measure.
The authorities have not yet announced how long the curfew will remain in place or what measures will be taken to maintain order in the town.
Meanwhile, Chinese officials are trying to play down the violence in Yarkand, saying that the situation is under control.
"The violent terrorist attack in Yarkand County has been effectively controlled," said Shohrat Zakir, the chairman of the Xinjiang government, in a statement posted on the government's website.
However, Uighur activists and exiles say that the situation in the region is far from under control.
"We call on the international community to pay attention to the unjust treatment of Uighurs and to take concrete actions to stop the Chinese government's oppression," said Dilshat Rexit, a spokesman for the World Uighur Congress.
The violence in Yarkand is a stark reminder that the tensions between Uighurs and Han Chinese are far from resolved. As long as the government continues to pursue its heavy-handed policies in the region, the risk of violence and instability will remain high.
