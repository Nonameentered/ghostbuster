On Tuesday, a South Korean government official revealed progress in talks with China regarding the fate of a senior North Korean leader who has reportedly defected from Pyongyang. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that high-level negotiations between South Korea and China have been ongoing for several weeks, and that they are making headway in finding a solution to the delicate situation.
The senior North Korean official, who has been identified as Jo Song Gil, was the North Korean ambassador to Italy before he reportedly defected with his family in November of last year. Since then, he has been under the protection of the Italian government, which granted him asylum. However, Italy has been under pressure from both North Korea and China to hand over Jo and his family, which has caused tensions between the two countries.
South Korea has been involved in efforts to secure Jo's safe passage out of Italy and into a third country, where he and his family can receive permanent asylum. China has been a key player in these negotiations, given its close ties to North Korea and its position as a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council.
According to the South Korean official, the talks with China have been focused on convincing China to allow Jo and his family to travel through Chinese territory on their way to a third country. China has been concerned about the potential diplomatic backlash from North Korea if it were to allow Jo to leave, but South Korea has been making the case that it is in China's interest to cooperate.
"We believe that China understands the gravity of the situation, and we are encouraged by the progress that has been made so far," the official said. "Both sides are committed to finding a solution that is satisfactory for all parties involved."
The official declined to provide further details on the negotiations, citing the sensitivity of the issue, but said that South Korea is working closely with its allies and partners around the world to ensure that Jo's safety and security are protected.
"The North Korean regime has a long history of punishing defectors and their families, and we are deeply concerned for Jo's well-being," the official said. "We are doing everything in our power to ensure that he and his family are able to live free from fear of persecution."
The case of Jo Song Gil has attracted international attention, with many countries expressing support for his asylum claim and condemnation of North Korea's human rights abuses. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the negotiations between South Korea and China will be, but the progress that has been reported suggests that a solution may be within reach.
