Valentine's Day Blooms Big Profits for Flower Vendors in China
Valentine's Day is one of the busiest times for florists all around the world, and China is no exception. The day is fast becoming a significant event in the Chinese calendar, with couples exchanging flowers, cards, chocolates, and other gifts to express their love and appreciation for each other. The demand for flowers is so great during this time that some florists in China have reported a ten-fold increase in sales compared to an average day.
A recent survey conducted in China by a Beijing-based market research firm found that, on average, Chinese couples spent around 1,500 yuan ($232) on Valentine's Day gifts in 2020. The survey also revealed that the most popular gift for Chinese women was fresh flowers. As a result, florists in China make the most of this romantic day, and they tend to stock up on their inventory weeks in advance to cater to the high demand.
One such florist is Chen Siyu, who has been running his flower shop in Beijing for over six years. Siyu told Xinhua News Agency that he had never seen anything like this year's demand. "I have been selling flowers for six years, but this year, the demand for flowers during Valentine's Day has broken all records. I have never seen so many orders for flowers in one day," he said.
According to Siyu, roses are the most popular flowers requested by customers, especially red ones that symbolize love and passion. He also revealed that other flowers such as carnations, lilies, and peonies are also in high demand, depending on customers' preferences and budget.
The surge in demand for flowers during Valentine's Day is not only limited to brick-and-mortar stores. E-commerce platforms are also cashing in on the event, and many online flower shops have seen a significant increase in orders. One such platform is JD.com, one of China's largest e-commerce companies. According to the company's data, sales for Valentine's Day flower sales increased by 418% year-on-year.
The company attributed the impressive increase in sales to the growth of its online customer base, adding that the majority of customers were young people aged between 18 and 35. "We found that the younger generation is not just looking for an easy way to deliver flowers, but they are more willing to spend money on more personalized gifts," said Xi Jiang, the business manager of JD Flowers.
Besides flowers, chocolates, and cards, some Chinese couples opt for more unconventional gifts to mark the day of love. For example, some couples in China have started to gift their partners with live fish instead of cut flowers. The idea behind this gift is that the fish symbolizes abundance and prosperity in Chinese culture. The trend has become so popular that some online fish shops reported that they ran out of stock before Valentine's Day.
The tradition of celebrating Valentine's Day in China is a relatively new one, having only caught on in the past few decades. Unlike the Western tradition of the day, Valentine's Day in China is not just limited to couples. It is also a day for expressing gratitude and affection towards family members, friends, and colleagues.
Despite the significant increase in demand for flowers during Valentine's Day, florists and flower shops in China still need to operate under challenging conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the country's economy and disrupted supply chains, leading to a shortage of supplies and increased costs.
To keep up with the demand, Chen Siyu's team had to work tirelessly to replenish their stock and prepare for the big day. "We have to be very careful about what we buy and where we buy it from. The supply chain has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, so we have to plan accordingly," he said. 
Despite the challenges, florists and flower shops in China remain optimistic. They believe that Valentine's Day will continue to be an essential occasion for generations to come, and they are committed to providing their customers with the best possible shopping experience.
In conclusion, Valentine's Day is an important day for many people around the world, and it's no different in China. The day brings a significant boost to the country's flower industry, with florists and flower shops reporting a significant increase in sales. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has created supply chain challenges, these businesses remain optimistic about the future of Valentine's Day in China. Who knows what the next big trend will be in China for Valentine's Day 2022.
