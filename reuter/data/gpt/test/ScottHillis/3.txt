In a major development, a Beijing-appointed committee has endorsed plans to scrap civil liberties in Hong Kong following the Chinese takeover of the region. The move is likely to worsen tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China and raise concerns about human rights abuses.
The committee, which includes top Chinese officials and pro-Beijing figures, was assembled to advise on Hong Kong’s Basic Law, the mini-constitution that sets out the region’s legal framework. Its endorsement of the plan to scrap civil liberties marks a significant shift towards authoritarianism and repression.
Under the new proposals, Hong Kong would be stripped of its political autonomy and ability to make its own laws, and its citizens would be subject to the same restrictions on speech, assembly, and association as those in mainland China. The crackdown on dissent and civil liberties is seen as a response to the pro-democracy protests that swept through Hong Kong last year, culminating in the passage of a controversial national security law.
The national security law, which was imposed by Beijing in June 2020 without the approval of Hong Kong’s legislature, criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign powers. It has been used to crack down on protests, arrest prominent activists and opposition politicians, and silence critical voices in the media.
The new proposals would go even further, eroding the protections and freedoms that have been guaranteed to Hong Kong residents since the city was handed over to China in 1997. The plan has been met with widespread condemnation from human rights groups and democracies around the world.
“This is an alarming and deeply concerning development that further erodes Hong Kong’s autonomy, undermines the rule of law and dismantles fundamental freedoms,” said Amnesty International in a statement. “It is a clear violation of international human rights law and sets a dangerous precedent for other countries to follow.”
The move is also likely to fuel the ongoing tensions between the United States and China, which have increasingly become a geopolitical flashpoint. The US has already imposed sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the Hong Kong crackdown and withdrawn the region’s special trade status, and more measures are likely to follow.
“China’s assault on Hong Kong’s freedoms and autonomy is a direct challenge to the democratic values that the United States and our allies share,” said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement. “The United States stands with the people of Hong Kong and we will take action against those who undermine their autonomy and human rights.”
The situation in Hong Kong is likely to remain fraught and unstable as China tightens its grip on the territory. The scrapping of civil liberties is just the latest step in a steady march towards authoritarianism that has seen Hong Kong’s freedoms and autonomy steadily eroded in recent years.
As the international community looks on in horror, the future of Hong Kong and its proud tradition of democracy and civil liberties remains uncertain. But one thing is clear: the struggle for freedom and democracy in Hong Kong is far from over, and the world must stand together to protect those values from the authoritarian encroachments of China.
