China's State Television Bypasses Deng Xiaoping's Wishes to Give Public Farewell
China's state television CCTV has contradicted the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's wishes by providing a public farewell ceremony for its former president Jiang Zemin. It is a rare move that has caused controversy in China.
Jiang served as the president of China from 1993 to 2003 and is regarded as one of the most powerful politicians in China's Communist Party. Despite his long reign as the leader of China, Jiang has not been seen in public for several years, and it was rumored that he had died.
However, Chinese media sources stated that Jiang is alive and well and continues to influence Chinese politics from behind the scenes. This has been confirmed by the public farewell ceremony given by CCTV for Jiang.
The decision by CCTV to publicly honor Jiang has stirred up controversy due to a 1994 directive from Deng Xiaoping, who was then the head of the Communist Party. Deng suggested that former leaders of China should be allowed to retire and live in privacy.
Deng's directive was meant to be a way of separating the government from the leadership of the Communist Party, which had been heavily influenced by those who retired but continued to exert power behind the scenes.
However, CCTV's decision to honor Jiang indicates that Deng's wishes have been ignored. This could be seen as disrespecting the former leader, who played a major role in the development and modernization of China's economy.
Critics have slammed the move as a sign that the Communist Party is struggling to maintain control over its members. Some have also accused the Party of disrespecting Deng through its decision to publicly honor Jiang.
However, supporters of the move have argued that the party is simply showing respect to one of its most significant former leaders. They also argue that the criticism leveled at the Party is politically motivated.
Despite the controversy surrounding the decision, the public farewell ceremony for Jiang was seen as a success, with a large crowd congregating outside the venue in Beijing to pay their respects.
This move by CCTV may signal a shift in the way the Communist Party handles its former leaders. If other retired leaders are also publicly honored, it would indicate that the Party has moved on from the strict control of its leadership that Deng sought to implement.
As the Communist Party continues to take control of China's political landscape, it is thought that the legacy of leaders like Jiang and Deng will continue to be debated. However, the public response to Jiang's farewell ceremony is likely to be seen as a positive step towards openness and transparency in Chinese politics.
