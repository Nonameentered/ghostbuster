Beijing, China – The Chinese police have surrounded and blockaded the South Korean embassy in Beijing as diplomatic tensions between the two countries escalate. The move comes as a response to the deployment of the US missile defence system, Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), that China fiercely opposes.
South Korea began the process of deploying the missile defence system last year, with the US offering their support and equipment. However, China has opposed the move and believes that THAAD threatens its national security interests.
As a result, China has imposed economic sanctions on South Korea, causing widespread concern over the economic and political fallout that could follow. The South Korean businesses operating in China have already reported a significant decline in sales, with many faced with the possibility of having to shut down.
The blockade of the embassy raises serious concerns over the safety and well-being of South Korean diplomats and citizens in China. Reports indicate that police officers have ringed the embassy complex and are disallowing visitors from entering or leaving the premises.
The incident has also attracted international attention, with many enquiring about the status of the South Korean embassy in Beijing. South Korea’s Foreign Policy Minister Kang Kyung-Wha called an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and the country’s response strategy.
"The illegal siege of the South Korean embassy in Beijing by Chinese authorities must come to an immediate and peaceful end," Minister Kyung-Wha said in a statement.
The move by China has raised significant alarm bells in South Korea with the Korean Embassy warning its citizens about the possible dangers associated with travelling to China.
Tensions between the two countries have increased steadily since the deployment of the US missile defence system, with China resorting to various measures to pressure South Korea into withdrawing their support. THAAD is said to have the capability of tracking and intercepting missiles from North Korea, a neighbour that has long posed a military threat to the South.
Many experts have observed that China’s strong reaction to the deployment of THAAD stems from its larger strategic interests, especially concerning the ongoing tensions with North Korea. Analysts suggest that the missile defence system could weaken China’s effectiveness in containing North Korean aggression and nuclear proliferation.
In response to the blockade of the embassy, an official from the South Korean government stated that such behaviour "has broken international laws and norms. We urge China to stop its unreasonable actions which are causing harm to the healthy development of bilateral ties, as well as the security of our diplomats and citizens”.
For many South Koreans, the situation is unsettling, with some calling for a more robust response by the South Korean government. There are already plans in place to activate a hotline between the defence ministers of the two countries to manage the situation, with the South Korean army already on high alert.
The dispute between China and South Korea highlights the vulnerabilities and tensions that exist in the region, especially in the wake of North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. As of now, a solution to the ongoing crisis is not in sight, with attitudes on all sides becoming increasingly entrenched.
The blockade of the embassy is just another example of the increasingly hostile nature of the diplomatic ties between the two nations. With fears of a military conflict rising, the hope is that cooler heads prevail.
