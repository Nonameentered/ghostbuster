Beijing - As China gets ready to celebrate the Year of the Ox, which commences on February 12th, a horoscope book has predicted that the country is likely to "puff up" and show off its achievements despite being admonished against bragging.
According to the Chinese zodiac system, 2021 is the year of the metal Ox. It is believed that those born in the Year of the Ox are hardworking, honest, and determined. The zodiac signs are believed to dictate the fortunes and personalities of people. And this year, the horoscope book has predicted that China will see strong economic growth, technological advancements, and success on the international stage.
But at the same time, the book says, the country is at risk of overestimating its abilities and succumbing to hubris. Chinese President Xi Jinping has previously warned against this kind of behavior. In 2018, he warned local officials that bragging about their achievements could lead to complacency and neglect of duties, which in turn could directly harm the people.
Despite the warnings, many in China believe that the country has every reason to showcase its achievements and seek further global influence. China has been able to overcome the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and maintain healthy economic growth, while many Western economies are struggling to cope.
At a time when many Western countries are grappling with political and social crises, China sees an opportunity to portray its own system as successful. The country has continued to invest in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, while also pushing ahead with its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to link Asia, Europe, and Africa through a network of infrastructure projects. China believes that by showcasing its investments and economic growth, it can draw more countries into its orbit of influence.
Moreover, the country has also been able to make a significant foray into the field of technological innovation. From producing artificial intelligence and 5G technology to making significant strides in space exploration, China is carving out a niche for itself as a global leader in technology.
But the horoscope book has warned that excessive pride can lead to complacency, which can ultimately lead to a fall. It has been pointed out that many countries that have tried to showcase their supremacy have often fallen into the trap of overreaching and being weighed down by their own arrogance.
At this juncture, President Xi has a challenging task before him. He has the responsibility of ensuring that China continues to make progress in different areas while also remaining cautious about the dangers of overconfidence.
The country's recent spat with the United States is a reminder of how quickly things can change. The US has accused China of stealing intellectual property, promoting unfair trade practices, and violating human rights. The outgoing US President Donald Trump had launched a trade war against China, imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and restricting Chinese investment in the US.
While President-elect Joe Biden is expected to take a less confrontational approach towards China, it is likely that the challenges posed by the US will continue. China also faces competition from other countries, such as India, Japan, and South Korea, who are also vying for a place in the global arena.
Given the current situation, China needs to be cautious in its approach. It needs to continue investing in technology, infrastructure, and education but also be mindful of the dangers of overconfidence. By showcasing its achievements with humility, China can further enhance its global influence and become a more respected player on the world stage.
In conclusion, the Year of the Ox holds a lot of promise for China. It presents a chance for the country to consolidate its position as a global leader in different fields. But China needs to be careful about the dangers of arrogance and complacency. By taking a measured approach, China can emerge stronger and more respected in the eyes of the international community.
