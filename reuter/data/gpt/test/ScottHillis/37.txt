BEIJING - China paid its last respects to former leader Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday as his ashes were interred in a cemetery in Beijing. Deng, who passed away in 1997, was a transformative figure in China's modern history and is widely credited with bringing about economic reforms that lifted millions of people out of poverty.
The ceremony was attended by top Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang, and former President Jiang Zemin. They joined thousands of mourners who gathered at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery to pay their respects to Deng.
The ceremony started with a tribute to Deng's life and achievements, with Xi and Li addressing the gathering. Xi praised Deng for his leadership and said he had left an indelible mark on China's history and development.
"Deng Xiaoping was a great leader who played a pivotal role in the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. He made significant contributions to the development of our nation and our people," Xi said in his speech.
Li, meanwhile, praised Deng's economic reforms, saying they had "turned China into an economic powerhouse."
After the speeches, mourners lined up to place flowers and bow in front of the urn containing Deng's ashes, which was covered in a red cloth with the hammer and sickle emblem of the Chinese Communist Party.
Deng's ashes were then interred in a simple tomb in the cemetery, which is also the final resting place of other revolutionary leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.
Deng was born in 1904 in Sichuan province and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1923. He rose through the ranks of the party and played a key role in the country's civil war, which resulted in the Communist victory in 1949.
However, Deng's career was not without controversy. He was purged from the party twice, including during the Cultural Revolution, the chaotic and violent political movement launched by Mao Zedong in 1966.
Deng returned to power in the late 1970s after Mao's death and launched a series of economic reforms that transformed China's economy and made it one of the world's largest. Deng also advocated for modernizing China's military and developing the country's nuclear weapons program.
Deng retired from politics in 1992 but remained an influential figure in Chinese politics until his death in 1997 at the age of 92.
The ceremony on Tuesday was seen as a reflection of China's growing confidence and power on the world stage. Many observers noted that the ceremony was reminiscent of the state funerals held for Mao and Zhou, which were massive exercises in propaganda and displays of state power.
While China's leaders have adopted a more modest approach in recent years, Tuesday's ceremony was a reminder that the country remains committed to upholding its revolutionary heritage and maintaining its status as a world leader.
