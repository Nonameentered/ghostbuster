Beijing, China: Chinese President Jiang Zemin delivered an emotional eulogy for the late patriarch Deng Xiaoping at his state funeral held at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing today.
The funeral was attended by the top leaders of China's Communist Party, along with hundreds of other dignitaries and family members.
Jiang praised Deng Xiaoping as the "chief architect of China's reform and opening-up" and said that his tremendous contributions to the country would be remembered forever.
"Deng Xiaoping is an outstanding leader in the history of the Chinese people's revolution, construction, and reform," Jiang said. "He is the founder of China's socialist modernization. He is the chief architect of China's reform and opening-up, and the pioneer of the modernization drive."
"His whole life was devoted to the prosperity and revitalization of the Chinese nation," Jiang added, with his voice cracking at times. "The Chinese people will always cherish his memory."
Deng Xiaoping, who helped bring China out of the isolation of the Mao era, died on February 19, 1997, at the age of 92. His reforms, which began in the late 1970s, led to China's economic transformation into an economic powerhouse and one of the world's superpowers.
The state funeral was broadcast on China's state television, and thousands of people gathered outside the cemetery to pay their respects to the late patriarch.
"Deng Xiaoping's vision and courage changed China's trajectory and changed the world," said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who also attended the funeral.
"Deng Xiaoping's contributions to China's modernization drive have been immeasurable," added Liu Yunshan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China.
The funeral concluded with a military salute and a gun salute, as the casket of Deng Xiaoping was carried to its final resting place.
The passing of Deng Xiaoping marked the end of an era for China, but his legacy lives on. His vision and leadership have helped transform China into the global superpower that it is today.
President Jiang Zemin's emotional eulogy for Deng Xiaoping reminded the world of the great leader's remarkable achievements, and his enduring legacy will continue to inspire future generations of Chinese leaders and citizens alike.
