The day after Deng Xiaoping's passing, the Chinese people were lined up in front of his statue at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, paying their respects to the man who had led China's economic revolution in the 1980s. The Chinese measure of success is economic development, and Deng Xiaoping's economic miracles are widely praised.
"The reform and opening up of China was Deng's achievement. He was a great man and a great leader. He led China into the modern age," said one citizen.
"I was a university student in the 1980s, and I have seen the tremendous changes in China. It is all thanks to Deng Xiaoping," said another.
Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms were launched in 1978 and shifted China from a planned economy to a market-oriented one. The reforms led to unprecedented economic growth, modernization, and increases in living standards. China's GDP growth rate was 9.6% per year from 1979 to 2010.
However, the Chinese are also aware of the social ills that followed, including a widening income gap, corruption, and environmental degradation.
"Deng Xiaoping achieved great economic success, but there are still many problems that need solving, such as the widening gap between rich and poor, the high economic growth rate at the expense of the environment, and corruption," said one citizen.
According to official statistics, the Gini coefficient in China, a measure of income inequality, rose from 0.291 in 1978 to 0.465 in 2019, indicating a significant increase in income inequality.
Environmental degradation is also a concern. China's breakneck economic growth has led to severe pollution, soil erosion, and deforestation. The World Bank estimates that pollution costs China the equivalent of 5.8% of its GDP annually.
Corruption is another issue. While the Chinese government has launched an anticorruption campaign in recent years, corruption remains a significant problem in the country. A study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences found that China lost $3.79 trillion to corruption between 1949 and 2017.
Despite these social ills, the Chinese people still praise Deng Xiaoping's leadership.
"He was a forward-looking man who realized the importance of opening up to the world and lifting thousands of people out of poverty," said one citizen.
The Chinese government has also praised Deng Xiaoping's contributions to the country.
"Deng Xiaoping was one of the greatest leaders in Chinese history. He was an architect of China's reform and opening-up and a pioneer of socialist modernization. He played an irreplaceable role in leading China's modernization drive," said Chinese President Xi Jinping in a statement.
"Deng Xiaoping's thoughts, strategy, and actions have given us a fundamental basis for the development and prosperity of our nation," said Premier Li Keqiang at a cabinet meeting.
The Chinese government has declared a period of mourning until April 22, with flags being flown at half-mast across the country.
Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms have transformed China into the world's second-largest economy. But the Chinese people are also aware of the social ills that followed, and they hope that the government will address them in the future. Despite these issues, Deng Xiaoping's leadership is widely praised, and the Chinese people will continue to remember him as a great man and a great leader.
