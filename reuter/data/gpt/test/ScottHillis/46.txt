Beijing, China - A bombing on a public bus during rush hour has killed two people and injured dozens more. The incident occurred on Wednesday morning in the Xicheng district of Beijing.
According to eyewitnesses, the bus was traveling on a busy street during rush hour when suddenly there was a loud explosion. The force of the explosion shattered the windows of nearby buildings and sent debris flying through the air.
Emergency services were quickly called to the scene and paramedics began treating the injured. The wounded were rushed to nearby hospitals for treatment.
The explosion is believed to have been caused by a homemade bomb. Authorities are still investigating the incident and have not yet made any arrests. However, they have stated that they believe the attack was carried out by terrorists.
The incident highlights the ongoing security challenges that China faces. The country has been hit by a spate of terrorist attacks in recent years, mostly carried out by separatist groups from the Xinjiang region of China.
The Chinese government has been working hard to crack down on terrorism and improve security measures across the country. However, attacks like this demonstrate that there is still a long way to go.
President Xi Jinping has condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. In a statement, he said: "This is a heinous and cowardly act and our thoughts are with the victims and their families. We will not rest until those responsible are brought to justice."
The incident has caused widespread shock and anger across China. Many people have taken to social media to express their sadness and disbelief at what has happened.
Security has been stepped up across the city and authorities are urging people to remain vigilant. Public transport has also been affected, with some bus routes being diverted or cancelled.
The bombing has once again highlighted the vulnerability of public transport and the need for improved security measures. It is hoped that this incident will serve as a wake-up call to the authorities and encourage them to take further action to protect citizens.
In the meantime, the country is mourning the loss of two innocent lives and praying for the swift recovery of those injured in the attack.
