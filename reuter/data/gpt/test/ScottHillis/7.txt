The United States has announced its plan to sponsor a United Nations resolution condemning Beijing unless the Chinese government makes progress on human rights, diplomats have said.
The move comes as tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to escalate over issues ranging from trade to Hong Kong and Taiwan. The U.S. has accused China of committing human rights abuses against Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang region and cracking down on dissent in Hong Kong.
Diplomats told Reuters news agency that the U.S. circulated a draft resolution at the U.N. last week that expressed concern over the human rights situation in China. The resolution is expected to be put to a vote at the U.N. Human Rights Council in September.
The draft resolution calls on China to end arbitrary detention, torture, and forced labor in Xinjiang, and to respect the rights of citizens in Hong Kong. It also urges the Chinese government to release individuals who have been arrested for peacefully expressing their opinions.
The resolution would be a symbolic rebuke of China, but would not have any binding effect. However, it could increase international pressure on China to change its human rights practices.
China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and has the power to veto any resolution. Chinese officials have pushed back against criticism of their human rights record, saying that other countries should not interfere in China's internal affairs.
However, the U.S. has been increasingly vocal in its criticism of China's human rights record. Last year, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Chinese officials for their role in the detention of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.
The U.S. has also passed legislation supporting pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. China responded by imposing a national security law on Hong Kong that critics say undermines the city's freedoms.
The U.S. move to sponsor a U.N. resolution condemning Beijing is likely to further strain relations between the two countries. However, some analysts say that the resolution could also create an opportunity for dialogue on human rights issues.
"By putting forward a resolution, the U.S. is opening up an avenue for dialogue on human rights with China," Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters. "This is an opportunity for China to show it is willing to engage on the issue."
China's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Chen Xu, said on Monday that China was "totally opposed" to the U.S. resolution. He called it a "political manipulation" that "ignored facts and truth" and was harmful to China's interests.
Chen also accused the U.S. of "crimes against humanity" for its treatment of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and for its involvement in military conflicts in the Middle East.
The U.N. Human Rights Council is made up of 47 member states and is responsible for monitoring human rights abuses worldwide. The council has been criticized in the past for not doing enough to address human rights abuses in countries such as Syria and Myanmar.
The U.S. plans to sponsor a resolution condemning Beijing unless China makes progress on human rights is likely to be a contentious issue at the U.N. Human Rights Council. However, it could also create an opportunity for dialogue on human rights between the U.S. and China.
The resolution is expected to be put to a vote in September and will be closely watched by the international community.
