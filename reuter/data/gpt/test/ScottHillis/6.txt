Washington: After a series of unsuccessful talks between the US and China, the two economic giants have engaged in last-ditch negotiations to come to an agreement over textile trade and market access. The negotiation talks come ahead of a planned summit in Washington between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The negotiations, which began last week, aim to resolve long-standing disputes between the US and China over textiles and manufacturing. The US has been pressing China to reform its trade policies and open up its markets to US companies, with the hope of reducing the US trade deficit with China.
The talks have been focused on two key issues â€“ textile trade and market access. The US has been seeking a textile accord that would limit China's textile exports to the US, while China has been pushing for greater market access for its companies in the US.
The textile accord has been a contentious issue between the two countries, with the US complaining of China's subsidies and rampant violation of intellectual property rights. The US has been seeking limits on the number of Chinese textile products that can be imported into the country, while China has been resisting US demands.
On the other hand, China has been pushing for greater market access for its companies in the US. China has been requesting the US to ease restrictions on Chinese companies, which have been subject to stringent regulations and barriers in the US market. China has also been seeking greater protection for its intellectual property rights in the US.
The negotiations have been challenging, and both sides have made it clear that the issues are complex and require time and effort to solve. However, there has been hope that an agreement can be reached that will be mutually beneficial for both countries.
US trade representative Katherine Tai, who led the US team in the negotiations, commented on the talks, "We've been engaged in a productive dialogue with our Chinese counterparts over the past week, seeking to resolve our differences over textile trade and market access. We have made progress, but there is much work to be done."
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who led the Chinese team, also expressed optimism, "We have engaged in constructive talks with the US, and the negotiations have been productive. We hope to continue these talks in the coming weeks and reach an agreement that is beneficial for both countries."
The negotiations have taken place against a backdrop of tense US-China relations, amid increasing signs of economic and military competition between the two countries. Tensions have been rising over issues such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and human rights abuses, with both countries accusing each other of engaging in hostile activities.
The outcome of the negotiations will be closely watched by observers, who believe that the agreement could provide a much-needed boost to the global economy, which has been reeling from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The US and China remain the world's two largest economies, and any agreement between them would have a significant impact on global trade and investment. The negotiations are expected to continue in the coming weeks, with both sides hoping to reach an agreement before the summit between the two leaders in Washington.
