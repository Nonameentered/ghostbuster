In 1978, an ambitious economic reform program was unveiled by Deng Xiaoping, the former Chinese leader. It fundamentally transformed China into a capitalist country in forty years from a stagnant agrarian nation. Though the change was gradual and slow, the transition paved the way for China's economic success, where it emerged as a superpower at a breathtaking pace. Deng Xiaopingâ€™s ideas of economic liberalization and market-based reforms not only set China on the path of prosperity but also transformed the cultural landscape of the nation, providing citizens with unprecedented freedom and choice.
Deng Xiaoping was a visionary leader of the Chinese Communist Party. He played a crucial role in modernizing China's economy by pursuing market-oriented economic policies that helped to liberalize the nation's economy. Deng Xiaoping's policies were aimed at reducing the state's role in the economy and increasing the role of the private sector. This led to a surge in economic growth, which transformed China into an economic powerhouse.
In the first few years of reform, Deng confined the liberalization to agriculture, where farmers were given incentives to produce. This led to a bumper crop, and China became self-sufficient in food production, ending the famine. Later, Deng liberalized foreign trade, opened up the coastal areas, created special economic zones, and invited foreign investment. China became a production hub, attracting multinational companies to set up their manufacturing base in China.
As a result of these policies, China's economy grew at an average of 9 percent per year from 1978 to 2020, making China the second-largest economy globally, with an annual GDP of $15 trillion. The reforms also lifted over 850 million people out of poverty, reducing the poverty rate from 88 percent to 1.7 percent, according to the World Bank.
The economic growth not only created wealth but also provided freedom and choice to Chinese citizens. People had access to more consumer goods, which were previously unavailable. The market economy became the norm, and business owners and entrepreneurs flourished. The internet and social media helped to promote openness and transparency, as well as offer people a platform to voice their opinions freely. People had access to a diverse range of products and services that were previously only available to elites.
Education is another area that underwent a significant transformation in China due to the Deng Xiaoping policies. Deng Xiaoping recognized that education was vital for economic development and that investment in human capital was necessary. He introduced education reform that increased the number of schools and universities, created new curricula, and improved the quality of education.
As a result, China now has some of the best universities in the world, producing world-class researchers, scientists, and other professionals. Education created new opportunities, with students starting their own businesses or joining multinational companies, where they have played an integral role in China's growth story.
The reforms also helped to transform China's social order. The government loosened its grip on society and gave freedom to people to live their lives within the legal framework. People were free to travel both domestically and internationally, marry who they wanted, and choose their careers. Society became more open, and people embraced individualism and the freedom to pursue their dreams.
Deng Xiaoping's reforms also transformed China's global image. China emerged as a significant player on the world stage, contributing to global issues and taking part in international initiatives. China's economic growth led to the country's prominence in global trade, with its share of the world exports soaring from 1.3 to 13.3 percent between 1980 and 2020. China became a model of development for the developing world, promoting South-South cooperation and sharing its experience with other countries.
In conclusion, Deng Xiaoping's legacy of freedom for the ordinary people of China has significantly transformed Chinese society, culture, and economy. His policies have led to China's economic and social progress, helped eliminate poverty, and opened up opportunities for millions of people. Deng Xiaoping's pragmatic approach to economic development ushered in an era of unprecedented prosperity for China, and his ideas remain relevant to China's development in the future.
