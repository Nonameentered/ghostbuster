Premier Li Peng Affirms China's Commitment to Opening to the World in Foreign Policy
In a speech delivered at the parliament session on Monday, China's Premier Li Peng affirmed the country's commitment to opening to the world in foreign policy. Peng emphasized the need for balanced global economic growth and the role China could play in achieving it.
The Premier acknowledged the current geopolitical and economic challenges facing the world today. However, he remained optimistic in China's ability to work with other nations in addressing these issues and called for greater cooperation among countries.
"China remains committed to opening up to the world in its foreign policy. We believe that global economic growth can only be achieved through balanced development," said Peng.
He also highlighted China's efforts in recent years to reform its economic system and create a more transparent and favorable business environment for foreign companies. The Premier assured foreign investors that China remains committed to safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests in the country.
"China has been actively pursuing economic reform and opening up since the 1980s. We have continued to deepen these reforms, and this has resulted in a more transparent and business-friendly environment. We remain committed to safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors in China," Peng said.
Furthermore, the Premier expressed his confidence in China's ability to handle the ongoing trade disputes with the United States. He did, however, urge the US to return to the negotiating table and find a mutually acceptable solution to the trade dispute.
"We believe that a trade war is harmful to both China and the US. China is willing to negotiate on the basis of mutual respect and equality with the US. We hope the US can come back to the negotiating table so that we can find a solution acceptable to both sides," Peng said.
China has been facing increased scrutiny from Western countries, particularly in regards to its trade policies and human rights record. However, Peng reiterated China's position that it is committed to upholding the principles of equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
"We believe in upholding the principles of international law and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. We seek to create a world order conducive to peace and development," he said.
The Premier's speech was well-received by both lawmakers and foreign ambassadors who were present at the parliament session. Many praised China's efforts to open up its economy and develop a more inclusive and cooperative foreign policy.
In conclusion, Premier Li Peng's speech highlighted China's continued commitment to open up its economy and work with other countries in achieving balanced global development. The speech also demonstrates China's willingness to engage in productive dialogue with other nations to address the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.
