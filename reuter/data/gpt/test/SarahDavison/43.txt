China has ramped up its regulations on red chip shares in response to the country's challenging economic and political circumstances, according to sources familiar with the matter. The move comes as the Chinese mainland struggles with a slowing economy, mounting debt levels, and a growing trade war with the United States, adding to the political challenges it faces.
Red chip shares are stocks in Chinese companies listed on Hong Kong's stock exchange. The term "red chip" refers to firms incorporated outside China but whose businesses are mainly based on the mainland. One of the reasons Chinese companies are listed on the Hong Kong exchange is that it provides them with access to international investors that they might not otherwise have. The move to tighten controls on these shares could impact these firms' ability to tap into these key markets.
China's recent actions include requiring mainland-listed companies planning to issue shares in Hong Kong to seek approval from the State Council's securities regulator. This move is seen as an effort to prevent companies from engaging in speculative deals or using the share issuances to mask financial difficulties.
Furthermore, the government has also implemented measures to reduce the number of red chip companies on the Hong Kong exchange. According to Reuters, there were 159 red chip companies in Hong Kong at the end of June 2021, down from 166 at the end of 2020.
Apart from these measures, the authorities also plan to scrutinize red chip companies for possible risks, such as undisclosed related-party transactions or off-balance-sheet financing.
The move to tighten controls on red chip shares comes against the backdrop of a number of challenges that China is facing. Firstly, the country's economic growth is expected to slow in the coming years, raising concerns about its longer-term economic outlook. The IMF recently lowered its growth forecast for China to 8.1% for 2021 and 5.7% for 2022, citing a number of headwinds facing the country, including the pandemic's impact on global trade, demographic trends, and the country's debt levels.
Secondly, the country is grappling with increasing debt levels, which could pose risks to its financial system in the coming years. According to the Bank for International Settlements, China's debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 296% in Q1 2021, making it one of the highest in the world.
Finally, China is also facing mounting tensions with the United States, which have had a major impact on the country's economy. The US-China trade war, which began in 2018, has resulted in tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods between the two countries, causing significant disruptions to global supply chains. The Biden administration has also taken a tough stance on China, calling for greater cooperation among allies to counter Beijing's growing influence around the world.
Despite these challenges, China's government has taken a number of measures to address these issues and stabilize its economy. For example, it has implemented a range of reforms to strengthen its financial system, including imposing stricter regulations on financial companies and limiting the amount of debt that local governments can take on. It has also prioritized efforts to increase domestic consumption and reduce its reliance on exports.
In conclusion, China's move to tighten controls on red chip shares is a response to the country's challenging economic and political circumstances. The measures could help prevent companies from engaging in speculative deals or using share issuances to mask financial difficulties. The recent actions come amid broader efforts by the government to stabilize its economy and reduce risks to its financial system, including mounting debt levels and the ongoing trade war with the United States. While these challenges remain significant, China's government has taken steps to address these issues and ensure a sustainable long-term economic outlook.
