Hong Kong and Taiwan are currently in a tense dispute over call warrants linked to the Taipei index. The incident began when a Taiwanese company launched call warrants linked to the benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX), which was then listed in Hong Kong.
The introduction of the warrants in Hong Kong immediately raised concerns from Taiwan as their government was not consulted on the matter. Taiwan expressed frustration citing a lack of communication between Hong Kong and Taipei, as well as China's ongoing efforts to isolate Taiwan from the international community.
Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) issued a statement that they would never recognize the listing of such products since it has not been vetted by their authorities. The FSC also stated their concern in the lack of communication channels between regulators in both jurisdictions.
Hong Kong, on the other hand, sees no grounds for Taiwan's claims and insisted the warrant listing was completely lawful, and in compliance with the regulations in the city. They defended the move, saying that the products complied with Hong Kong stock exchange listing regulations.
Despite Hong Kong's claim, Taiwan remains unconvinced, and has called on the Hong Kong regulators to remove the warrants from their market. Taipei also warned that it would not rule out taking further steps to safeguard Taiwan's interests.
Market experts suggest that the warrants market is a highly profitable industry, and it could be one of the major underlying issues that drive the latest dispute between Hong Kong and Taiwan. However, the potential impact on the market remains unclear.
This latest spat between Taiwan and Hong Kong comes on top of already strained relations due to China's assertive approach towards Taiwan. China has always seen the island as a renegade province, and tensions have continued to rise between Taipei and Beijing, with the US Navy sending warships to the region in support of Taiwan in recent years.
Analysts fear that this dispute could lead to further isolation from China, as the Chinese government continues to tighten its grip on various industries and increase control over the economy.
The Hong Kong market offers investors an opportunity to invest in Taiwan, which is known for its high-tech and export-driven economy. However, this has become the center of disagreement between the two jurisdictions.
As the conflict continues to develop, it remains uncertain how both parties will resolve the dispute. Nevertheless, there is hope that communication channels will be established to ease the tension between Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
The current development of the disagreement could create a whole new level of friction between the countries, impacting investment, trade and other economic sectors in the region.
