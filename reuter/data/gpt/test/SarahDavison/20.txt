Hong Kong's former leader Donald Tsang has been appointed to manage the city's US$19 billion land fund, marking his comeback after serving a two-year jail term for corruption charges.
Tsang, who served as the Chief Executive of Hong Kong from 2005 to 2012, was convicted of misconduct in public office in 2017 and sentenced to 20 months in jail. He was released in January 2019 after serving two-thirds of his sentence.
Tsang's appointment to manage the land fund, one of the largest in the world, has raised eyebrows and sparked criticism from some quarters. Some have questioned whether the former leader is fit to hold such a high-profile position given his criminal record.
The land fund, which was established in 2019, is an investment vehicle that aims to generate long-term returns for the city by investing in land and property projects domestically and abroad. It is overseen by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and managed by a subsidiary called the Hong Kong Investment Fund Management Limited (HKIFML).
In a statement, the HKMA said Tsang's appointment was based on his "relevant experience and expertise in leading a large and complex organization in the public sector." It also noted that Tsang's appointment was subject to approval by the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong.
According to reports, Tsang will oversee the HKIFML and report to the Investment Committee, which is responsible for setting the fund's investment strategy and monitoring its performance. The committee is chaired by the HKMA's Chief Executive Eddie Yue.
Many in Hong Kong have criticized the appointment, saying it sends the wrong message about the city's commitment to fighting corruption. The move also comes at a time when Hong Kong is grappling with a political crisis and facing growing pressure from Beijing to clamp down on dissent.
Tsang's appointment has also been seen as a political move, with some suggesting that it is part of a broader effort by the Hong Kong government to rehabilitate former leaders who have fallen out of favor.
Despite the criticism, some have expressed optimism that Tsang's appointment could bring fresh ideas and energy to the land fund. Tsang is widely regarded as a skilled administrator and has a strong track record in managing large organizations.
In his statement, Tsang said he was "honored" to be appointed to the role and pledged to work diligently to achieve the fund's goals.
"I am aware of the challenges ahead but I am confident that, with the support of the Investment Committee and the HKIFML team, we can achieve good investment results for the long-term benefit of Hong Kong society," he said.
