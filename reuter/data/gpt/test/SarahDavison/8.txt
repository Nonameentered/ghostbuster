In the last few years, Hong Kong has seen a mass wave of protests and civil unrest following the implementation of a new security law that took place in June of 2020. This law has been viewed by many as an attempt by Beijing to increase its control over the semi-autonomous city, with critics arguing that it severely curtails the civil liberties that Hong Kong residents were promised after the British handover in 1997. 
Since the law's implementation, democracy activists in Hong Kong have been working to increase pressure on China to respect their civil liberties, mainly through public protests and advocacy campaigns. Recently, this pressure has been amplified, and democracy activists have been ramping up their efforts to hold China accountable for its disregard for Hong Kong's democratic values.
One of the most high-profile activists in Hong Kong, Joshua Wong, recently launched the "Hong Kong Charter 2021," a campaign pushing for democratic reforms in the city. The Charter calls for the repeal of the imposed security law and for universal suffrage to be granted to Hong Kong citizens. Wong's campaign has been successful in attracting international attention, with the activist reportedly testifying at a US congressional panel in September of 2021.
The Hong Kong Charter has also been endorsed by a coalition of pro-democracy lawmakers from around the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. This endorsement was seen as a significant step towards holding China accountable for its actions, as it represented a united front in support of Hong Kong's democratic values.
In addition to these advocacy campaigns, Hong Kong activists have also been taking to the streets to protest the recent arrests of several prominent pro-democracy figures. In June of this year, five activists, including Wong, were detained on charges of "subversion" under the security law. These arrests were met with widespread outrage in Hong Kong and around the world, with many activists viewing the charges as an attempt by China to silence dissent and suppress democratic values.
Protests against the arrests have continued to rage in Hong Kong, with thousands taking to the streets to demand the activists' release. These protests have often turned violent, with police using tear gas and pepper spray to disperse crowds. In response, the activists have been using social media to organize protests and communicate their message to the world, posting videos and photographs of protests and the police response in real-time.
Many activists believe that only international pressure can force China to respect Hong Kong's democratic values. To this end, they've been calling on foreign governments to sanction Chinese officials who are responsible for the violations of human rights and civil liberties in Hong Kong.
In July of 2021, the United States responded to these demands by imposing new sanctions on several Chinese officials, including Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam. These sanctions were seen as a significant step towards holding China accountable for its actions in Hong Kong, with activists praising the move as a step in the right direction.
However, many activists believe that more needs to be done to pressure China to respect Hong Kong's democratic values. Some are calling on Western governments to take a more aggressive approach, including boycotts of Chinese products and increased military support for Hong Kong.
These calls for increased pressure come as Hong Kong residents are facing increasing control by China over their daily lives. In recent months, Beijing has imposed a series of new measures aimed at curbing dissent and political activism, including new national security laws and increased surveillance of social media and political dissent.
Despite these challenges, democracy activists in Hong Kong remain committed to their cause, and are working tirelessly to increase pressure on China to respect their civil liberties. With support from the international community, they hope to secure a brighter future for themselves and for future generations of Hong Kong residents.
