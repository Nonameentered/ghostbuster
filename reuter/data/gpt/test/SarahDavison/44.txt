Hong Kong has long been a crucial facilitator of trade between Taiwan and China, despite the political sensitivities that surround such transactions. And despite recent tensions between the two regions, experts say that Hong Kong's role in this trade relationship will likely continue for the foreseeable future.
Taiwan and China have been at odds ever since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, after which the Chinese Communist Party took control of mainland China and the Nationalist Party (KMT) retreated to Taiwan. Since then, China has regarded Taiwan as a part of its territory that it plans to reunify with the mainland, while Taiwan insists on its sovereignty and sees itself as a separate nation.
Despite these political tensions, trade between the two regions has been growing steadily over the years. According to the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) in Taiwan, the island's exports and imports to and from China reached a record high of $171.8 billion in 2019. This represents a substantial increase from just $6 billion in 1990, when trade across the Taiwan Strait was first reopened.
Hong Kong has played a crucial role in facilitating this trade, serving as a key conduit for Taiwanese companies to access China's vast consumer market. Because of the special administrative region's unique status as a global financial hub with a separate legal system from the mainland, it has been able to act as a neutral intermediary between Taiwan and China, enabling businesses from both sides to engage in transactions while navigating the complex legal and political landscape.
According to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), Hong Kong has been the top export destination for Taiwan since 2011, while it is also one of the most significant sources of foreign investment into China. By leveraging Hong Kong's proximity to both Taiwan and China, Taiwanese companies have been able to set up regional headquarters and manufacturing facilities in the city, where they can conduct business with their counterparts across the strait.
However, this unique positioning has also made Hong Kong vulnerable to political tensions between the two regions. As relations between China and Taiwan have grown increasingly strained in recent years, there have been concerns that Hong Kong could become caught up in the middle of this conflict.
This was highlighted in early 2020, when Taiwanese officials accused Hong Kong of seizing a shipment of face masks intended for the island. According to Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control, the shipment of 10,000 masks was confiscated by Hong Kong customs officials without explanation, despite the fact that Taiwan had previously donated hundreds of thousands of masks to Hong Kong during its own outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. While Hong Kong authorities denied any official involvement in the confiscation, the incident highlighted the potential for tensions to spill over into economic relations.
Nonetheless, experts say that Hong Kong's role as a facilitator of China-Taiwan trade is likely to continue, despite the underlying political sensitivities. While there may be occasional disruptions or tensions, the benefits of Hong Kong's unique positioning as a global business hub and financial center are simply too great to ignore.
"For many Taiwanese businesses, Hong Kong is the ideal location to set up their operations in China due to its legal system, financial infrastructure, and business-friendly environment," said Cheah Cheng Hye, co-chairman and co-chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based asset management firm Value Partners Group. "I don't think this will change anytime soon, as the advantages are too great to be replaced by other locations."
Similarly, James Roy, founder of China Market Research Group, noted that "it's difficult to see trade flows being redirected to other locations as Hong Kong provides a unique location for companies to set up regional headquarters and conduct business between Taiwan and China."
However, there are concerns that the ongoing protests in Hong Kong over the past year could have a lasting impact on the city's role as a global business hub, potentially driving some Taiwanese companies to explore other options.
According to a survey by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) in August 2019, around 13 percent of Taiwanese companies in Hong Kong were considering relocating their operations due to the ongoing protests, while another 43 percent were considering downsizing.
Nonetheless, experts say that the advantages of Hong Kong's location and business infrastructure are likely to continue outweighing any potential disruptions caused by political tensions or the protests. And while the situation may be fluid, with the ongoing pandemic and other geopolitical factors adding further uncertainty, the role of Hong Kong as a facilitator of China-Taiwan trade seems set to remain a crucial one for the foreseeable future.
