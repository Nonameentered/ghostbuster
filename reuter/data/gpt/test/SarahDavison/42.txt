Taiwan has rejected the “one country, two systems” policy proposed by China for the handover of Hong Kong. The rejection of the policy comes as China is set to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from Britain.
The Taiwanese government released a statement in which it said that “Taiwan reiterates that the ‘one country, two systems’ model has completely failed in Hong Kong.”
Taiwan, which has been a self-governing island for over seven decades, has become increasingly worried about China's attempts to exert control over Hong Kong. The statement further read, “Hong Kong’s experience has shown that the aspirations of the people cannot be suppressed for long, and that Taiwan’s democratic security cannot be threatened.”
The “one country, two systems” policy, which was proposed by China's leader, Deng Xiaoping, in the late 1970s, allows Hong Kong and Macau to retain a degree of freedom and autonomy separate from mainland China. The policy has been in place for Hong Kong since 1997 when the city was handed over to China by Britain. However, the policy has been criticized in recent years for failing to protect Hong Kong’s autonomy and democratic freedoms.
In response to Taiwan's rejection of the “one country, two systems” policy, China has reiterated that Taiwan is an integral part of China and that any attempt to separate from China is a violation of its sovereignty. China's state-run media has accused Taiwan of using Hong Kong's protests to pursue its own independence agenda.
The Chinese government's stance has raised concerns among Taiwanese people and the international community who fear that the situation in Hong Kong could repeat in Taiwan. The Taiwanese President, Tsai Ing-wen, has repeatedly rejected pressure from China to unify under the “one country, two systems” policy.
In a tweet, Tsai Ing-wen said that “As long as I am President, the government will firmly defend Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy.”
Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it opposes any attempts to "unilaterally change the 'status quo' across the Taiwan Strait" and that it has called on the international community to support Taiwan's democracy and right to self-determination.
The rejection of the “one country, two systems” policy by Taiwan is not entirely unexpected as it has long been opposed to China's attempts to unify it under the Chinese mainland. The Taiwanese government has repeatedly expressed its support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and has criticized China for exerting control over the territory.
The Chinese government has been accused of eroding civil liberties in Hong Kong, which has led to mass protests in the city. The protests have been sparked by a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to mainland China. Critics of the bill have argued that it would have given China greater control over Hong Kong's judicial system.
The protests quickly escalated into a larger pro-democracy movement, with protesters calling for the preservation of Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic freedoms. The Chinese government has responded with force, with police using tear gas, rubber bullets, and batons to disperse protesters.
The situation in Hong Kong has become a major flashpoint in the ongoing tensions between China and Taiwan. The Taiwanese government has accused China of using Hong Kong's protests to intimidate and pressure Taiwan into accepting the “one country, two systems” policy.
The rejection of the “one country, two systems” policy by Taiwan is likely to further exacerbate tensions between China and Taiwan. The Taiwanese government's rejection of the policy sends a clear message that it will not allow China to exert control over Taiwan's democracy and sovereignty.
The situation in Hong Kong has raised concerns about China's increasingly authoritarian policies and its disregard for civil liberties and human rights. The international community has expressed its support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and has called on China to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic freedoms. 
As China celebrates the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover, the future of Hong Kong's freedom and democracy remains uncertain. The rejection of the “one country, two systems” policy by Taiwan marks a significant turning point in the ongoing tensions between China and Taiwan and indicates that Taiwan is prepared to defend its sovereignty and democratic values.
