Hong Kong's flagship airline, Cathay Pacific, finds itself battling a double-whammy crisis that threatens to further dampen the company's already debilitating finances: a grounded fleet of fifteen Airbus A330-300 aircraft and a bleak financial forecast from analysts. 
The airline recently announced that it would be placing the Airbus fleet on indefinite ground-hold pending investigations into maintenance issues affecting some of the planes. This development comes as a blow to the airline, which relies heavily on the A330-300 for long-haul flights to Europe and the United States. 
The decision to ground the fleet was announced after the carrier reported a loss of HK$21.6bn ($2.8bn) for the first half of this year, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage global air travel demand. Cathay Pacific has already cut thousands of jobs and grounded dozens of aircraft, as it tries to weather the worst crisis in its seventy-year history. 
However, the A330-300 grounding will further intensify Cathay Pacific's problems as it will reduce the airline's capacity, downgrade the quality of its services and add to the list of service cuts that the airline has already implemented in an effort to cut costs. 
Moreover, analysts suggest that the airline's future may be bleaker than projected in its original estimates, as early signs of economic recovery remain scanty and the COVID-19 contagion continues to stifle air travel worldwide. Reuters reports that JP Morgan analysts have already reduced their rating on the airline to "underweight," citing that their newly estimated earnings per share for the airline stand at negative HK$5.65, compared to the airline's original estimate of a negative HK$1.71. 
Other analysts are also pessimistic about the airline's financial outlook, as Macquarie raises concerns about Cathay Pacific's poor cost-cutting measures. Bloomberg reports that the "Macquarie analysts, including Timothy Ross, said the [Cathay Pacific] management has done too little too late to tackle the carrier's cost structure, which is too complex" and that the company is "overspending on fuel and some aircraft leases and that cutting jobs alone will not solve the airline's problems." 
The frequent re-imposition of travel restrictions due to the outbreak of new COVID-19 cases in various regions worldwide also presents a considerable threat to the airline's recovery prospects, as it continues to dampen air travel demand. Hence, the airline's management faces the daunting task of implementing more cost reduction measures in the immediate term while hoping for a significant recovery in global air travel demand to minimize the impact on earnings from the prolonged crisis. 
In response to this dilemma, the airline's management continues to negotiate with its stakeholders, including the Hong Kong government, seeking financial support. Cathay Pacific has already secured HK$39bn ($5bn) in a bailout from the Hong Kong government to keep them going during the crisis. The airline's management has emphasized that a steady recovery in air travel among Hong Kong consumers is critical to its recovery prospects. 
Thus, they have made some significant changes to the airline's business model, including redefining the focus on their home market, encouraging more bookings for short-haul flights, and adapting to the new norm by implementing more stringent flight protocols to ensure the safety of passengers. 
In conclusion, Cathay Pacific's struggle with the Airbus A330-300 fleet's grounding and the bleak financial forecast from analysts presents a severe challenge to the airline's recovery plans. Even the combination of cost-cutting measures and government financial support may not adequately address what seems to be a more prolonged and unpredictable crisis for the airline. The company's management must continue to explore ways of cutting more costs, strengthening its balance sheet, and devising innovative strategies to adapt to the new norm to stay afloat during this air travel crisis.
