Hong Kong's stock market continues to experience volatility despite China's attempt to control speculation, according to institutional investors. The market has been fluctuating since the political protests began in the city four months ago, resulting in a larger-than-expected economic surge. Although China increased its stake in Hong Kong's economy, the stock market remained volatile. 
Many experts believe that the protests have caused a significant impact on Hong Kong's financial stability. Demonstrators have been demanding democracy and have called for an end to police brutality. The government has responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon. The violence has led to a slowdown of Hong Kong's economy and has weakened its banks. 
In August, China announced measures to control speculation in the stock market. The government's measures included the elimination of dividend tax for A-shares over the next three years, and a cut in the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks. However, institutional investors say these measures have not been effective.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has been one of the world's most volatile markets for years, and it has been hit hard this year by the US-China trade war. The market's instability was further exacerbated by the political upheaval and economic downturn.
Many institutional investors argue that the root problem is the long-standing unrest between Hong Kong and China. This is because Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub is based on the "one country, two systems" principle that was put in place when the city was returned to China in 1997. This is a bitter pill, since it is viewed as an assault on Hong Kong's autonomy and will lead to an erosion of its sovereignty.
In addition, China has invested billions of dollars to fuel the growth of Hong Kong's economy. However, there are concerns that this investment may have been damage by the protests. Some institutional investors even argue that China's investment in Hong Kong could be at risk.
Despite these concerns, there are glimmers of hope. The stock market has been reacting positively to news of progress in the US-China trade negotiations. However, investors remain cautious about the volatile market until the political unrest in Hong Kong is resolved.
Institutional investors suggest that to end the protests, the government will need to address the underlying causes. The government needs to ensure that police brutality stops and work to address the social and economic grievances of the protesters. Until these issues are successfully addressed, the potential for violence to flare up again remains high.
In addition, institutional investors suggest that the government needs to focus on increasing economic development in Hong Kong. This will help to create jobs and help businesses and individuals to grow. As much as possible, the government should reduce economic inequalities. This will increase social stability and reduce the likelihood of protests taking hold again.
Moreover, institutional investors suggest that the government needs to restore confidence in Hong Kong's financial institutions. This may require substantial investments, such as government bailouts or joint ventures with foreign investment firms. Furthermore, they need to develop stronger anti-corruption measures to help bolster investor confidence in the market. 
Indeed, the recent volatility in Hong Kong's stock market has spooked some institutional investors but, despite this, the city still remains an attractive financial hub for foreign investors. Nonetheless, the protests and uncertainty have made investment in Hong Kong much riskier, and this could lead to a drop off of Chinese investment in Hong Kong in the coming months. All eyes will be on how successful the government can be in resolving the political issue and convincing investors to once again put their money into Hong Kong's stock market.
