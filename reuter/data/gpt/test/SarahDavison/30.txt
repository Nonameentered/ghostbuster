Nicholas-Applegate, a San Diego-based asset management firm, announced on Thursday that it will acquire Credit Lyonnais’ Asian Fund Management Unit in a deal that consolidates the investment management industry in the Asia-Pacific region. The acquisition is part of Nicholas-Applegate’s broader strategy of expanding its global footprint and enhancing its investment capabilities.
The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals. The transaction will result in Nicholas-Applegate taking over the management of Credit Lyonnais’ regional mutual funds, trust funds, and institutional mandates. Credit Lyonnais’ employees in Hong Kong and Singapore will also be transferred to Nicholas-Applegate, which will continue to operate the acquired business under its own brand.
“This acquisition marks a significant milestone in our growth trajectory and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to offer innovative investment solutions to our clients,” said David Young, CEO of Nicholas-Applegate. “By adding Credit Lyonnais’ talented team and established product suite to our platform, we will be better positioned to meet the needs of investors in the Asia-Pacific region.”
Nicholas-Applegate is a subsidiary of Allianz Global Investors, one of the world’s leading asset managers with EUR 722 billion ($810 billion) in assets under management. With this acquisition, Nicholas-Applegate will increase its assets under management in the Asia-Pacific region by more than 50%, according to the company.
“This transaction highlights our commitment to growing our business in Asia-Pacific, one of the world’s most dynamic regions for investment management,” said Deborah Zurkow, global head of investment management at Allianz Global Investors. “We believe the combination of Credit Lyonnais’ expertise in Asia and Nicholas-Applegate’s global investment capabilities will create a powerful proposition for clients seeking access to the region’s growth opportunities.”
The acquisition comes at a time when the investment management industry in Asia-Pacific is undergoing a period of rapid consolidation. According to a report by KPMG, the number of active asset managers in the region fell by 15% from 2017 to 2019, while assets under management increased by 21% over the same period. This trend is expected to continue as smaller players struggle to compete with larger firms that have greater scale and resources.
“Consolidation is a natural progression for the investment management industry in Asia-Pacific as firms seek to achieve greater efficiency, scale, and diversification,” said Jason Bedford, head of financial services at KPMG. “It also reflects the changing needs of investors, who are increasingly demanding more sophisticated investment solutions and higher levels of service.”
The acquisition of Credit Lyonnais’ Asian Fund Management Unit is expected to position Nicholas-Applegate as one of the leading investment managers in the region, with a broad range of investment strategies and a strong presence in key markets. The acquisition will also enable the company to offer clients a more comprehensive suite of investment solutions, including equity, fixed income, multi-asset, and alternative strategies.
