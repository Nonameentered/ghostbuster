The British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has issued a warning that corruption is rising and standards are declining in the city under Chinese sovereignty. The chamber has called for action to address the problem, which it says is threatening Hong Kong's international reputation.
The British Chamber of Commerce has always been a vocal advocate for a transparent, open, and free business environment. In a report published on Monday, the chamber highlighted several concerns that businesspeople have expressed to them about Hong Kong's current state of affairs.
The report cites a series of scandals in recent years as evidence of growing corruption in the city. Cases include bribery allegations in the banking sector, corruption in the construction industry, and collusion between the authorities and businesspeople.
According to the report, many businesspeople believe that these cases of corruption are not being dealt with appropriately by the government. They also worry that businesspeople who refuse to get involved in these practices are increasingly ostracized by their peers.
The report also highlights concerns about declining standards in Hong Kong. In particular, it notes that there has been a decline in the quality of public services. This is partly due to a lack of investment in infrastructure, but it also reflects a broader trend of declining standards across a range of sectors.
The chamber argues that these trends are bad for business and threaten to damage Hong Kong's international reputation. It goes on to call for action to address these problems. Specifically, it urges the government to take action to tackle corruption, improve public services, and invest in infrastructure.
"If Hong Kong is to remain a leading international business center, it needs to tackle corruption and improve standards across the board," said the chamber's CEO, Tara Joseph.
The report has been welcomed by other business groups in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce described it as "timely and important," while the Confederation of Hong Kong Industries said it was "a valuable contribution to the debate about the state of business in Hong Kong."
However, the report has also been criticised by some pro-Beijing figures in Hong Kong. They argue that the report is politically motivated and that it ignores the positive developments that have taken place in Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty.
Despite these criticisms, the British Chamber of Commerce insists that the report is a genuine attempt to highlight the challenges facing businesspeople in Hong Kong.
"Our report is about identifying the challenges and working together to find solutions," said Tara Joseph. "We hope that the government, business groups, and other stakeholders will work with us to address these important issues."
