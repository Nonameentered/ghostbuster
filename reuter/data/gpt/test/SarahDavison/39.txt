Most European Governments to Attend Inauguration of Unelected Provisional Legislature in Hong Kong, Says Western Envoy
Amidst growing concerns over the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy, it has been reported that most European governments are expected to attend the inauguration of the unelected provisional legislature on Friday. This comes as a surprise to many, as the legislature has been widely criticized as a tool of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to further tighten its grip on Hong Kong.
The provisional legislature was established by Beijing in direct contradiction to the "one country, two systems" principle that was promised to Hong Kong during the handover from Britain in 1997. It consists of 70 members, none of whom were elected by the people of Hong Kong, but appointed by the CCP.
The move has been met with fierce opposition and protests from Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists, who see it as an affront to the territoryâ€™s autonomy and freedoms. Many have also questioned the legality of the move, arguing that it contravenes Hong Kong's Basic Law, the territory's mini-constitution.
Despite these concerns, it appears that most European governments are set to attend the inauguration. A Western envoy, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters that "most European ambassadors will attend the ceremony" and that the move "reflects their countries' positions towards China".
The envoy added that while some ambassadors may have reservations about attending, it is seen as a "necessary diplomatic gesture" to maintain good relations with China. "It's not ideal, but we have to be pragmatic", he said.
The decision to attend the ceremony has drawn criticism from many, including members of the European Parliament. Guy Verhofstadt, the former President of the parliament's Brexit Steering Group, called the move a "grave mistake" that would only serve to legitimize Beijing's actions in Hong Kong.
"By attending this illegitimate ceremony, European governments risk being seen as endorsing China's blatant disregard for democracy and human rights", he said.
The decision also highlights the delicate balancing act that many European governments are forced to carry out when it comes to their relations with China. On the one hand, Beijing is an important economic partner and a key player in global affairs. On the other, its human rights record and increasingly assertive foreign policy have drawn criticism from many in Europe.
The situation in Hong Kong is further complicating matters. Many in Europe see the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy as a threat to the global order and a sign of China's growing assertiveness. But as the envoy pointed out, attending the inauguration is seen as a way to maintain good relations with China and avoid a diplomatic row.
As the ceremony approaches, it remains to be seen whether any European governments will change their minds and boycott the event. But the fact that most are set to attend the inauguration of an unelected, CCP-appointed legislature is likely to raise eyebrows and fuel speculation over the future of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms.
