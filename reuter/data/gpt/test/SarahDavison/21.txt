Hong Kong newspapers have been accused of pro-China bias and self-censorship just weeks ahead of the midsummer transition to Chinese rule. Critics are pointing to several incidents where newspapers have downplayed or ignored stories that could be considered critical of China. The accusations are raising concerns about the future of press freedom in the former British territory.
One of the most recent incidents that has come to light is the censorship of the pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong from the South China Morning Post. Wong was ousted from his role as a columnist after he tweeted about a boycott of TVB, a Hong Kong television company that is seen as pro-Beijing. Wong's tweet was seen as critical of China, and it was not published by the South China Morning Post. Instead, Wong posted it to Facebook, prompting the newspaper to remove him from his role.
This incident is just one example of what critics say is a broader problem of self-censorship among Hong Kong's newspapers. In recent years, several journalists and media outlets have reported incidents of pressure from China to tone down or avoid reporting on sensitive issues related to China's Communist Party and its policies. The crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement has also made it more difficult for journalists to report on sensitive issues, such as the July 1st anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China.
Critics say that this self-censorship is driven by a desire to maintain good relations with China and to avoid being shut down by the Chinese government. China has long been known for its strict controls over the media and its suppression of free speech. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, China is the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with at least 47 currently in custody.
Hong Kong, which was returned to China in 1997 under the "one country, two systems" model, was supposed to enjoy a high degree of autonomy and freedom of expression for 50 years. But as China's grip on the territory has become tighter in recent years, concerns have grown that this autonomy is being eroded. The recent cases of self-censorship by newspapers and journalists are seen as evidence of this trend.
Some media outlets in Hong Kong have been accused of outright pro-China bias. One of the most prominent examples is Hong Kong's broadcaster TVB, which has been accused of pushing pro-China propaganda. TVB has come under fire for downplaying the pro-democracy protests that have swept Hong Kong in recent years and for airing programs that promote China's interests.
Critics say that the pro-China bias in Hong Kong's media is not only a threat to press freedom but also to Hong Kong's autonomy. The territory has a unique cultural and political identity that is different from mainland China, and many fear that the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy will eventually lead to its assimilation into China.
The accusations of self-censorship and pro-China bias are particularly worrying as Hong Kong prepares to mark the 24th anniversary of its handover to Chinese rule on July 1st. This year's celebrations are expected to be more muted than in previous years due to the pandemic, but they will still serve as a reminder of Hong Kong's uncertain future under Chinese rule.
The Chinese government has been tightening its grip on Hong Kong ever since the pro-democracy protests of 2019, which saw millions take to the streets to demand greater political freedom. In response, China imposed a new national security law on the territory, which criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. Critics say that the law is overly broad and can be used to stifle dissent and silence political opposition.
The national security law has already had a chilling effect on Hong Kong's media. Earlier this year, Hong Kong's leading pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, was forced to shut down after it was raided by police and its founder was arrested under the national security law. The closure of Apple Daily was seen as a major blow to press freedom in Hong Kong and a harbinger of things to come.
As Hong Kong prepares for the midsummer transition to Chinese rule, the accusations of self-censorship and pro-China bias among the territory's newspapers are raising concerns about the future of press freedom and political autonomy. Hong Kong's unique status as a semi-autonomous entity within China is at risk, and the erosion of press freedom is seen as a threat to its identity and independence.
It remains to be seen how Hong Kong's newspapers and journalists will respond to these accusations. Some are already pushing back, pointing out that many reporters are still committed to reporting the truth and holding those in power accountable. But with China tightening its grip on the territory and the national security law looming over them, it is clear that the challenges facing Hong Kong's press freedom are only going to grow in the years to come.
