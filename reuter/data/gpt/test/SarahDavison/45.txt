Financial experts have dismissed the possibility of a merger between the Hong Kong and China currencies in the short-term and the long-term, stating that such a move is virtually impossible.
The issue of currency merger has been a longstanding debate in the region, fueled by China's increasing economic influence in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have previously expressed their desire for a currency merger, arguing that it would promote economic integration and stability in the region.
However, financial experts have noted that such a merger would not only be difficult to implement but could also lead to significant economic challenges in both Hong Kong and China.
In the short-term, a currency merger would require significant adjustments in both the Hong Kong and China economies. The two currencies have vastly different exchange rates and monetary policies, making it challenging to establish a unified currency that could seamlessly integrate both economies.
The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, while the Chinese yuan is controlled by the central bank in Beijing. The two currencies have different exchange rates and monetary policies, making it challenging to establish a unified currency that could seamlessly integrate both economies.
Moreover, Hong Kong's economy is heavily focused on financial services, while China's economy is more export-oriented. A currency merger could lead to inflation in Hong Kong and a decline in its financial sector, as well as increase China's dependence on the Hong Kong market.
Experts also note that a currency merger could face significant political obstacles in Hong Kong. Hong Kong residents have long valued their currency's independence, with many viewing it as a symbol of the region's autonomy from mainland China.
This sentiment was evident during the 2019 pro-democracy protests, where some protesters were seen waving the Hong Kong dollar in an act of defiance against China's increasing influence in the region.
As such, financial experts believe that any attempt to merge the currencies would likely face significant opposition in Hong Kong.
In the long-term, experts argue that economic factors make a currency merger even less likely. China's economy is significantly larger and more powerful than Hong Kong's, and there is little incentive for Beijing to integrate its economy with a smaller, less dynamic region.
Moreover, Hong Kong's economic importance to China has declined in recent years, as China has invested heavily in its domestic market and expanded its economic reach through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.
In conclusion, a currency merger between Hong Kong and China is unlikely both in the short-term and the long-term. While the idea has its supporters, the economic and political realities make it an unlikely and practically impossible move.
