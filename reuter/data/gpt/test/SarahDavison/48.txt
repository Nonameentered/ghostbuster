Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang has promised to ensure stability and prosperity for the city before it returns to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.
In a press conference on Thursday, Tsang said that Hong Kong would remain an international financial center and that he would work to maintain the city's competitive edge in the region.
"We will make sure that Hong Kong remains open for business, that our markets remain free, and that our legal system stays independent," Tsang said. "We will also work closely with our mainland Chinese counterparts to deepen economic cooperation and ensure that Hong Kong remains a gateway to China."
Tsang's comments come amid concerns about the impact of the handover on Hong Kong's economy, which has been the growth engine of the region for decades.
Many have worried that the city's success as a financial center and its status as a hub for global trade and commerce will be threatened by the transition to Chinese rule.
However, Tsang stressed that the government would take steps to ensure a smooth transition and that the city's institutions would remain intact.
"We will continue to support our financial industry, our shipping industry, and our logistics industry," he said. "We will also continue to foster innovation, promote entrepreneurship, and support small and medium-sized enterprises."
Tsang also addressed concerns about the potential impact of the handover on Hong Kong's legal system, which operates under a common law framework that is distinct from mainland China's civil law system.
He said that the government would work to maintain the city's judicial independence and that it would seek to strengthen ties with mainland Chinese legal authorities to facilitate cooperation and exchange.
"We are committed to upholding the rule of law, and we will make sure that our legal system remains fair, impartial, and transparent," he said.
Tsang's comments were welcomed by members of the business community, who expressed hope that the government's commitment to stability and prosperity would help ensure a smooth transition.
"Donald Tsang is a seasoned veteran of Hong Kong's financial industry, and we trust that he will do everything in his power to support our businesses and keep our economy moving forward," said Howard Cheng, the chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks.
However, some critics pointed out that Tsang's pledges may be difficult to fulfill, given the complexities of the handover and the uncertain political climate in China.
"Maintaining stability and prosperity in the face of a major political transition is no small feat," said Frank Ching, a Hong Kong-based political analyst. "Donald Tsang has his work cut out for him, and it remains to be seen whether he can deliver on his promises."
Despite the challenges, Tsang remained optimistic about Hong Kong's future.
"We are living in a time of great change, but I have faith in our city and in our people," he said. "With hard work, determination, and a commitment to excellence, I believe that we can overcome any obstacle and forge a bright and prosperous future for Hong Kong."
