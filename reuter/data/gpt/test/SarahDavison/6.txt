Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich plans to travel to Beijing later this month to discuss allegations of illegal funding by China. Gingrich, who is also a former Republican presidential candidate, has been critical of China's economic policies in the past and has been outspoken about the need for the United States to take a more aggressive stance against the Asian superpower.
At the heart of the allegations against China is the issue of state-sponsored hacking. According to reports, Chinese hackers have been stealing sensitive information from the United States for years in order to gain a competitive advantage in fields such as technology, finance, and defense. Some of this stolen information may have also been used to fund Chinese businesses, a practice that is illegal under U.S. law.
Gingrich believes that China's actions are harmful to American interests and is seeking to hold Beijing officials accountable for their actions. He says that his upcoming visit is an opportunity to address these issues in a diplomatic manner and to work towards finding solutions that benefit both countries.
"I am heading to Beijing to discuss the allegations of illegal funding by China," Gingrich said in a statement. "I believe that it is important to engage in a constructive dialogue with our Chinese counterparts in order to address these issues and to find ways that we can work together for the benefit of both our nations."
The trip comes amid a period of tension between the United States and China, with the two countries engaging in a trade war and tensions simmering over issues such as human rights abuses in Xinjiang and the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Some observers have expressed concern that Gingrich's trip could further inflame tensions between Washington and Beijing.
However, supporters of Gingrich argue that his visit is an important step towards holding China accountable for its actions. They point to his experience as a politician and diplomat, as well as his knowledge of China's political and economic landscape, as evidence that he will be able to engage in productive discussions with Chinese officials.
"Newt Gingrich is the perfect person to lead this discussion," said John Bolton, former National Security Advisor to President Trump. "He understands China better than almost anyone and is a respected voice in diplomatic circles. I have faith that he will be able to make progress on these important issues."
Gingrich's trip to Beijing is scheduled for later this month and is expected to last for several days. It is unclear at this time which Beijing officials he will be meeting with or what specific topics will be discussed during his visit. However, many are hopeful that the trip will lead to increased cooperation between the United States and China and a resolution to the ongoing tensions between the two countries.
