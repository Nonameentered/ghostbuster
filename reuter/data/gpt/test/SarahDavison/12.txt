As Hong Kong's handover to China approaches, the city's police force is bracing itself for all possible scenarios that could unfold during the celebrations marking the transfer of power. With the handover anniversary being an emotional and politically-charged event, the authorities are taking every precaution to ensure that the festivities pass off smoothly, without any violence or disruption.
The preparations for the handover celebrations have been underway for weeks, with thousands of police officers being mobilized to maintain law and order. The police have said that they are prepared for any contingency, whether it is a peaceful gathering or a violent protest. They have deployed a range of equipment and personnel to manage the crowds, including water cannons, riot shields, tear gas, rubber bullets, and armoured vehicles.
The authorities have also taken several measures to limit the number of people attending the celebrations, citing Covid-19 concerns and the need to maintain social distancing. The public has been urged to watch the events on television, and access to public areas, such as Victoria Park, will be closely controlled. The police have warned that anyone who tries to gather in large numbers or engage in disruptive behavior will be arrested and prosecuted.
In the run-up to the handover anniversary, the police have conducted a series of exercises to test their readiness for different scenarios. For example, they have practiced how to respond to an attack on a police station or government building, how to subdue violent protesters, and how to evacuate injured people. The exercises have involved various branches of the police force, including the tactical unit, marine unit, bomb disposal unit, and police dog unit.
However, the preparations have not been without controversy. Some human rights groups have criticized the heavy-handed tactics of the police, accusing them of using excessive force and violating the rights of protestors. They have also questioned the need for such a massive show of force when the majority of people in Hong Kong are expected to stay at home or watch the events on TV. Moreover, they have criticized the government's decision to ban the annual pro-democracy march that has traditionally taken place on July 1, the day of the handover anniversary.
The police have tried to defend their actions, saying that their primary concern is the safety of the public and the city. They have also emphasized that they are acting within the law and that they are only using force when necessary and proportionate. They have urged people to cooperate with them and respect the law and order.
Meanwhile, the residents of Hong Kong are divided over the handover anniversary. While some see it as an occasion for celebration and unity, others see it as a reminder of the loss of autonomy and freedom that they have experienced under Chinese rule. The handover anniversary coincides with the passing of a new security law that grants Beijing more powers to suppress dissent and impose its will on Hong Kong.
The new law has sparked widespread protests and condemnation from various sectors of Hong Kong society and the international community. Critics argue that the law undermines the "one country, two systems" framework that was supposed to guarantee the autonomy of Hong Kong and its people. They fear that it will lead to further erosion of civil and political rights and the stifling of free speech and assembly.
Against this backdrop, the handover celebrations are likely to be a tense and emotional affair. The authorities will be keen to ensure that nothing goes wrong and that the handover passes off smoothly. Whether they can achieve this goal remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: the world will be watching Hong Kong to see how it handles this critical moment in its history.
