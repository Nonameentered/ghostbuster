Hong Kong has been struggling to maintain its foothold as a global financial hub ever since China imposed a new national security law on the city last year. The law, which criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, has been criticized by many countries and human rights groups for being too broad, vague and open to abuse. It has also raised fears of eroding Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms, which were guaranteed under the "one country, two systems" principle when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
Now, a new report by HSBC's chief economist for Asia-Pacific warns that Hong Kong's unskilled labour force is hindering its success under China's rule. The report, titled "Hong Kong: The long road ahead," highlights the challenges facing the city in the wake of the law and the pandemic, including a shrinking workforce, an aging population, a widening wealth gap, and a lack of diversity in education and skills. 
"The gradual loss of Hong Kong's comparative advantage in unskilled labour has reduced its competitive edge and raised labour costs," said Frederic Neumann, the author of the report. "This has made it even more difficult for Hong Kong to attract and retain talent, especially in the high-tech and creative industries that require more advanced skills and knowledge." 
Neumann cited the example of Shenzhen, the booming megacity across the border from Hong Kong, which has become a magnet for tech startups, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs in recent years. Shenzhen's thriving tech scene has been fueled by its abundant supply of young, educated and ambitious workers, who are willing to work long hours for lower wages than their counterparts in Hong Kong. 
"Shenzhen is a clear competitive threat to Hong Kong, not only in terms of its proximity and accessibility, but also in terms of its talent pool," said Neumann. "To compete effectively, Hong Kong needs to invest more in education, training and re-skilling to upgrade its labour force and enhance its innovation capacity." 
Neumann pointed out that Hong Kong has some advantages over Shenzhen, such as its legal system, its cultural diversity, its global network and its reputation for financial expertise. However, he warned that these advantages could be eroded if Hong Kong fails to address its structural weaknesses, including its high living costs, its political uncertainties and its social discontent. 
"Hong Kong needs to tackle these issues head-on, rather than relying on short-term measures or external factors," said Neumann. "It needs to build a more inclusive and resilient society that can adapt to the changing global landscape and embrace new opportunities." 
The HSBC report comes as Hong Kong is trying to revive its economy after two years of political turmoil and the pandemic. The city's GDP shrank by 6.1% in 2020, the largest contraction since the Asian financial crisis in 1998. It also faces a growing brain drain, as many young professionals and entrepreneurs are leaving the city for other destinations, such as Taiwan, Canada and the UK. 
The Hong Kong government has launched various initiatives to boost innovation, technology and entrepreneurship, such as the HK$100 billion Technology Talent Scheme, the HK$2 billion Reindustrialisation Funding Scheme, and the HK$500 million Innovation and Technology Venture Fund. It has also promised to reform the education system and enhance vocational training. However, critics say these efforts are not enough or are too slow, given the urgent need to compete with other global hubs and retain local talent. 
As Hong Kong marks the 24th anniversary of its handover to China on July 1, many people are reflecting on the city's past, present and future. Some see it as a resilient and dynamic city that can overcome any challenges, while others see it as a fading and divided city that may never regain its glory. The truth may lie somewhere in between, as Hong Kong faces a long and uncertain road ahead.
