China's firm backing of Hong Kong dollar makes attack unlikely, say experts
As Hong Kong braces itself for the impact of the US trade war, experts say China's firm backing of the Hong Kong dollar makes an attack on it unlikely.
The Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the US dollar for more than three decades, a move that has been successful in keeping the currency stable and boosting Hong Kong's economy. But recent tensions between the US and China have put the Hong Kong dollar under pressure.
The US has been threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, and China has responded by devaluing its currency, the yuan, in order to make its exports more competitive. As a result, the Hong Kong dollar has been caught in the crossfire.
But according to experts, an attack on the Hong Kong dollar is unlikely to succeed. This is because China is committed to backing the Hong Kong dollar, and has deep pockets to ensure its stability.
"China has a lot of money, and they can use that to support the Hong Kong dollar," says Jonathan Garner, chief Asia and emerging markets strategist at Morgan Stanley. "They have a vested interest in keeping the Hong Kong dollar steady, because Hong Kong is a gateway for Chinese companies to access the global market."
Garner points out that China has been propping up the Hong Kong dollar for years, and is in a strong position to continue doing so.
"The Hong Kong dollar is backed by a massive amount of US dollars, which China has accumulated over the years," he says. "They have the means to intervene in the currency markets and stabilize the Hong Kong dollar if necessary."
China has also signaled its commitment to supporting the Hong Kong dollar in recent months. In March, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced that it would start issuing bills in Hong Kong, a move that was seen as a vote of confidence in the city's financial markets.
"The PBOC's decision to issue bills in Hong Kong is a sign that China is committed to backing the Hong Kong dollar," says Garner. "It shows that they are willing to invest in Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and make sure that the city's markets remain stable."
Some experts say that China's commitment to supporting the Hong Kong dollar is also driven by political factors.
"Hong Kong is an important source of capital for mainland China, and the Hong Kong dollar is a key part of China's financial system," says Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Capital. "China doesn't want to risk destabilizing the Hong Kong dollar and damaging its own financial system."
Wong adds that an attack on the Hong Kong dollar would also damage China's credibility on the international stage.
"If China were to let the Hong Kong dollar collapse, it would be a major blow to its reputation as a responsible global player," he says. "China has invested heavily in the global financial system, and any move that undermines that system would be seen as a sign of weakness."
Despite the assurances of experts, some investors remain concerned about the Hong Kong dollar's stability. The currency has weakened slightly against the US dollar in recent weeks, and some analysts say that the ongoing US-China trade war could cause further volatility.
"The US-China trade war is a major risk factor for the Hong Kong dollar," says Garner. "If the dispute escalates, we could see increased pressure on the currency, and that could lead to greater intervention from China."
However, Garner says that despite the risks, the Hong Kong dollar remains a safe-haven currency for investors.
"Hong Kong has a well-developed financial system and a stable government, and those factors make the Hong Kong dollar an attractive currency for investors," he says. "As long as China continues to back the currency, we don't see a major threat to the Hong Kong dollar's stability."
