Hong Kong's financial markets were on the edge this past week after rumors circulated that the thriving city-state was on the brink of a merger with China. As the Chinese Communist Party moves forward with its plans to unify Hong Kong with China, analysts warn that the financial markets could experience a significant shakeup. 
The purchase of Hong Kong by the Chinese government is not a new concept, as they have been trying to take over the city-state since the 1980s. However, the relationship between the two entities has soured in recent years following the pro-democracy protests in 2019 and the recent passage of the National Security Law. The law has effectively silenced critical voices, eliminated opposition leaders, and suppressed dissent. 
Hong Kong is a financial hub in the Asia-Pacific region and a global financial center. Any significant changes in its status can have a ripple effect on the region's economy, as well as the global market. Additionally, concerns remain about China's treatment of minorities and the suppression of religious and civil freedoms. 
The financial markets acted accordingly, with the Hang Seng index dropping nearly 5% on Thursday, the largest decline in recent weeks. Market analysts are pointing to fears of a shift in policy following the unification of the two entities. Some are also speculating that Hong Kong's status as an international finance center may be at risk. The city-state receives a significant portion of its GDP from the financial industry, and any disruption to this industry would have a severe impact on the economy. 
There is already an exodus of residents who are concerned about their future in the city-state. This includes both expatriates and locals, some of whom have already left due to the political instability and soaring living costs. The current unsettled environment has also led to a reduction in the number of new entrepreneurs and companies relocating to Hong Kong. As a result, many financial and tech startups have been looking for greener pastures elsewhere. 
Growing discontent in Hong Kong's business community and among the broader population could further complicate the situation. Any indication of the increased imposition of Chinese laws and regulations on Hong Kong's financial sector is likely to lead to a backlash that could substantially undermine the city's standing as a financial hub. This situation is especially precarious since Hong Kong is no longer governed autonomously but has been brought under the direct rule of Beijing since last year's National Security Law. 
Furthermore, people have questioned the effectiveness of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments' strategies since Occupy Central in 2014. Hong Kong's unprecedented demonstrations and escalating violence have left many wondering whether the two governments can create a mutually acceptable solution while maintaining the former British colony's role as a regional financial center. 
Concerns that driving out opposition leaders and harassing critics will kill the city's evolution from a British colony to an open city welcoming to new perspectives are valid. Scientists, academics, and techies who had chosen Hong Kong, hoping to enjoy the cultural exchange and economic opportunities offered, are canceling those agreements due to political instability. They fear they will become cut off from international networks, funding, and collaboration. 
In conclusion, Hong Kong's financial markets are closely monitoring the situation as the city-state approaches a possible merger with China. The recent trade war with China and political turmoil in Hong Kong have sent a chill across the financial sector. It is unclear what the future holds for the city's financial industry and whether it will remain a global financial center or not. Given the current circumstances, international businesses that want to benefit from Hong Kong and China's growth need to be mindful of the risks and uncertainties in the coming period.
