The largest party in Hong Kong, the Democratic Party, has announced its plan to occupy the Parliament building on the first day under Chinese control to stage a symbolic protest. The move comes amid a growing concern over the erosion of the city's autonomy under the new security law imposed by Beijing.
The event, scheduled on July 1, will mark the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China from British rule. The date has traditionally been marked with a peaceful march by pro-democracy groups, but this year's event is likely to be more tense than ever.
The protest is being led by the Democratic Party's chairman, Wu Chi-wai, who has called for a show of defiance against China's increasing encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy. Wu said in a statement that the Legislative Council under Chinese rule would "lose its authority and legitimacy."
"The democratic camp will take no part in this farce," he said.
The party has asked its supporters to come out in large numbers to join the protest, promising to occupy the Parliament building until their demands for greater democracy and freedom are met. The group has also called for an immediate political reform that would allow for universal suffrage, expanded voting rights and more transparency in government.
The move comes amid growing concerns over Beijing's crackdown on the city's autonomy. In late June, the Chinese government imposed a new security law on Hong Kong that criminalizes a wide range of supposedly subversive activities. The law gives police sweeping new powers to investigate and arrest people suspected of threatening national security, prompting fears of a crackdown on free speech and political dissent.
Many see the new law as a deliberate attempt by China to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and suppress pro-democracy forces in the city. The move has sparked a wave of protests in Hong Kong, with many residents taking to the streets to express their anger and frustration.
The protest by the Democratic Party is likely to be seen as a significant challenge to China's authority over the city. The party is one of the few pro-democracy groups that still operates in Hong Kong's Parliament and has been a vocal critic of China's attempts to erode the city's autonomy.
The move is also likely to increase tensions between China and the United States. The US government has been highly critical of China's move to impose a new security law on Hong Kong and has threatened to impose sanctions on Chinese officials if they do not move to protect the city's autonomy.
In recent weeks, both China and the US have taken steps to increase their control over Hong Kong. China has imposed new security laws while the US has revoked Hong Kong's special trade status, which has allowed the city to operate as a hub for international trade.
The move by the Democratic Party to occupy the Parliament building is likely to be seen as a significant escalation in the ongoing battle for control over Hong Kong. It is unclear what China's response will be to the protest, but many fear that it could lead to a more violent crackdown on pro-democracy forces in the city.
For now, the Democratic Party remains committed to its plans to occupy the Parliament building on July 1. The move is likely to be seen as a significant challenge to China's authority over the city and a symbol of resistance against Beijing's increasing encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy.
