Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer of cocoa, is reportedly on track to have its most significant coffee harvest in over a decade, with industry experts forecasting up to 300,000 tonnes of coffee for the 1996/97 coffee crop.
However, the expected bumper crop has come with a warning from coffee buyers that the quality of the coffee being produced may not meet the standards of international markets.
According to the International Coffee Organization (ICO), Ivory Coast's coffee industry has been in decline for years, with low prices, aging trees and a lack of investment contributing to falling yields and quality.
Despite this, there are signs of hope for the industry. The ICO has cited government policy changes, such as the removal of taxes on coffee exports, as having a positive impact on the sector, along with support from development banks and non-governmental organizations.
Jean-Michel Latron, the West Africa representative of the ICO, said: "There is a lot of work to be done, but the situation is improving," adding, "We are optimistic that the quality of coffee from Ivory Coast will continue to improve."
However, some coffee buyers remain unconvinced. Pierre Descrois, head of coffee trading at Carrefour, expressed concerns that the increased production would not necessarily translate to good quality coffee capable of meeting the demands of the international market.
Speaking to Reuters, Descrois said, "We have seen a lot of coffee in recent years that has been of very poor quality... This is a real challenge for us as we try to guarantee a high level of quality for our customers."
Low quality coffee from Ivory Coast has been a long-standing issue for buyers, with some citing poor harvesting techniques and a lack of proper storage facilities as key factors.
As part of efforts to improve quality, the Ivorian government has introduced measures to increase the use of modern farming techniques and storage methods, as well as setting up a regulatory body to oversee the industry.
Despite these measures, some in the industry remain skeptical of the ability of the Ivorian coffee sector to meet the demands of buyers.
According to Marc Blanchard, head of coffee trading at Paris-based coffee roaster Cafes Malongo, "Ivory Coast must improve the quality of its coffee if it wants to compete with other major producers like Brazil and Colombia."
However, there is hope that the increase in production could lead to a more competitive and profitable coffee industry in Ivory Coast.
The upcoming season also marks the first time that Ivory Coast's coffee exports will be certified under the new International Coffee Agreement, which aims to establish a framework for sustainable coffee production and trade.
The move has been welcomed by coffee industry stakeholders as a sign of Ivory Coast's commitment to improving the quality and sustainability of its coffee exports.
Speaking on behalf of the Ivorian government, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Mamadou Sangafowa Coulibaly said, "Certification will help to improve the image of our coffee in the international market, which will ultimately lead to better prices for our farmers."
Whether Ivory Coast's coffee industry will be able to meet the expectations and quality standards of global buyers remains to be seen. However, the increase in production and growing government support for the industry offer a glimmer of hope for the future of coffee in the West African country.
