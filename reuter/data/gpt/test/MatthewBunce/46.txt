The global cocoa industry is bracing for a potential shortfall in Ivory Coast's mid-crop cocoa arrivals, after the country experienced a sharp drop in weekly arrivals, according to a report released on Thursday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).
Ivory Coast is by far the world's largest cocoa producer, accounting for around 40% of global cocoa production. The country's cocoa season is split into two main crops - the main crop, which runs from October to March, and the mid-crop, which runs from April to September.
The mid-crop is usually smaller in volume than the main crop, but is still important for meeting global cocoa demand, particularly as demand for sustainable and ethical cocoa continues to grow.
However, the ICCO's latest report suggests that the mid-crop harvest may be disappointing this year, after weekly arrivals in Ivory Coast dropped by 39% in the week ending on June 6, compared to the same period last year.
"This sharp drop in arrivals raises the prospect of a smaller main-crop surplus and a more muted mid-crop, which could add to concerns over potential supply challenges in the coming months," the ICCO said in its report.
The report did not give specific reasons for the drop in weekly arrivals, but noted that weather conditions had been relatively favorable in Ivory Coast in recent weeks, with regular rains and moderate temperatures.
Ivory Coast's cocoa industry has struggled with a variety of challenges in recent years, including low prices for cocoa beans, poor weather conditions, and the ongoing issue of child labor and deforestation in cocoa-growing areas.
The country has made progress in tackling these issues, particularly through the implementation of its National Cocoa Plan, which aims to improve cocoa productivity, promote sustainable farming practices, and eliminate child labor by 2025.
However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on the cocoa industry, with global demand for cocoa falling sharply as a result of lockdown measures and reduced economic activity. This has led to lower prices for cocoa and reduced income for cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast and other cocoa-producing countries.
Despite these challenges, the ICCO's report noted that Ivory Coast's total cocoa arrivals for the 2020-21 season were still expected to be higher than the previous season, at around 2.1 million tonnes.
However, this increased production may not necessarily lead to higher income for cocoa farmers, due to the ongoing low prices for cocoa beans.
"The challenge now is to ensure that cocoa farmers receive a fair income for their produce, so that they can continue to invest in their farms, support their families, and contribute to the long-term sustainability of the cocoa industry," the ICCO said in its report.
Overall, the drop in weekly arrivals in Ivory Coast is likely to be a cause for concern for the global cocoa industry, particularly as demand for sustainable and ethical cocoa continues to grow. It remains to be seen whether the mid-crop harvest will meet expectations, and what impact this will have on global cocoa prices and availability in the coming months.
