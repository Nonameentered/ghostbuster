San Pedro, Ivory Coast - As the cocoa season in the West African country of Ivory Coast enters its peak period, farmers and traders are gearing up for a sharp increase in cocoa bean arrivals at the San Pedro port. While market analysts expect November and December to record some of the highest numbers of incoming cocoa crop shipments, they also predict that this upward trend is likely to taper off dramatically in the new year.
The San Pedro port, situated on Ivory Coast's southwestern coast, is one of the country's biggest cocoa export ports. With vibrant cocoa plantations producing a significant surplus from the end of October, San Pedro is expected to be swamped with cocoa crop arrivals, as farmers converge to sell their much-awaited harvest.
According to data from Cocoa Insider, a research firm that specializes in cocoa market analysis, the port's cocoa crop arrivals are expected to peak between November and December, with projections indicating an increase of up to 25% from what was recorded during the same period last year. Such sudden high volumes are a clear indication of the rampant cocoa production from the country's farms in the last few months.
The rise in cocoa crop arrivals during this period is attributed to the favorable weather conditions that the country has experienced in the past few months. Following the dry season early this year, Ivory Coast's humid climate has been ideal for cocoa farming, leading to a bumper crop. Moreover, the government's recent decision to provide subsidies to farmers to aid in the procurement of good quality fertilizers and other farming materials has also boosted production.
However, as the new year dawns, market analysts project a sharp decline in cocoa crop arrivals at San Pedro port. Cocoa Insider predicts a 30% drop in cocoa arrivals from January through to March compared to last year's numbers.
Some traders and analysts attribute this potential reduction to the start of the known "harmattan" season, a particularly harsh dry and dusty period that usually lasts between December and February. During this period, cocoa trees tend to experience low productivity, resulting in a significant decline in cocoa crop arrivals. Others speculate that the current global economic recession may have adverse effects on the cocoa markets, causing a drop in demand.
These predictions have set off alarm bells in the cocoa trading industry, with many farmers and traders scrambling to make the most of the current peak by shipping as much cocoa as they can before the expected decline.
Moreover, a further incentive to the high cocoa prices is the current reduction in cocoa supply from Ghana, Ivory Coast's closest competitor. Ghana's production has currently stalled due to delayed payments to farmers and a higher incidence of COVID-19 among cocoa-workers.
Despite the currently high cocoa prices, Ivory Coast's government has called for caution among the farmers and traders, urging them to focus on sustainable cocoa farming methods that will aid in long-term cocoa production and ensure the sustainability of Ivory Coast's most valuable agricultural asset.
As farmers in Ivory Coast gear up for a potentially record-breaking cocoa crop, the country's leaders remain optimistic about the future of the cocoa industry. San Pedro's bustling port remains a key player in the industry, and as the season progresses, traders hope to cement Ivory Coast's position as the world's leading cocoa exporter while ensuring the long-term prosperity of the nation's farmers.
