In an effort to boost its position as the world's largest cocoa producer, the Ivory Coast has officially reviewed three formal proposals for the construction of three new cocoa processing factories. The proposals, which were submitted by three different international firms, have gained a lot of attention from both domestic and international cocoa players.
The move comes at a time when world demand for cocoa and chocolate is increasing, leading to increased competition among cocoa- producing countries for market share. The Ivory Coast is determined to establish itself as the most technologically advanced cocoa processing country, which will help it to increase its cocoa production capacity and meet the increasing demand for cocoa products worldwide.
The three firms that submitted their proposals are all international firms with an established reputation in the cocoa processing space. The firms include Singapore-based OLAM, Dutch firm Tony's Chocolonely, and Swiss firm Barry Callebaut AG.
The proposed facilities will be located in the coastal cities of San Pedro, Abidjan, and Daloa. These areas were chosen due to the enormous cocoa trade in these regions, making them the perfect locations to build new cocoa processing facilities. The locations also give the facilities access to safe water sources, electricity supply, and good road networks.
The Ivory Coast's Ministry of Agriculture, which is responsible for processing and upgrading the cocoa industry, reviewed the proposals, taking into account the proposed cost of construction, production output capacity, sources of raw materials, and environmental impact.
According to the ministry, the review process was thorough, fair, and transparent. The ministry also noted that the proposed facilities would increase the country's cocoa production capacity by about 35%, creating more job opportunities and boosting the country's economy.
Olam proposed to build a cocoa processing factory in San Pedro. This facility will have an annual capacity of 150,000 tons of cocoa processing, focusing mainly on the production of cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and chocolate. The facility will also provide employment opportunities for over 1,000 people.
Dutch firm Tony's Chocolonely submitted its proposal to build a cocoa processing factory in Abidjan. The factory will have an annual processing capacity of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa beans, producing cocoa powder, cocoa paste, and butter. The company will also incorporate training programmes in cocoa farming, targeting small-scale cocoa farmers in the Ivory Coast.
Lastly, Swiss firm Barry Callebaut AG proposed to build a cocoa-processing facility in Daloa. The company will focus on producing sustainable cocoa solutions, including cocoa liquids and chocolate for domestic and international markets. The facility will have an annual processing capacity of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa beans, providing employment for over 1,500 people.
The proposals were well received by the government of Ivory Coast. The government noted that these proposals were aligned with the country's long-term plans to become an industrialized hub for cocoa processing, highlighting that it will help boost the country's cocoa economy, enhance cocoa value chain, and increase the revenue that cocoa generates.
The ministry of agriculture added that this will be a welcome boost to the country's economy, which has suffered from a slump in cocoa prices in recent years. The new factories will create jobs and provide much-needed economic opportunities for the people of the Ivory Coast.
In conclusion, the formal proposals for the construction of three new cocoa processing factories in Ivory Coast are positive developments for the country's cocoa sector. With the review process complete, the firms that submitted proposals must now work with the ministry of agriculture to finalize detailed plans for the construction of the three factories. This initiative will undoubtedly propel the country's cocoa industry forward, making a significant contribution to the national economy.
