Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is expected to meet its forecast for the cocoa harvest despite a drop in the May rains, according to the country's industry regulator. The dry spell sparked concerns among farmers earlier this year that the harvest may be affected, but recent reports indicate that the yield will be as expected.
The Ivory Coast Cocoa and Coffee Council (CCC) has been monitoring the weather patterns and soil moisture levels to ensure an accurate forecast for the crop. The council indicates that the continental West African nation is expected to produce around 2 million tonnes of cocoa in the 2021/2022 season.
Despite the pandemic, which has hit the export market, Ivory Coast's cocoa sector is optimistic, as the country has remained relatively unscathed by the virus. The industry regulator has also stepped up measures to address child labor concerns and deforestation - two persistent issues that have dogged the cocoa industry for decades.
In recent years, the Ivory Coast government has embarked on various initiatives aimed at addressing child slavery on cocoa farms and ending deforestation. The government's actions have been supported by international organizations such as the World Cocoa Foundation and the International Cocoa Initiative. These organizations have called for more investment in sustainable cocoa farming, better farming practices and a more responsible approach to the environment.
Cocoa farming is the mainstay of the Ivory Coast economy, accounting for around two-thirds of the nation's exports. Smallholders farm 90 percent of cocoa in the country, and this provides the backbone of rural society, supporting millions of people. With this expected forecast, the Ivory Coast cocoa farmers can breathe a sigh of relief, and the market's stability can remain constant.
