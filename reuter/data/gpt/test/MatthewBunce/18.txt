A Sino-French consortium has proposed a new cocoa factory in Ivory Coast to help meet the rising demand for chocolate in China. The consortium is led by the Chinese government-owned investment group, China National IC Fund and also includes Cemoi, a family-owned French chocolatier.
The proposed factory would be located in the port town of San Pedro, Ivory Coast, and would cost an estimated $100 million. It is expected to employ about 500 local workers and produce up to 50,000 tonnes of cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, and cocoa powder annually. The products would be shipped to Chinese chocolate makers to supply their increasing demand for chocolate.
According to experts, China’s chocolate consumption has been growing rapidly, transforming the country into the world’s fastest-developing chocolate market. The rising demand for chocolate in China is being propelled by a growing middle class, increasing disposable incomes, and an affinity for Western-style products.
However, China does not have a mature cocoa industry, and almost all of the cocoa beans used to make chocolate in China are imported. Ivory Coast is the world’s largest cocoa producer, and the proposed factory would offer more opportunities for the West African nation to export cocoa products to China.
The Ivorian government has welcomed the proposal, hailing it as a win-win situation for both countries. Ivory Coast is aiming to increase its cocoa processing capacity to add value to its cocoa exports, and the proposed factory would help bridge the demand and supply gap while generating much-needed employment for Ivorians.
Jean-Louis Billon, the Ivorian Minister of Commerce, Industry, and Promotion of SMEs stated that “This project aligns with our national policy of promoting agro-industry and increasing the value of our cocoa exports. We are happy to see that both Chinese and French investors are committed to supporting our development aspirations.”
Cemoi and China National IC Fund have been working together since 2015 and have already invested in a chocolate plant in Hangzhou, China. The French chocolatier produces chocolate products locally, while China National IC Fund helps with the operational aspects and marketing.
Cemoi Chairman Patrick Poirrier stated, “We are eager to strengthen our partnership with CNIC and Ivory Coast by expanding our presence in West Africa. Ivory Coast is the ideal location for us to tap on the abundant high-quality cocoa beans in the region and support the transfer of technology to nurture sustainable cocoa processing.”
The proposed factory is expected to be up and running by 2022, subject to governmental approvals and financing arrangements. It would not only boost the export earnings of Ivory Coast, but it would also enhance China's efforts to become more self-sufficient in the cocoa industry.
