Ivory Coast, known for its cocoa production, is now gaining momentum in the coffee industry. Ivorian  coffee exports have the potential to surge, despite the challenges faced in terms of quality and exportability concerns.
Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer, accounting for about 40% of global cocoa production. However, the country is slowly breaking into the coffee industry and has been exporting coffee for some years. Coffee production has grown over the past three years, from around 40,000 tons in 2018 to 62,000 tons in 2020.
Ivory Coast's coffee production mainly comes from the highland regions in the central and western parts of the country. The majority of coffee produced is Robusta, which is known for its strong and earthy flavor and is preferred for making instant coffee. Robusta accounts for about 70% of the country's coffee exports, while the remaining 30% is Arabica, which is milder and has a more complex flavor profile.
Despite the growth in coffee production, Ivorian coffee beans are known for their poor quality, due to inadequate processing and storage facilities, and lack of use of modern technology. The processing of coffee beans in Ivory Coast is primarily done using traditional techniques, which often results in beans that are of low quality and have high moisture content. The low quality of the coffee beans has led to reduced demand in international markets. 
Ivory Coast has also faced challenges in terms of exportation concerns. One of the major issues has been the lack of a reliable transportation network for the coffee beans. In addition, the country's ports are often congested, leading to long waiting times for shipping containers. Consequently, this has led to a backlog of unprocessed coffee beans, which further reduces their quality.
However, despite the challenges they face, Ivorian coffee farmers are determined to revive their coffee industry and boost exports. They are adopting new technologies and techniques to produce high-quality coffee beans that meet international market standards. Hence, Ivory Coast's government has implemented measures to support coffee farmers by offering training programs, improving cultivation practices, and building infrastructure, such as storage facilities and drying beds.
Ivorian coffee has enormous potential in the international market. The country's coffee beans are gaining recognition for their unique taste and flavor profiles. Some experts suggest that Robusta coffee from Ivory Coast could become more popular than the Indonesian Robusta coffee in the global market. This is due to the unique terroir of the country, its humid climate, rich soil, and mountainous landscape that influences the flavor of its coffee beans.
Ivory Coast's coffee industry has shown incredible resilience in the face of various challenges. Farmers are optimistic that the industry will continue to grow, and the country will become a major player in the coffee industry in the coming years. 
In conclusion, Ivory Coast's coffee industry has enormous potential despite the challenges of poor quality and exportability concerns. The resilience and determination of farmers, combined with government support and technological interventions, are set to improve the quality of Ivorian coffee beans and boost exports. Ivorian coffee farmers are poised to take advantage of the growing demand for high-quality coffee beans and carve out a niche in the global market.
