Blind Chadian musician Yegue Badigue has been using his music to build bridges between people and cultures for years. Born in the small town of Kelo in southern Chad, Yegue lost his sight at a young age due to an unknown illness. Despite this hardship, he has always been drawn to music.
Growing up, Yegue taught himself to play the guitar and started performing at local events. As he gained recognition, he began to travel across Chad and neighboring countries, performing at festivals and concerts. His unique blend of Chadian and African rhythms with Western pop and rock influences earned him a dedicated following.
But Yegue's music is more than just entertainment. Through his lyrics, he addresses pressing social and political issues in Chad, including poverty, corruption, and ethnic division. He sings in multiple languages, including Arabic, French, and Chadian Arabic, to reach as many people as possible.
"Music is a language beyond words," Yegue says. "It speaks to the heart and the soul. When I perform, I hope to touch people's emotions and inspire them to think differently."
Yegue's message has not gone unnoticed. In 2014, he was invited to perform at a conference in Nairobi, Kenya, on the role of music in conflict resolution. There, he met musician and activist Bob Geldof, who was impressed by Yegue's talent and dedication to his cause.
Geldof invited Yegue to perform at the 2015 Africa Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he shared the stage with some of the continent's biggest music stars. "It was an incredible experience," Yegue recalls. "I felt like I was representing my country and my people, and that my music was breaking down barriers and bringing us all together."
Since then, Yegue has continued to use his music as a tool for social change. In 2018, he released his first album, "Maïhouloud," which means "hope" in Chadian Arabic. The album features ten original songs, each addressing a different issue affecting Chad and its people.
One of the album's standout tracks is "Mali-Tchad," a collaboration with Malian guitarist and singer Vieux Farka Touré. The song laments the ethnic and religious violence that has plagued both countries in recent years and urges people to come together in peace and unity.
"Yegue is a true ambassador of Chadian music and culture," Touré says. "His ability to blend different styles and languages is a testament to his talent and vision. It was an honor to work with him on 'Mali-Tchad,' and I hope our message resonates with people across Africa and beyond."
Yegue has also been active in promoting music education and cultural exchange in Chad. In 2019, he founded the Yegue Music School in his hometown of Kelo, where he teaches guitar and other instruments to local children and youth. The school also hosts workshops and concerts, bringing together musicians from different parts of Chad and beyond.
"I want to give back to my community and inspire the next generation of musicians," Yegue says. "Music has given me so much, and I believe it has the power to transform lives and societies."
Yegue's music has not only reached audiences across Africa but has also gained international recognition. In 2020, he was named a finalist in the World Music category of the Independent Music Awards in the United States. His album "Maïhouloud" has been praised by critics for its emotional depth and cultural richness.
"Yegue's music is a reminder of the power of art to bring people together and transcend borders," says Chad's Minister of Culture, Mahamat Saleh Haroun. "He is a true icon of Chadian music and a source of pride for our country."
As he continues to create and perform music, Yegue remains committed to his mission of building bridges through music. He hopes that his music will inspire dialogue, understanding, and positive change in Chad and beyond.
"Music is not just about entertainment or competition," Yegue says. "It's about communication and connection. It's about sharing our stories and our struggles, and finding common ground. That's what I strive to do with every note I play and every word I sing."
