A delegation of African coffee ministers has gathered in Ethiopia to discuss possible measures to reduce exports of the Robusta coffee bean. This follows concerns over increased drought and disease in some African countries, leading to a reduction in Robusta production. 
The Robusta bean, known for its high caffeine content, is a popular choice for many coffee blends and is typically grown in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. However, recent climate change and disease outbreaks have resulted in a drop in production and quality of this bean. 
According to reports, coffee exports among African nations have been affected by several factors, including the increased incidence of pests like the coffee berry borer in East Africa and the coffee wilt disease in parts of Central Africa. Moreover, several countries, including Uganda and Vietnam, have been facing drought conditions, significantly affecting production.
To address these concerns, ministers from several African nations, including Ethiopia, Uganda, and Angola, have convened to deliberate on measures aimed at reducing Robusta exports and seeking solutions to safeguard their domestic supply of coffee.
Among the proposed solutions is the promotion of coffee diversification, with some nations seeking to introduce hybrid varieties that are resistant to pests and droughts. Additionally, some delegates have emphasized the need to focus on Arabica coffee production, which has typically fetched higher prices in foreign markets.
The conference, organized by the International Coffee Organization (ICO), has also emphasized the need for collaboration between coffee-producing nations, private industry, and international organizations to find long-term solutions to the various issues affecting Robusta production.
In his opening remarks, the Ethiopian Minister of Agriculture, Oumer Hussein, emphasized the need for African nations to work together to safeguard their coffee industries from significant disruptions, saying: "We must act now to address these challenges before they become even more severe."
The meeting in Ethiopia comes amid growing international concern over the sustainability of coffee production globally. As climate change continues to impact coffee-growing regions worldwide, experts warn the coffee industry's future is at risk unless coordinated efforts are made to address the various challenges facing it.
