The Ivory Coast government announced plans to hold a cocoa conference in May, to discuss the necessary reforms the industry needs following a review by industry, donors, and delegates. The conference will provide a platform to discuss practical solutions to issues facing the cocoa industry in the Ivory Coast. The West African country is the world’s largest cocoa producer, accounting for roughly 40% of global production.
The review was initiated by President Alassane Ouattara, who expressed concern about the industry’s long-term sustainability amid concerns over labour abuse, poor prices, and low productivity. He directed a review team to scrutinize the cocoa industry supply chain, including issues such as child labour, deforestation, cooperation between industry stakeholders, and economic sustainability.
The review, which involved key industry reports, uncovered that child and forced labour remains a significant issue in cocoa fields in the Ivory Coast. The review also found that cocoa farmers do not receive fair compensation for their crops, leading to poverty. Over the past three decades, the Ivory Coast has lost more than 80% of its forest cover due to unsustainable agricultural practices such as illegal deforestation, cultivation, and illegal mining.
Following the report’s findings, the government of Ivory Coast has developed a comprehensive plan that highlights necessary reforms and recommendations to improve the productivity, sustainability, and welfare of all the stakeholders. These include addressing issues such as child labour, fair-trade prices, sustainable farming practices, and eco-friendly initiatives.
The conference will bring together representatives from the cocoa industry, government officials, donors, and civil society to negotiate and adopt policies and action plans based on the review’s findings. The government aims to use the conference as an opportunity to engage with various stakeholders and work on implementing the necessary reforms to support the cocoa industry’s overall sustainability.
President Ouattara called upon all stakeholders to exhibit a sense of urgency, responsibility, and collective action to address issues facing the Ivory Coast cocoa industry. He acknowledged that creating a sustainable cocoa industry would require collective efforts and mutual cooperation from all stakeholders— from the government to the cocoa farmers to the chocolate manufacturers.
“Every stakeholder has a role to contribute towards ensuring the cocoa industry is sustainable and profitable for all. We must ensure that cocoa farmers’ livelihoods are protected, and their children’s rights are upheld. We must also ensure that the growth of the industry is not at the cost of the environment. Our commitment is to build a sustainable, peaceful, and prosperous cocoa sector for all,” he said.
In conclusion, the Ivory Coast cocoa conference scheduled for May is a crucial initiative that will help bring about positive changes in the cocoa industry. The government's initiative is a significant step towards improving the sustainability of the industry, promoting fair trade practices and protecting the rights of cocoa farmers and their children. All stakeholders must collaborate towards the conference's success, ensuring that the cocoa industry’s long-term sustainability is assured.
