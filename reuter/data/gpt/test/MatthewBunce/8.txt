In Ivory Coast, cocoa warehouses remain full while coffee exporters struggle to find space to store their beans. The problem magnifies the current economic challenges facing the West African country, which heavily depends on cocoa and coffee exports.
According to the country's Coffee and Cocoa Council, over 50% of the coffee produced in the country remains unsold. This is primarily due to the lack of sufficient storage facilities to hold the beans. Meanwhile, cocoa production continues to rise, resulting in an oversupply of cocoa beans and warehouse space.
Many coffee exporters have resorted to storing their beans in makeshift warehouses, which poses a significant risk of spoilage and loss due to the harsh African climate. Some exporters also face the challenge of delayed shipments due to limited space on vessels.
The situation has caught the attention of the government, leading to calls for urgent action to support the coffee industry. The Ivory Coast's government has pledged to provide financial support to coffee exporters, primarily regarding logistics and storage costs.
However, several industry experts believe that the problem goes beyond funding, emphasizing that the government needs to implement policies that encourage local consumption of coffee. This move could help reduce the reliance on exports and create a more balanced and sustainable coffee industry.
Meanwhile, cocoa producers have continued to enjoy a surge in demand, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which spurred an increased demand for chocolate. Ivory Coast's cocoa production is expected to reach 2.3 million tonnes in the 2021/2022 season, representing a 21% increase from the previous year.
While cocoa production records impressive growth, the government faces a critical challenge of finding markets for the surplus cocoa beans, which still remains unused. Failure to find new markets could lead to depressed cocoa prices, where farmers would ultimately suffer the consequences.
Ivory Coast remains the world's top cocoa producer, accounting for over 40% of total world production. The country is also the third-largest coffee producer in Africa, following Ethiopia and Uganda.
As the coffee industry in Ivory Coast faces challenges, stakeholders hope that urgent action will be taken to address the pressing issues. With the right policies and investments, the country's coffee industry could realize its potential, creating employment, generating income, and supporting the nation's economy.
