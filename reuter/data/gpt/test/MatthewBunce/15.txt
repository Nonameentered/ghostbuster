Angola's Coffee Industry Aims to Increase Short-Term Output Tenfold Despite Land Mine Obstacles
Angola, a country that has been historically known for its rich oil and diamond reserves, is now setting its sights on becoming a major player in the global coffee industry. According to the International Coffee Organization, Angola’s coffee production has been steadily increasing since the country’s civil war ended in 2002. However, the country’s present output merely accounts for a negligible percentage of the global coffee market. Despite this, Angola's coffee industry continues to aim for astounding growth through short-term techniques despite facing numerous challenges.
The country's coffee industry is determined to grow quicker than usual. Recently, Ruben Baptista, the cofounder of NovoDia Coffee, a coffee company in Angola, said that the company is aiming to increase its coffee output tenfold in the next three years. NovoDia Coffee currently owns 650 hectares of coffee plantation and produces around 150 tons of coffee every year. However, company officials believe that the demand for coffee in the country and across the globe has the potential to make their ambitious plan to increase production an attainable goal.
Besides NovoDia Coffee, various other Angolan coffee companies are also expanding their production capacities. Angola's coffee exports have already increased 25% year-on-year, according to the National Coffee Institute. Between all of the producers, Angola’s coffee industry hopes to produce around 12,000 tons of coffee in the 2021/2022 coffee season. The goals of the companies will be challenging, given all the obstacles that these enterprises are confronting.
One great challenge is Angola's land mines. The country faced a colossal humanitarian crisis due to landmines, with estimates suggesting that there are more than 80,000 land mines still located in 18 of the country’s 26 provinces. The mines affect around 1,100 communities in Angola, denying the residents access to vital land. While coffee plantations are not normally the intended victims of land mines, farmers who have returned to their land risk injury or death when performing their duties.
The presence of land mines is just one of the many issues facing the country's coffee industry. Prices of equipment and materials required for coffee plantation production are expensive, and while the Angolan government has been working to ease the cost of getting started in the coffee production industry, it can still be challenging for new entrepreneurs. For the coffee industry to grow in Angola, it needs a significant injection of capital to finance plantations, and train farmers to produce high-quality coffee.
One other potential obstacle is that Angola has a relatively small population of coffee drinkers. The demand for coffee is growing, but it is not sufficient to support the substantial increase in production that the country anticipates when compared to top coffee producers worldwide.
Despite these challenges, the country’s coffee industry is working hard to increase exports and supply more beans to the global market. The industry's growth could have a significant impact on Angola's economy, as the country looks for ways to diversify its revenue streams outside of oil and diamonds.
Moreover, one business enterprise, NovoDia Coffee, has tried to tackle the landmine obstacle found in the plantations. The plantation has used the land that was cleared of land mines by The Halo Trust, a non-profit organization that helps clear land mines worldwide. They have planted over 4,000 coffee trees in the new cleared fields and hope to produce around 1.5 tonnes of coffee beans per hectare soon. If more coffee plantations follow the lead of NovoDia Coffee and make use of Halo's existing land clearing work, Angola’s coffee industry could grow even faster, and the land mines could be eradicated more efficiently.
Additionally, one recent development that could potentially increase the demand for coffee in Angola is the recent surge in local coffee shops throughout the country. These cafes have been steadily growing in popularity, especially in most of the country's urban areas.
In addition, coffee always finds a way to penetrate new markets, and this can be seen in how international coffee companies like Nespresso and Starbucks are making inroads into the African continent. Starbucks recently opened up its first stores in sub-Saharan Africa in South Africa, and there are possibilities of Starbucks expanding into other countries on the continent like Angola in the future.
Angola has a long way to go before it can become a major player in the global coffee market. Challenges like the presence of land mines and the high cost of equipment and materials remain. Additionally, the demand for coffee in the country is still relatively low when compared with other coffee-drinking countries. However, the country's coffee industry has big plans and is working hard to produce and create new markets for coffee in Angola and abroad.
