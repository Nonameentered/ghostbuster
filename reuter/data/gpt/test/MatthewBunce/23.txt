Ivory Coast Sees Increase in Coffee Arrivals at Ports, Exporters Expect Strong Crop Despite Low Prices for Farmers
Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, is seeing an increase in coffee arrivals at its ports as exporters expect a strong crop, despite low prices for farmers. According to data from the country's Coffee and Cocoa Council, 105,000 tonnes of coffee were delivered to Ivorian ports between October 2020 and May 2021. This is a 14% increase from the same period last year.
Exporters are optimistic about this year's coffee crop, expecting it to be above the previous year's level. However, this optimism is not shared by Ivorian farmers, who are struggling with low coffee prices.
In recent years, the price of coffee has plummeted, hitting a historical low in 2019. The Covid-19 pandemic has only worsened the situation, as lockdowns and reduced demand for coffee from cafes and restaurants have led to lower prices for farmers. This has caused many farmers to switch to other crops, such as cocoa and cashew nuts.
"We are seeing an increase in coffee arrivals at our ports, but this does not translate to better prices for our farmers," said Lambert Kouakou, chairman of the Ivorian Coffee and Cocoa Council.
According to the council, the average price of coffee paid to farmers this year has been 600 CFA francs ($1.10) per kilogram, down from an average of 1,200 CFA francs in 2016. This has made it difficult for farmers to maintain their coffee plantations, let alone invest in new ones.
He said the government was taking steps to help coffee farmers, such as offering subsidies for fertilizer and seeds and providing support for agroforestry, which is the cultivation of trees alongside crops.
"We are working to increase the productivity of our coffee farms and improve the quality of our beans, so that we can compete on the global market," he said.
The Ivorian government has also launched a coffee development program, which aims to increase the country's coffee production and improve the quality of its beans. The program includes initiatives such as the provision of high-quality seedlings and technical training for farmers.
Despite the challenges faced by Ivorian coffee farmers, exporters are optimistic about this year's crop. The country's coffee exports are expected to reach 180,000 tonnes in the 2020-2021 season, according to the Coffee and Cocoa Council. This is a 7% increase from last year.
Exporters are building on the success of last year, when Ivory Coast's coffee exports reached a record high of 131,000 tonnes, driven by increased demand from Europe and Asia.
"We are optimistic about this year's coffee crop, which has been strong so far," said Kouame Kouadio, an exporter based in the port city of Abidjan.
He said Ivory Coast's coffee had a good reputation in international markets, thanks to its high quality. "Our coffee is known for its rich flavor and aroma, and we have a loyal customer base," he said.
Ivorian coffee is also highly valued for its sustainability. The country's coffee industry has made significant progress in recent years in promoting sustainable farming practices, protecting the environment, and improving the welfare of farmers and their communities.
"Investing in sustainability is not only good for the environment, but it is also good for business," said Kouadio. "We are proud to be part of a coffee industry that is leading the way in sustainability and social responsibility."
Despite the challenges faced by Ivorian coffee farmers, the country's coffee industry is poised for growth, driven by strong demand for high-quality, sustainable coffee in the global market. While there is much work to be done to support Ivorian farmers, the future of Ivory Coast's coffee industry looks bright.
