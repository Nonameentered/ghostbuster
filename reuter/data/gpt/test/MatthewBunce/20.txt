Ivory Coast Coffee Production Expected to Exceed Last Year's Totals Despite Quality Concerns
Ivory Coast has been known for its robust agricultural industry that produces some of the finest cocoa and coffee beans in the world. Despite the ongoing concerns regarding coffee quality, Ivory Coast's coffee production is expected to exceed last year's totals, breaking previous records.
The coffee industry in Ivory Coast is gearing up for the 2021-22 harvest season, with optimism about the pending results and with an expectation of breaking new records. The country's government hopes to produce more than 350,000 tonnes of coffee beans, which is about 12 percent more than last season.
The latest development comes despite the concerns over the quality of the coffee beans produced in Ivory Coast. Critics have lamented the lack of efforts to promote quality over quantity, with many blaming the emphasis on mass production for the deteriorating quality of beans.
However, coffee experts are confident that Ivory Coast's coffee beans still possess a unique flavor profile that sets them apart from other countries. They argue that the issue of quality can be addressed by improving the management of the entire production process, starting from the farms, to the processing facilities and even the transportation.
The government appears to recognize the concerns over the beans' quality, and it has announced that it will embark on a quality improvement program that will include educating farmers on best practices, providing them with better equipment and guaranteeing them better prices for high-quality beans.
Despite the challenges, the coffee industry in Ivory Coast remains a vital part of the country's economy, providing livelihoods for over 200,000 people, and generating more than $800 million in exports annually.
The quality of Ivory Coast's coffee beans had long suffered due to years of unrest and low investment. However, the political stability and the government's drive to promote agricultural investment have helped to boost the industry's growth and increase coffee production. Ivory Coast has become one of the top five coffee-producing countries in Africa, alongside Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania.
The country also aims to improve the domestic market for its coffee beans, which currently account for less than one percent of the local consumption. The government is encouraging local coffee consumption, mainly through education and advertising. It is hoped that by promoting the consumption of coffee locally, the country can capture a bigger share of the proceeds of the coffee value chain.
In conclusion, Ivory Coast's coffee industry is poised to break new records despite ongoing concerns about quality. The government's push to improve the quality of its beans and encourage local consumption is a step in the right direction. The upcoming harvest season provides an opportunity to prove that Ivory Coast can challenge the dominance of the biggest coffee producers globally, and produce specialty coffee that is prized by roasters and coffee connoisseurs worldwide.
