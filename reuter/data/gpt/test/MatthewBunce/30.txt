Ivorian Cocoa Arrivals Expected to Approach Record Levels for 1996/97 Main Crop Season
Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is expected to see record levels of cocoa arrivals for the 1996/97 main crop season, which runs from October 1 to March 31. The expected increase in cocoa arrivals is due to a combination of favorable weather conditions and government initiatives aimed at increasing production.
According to the Ivorian Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC), cocoa arrivals for the current season are expected to reach 1.6 million tonnes, up from 1.45 million tonnes in the previous season. The record for cocoa arrivals in a season was 1.55 million tonnes in 1992/93.
"We are confident that we will approach that record level this season," said Yao N'guessan, the Director General of the CCC.
The increase in cocoa arrivals is expected to boost Ivory Coast's economy, which heavily relies on cocoa exports. Cocoa exports account for around 40% of the country's total export revenues.
"We expect the higher cocoa arrivals to have a positive impact on the Ivorian economy, which has been struggling in recent years due to falling cocoa prices and political instability," N'guessan said.
The government of Ivory Coast has implemented several initiatives aimed at increasing cocoa production, including a subsidy program to encourage farmers to plant new cocoa trees and a plan to replant old trees that are no longer productive.
"We have seen an increase in the number of cocoa trees being planted, and we expect this to have a positive impact on production in the long term," N'guessan said.
The favorable weather conditions in Ivory Coast have also helped boost cocoa production this season. The country has experienced a mild harmattan, a dry and dusty wind that blows across West Africa in the winter months. The harmattan is known to affect cocoa production, but this year's mild harmattan has had a minimal impact on cocoa yields.
"We have had good weather conditions so far this season, and we expect this to continue," N'guessan said.
However, there are concerns that the increase in cocoa arrivals could lead to a glut in the market, which would result in falling prices. Cocoa prices have already been volatile in recent years due to oversupply and a decrease in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
"We are monitoring the situation closely and will take action if necessary to ensure that prices remain stable," N'guessan said.
The Ivorian government has previously intervened in the cocoa market to stabilize prices. In 2011, the government introduced a system of guaranteed pricing for cocoa farmers, which set a minimum price for cocoa exports. The system has been successful in stabilizing prices and ensuring that farmers receive fair prices for their crops.
"We are committed to ensuring that cocoa farmers receive a fair price for their crops, and we will continue to take measures to stabilize prices," N'guessan said.
The increase in cocoa arrivals is also expected to have a positive impact on the Ivorian cocoa industry, which has faced several challenges in recent years. The industry has been criticized for its use of child labor and poor working conditions, leading to several major chocolate companies pledging to source only ethically produced cocoa.
"We are working to address these issues within the industry and ensure that cocoa production in Ivory Coast is sustainable and ethical," N'guessan said.
Overall, the increase in cocoa arrivals for the 1996/97 main crop season is expected to have a positive impact on Ivory Coast's economy and cocoa industry. The government's initiatives aimed at increasing production, combined with favorable weather conditions, have resulted in a record-breaking crop.
"We are proud of the hard work and dedication of our cocoa farmers, and we look forward to a successful season," N'guessan said.
