The world’s chocolate industry leaders, Ivorian officials, and donors will gather in Washington, D.C. in early October to discuss ways to improve cocoa quality and supply in Côte d’Ivoire, the world’s leading cocoa producer. The meeting is being hosted by the World Cocoa Foundation (WCF), a non-profit organization that works to promote sustainable cocoa production and improve livelihoods of cocoa farmers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
According to a press release from WCF, the meeting will focus on sharing best practices in cocoa farming, productivity, and quality, as well as discussing strategies for tackling challenges such as climate change, child labor, and low cocoa prices. The participants will also explore new ways of financing cocoa farmers and cooperatives, including establishing fair trade and sustainable cocoa supply chains.
Côte d’Ivoire is a key player in the global cocoa market, generating an estimated 40% of the world’s cocoa production. However, the country’s cocoa sector has been plagued by poor quality and low productivity, due in part to aging trees, inadequate training for farmers, and a lack of investment in infrastructure and technology. Moreover, many cocoa farmers struggle with poverty, disease, and social inequality, leading to child labor and human rights abuses.
To address these issues, the Ivorian government has launched several initiatives in recent years to boost cocoa productivity and improve the welfare of farmers and their families. These include the implementation of a new cocoa farming model that emphasizes sustainable practices, the establishment of a price stabilization fund, and the creation of a national agency to oversee cocoa production and marketing.
Meanwhile, the chocolate industry has also pledged to support sustainable cocoa initiatives in Côte d’Ivoire and other cocoa-producing countries. Companies such as Nestle, Mars, Hershey, and Ferrero have committed to sourcing cocoa from certified sustainable sources, investing in education and training for cocoa farmers, and promoting fair trade and ethical standards.
However, the industry still faces challenges in meeting the growing demand for high-quality cocoa, especially as climate change threatens to reduce the availability and quality of cocoa beans in certain regions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains and affected cocoa prices, exacerbating the already difficult situation for cocoa farmers in Côte d’Ivoire and other cocoa-producing countries.
The upcoming meeting in Washington, D.C. is expected to provide a platform for intensive discussions among key stakeholders in the cocoa industry, including representatives from government, civil society, and private sector. The participants will share their insights on how to improve cocoa quality and productivity through sustainable and responsible farming practices, and how to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of benefits across the entire cocoa value chain.
The meeting will also offer an opportunity to explore innovative financing mechanisms for cocoa farmers and cooperatives, such as impact investing, blended financing, and microfinance, that can help to unlock new sources of capital and build more resilient cocoa supply chains.
By working together and sharing knowledge and resources across various sectors, the participants in the meeting hope to achieve meaningful progress towards a more sustainable and profitable cocoa industry, one that can contribute to the economic development and social well-being of cocoa farmers and the broader communities in which they live. Through coordinated efforts, the cocoa industry can continue to deliver the high-quality and delicious cocoa products that consumers around the world love, while also supporting the livelihoods and dignity of the people behind the cocoa beans.
