After the prolonged February drought that posed a risk to the mid-crop cocoa harvest in Ivory Coast, the much-needed rains returned in late March, providing much-needed relief for farmers. The rains have rejuvenated the cocoa trees, leading to a boost in mid-crop harvest prospects, according to farmers and industry sources.
Ivory Coast produces nearly 40 percent of the world's cocoa, and the mid-crop harvest plays a crucial role in the country's economy. The mid-crop harvest, which occurs from April to September, generally produces 30 to 40 percent of the country's total cocoa output. However, the drought in February raised concerns that the mid-crop harvest would be severely affected, leading to a fall in production and a rise in the price of cocoa.
Farmers in the key growing regions reported that the rains have helped the cocoa pods to grow faster, and the trees are looking healthier. "We were very concerned about the impact of the drought on our cocoa trees. But the rains have come just in time to save the crop," said Jacques Koffi, a farmer in the western region of Soubre.
Industry experts believe that the late March rains are a boon for the Ivorian cocoa sector, which has been struggling over the past few years due to low prices and a lack of investment. "The rains have come as a relief for cocoa farmers, who were already grappling with low prices and farm-gate activities affected by COVID-19," said a cocoa trader in Abidjan.
The positive news of the rains has brought some respite to the industry, which had been hit earlier this year by a wave of pandemic-related disruptions. The global cocoa market has been volatile this year due to lower demand from the hospitality and confectionery sectors, which were affected by the pandemic. However, traders believe that the positive news of the mid-crop harvest will help stabilize cocoa prices in the coming months.
The Ivorian government has also expressed optimism about the mid-crop harvest after the late March rains. "We are confident that the mid-crop harvest will pick up pace after the rains. The government is committed to supporting farmers to improve their yields and strengthen their livelihoods," said the Agriculture Minister Kobenan Kouassi Adjoumani.
Overall, the late March rains have breathed new life into the Ivorian cocoa sector, raising hopes of a successful mid-crop harvest and a brighter future for farmers.
