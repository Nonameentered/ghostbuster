In a breakthrough moment for Ivory Coast's cocoa production, heavy rains have unexpectedly fallen in the country's cocoa belt, boosting the 1996/97 main crop prospects.
According to the national weather service, the rainfall has exceeded the annual average and covered most of the cocoa-growing regions, including the southeast and southwest of the country. This is a stark contrast to last year's prolonged dry spell, which severely impacted cocoa production and resulted in a smaller main crop.
As a result of the rainfall, farmers are expected to harvest a significant volume of cocoa beans, which is projected to jump to 2.1 million tonnes from 1.7 million tonnes in the previous year. This is much higher than the earlier forecast of 1.8 million to 1.9 million tonnes.
Cocoa is a critical cash crop for Ivory Coast, accounting for nearly 40% of its export earnings. Therefore, any boost in production is essential to the country's economy, which is still recovering from the pandemic's impact.
The unexpected weather has come as a relief for cocoa farmers like 48-year-old Awa Ouattara, who was devastated after last year's dry spell ruined his entire crop. "Last year, I was left with no beans to sell, and I had to take a loan to feed my family. The unexpected rainfall has given me hope again. I hope to harvest a bumper crop this year," he said.
The improved main crop prospects have also pushed up cocoa prices globally, ending a five-month period of slow trading. The long-awaited rainfall has escalated market confidence, which has seen cocoa prices jump to $2,543 per tonne from $2,429 per tonne in September.
Despite the rainfall, Ivory Coast's cocoa industry still faces several challenges, including labour shortages, ageing plantations, and a high incidence of cocoa diseases such as swollen shoot virus, which is expected to affect 30% of the cocoa trees in the country.
To tackle these challenges, the government, in partnership with industry players, has adopted several long-term strategies, such as investments in new cocoa planting materials, establishing a cocoa disease control programme and offering incentives for young people to take up cocoa farming.
In conclusion, the heavy rains that have fallen in Ivory Coast's cocoa belt have revived the country's hopes of a good cocoa harvest for the 1996/97 main crop. The unexpected weather has not only benefited farmers in the country but has also improved global cocoa prices. However, this should not blind Ivory Coast's cocoa industry to the underlying challenges that continue to threaten its sustainability.
