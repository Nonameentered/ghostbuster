Ivory Coast, the world’s leading cocoa producer, is aiming to increase its cocoa processing capacity to 500,000 tonnes by the year 2000. This ambitious goal was announced at the 13th International Cocoa Organization conference held in Abidjan, the country’s economic capital.
The country currently processes around 200,000 tonnes of cocoa annually, with 60% of that cocoa being processed locally. The remaining 40% is exported to Europe and the United States. Ivory Coast has been actively encouraging cocoa processing within its borders, with the government providing incentives to local chocolate manufacturers.
This drive to increase local cocoa processing is part of Ivory Coast's strategy for economic development. The government believes that by processing more cocoa locally, they will be able to add more value to the export of the cocoa, create more jobs and stimulate economic growth. According to the Ivorian Minister of Commerce, Jean-Louis Billon, "By processing more cocoa within our borders, we can create jobs and earn more money. This will help us combat poverty in our country."
However, achieving this goal will not be easy. The Ivorian cocoa industry faces several challenges, including a lack of financing, outdated machinery, and insufficient training for workers. These challenges must be overcome if the country is to reach its target.
One of the solutions to these problems is private-public partnerships, with the government partnering with private companies to finance new cocoa processing facilities. To this end, the Ivorian government has already started working with a number of local and international companies to help fund new processing plants.
Additionally, the Ivorian government is also working to improve access to finance for cocoa farmers. Many farmers struggle with limited access to credit, which makes it difficult for them to invest in their cocoa farms. The Ivorian government has set up a cocoa loan fund to provide farmers with access to credit, which will help them increase their supply of cocoa beans.
Technology will also play a crucial role in meeting the government's goals. The government is investing in new technology and equipment, which will help to improve the efficiency of existing cocoa processing plants. Moreover, the government is providing training to local workers in the cocoa industry, which will help to improve the quality of their work and the output of the facilities.
Experts believe that reaching the 500,000-tonne cocoa processing capacity target will provide significant benefits to Ivory Coast's economy. According to the director of the International Cocoa Organization, Michel Arrion, "If Ivory Coast can achieve this target, it will help to create jobs and drive development, not only in Ivory Coast, but across the entire region."
In addition to the economic benefits, there are environmental benefits to increasing cocoa processing capacity. By processing more cocoa locally, the country will reduce the amount of cocoa pods that are exported, and thus reduce the carbon footprint of the cocoa industry.
In conclusion, Ivory Coast's goal to increase cocoa processing capacity to 500,000 tonnes by the year 2000 is an ambitious target, but one that is essential for the country's economic development. If successful, it will bring significant benefits to the country and region, providing more jobs, reducing poverty, and boosting income levels. However, overcoming the challenges facing the cocoa industry will require collaboration between the government, private sector, and cocoa farmers. It will also require investments in technology and equipment, improved access to finance, and better training for workers in the cocoa industry.
