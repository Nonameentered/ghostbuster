CEMOI, the French chocolate giant, has announced plans to build a new cocoa processing factory in Ivory Coast, consolidating the company's position as one of the country's largest cocoa buyers. The new factory, which will be located in the western town of Daloa, is expected to be operational by late 2023.
Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, has long been a key source of cocoa for CEMOI. The French firm already owns three processing factories in the West African nation and employs over 3,500 people.
The new factory, which will have a capacity of 50,000 tonnes per year, will be equipped with state-of-the-art technology that allows for the production of high-quality cocoa. CEMOI said it was investing â‚¬35m ($41m) in the new facility, which will be part of the company's drive to expand its cocoa processing capabilities in Ivory Coast.
"We are delighted to announce our investment in this new factory, which will allow us to enhance our cocoa processing capabilities in Ivory Coast," said Patrick Poirrier, CEO of CEMOI. "This investment is part of our commitment to supporting sustainable cocoa farming practices and the local communities in Ivory Coast."
CEMOI's investment in Ivory Coast is expected to create new jobs and benefit local cocoa farmers. The French firm has been a key player in the country's cocoa sector for over two decades and has actively supported initiatives to promote sustainable cocoa farming practices and provide training to farmers on best practices.
The company's move to invest in a new cocoa processing facility in Ivory Coast is a testament to the growing importance of West Africa's cocoa industry in the global cocoa market. Despite challenges such as climate change, aging trees, and low productivity, the region remains the world's largest cocoa-producing region, accounting for over 70% of global cocoa production.
CEMOI's expansion in Ivory Coast is part of a broader trend of global chocolate companies investing in cocoa processing infrastructure in West Africa. With demand for chocolate on the rise, many companies are seeking to secure access to high-quality cocoa by investing in local processing facilities and forming long-term partnerships with cocoa farmers.
As CEMOI's new factory takes shape in Ivory Coast, it is clear that the country's cocoa sector will continue to play a critical role in shaping the future of the global chocolate industry.
