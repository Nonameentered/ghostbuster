Chad's fragile economy has been given a glimmer of hope in the form of fresh oil revenue, according to official reports from the country.
After several years of struggling to maintain a positive economic outlook, it appears that Chad has finally found a much-needed lifeline.
The oil industry has been a significant driver of economic growth in Chad, accounting for over half of the country's GDP and providing a significant proportion of its government revenue.
However, the country has been through a tumultuous period in recent years, with falling oil prices and increased competition from other nations leading to a decline in profits.
Now though, Chad's fortunes are on the upswing once again, as new oil reserves have been identified in the country's Doba Basin.
The Doba Basin, located in the southern part of Chad, is home to one of the largest oil fields in Sub-Saharan Africa. This new discovery is estimated to hold up to 1.5 billion barrels of crude oil, significantly increasing Chad's already sizeable oil reserves.
According to the Chadian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, the new discovery represents a significant boon to the country's struggling economy, providing a fresh injection of capital that could be used to jumpstart growth in other sectors.
Abdoulaye Sabre Fadoul, Chad's Minister of Petroleum and Energy, was quick to praise the discovery, highlighting its potential to transform the country's fortunes.
"This new discovery is great news for Chad. It will help us address our urgent economic needs and create new opportunities for growth and development," he said in a statement.
The news has been welcomed by international investors, who see Chad's newfound wealth as an attractive opportunity for investment.
"Chad has enormous potential for growth and development, and this new oil discovery represents a major step forward in unlocking that potential," said Paul Tergat, a senior analyst at the World Bank.
"International investors are eager to capitalize on this opportunity, and we expect to see a great deal of interest in Chad's oil sector in the coming months and years."
The Chadian government has already begun taking steps to capitalize on the new discovery, signing a deal with Chinese energy firm CEFC China Energy to develop the Doba Basin.
The deal, which was signed earlier this month, is worth approximately $600 million and will see CEFC take a 51% stake in the project.
"This agreement is an important step in securing the long-term growth of Chad's oil sector. We are committed to working with our partners to maximize the benefits of this new discovery for our people," said Fadoul.
CEFC China Energy has welcomed the agreement, saying that it sees enormous potential in Chad's oil industry.
"We are excited to be partnering with the Chadian government on this important project. We believe that Chad has incredible potential for growth and development, and we are committed to helping unlock that potential through our investment in the Doba Basin," said a spokesperson for the company.
Despite the new discovery, Chad's economic challenges are far from over. The country remains heavily dependent on oil exports, and its economy is still plagued by high inflation, unemployment, and poverty.
However, the new discovery is seen as a positive sign that Chad is moving in the right direction and could provide a much-needed catalyst for change.
"The discovery of new oil reserves in Chad is a game-changer for the country's economy. It represents a significant opportunity for growth and development, and we are optimistic about the future," said Tergat.
With the new investment in the Doba Basin set to begin soon, Chad's future may be looking brighter than it has in years.
