ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast - The Ivorian cocoa midcrop development is under threat due to the dry weather that has hit the country, but industry experts say that strong harvests are still expected.
The midcrop season, which started in April, is crucial for cocoa production in Ivory Coast, which accounts for nearly 40% of the world's cocoa.
According to the National Meteorological Service, the country is experiencing abnormal weather patterns, with temperatures above the normal range and rainfall below average. As a result, the midcrop development has been limited, and farmers are worried about the impact on their yields.
"We are facing a difficult situation because of the dry weather, which has been ongoing for a while. We have not had enough rain, and it has affected the development of the midcrop," said Issouf Kouyaté, a cocoa farmer in the western region of Soubre.
Despite the challenges, industry experts say that the strong harvests are still expected due to the excellent main crop production earlier this year.
"We had a good main crop season. The quality of the cocoa beans was excellent, and we expect the same for the midcrop despite the challenges posed by the dry weather," said Laurent Aho, the director of the Ivorian Coffee and Cocoa Council.
The Ivorian Coffee and Cocoa Council also announced that the government plans to provide support to farmers during this challenging period. The support will be in the form of inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, and training to help them manage the midcrop better.
"We are committed to supporting our farmers. We will provide them with the necessary inputs and training to help them navigate this challenging period and ensure that their yields are not affected," said Yves Brahima Koné, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.
Ivory Coast has been facing unpredictable weather patterns in recent years, which have affected cocoa production. To address this issue, the government has launched a number of initiatives aimed at helping farmers adapt to climate change.
One such initiative is the Cocoa and Forests Initiative, which seeks to promote sustainable cocoa production while preserving the country's forests. The initiative has already resulted in a reduction of illegal deforestation in cocoa-growing areas and has helped farmers adopt sustainable land-use practices.
The Ivorian government's commitment to supporting farmers during this difficult period is a positive sign for the future of cocoa production in the country. With the country accounting for nearly 40% of the world's cocoa, the strength of the industry is crucial not only for Ivory Coast but also for the global chocolate market.
