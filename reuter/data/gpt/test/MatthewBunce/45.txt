Ivory Coast's Cocoa Mid-Crop Expected to Meet Forecasts, but Bean Sizes May Disappoint
The Ivory Coast's cocoa mid-crop is expected to meet forecasts, but bean sizes may disappoint growers. Cocoa is an important agricultural export for the Ivory Coast and accounts for a significant proportion of the country's economy.
The mid-crop season, which runs from April to September, is important for cocoa growers in the Ivory Coast as it accounts for around 35% of the country's annual cocoa production. After a bumper main-crop earlier this year, expectations are high for the mid-crop.
According to the Ivory Coast's Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC), the mid-crop is expected to reach 900,000 tonnes, which is in line with forecasted levels. This will be welcome news for the country's cocoa industry, which has faced a challenging year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower global cocoa prices.
However, there are concerns that bean sizes may disappoint. The CCC has reported that much of the mid-crop cocoa is of smaller size compared to last year. This could affect prices, as buyers typically pay a premium for larger beans as they produce better quality chocolate.
"The mid-crop is meeting our expectations in terms of quantity, but we are seeing smaller bean sizes," said a spokesperson for the CCC. "We are monitoring the situation closely and working with growers to ensure the best quality cocoa for buyers."
The smaller bean sizes are thought to be due to a combination of factors, including a lack of rainfall and pests and disease affecting the crop. The Ivory Coast has experienced a drier than usual rainy season, followed by heavy rains in recent weeks. This has led to poorer quality cocoa beans in some areas, which has affected the overall size of the crop.
To address this, the CCC is working with cocoa growers to improve farming practices and reduce the impact of pests and disease. The organization is also providing education and training to farmers to help them understand how to produce high-quality cocoa that meets global standards.
Despite the challenges facing the cocoa industry, there are signs of hope. The global cocoa market is showing signs of recovery, with demand for chocolate expected to increase as economies reopen and consumers return to normal shopping patterns.
In addition, there is growing interest in sustainable and traceable cocoa, which could benefit Ivory Coast growers who can demonstrate that they are adhering to industry sustainability standards. The CCC has been working to promote sustainable cocoa farming practices in the Ivory Coast, including reducing the use of pesticides and providing education and training to farmers.
"We believe that the future of cocoa in the Ivory Coast is bright," said the CCC spokesperson. "By working with growers to produce sustainable and high-quality cocoa, we can build a more resilient and prosperous industry for the future."
The Ivory Coast is the world's leading producer of cocoa, accounting for around 40% of global production. The cocoa industry is an important source of income for millions of farmers in the country, many of whom are small-scale growers. The country's cocoa sector is also a key driver of economic growth, providing employment opportunities and contributing to the country's GDP.
