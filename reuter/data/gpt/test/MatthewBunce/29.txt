Ivory Coast is set to increase its power capacity by one-third following the completion of the largest combined-cycle power plant in West Africa. The new plant, located in the city of Jacqueville, has an installed capacity of 390MW and will help to meet the country's growing demand for electricity, both domestically and for export markets. 
The Ivorian government is keen to position the country as a net exporter of electrical power within the West African Power Pool, a regional organization that aims to integrate national power systems and facilitate electricity trade between countries in the region. The country already exports power to neighboring Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Togo, and the new power plant will enable it to increase its exports to these countries and potentially others.
"The commissioning of this plant is a milestone in Ivory Coast's energy development," said Thierry Tanoh, the country's Minister of Petroleum, Energy, and Renewable Energy Development. "It reaffirms Ivory Coast's leadership in the region and our commitment to providing reliable and affordable power for our people and neighboring countries."
The new combined-cycle plant is a significant addition to Ivory Coast's power generation mix, which currently relies heavily on thermal power plants that burn expensive imported diesel and heavy fuel oil. The country has been exploring alternative sources of energy in recent years, including hydro, solar, and wind power, and has set a target of generating 42% of its electricity from renewables by 2030.
However, the government recognizes the need for a diversified energy mix that can meet the country's growing demand for electricity and ensure a stable supply during periods of low renewable energy generation. The new power plant, which uses a combination of gas and steam turbines to generate electricity, provides a flexible and efficient means of meeting this demand.
"Investing in combined-cycle power plants is a smart strategy for countries that want to combine low-carbon energy sources with reliable baseload capacity," said Louis Berger, a global engineering and infrastructure firm involved in the project. "These plants are highly efficient, flexible and fast-starting technology that allow countries to balance their power supply mix and support the intermittency of renewable sources."
The development of the Jacqueville combined-cycle power plant was financed by a consortium of lenders led by the African Development Bank, with support from the Ivorian government and private investors. The plant was developed under a public-private partnership between the government-owned power company, CI-Energies, and the global energy firm, Eranove.
"The successful completion of this project is a testament to the value of public-private partnerships in developing critical infrastructure," said Amadou Hott, Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth at the African Development Bank. "We are proud to have supported Ivory Coast's energy sector and look forward to continuing our partnership to bring sustainable and affordable electricity to the people of Ivory Coast and the wider region."
The commissioning of the new combined-cycle power plant is a significant milestone for Ivory Coast's energy sector and its ambitions to become a major exporter of electricity in West Africa. The plant will help to meet the country's growing demand for electricity and provide a reliable and efficient means of balancing its power supply mix. With continued investment in renewable energy and flexible power generation, Ivory Coast will be well placed to meet its energy needs and contribute to the wider regional effort towards energy integration and security.
