Ivorian Cocoa Exports Reach 416,000 Tonnes in 1996/97 Season
Ivory Coast has reported a record export of 416,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1996/97 season. This marks a significant increase from the previous year's figure of 385,000 tonnes, and an all-time high for the West African nation, which is the world's top cocoa producer.
According to the Ivorian Cocoa and Coffee Council, the rise in exports can be attributed to favourable weather conditions and a strong marketing strategy. The council added that the quality of this year's crop was also excellent, which helped boost export figures.
Cocoa is Ivory Coast's leading export product, accounting for around 40% of its total export earnings. The country's cocoa farmers are expected to benefit greatly from this year's bumper crop, with increased revenue and improved livelihoods.
However, the cocoa industry in Ivory Coast is not without its challenges. Child labour remains a significant issue, with an estimated 1.6 million children working on cocoa farms in the country. Efforts to eradicate child labour have been ongoing for several years, but progress has been slow.
Additionally, the industry has been hit by falling prices in recent years, due in part to oversupply and changing consumer preferences. The Ivorian government has taken steps to address this issue by investing in cocoa processing and developing new markets for Ivorian cocoa.
Despite these challenges, the record export figure is welcome news for Ivory Coast's cocoa sector, which has faced a turbulent year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many cocoa farms were forced to close temporarily, and there were concerns about how this would impact the industry.
The increase in exports is also a positive sign for global cocoa supply, which has been affected by adverse weather conditions in other major producing countries such as Ghana and Indonesia.
In conclusion, the record export figure is a testament to the hard work of Ivorian cocoa farmers and the efforts of the Ivorian government to support the industry. With continued investment, proactive measures to address child labour, and strategic marketing initiatives, Ivory Coast's cocoa sector has the potential to remain a significant player in global cocoa production for years to come.
