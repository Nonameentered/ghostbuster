Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, is set for an early and prolonged harvest of cocoa, traders and buyers estimate, thanks to good rains. Nestle SA and other chocolate makers are looking forward to the bumper crop.
The Ivory Coast, which accounts for about 40% of global cocoa production, is in the midst of its rainy season. Cocoa trees, which are sensitive to drought, require at least four months of rainy weather to grow. Farmers, who depend on cocoa for their livelihoods, say they have seen reliable rains, and they are optimistic about this year's crop.
Buyers and traders have noted that the good rains should ensure an early and prolonged harvest for cocoa, which will extend the supply of beans that will be available for export. This year, cocoa has been growing well in central regions of Ivory Coast such as Daloa, Bouafle, and Yamoussoukro, which are major producing areas.
"Rainfall has been great so far, and we see a good quality yield," said Philippe Cote, the head of Ivory Coast's Coffee and Cocoa Council. "If it continues like this, we will see an early and prolonged harvest."
Previous harvests have been disrupted by Brazil's drought and disease issues. This leads chocolate makers, such as Nestle SA, to increase prices. However, with an expected good harvest, chocolate makers could experience some relief.
The Ivory Coast government and industry groups are working to lift cocoa production even more. The country has plans to increase the number of trees by 20% by 2020, while at the same time promoting sustainable farming practices. This strategy is expected to provide a stable supply of high-quality cocoa for the 350,000 small farmers who rely on cocoa for their livelihoods.
"The good rains so far this year are a clear indication of the positive efforts to increase production and support farmers," said Cote. "We can see that the efforts are paying off, and we hope to continue seeing good yields."
The bumper crop could also mean an increase in the country's cocoa revenues, which were almost $3 billion last year. Ivory Coast officials say they're optimistic that the country can achieve it even as global cocoa prices fluctuate. The increased revenue means more investment in the country's infrastructure such as roads and hospitals.
In conclusion, the good rains in the central region of Ivory Coast are expected to ensure an early and prolonged harvest of cocoa. This will extend the supply of beans that will be available for export. Chocolate makers, such as Nestle SA, are excited about the bumper crop and relieved as it could mean some relief from price increases. Furthermore, the increase in cocoa production could lead to a decrease in the country's poverty level by improving the country's infrastructure. The Ivory Coast has plans to increase the number of trees by 20% by 2020, while promoting sustainable farming practices that will provide a stable supply of high-quality cocoa for the 350,000 small farmers who rely on cocoa for their livelihoods.
