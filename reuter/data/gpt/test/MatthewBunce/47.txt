West Africa's cocoa industry is under threat as the arrival of El Nino will likely cause a shortage of water for cocoa crops in the region. Ghana and Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producers, have already seen the effects of high temperatures and unpredictable rainfall in recent years, which has impacted their cocoa crops. The looming El Nino weather phenomenon, which is expected to last until 2020, could exacerbate the problem further. However, the effects of El Nino on cocoa production in West Africa remain uncertain.
El Nino is a weather phenomenon that occurs when the Pacific Ocean warms up, resulting in a shift in the atmospheric circulation. This often leads to extreme weather conditions across the world, including drought, floods, and hurricanes. In West Africa, El Nino is expected to bring about a dry, hot, and windy climate, which could hurt cocoa crops.
Cocoa is a vital cash crop for West African economies like Ivory Coast and Ghana. The two countries alone account for over 60% of the world's cocoa production. Approximately 5 million farmers rely on cocoa for their livelihoods in the region, and many have already been grappling with the effects of climate change in recent years.
The adverse effects of climate change in West Africa have been evident in the recent past. In 2015, a severe drought hit Ivory Coast, causing a 20% drop in cocoa production levels. A similar drought struck Ghana the following year, causing cocoa production to fall by about a third. These episodes have been attributed to the decrease in rainfall that has accompanied global warming. With El Nino, these rainfall deficits could worsen, and farmers could be dealing with immeasurable losses.
Despite the potential risk, there remains uncertainty about the likely effects of El Nino on cocoa crops in West Africa. One major factor that makes it difficult to predict the precise impacts of El Nino is the unique role that rainfall patterns play in each cocoa growing region in West Africa. In some regions, farmers may experience droughts, while in other areas, there could be excess rainfall leading to flooding.
Another factor that clouds the outlook is the improved resilience of cocoa farms in the region, and the preparedness of the West African governments in addressing climate change initiatives. Already, several initiatives have been put in place to support West African cocoa farmers in adapting to climate change. Recently, Ghana and Ivory Coast have raised their price of cocoa by more than 20%, promising to use the additional revenue to invest in improving farm productivity, promoting reforestation, and mitigating climate change, as well as provide farmers with a fair living wage.
Moreover, climate-smart agriculture practices are becoming more commonplace in the West African cocoa sector. These include intercropping, shade management, agroforestry, and the use of improved cocoa varieties. These practices have been proven to improve crop resilience, conserve soil moisture, and improve yields. In 2019, the Cocoa and Forest Initiative (CFI) was launched, bringing together government, private sector, and civil society stakeholders to end cocoa-driven deforestation and support the sustainable development of the cocoa sector.
In conclusion, El Nino poses a significant threat to cocoa production in West Africa, and its effects remain uncertain. West African governments and chocolate companies should work together to implement climate change adaptation and mitigation measures to support the sustainability of the cocoa industry in the region. Climate-smart agriculture practices should be promoted, and farmers should be provided with the resources needed to adapt to changing weather conditions. It is through such initiatives that the future of West African cocoa, and its millions of farmers, can be secured.
