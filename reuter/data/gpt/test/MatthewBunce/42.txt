Ivorian coffee exporters have refused to be drawn in by the multitude of world export plans aimed at boosting global coffee output. Rather, they remain focused on ensuring they produce quality coffee beans that will command a premium price in the international market.
According to industry watchers, the Ivorian coffee industry has often been accused of paying little attention to global trends, instead focusing on grading a large coffee crop. This is in sharp contrast to other major coffee exporting nations, which have embraced world export plans as a way of increasing their share of the global coffee market.
However, industry stakeholders in Ivory Coast have explained why this approach makes sense for them.
For starters, coffee farmers in Ivory Coast face unique challenges that are different from those experienced by farmers in other coffee-producing countries. These challenges include a lack of infrastructure, security issues, and a generally underdeveloped agricultural sector.
As a result, the country's exporters have identified quality grading as a key differentiator that can help them compete in the international market. They have invested heavily in ensuring that the coffee beans they export meet international standards of quality.
This strategy seems to be paying off. Despite grinding poverty and the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, coffee exports from Ivory Coast have continued to hold steady.
According to data from the International Coffee Organization (ICO), Ivory Coast exported 256,000 bags of coffee during the 2019/2020 coffee year, down slightly from the 264,000 bags it exported the previous year.
However, its share of the global coffee market remained largely unchanged, accounting for just over one percent of the world's coffee exports.
Industry experts attribute the country's ability to maintain its market share to its emphasis on quality grading. They argue that while other countries have chased quantity, Ivory Coast has focused on producing high-quality coffee beans that command a premium price in the international market.
In fact, the country's coffee exports have been consistently ranked among the best in the world, a testament to the hard work of the country's farmers and exporters.
What's more, Ivory Coast is now ripe for greater investment in its coffee sector, a move that could potentially boost production levels and increase the country's share of the global market.
But even as coffee production increases, exporters must remain focused on maintaining quality grading practices. The country's success in the coffee industry has been built on its ability to produce high-quality coffee beans that are highly sought after by international buyers.
Going forward, it will be important for the country to maintain this focus, even as it seeks to boost production levels and expand its share of the global coffee market.
Overall, the Ivorian coffee industry is a shining example of how quality-focused grading practices can pay off in the international market, even in the face of significant challenges. By putting quality first, exporters have been able to remain competitive and establish themselves as key players in the global coffee industry.
