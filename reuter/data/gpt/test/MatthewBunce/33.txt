ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast - Ivory Coast is destroying cocoa farms located within protected forests to combat illegality, a move that has been lauded by conservationists but denounced by cocoa farmers in the West African country.
According to officials of the country's regulatory body, Le Conseil du Café-Cacao, at least 18,000 hectares of cocoa farms cultivated within protected areas have been destroyed since the beginning of the year. The aim of this action is to eradicate the prevalence of cocoa being grown in areas that are ecologically-sensitive and have been demarcated for conservation purposes.
The spread of cocoa farming into protected forests is a long-standing issue in Ivory Coast, particularly in the western cocoa-growing regions of the country. Despite laws prohibiting farmers from farming on protected lands, many farmers have encroached into the forests, leading to environmental degradation, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflicts.
The destruction of cocoa farms is part of a new campaign launched by the government, backed by regulators, conservation groups, and chocolate companies, to combat the degradation of protected forests. The move comes after decades of ineffective enforcement, where many farmers have continued to cultivate cocoa farms in protected areas without facing the consequences.
Many environmental experts have lauded the new campaign, stating that it will help reduce the ecological impact of cocoa farming while encouraging conservation and sustainable cocoa production. However, the campaign has come under intense criticism from cocoa farmers, who claim that their livelihoods are being destroyed.
"It's unfair for the government to destroy our cocoa farms without providing us with any compensation," said Ahmed Bamba, a cocoa farmer based in the western region of Ivory Coast. "We understand the need to conserve forests, but our survival depends on cocoa farming. We need the government to provide us with alternative sources of income."
The impact of the campaign on cocoa output in Ivory Coast is expected to be minimal, according to officials of Le Conseil du Café-Cacao. The regulatory body estimates that less than 1% of the country's cocoa output comes from protected forests.
Despite the minimal impact anticipated, some analysts argue that the destruction of cocoa farms could, in fact, lead to a temporary rise in cocoa prices for two reasons.
Firstly, the destruction of cocoa farms that have previously avoided taxation or are operated illegally could lead to a reduction in the supply of cocoa in the illegal market, putting a strain on the existing market supply and thus driving up prices. Secondly, the move by Ivory Coast could spur other major cocoa-growing countries, particularly Ghana and Nigeria, to take similar conservation measures, leading to a reduction in global supplies and an increase in global cocoa prices.
The issue of cocoa farming in protected forests has also been a source of concern for some of the world's biggest chocolate manufacturers. In 2017, Nestle, Mondelez, and Barry Callebaut, the world's largest cocoa processors, pledged to end deforestation in the cocoa supply chain by 2020. The companies have been investing in new technologies such as satellite monitoring to trace cocoa farming encroachment within protected areas, with the aim of eliminating it entirely.
"It's great to see the government of Ivory Coast taking bold measures to protect its forests," said Luis Neves, an associate director at Mondelez International. "As chocolate manufacturers, we need to support such efforts by investing in sustainable production and environmentally-friendly technologies."
Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer, responsible for two-thirds of global cocoa output. Cocoa is also a critical component of the country's economy, accounting for more than 40% of its export earnings. The country is home to several protected forests, including the Taï National Park and the Mont Peko National Park, which are vital ecosystems for endangered species such as chimpanzees, leopards, and pygmy hippos.
With the new campaign, Ivory Coast aims to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring conservation of ecologically-sensitive areas while continuing to meet growing global demand for cocoa. The destruction of cocoa farms in the protected forests is expected to continue until all farms have been eradicated, with the government promising to provide compensation to affected farmers.
