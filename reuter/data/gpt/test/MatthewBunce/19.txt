Ivory Coast's mid-crop cocoa harvest is expected to exceed 100,000 tonnes, according to the country's National Coffee and Cocoa Council. This announcement comes as welcome news for the country, which has been grappling with a host of challenges over the past few years.
For many years, Ivory Coast has been the world's leading producer of cocoa, accounting for around 40% of global production. However, the industry has been plagued by low prices, falling yields, and the effects of climate change, including droughts, floods, and disease outbreaks.
The mid-crop harvest runs from April to September and typically accounts for around 30% of Ivory Coast's total cocoa production. This year's harvest is expected to be significantly larger than last year's, which saw a total production of 52,000 tonnes.
The increase is largely attributed to favorable weather conditions and government initiatives to support smallholders. The government has invested heavily in improving the country's cocoa sector, including building new processing factories, modernizing infrastructure, and providing training and support for farmers.
Christian Coffi, the general director of the National Coffee and Cocoa Council, said that the country's cocoa production is on track to meet its target of 2 million tonnes this year, up from last year's 1.7 million tonnes. He added that the government is committed to continuing its efforts to support the sector and increase production.
The news has been welcomed by cocoa traders and chocolate makers, who have been concerned about the impact of the pandemic on the industry. Demand for cocoa products has remained strong during the pandemic, but logistical challenges and supply chain disruptions have made it difficult for traders to get their products to market.
Ivory Coast's cocoa sector has also been hit hard by the pandemic, with many farmers struggling to access markets and supplies. However, Coffi said that the government has implemented strict health and safety measures to minimize the spread of the virus and ensure that the cocoa harvest can be carried out safely.
The news of the larger mid-crop harvest is also a boost for efforts to tackle deforestation and promote sustainability in the cocoa industry. Ivory Coast has been under pressure to address concerns about the environmental impact of cocoa production, including the destruction of forests and the use of child labor.
Several major chocolate companies, including Nestle, Mars, and Mondelez, have committed to sourcing only sustainable cocoa by 2025. Sustainable cocoa production involves protecting forests, improving the livelihoods of farmers, and ensuring that cocoa is produced without the use of child labor.
The larger mid-crop harvest is a sign that Ivory Coast is making progress towards these goals, but much more work needs to be done to ensure that the sector is sustainable in the long term. Governments and chocolate companies must work together to provide farmers with the resources and support they need to improve yields, reduce their environmental impact, and build resilient communities.
In conclusion, Ivory Coast's mid-crop cocoa harvest exceeding 100,000 tonnes is welcome news for the country's cocoa sector, which has been facing numerous challenges in recent years. The increase is attributed to favorable weather conditions and government initiatives to support smallholders. This news is a boost for efforts to tackle deforestation and promote sustainability in the cocoa industry. Governments and chocolate companies must work together to ensure that the sector is sustainable in the long term.
