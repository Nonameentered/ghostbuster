Washington D.C. - The Clinton administration has announced its plans to reform outdated U.S. banking laws. This announcement is aimed at ensuring that financial regulations in the United States match the pace and evolution of global financial markets.
The move comes from concerns of many experts that the U.S. regulatory framework has not kept up with needed changes in recent years in the banking industry. This, some experts suggest, may have ultimately contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.
According to reports, the administration intends to close regulatory loopholes and enact new legislation aimed at disentangling the overly complex and convoluted banking industry.
The administration has outlined several key changes that are likely to go into effect in the near future. One of the most significant changes is to bring new transparency to financial transactions, thus preventing obscure deals from coming to fruition, which was a factor contributing to the 2008 financial crisis.
The other notable change centers around the creation of new regulatory bodies, which will be tasked with monitoring financial activity. The government plans to implement strong, proactive oversight and create robust mechanisms to protect the financial system and taxpayers. Such a move will ensure that any future financial blow-up will not have a cascading effect down the financial system.
Regulatory measures being considered include the limitations on the risk-taking capabilities of banks and other financial institutions. This is to prevent larger banks from taking on excessive risk, and subsequently creating financial instability.
"We have a responsibility to ensure that the U.S. banking industry remains fair and safe for all Americans. In the past couple of decades, the world has seen the financial markets evolve, yet banking laws in the U.S. remain woefully outdated. It's about time for the industry to catch up," said Jacob Lew, President Obama's Treasury Secretary.
The proposed changes have been met with mixed reception. Some economists and financial experts suggested that any reforms could be stifling to the banking industry, traditionally one of the driving forces of America's economy.
However, the administration has been quick to point out that any such regulatory measures would be put into place only after much deliberation.
"These measures will ensure that the banking industry remains a cornerstone of our economy in the future. We will carefully balance the interests of the American people with that of the industry's need to thrive," added Lew.
The banking reform proposal is still being debated in Congress. The process is expected to take several months before it is finalized into law. Nonetheless, some politicians have already applauded the move, highlighting the need for modern and updated regulations.
"Investors, shareholders, and customers all deserve strong actions to ensure a safe and sound banking system," commented Christopher Dodd, a former Senator and the co-author of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010 to curb some of the banking excesses. "I'm hopeful that the proposed reforms will pass and provide adequate safeguards to protect our financial system," he added.
