A recent survey conducted by Bankrate has found that the number of banks charging non-customers for ATM use has doubled in the United States. The survey collected responses from 36 banks in the country and found that 11% of them now charge a fee to non-customers for using their ATMs.
The survey shows a considerable increase from 2020 when only 5% of banks charged customers for ATM use. While the reasons behind the increase in fees remain unclear, some banks claimed that the decision was driven by the need to cover their operational costs.
Dave Rathgeber, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate, commented on the findings, saying, "Banks are always looking for ways to generate income. For some banks, ATM fees have become an attractive revenue stream."
The findings of the survey come at a time when ATM usage is declining in the country. According to the Federal Reserve, the number of ATM transactions fell by 11.5% in 2020. This decline can be attributed to the rise of digital banking and the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw an increase in online transactions.
Despite the decline in ATM usage, the fees charged to non-customers have raised concerns among consumer advocates. They argue that ATM fees are one of the many hidden fees charged by banks, which disproportionately impact low-income individuals and families.
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, stated that "ATM fees take a significant amount of money out of the pockets of consumers who can least afford it." She added, "For people with low incomes, these fees can add up quickly, making it harder to access their money."
To avoid ATM fees, consumers are advised to use ATMs that are affiliated with their bank or credit union. Most banks offer a list of affiliated ATMs on their website or mobile app. Alternatively, consumers may consider using digital banking services, such as online banking or mobile banking, which often offer fee-free transactions.
In conclusion, the survey conducted by Bankrate serves as a reminder for consumers to stay vigilant when it comes to financial fees and charges. As the number of banks charging non-customers for ATM use continues to grow, consumers must stay informed about their banking options to avoid unnecessary fees.
