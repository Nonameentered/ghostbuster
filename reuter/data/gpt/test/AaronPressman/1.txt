Washington D.C. - Several members of Congress are criticizing the Federal Reserve for its "woefully inadequate" record of hiring minorities and women. In a heated hearing on Capitol Hill, members of the House Financial Services Committee voiced their concerns and criticized the lack of diversity in the Federal Reserve's workforce.
The criticism comes after a report was released by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that found the Federal Reserve's hiring practices have led to disproportionately low numbers of minorities and women making it into management positions. The report found that while the Federal Reserve made strides in hiring minorities, they were still underrepresented in leadership positions, and women and minorities were less likely to be promoted.
"Despite years of reporting and promises to diversify the Federal Reserve's workforce, little has changed. This is unacceptable," said Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee. "It is clear the Federal Reserve has not done enough to address this issue and it is time for them to take meaningful action."
Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut, the Subcommittee Chair of the National Security, International Development, and Monetary Policy, echoed Waters' concerns. "The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to ensure that its workforce reflects the diversity of our country. The current state of affairs is not acceptable," Himes said.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the need for change and said the central bank would take steps to address the issue. Powell promised to establish more training programs for minorities and women and to review the promotion policies to ensure they are fair and equitable.
"We take this issue very seriously, and we recognize that we have more work to do," Powell said. "We have made some progress, but we need to do more to create a workplace that is truly inclusive."
The Federal Reserve has come under fire in the past for its lack of diversity. In 2020, a group of Democrats wrote a letter to Powell expressing concerns about the lack of diversity within the Federal Reserve's leadership. The letter called for increased efforts to increase diversity and inclusion throughout the organization.
Congresswoman Waters and Congressman Himes have requested a follow-up report from the GAO in a year to review the Federal Reserve's progress on diversity and inclusion. They believe it is essential for the Federal Reserve to take immediate action to address the issue and create a diverse and inclusive workplace.
