The U.S. Commerce Department has created a committee to advise the government on its controversial encryption export policy. The move comes after years of debate over the issue, which has divided government agencies and technology companies.
The committee will be comprised of industry experts, academics, and government officials, and will be tasked with providing recommendations on how to balance the need for strong encryption with national security concerns.
The issue of encryption has been contentious for years, with law enforcement officials arguing that strong encryption hinders their ability to investigate and prevent crimes. They have pushed for encryption to be weakened or backdoored so that law enforcement agencies could gain access to encrypted communications.
Technology companies have largely opposed such measures, arguing that they would undermine the security and privacy of their products and ultimately harm their businesses.
The export of encryption technology has been similarly controversial, with the government imposing various restrictions and regulations on the export of strong encryption products.
The current policy, which was put in place in the 1990s, places strict limits on the export of encryption products with key lengths above 56 bits. It requires companies to obtain export licenses for such products and to provide the government with access to their encryption keys.
Some experts have argued that the policy is outdated and overly restrictive, noting that many countries have adopted more liberal encryption policies. They argue that lifting the restrictions could help U.S. companies compete more effectively in the global technology market.
Others, however, fear that lifting the restrictions could undermine national security by allowing terrorists and other criminals to communicate more freely and securely.
The government has been reviewing its encryption export policy for years, with various agencies and departments offering conflicting opinions on the matter. The new committee is expected to provide an independent perspective and help guide the government in making a final decision on the issue.
The creation of the committee has been welcomed by both industry and civil liberties groups, who see it as a step towards a more balanced and informed policy.
"The committee's formation is a positive and important development that shows a renewed commitment to finding a workable and secure encryption policy that can support both national security and privacy interests," said Kevin Bankston, director of the Open Technology Institute.
However, some experts remain skeptical of the government's intentions, arguing that the committee may be little more than a delaying tactic designed to avoid making a difficult decision.
"Given the long history of government agencies stalling and obstructing attempts to reform encryption policy, it's entirely possible that this committee will simply serve as another way for the government to avoid taking meaningful action," said Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.
The committee is set to begin its work this fall, with a final report expected to be delivered to the Commerce Department within 18 months. It remains to be seen whether the government will follow the committee's recommendations or continue to maintain its current encryption export policy.
