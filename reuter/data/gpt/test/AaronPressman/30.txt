The House Judiciary Committee has approved a bill to ease restrictions on the export of U.S. encryption technology, which would remove barriers for American businesses that use encryption technologies in their products.
The bill, called the "Secure And Fair Export Control Reform Act," or SAFER Act, was approved last Friday by a vote of 45 to 17. The legislation is aimed at updating export controls on encryption technology by placing it in a new category that would be easier to export.
The current regulations on encryption technology were established in 1996, and are aimed at preventing the spread of encryption technology to countries that could use it for military or terrorist purposes. However, many experts argue that these regulations are outdated and harmful to American businesses.
Under the current regulations, exporting encryption technology requires a license from the U.S. government. This requirement has impeded the growth of American businesses that use encryption technologies in their products, as they have to navigate a cumbersome and time-consuming licensing process.
The SAFER Act would ease these restrictions by creating a new category of encryption technology that would be less restricted and easier to export. The bill also includes provisions to ensure that advanced encryption technologies are not exported to countries that pose a national security threat to the United States.
Supporters of the bill argue that the proposed changes are long overdue, and are necessary to help American businesses compete in the global market. "The reforms in our bill will unleash innovation and help American businesses thrive in the global marketplace," said Representative Zoe Lofgren, one of the bill's sponsors.
Opponents of the bill, however, are concerned that easing restrictions on encryption technology could make it easier for terrorists and criminals to communicate without being detected by law enforcement agencies. "We need to be careful not to give terrorists and bad actors the tools they need to harm us," said Representative Jerrold Nadler, who voted against the bill.
The legislation now heads to the House of Representatives for a full vote, and if approved, will then move on to the Senate. If the bill becomes law, it would mark an important step forward for American businesses that rely on encryption technology, and could help spur innovation in the tech industry.
