Washington, D.C. – On Tuesday, Congress reopened the long-standing encryption export debate as companies and privacy advocates called for change. The debate centers around whether the U.S. government should allow tech companies to export strong encryption technology abroad. Tech companies and privacy advocates argue that strong encryption is necessary to protect consumers’ privacy and security, while the government argues that it hinders law enforcement’s ability to investigate and prevent crimes.
The current law, known as the Wassenaar Arrangement, was established in 1995 and regulates the export of dual-use goods and technologies, including encryption. The agreement was updated in 2013 to include stronger restrictions on the export of certain encryption technologies. However, tech companies argue that these restrictions are outdated and limit their ability to compete on a global scale.
This week, companies and privacy advocates testified before the House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation about the need for Congress to update the Wassenaar Arrangement and modernize the U.S. encryption export policy. The subcommittee heard from representatives from companies including Google, Microsoft, and Apple, who argued that the current policy is hindering their ability to innovate and develop new technologies.
“The United States has fallen behind our global competitors in building strong encryption technologies,” said Kent Walker, SVP of Global Affairs at Google. “We need to update our approach to export controls to ensure our companies can compete and innovate on a global scale.”
Privacy advocates also testified about the importance of strong encryption for protecting consumers’ privacy and ensuring the security of sensitive communications. “Encryption is a critical tool for journalists, human rights activists, and whistleblowers,” said Jameel Jaffer, Executive Director of the Knight First Amendment Institute. “We need strong encryption technologies to ensure individuals can communicate securely without fear of surveillance or retaliation.”
Law enforcement agencies, however, argue that strong encryption technology hinders their ability to investigate crimes and protect national security. “Strong encryption technology has become a tool for terrorists, drug traffickers, and cybercriminals,” said John Demers, Assistant Attorney General of the National Security Division. “We need to strike a balance between protecting individual privacy and enabling law enforcement to investigate and prevent crimes.”
The debate over encryption export policy is not a new one. Advocates and opponents of strong encryption have been at odds for decades, with no resolution in sight. However, as technology and communication methods continue to evolve, the need for strong encryption technology becomes increasingly important.
“As technology continues to change, we need to have an open and honest conversation about how we balance the need for strong encryption with the need for law enforcement to investigate and prevent crime,” said Rep. Jim Langevin, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation. “We need to update our encryption export policy to ensure that U.S. companies can compete and innovate on a global scale, while also protecting the privacy and security of individuals.”
The subcommittee plans to continue its hearings on encryption export policy in the coming weeks, with the goal of eventually updating the current law. While there is no clear resolution in sight, the debate over encryption is one that will likely continue for years to come.
