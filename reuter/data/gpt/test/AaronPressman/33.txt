Sun Microsystems, a California-based technology company, has been found to be using encryption software from Russia in some of its products. This revelation has put pressure on the Clinton Administration to relax the export controls that currently prohibit the sale of such software to foreign countries.
The Russian encryption software, known as "Crypto-C", is used to secure information by making it unreadable without a secret code or key. The software has been widely used in Russia for years and is considered to be among the best in the world. However, it is subject to strict U.S. export restrictions due to concerns that it could fall into the hands of terrorists or other enemies of the United States.
Sun Microsystems has been using the Crypto-C software in its products since the mid-1990s, according to industry sources. The company reportedly obtained a license from the U.S. government to use the software, but the license did not allow it to export products containing the software to certain countries, such as China and Syria.
The use of the Russian encryption software by Sun Microsystems has raised questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls. Critics argue that the controls are too strict and hinder American companies from competing in the global marketplace. They also argue that the controls do little to prevent other countries from obtaining sensitive technology.
Proponents of export controls, however, argue that they are necessary to protect national security. They point out that encryption software can be used by terrorists and foreign intelligence agencies to conceal their communications and activities.
The Clinton Administration has not yet responded to the pressure to relax U.S. export controls on encryption software. However, it is facing increasing pressure from the technology industry and other groups to reexamine its export control policies. The debate over export controls is likely to continue as technology companies seek to compete globally while the government seeks to protect national security.
