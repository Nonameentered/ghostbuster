Washington D.C. - The House of Representatives has passed a bill that would protect homeowners from unnecessary mortgage insurance. The bill, known as the Homeowners Protection Act, was introduced by Rep. Jack Wilson (R-TX) earlier this year.
Under current law, homeowners who take out mortgages are required to purchase mortgage insurance if they put down less than 20% of the purchase price. Mortgage insurance is meant to protect lenders if borrowers default on their loans. However, many homeowners end up paying for mortgage insurance for years, even after their home's value has increased and their equity has grown to more than 20%.
The Homeowners Protection Act would require lenders to automatically cancel the mortgage insurance once a homeowner's equity reaches 20%. The bill would also require lenders to give borrowers annual notices letting them know when they are eligible to cancel their mortgage insurance.
“Homeownership is a vital part of the American dream,” said Rep. Wilson. “But too often, homeowners are being required to pay for mortgage insurance even after they’ve built up substantial equity in their homes. This bill will protect homeowners from this unnecessary expense and help them build equity in their homes faster.”
The bill has been widely supported by consumer advocacy groups, who see it as a common-sense way to protect homeowners. "Mortgage insurance can be a major burden on homeowners, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet," said John Roberts of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. "The Homeowners Protection Act will give them the relief they need to stay in their homes and continue building wealth."
The bill now heads to the Senate, where it is expected to face stiff opposition from big banks and other financial institutions that make money from selling mortgage insurance. However, supporters are optimistic that the bill will pass and help millions of homeowners across the country.
