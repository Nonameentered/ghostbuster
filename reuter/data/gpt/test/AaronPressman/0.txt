U.S. Senators Criticize SEC Rule on Derivatives Disclosure
A new rule introduced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ignited criticism among several U.S. senators. The rule in question relates to derivatives disclosure, and its new amendments have taken several senators aback. Previously described as a "closing gap," the new rule will now make it obligatory for parties that use derivatives to disclose securities positions. The rule, which was put forward earlier this year, has been tagged as imposing onerous costs on financial firms, but the SEC had explained that it is a necessary step to increase transparency in the market.
The new derivatives disclosure rule with its amendments was precisely written for reforms back in 2010 after the financial crisis, including areas with opaque derivatives markets that caused the 2008 financial crisis. The SEC's rule expands the number of people required to disclose and reinforces the transparency of risks inherent in the use of these securities, including those involved in swap transactions and security-based swaps. This disclosure primarily targets counterparties mostly kept secret in the past, which experts have lauded as the continued progression away from the shadow banking market.
The SEC's rule was seen as a necessary move for the SEC's investor protection goal and in line with the Dodd-Frank Act. The SEC chairman, Gary Gensler, while introducing the new rule in March, had said that it was aimed at closing regulatory gaps and increasing transparency in the derivatives markets. The SEC intended to improve investor protection approaches without impeding competition or innovation in a more robust market ecosystem.
"The rule builds upon the agency's efforts over the last two years to improve transparency and reduce risk in the security-based swaps market. The amendments being adopted today, together with recent rulemakings, move the security-based swap market closer to the swap market envisioned by Dodd-Frank," Gensler stated.
However, three influential senators, citing concerns about their impact on competitiveness, have risen to criticize the SEC's rule amendments' timing and implementation. Senators Patrick Toomey (Republican from Pennsylvania), Dan Sullivan (Republican from Alaska), and Cynthia Lummis (Republican from Wyoming) jointly wrote a letter to the SEC's chairman, Gensler, on September 1, expressing their criticism.
"The SEC's proposal to expand the definition of 'security-based swap dealers,' 'major security-based swap participants,' and 'active security-based swap' could impact end-users with significant economic implications. The proposal could also impose an unnecessary compliance burden on smaller end-users and may limit the growth of the security-based swap market, undermining the goal of regulatory improvement and competition," the senators wrote.
The senators also claim that many market participants had already expressed concerns to them about the SEC's proposal, highlighting a possible negative impact on small businesses.
"For these reasons, we strongly urge the SEC to revise its proposal accordingly to avoid unintended consequences that could negatively impact end-users and harm the competitiveness of the security-based swap market," they concluded.
Many are, however, of the opinion that the SEC's rule's timing and implementation are accurately targeted, given the post-COVID-19 pandemic uncertainty reflected globally in the financial markets. Experts say the overhaul of regulation through derivatives disclosure provides information essential for assessing and managing risk, managing cross-border regulatory frameworks, and improving overall payment systems' stability.
In conclusion, the SEC's disclosure rules regarding derivatives disclosure are seen as a step in the right direction towards keeping the financial market transparent. However, with criticisms from major senators, it remains to be seen if the new rules will undergo review and bear fruit. The SEC board will likely give feedback on the senators' letter or take it under advisement as it prepares to implement the new rules.
