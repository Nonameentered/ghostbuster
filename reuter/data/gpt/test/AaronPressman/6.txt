The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is urging banks to tighten credit card standards following a record increase in late payments by consumers.
According to the CFPB, credit card delinquencies reached a seven-year high in the third quarter of 2019, with 4.47% of credit card accounts becoming delinquent within the last two quarters. This is the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2012, when delinquencies were at 4.73%.
To address this issue, the CFPB is encouraging banks to tighten their credit standards by taking steps such as increasing credit score requirements and reducing the number of credit card loans they approve.
“This is not a sustainable trend, and we need to act to prevent further harm to consumers,” said CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger in a statement. “We are urging banks to take a closer look at their credit card underwriting practices and make necessary changes to avoid future delinquencies.”
Experts suggest that the rise in delinquencies is due to a combination of higher credit card balances, rising interest rates, and a lack of financial literacy among consumers.
“Many consumers are carrying more credit card debt than they can afford to repay, and they are struggling to stay on top of their payments,” said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst with Bankrate. “As interest rates continue to rise, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for consumers to keep up with their credit card bills, which is leading to higher delinquency rates.”
In addition, some experts believe that a lack of financial literacy among consumers is contributing to the rise in delinquencies.
“Many consumers are simply not well-informed about how credit cards work, and they are not taking the necessary steps to manage their finances effectively,” said Minda Le, a financial advisor with SmartAsset. “This lack of financial literacy can lead to missed payments and delinquencies, which can cause significant damage to a person’s credit score.”
To address these issues, the CFPB is also calling for increased financial education and counseling for consumers.
“Financial literacy is key to helping consumers understand how credit cards work and how to manage their finances responsibly,” said Kraninger. “We need to ensure that consumers have access to the information and resources they need to make wise financial decisions.”
Some banks have already taken steps to tighten their credit standards in response to the rise in delinquencies. For example, Capital One has tightened its underwriting standards over the past year, which has led to a decline in account growth but has also resulted in a lower delinquency rate.
Other banks, however, may be hesitant to tighten their credit standards due to concerns about losing market share to competitors.
“Banks are in a difficult position because they don’t want to lose customers to competitors who are willing to approve credit card loans more easily,” said Hamrick. “However, if delinquencies continue to rise, we may see more banks taking steps to tighten their underwriting standards.”
The CFPB’s call for tighter credit standards is likely to be welcomed by consumer advocates, who have long been concerned about rising credit card debt and delinquency rates.
“We applaud the CFPB for taking action to address this important issue,” said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center. “We hope that banks will work with the CFPB to implement stronger underwriting standards and provide better financial education and counseling for their customers.”
Overall, it remains to be seen how banks will respond to the CFPB’s call for tighter credit standards. While some banks may be willing to make changes to avoid future delinquencies, others may be hesitant to lose market share. In the end, it will be up to banks to strike a balance between risk and reward, while also providing their customers with the tools and resources they need to manage their finances effectively.
