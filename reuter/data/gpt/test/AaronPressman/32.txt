The House Judiciary Committee has approved a bill that would ease export restrictions on computer encoding technology, a move seen as a victory by technology firms who have long called for such a change.
The bill, called the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act, was passed by a vote of 24 to 10. It would allow companies to export encryption products to foreign countries where they previously could not, as long as the products were deemed not to pose a threat to national security.
Encryption is the process of converting data into a code that can be read only by those with the knowledge to decipher the code, making it difficult for hackers or government agencies to access sensitive information. While many tech companies have long sought to promote the development and sale of encryption technology, they have faced resistance from the government, which has argued that such technologies could be used by terrorists or other bad actors.
The legislation is seen as a key victory for tech firms, who have long complained about the restrictions, arguing that they are stifling innovation and preventing American companies from competing effectively with foreign rivals. Some industry experts have argued that the restrictions are also hindering efforts to combat cybercrime, as law enforcement agencies struggle to access encrypted information.
The bill would also provide protections for banks that provide services to cannabis-related businesses, which are currently operating in a legal gray area due to conflicting state and federal laws. The protections would allow banks to provide basic banking services to these businesses without fear of prosecution.
The legislation has received broad support from industry groups, including the Computer and Communications Industry Association, the Information Technology Industry Council, and the Internet Association.
"Passing the SAFE Banking Act is an important step forward for the technology industry, as it will help to promote innovation and ensure that American companies can compete on a level playing field with their foreign rivals," said Ed Black, President and CEO of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.
The bill now moves to the full House of Representatives for consideration, where it is expected to face stiff opposition from some lawmakers who are concerned about the potential risks associated with easing encryption export controls.
Despite these concerns, tech companies remain optimistic about the bill's chances of passage, with many arguing that the benefits of increased access to encryption technology outweigh the potential risks.
