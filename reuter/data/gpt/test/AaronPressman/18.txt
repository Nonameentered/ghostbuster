The Internet Society (ISOC) has announced its plan to add seven new top-level domains (TLDs) to the Domain Name System (DNS). The organization has also received endorsement from major companies and organizations around the world.
The seven new TLDs will be .gay, .eco, .music, .film, .game, .sport, and .bank. These TLDs will be added to the existing TLDs such as .com, .org, .net, and so on.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the organization responsible for managing the DNS, has approved the plan after a thorough review process. The new TLDs will bring a fresh wave of innovation and diversity to the DNS, offering new branding opportunities for businesses and organizations.
According to ISOC President Andrew Sullivan, the new TLDs will help build a more diverse and inclusive internet. "ISOC believes that a more diverse and inclusive internet is critical for the future of the internet," Sullivan said. "By adding these TLDs, we hope to encourage greater online engagement among users and businesses across the globe."
The new TLDs have also received endorsement from major companies and organizations in various industries. Tech giant Apple, social media platform Twitter, and environmental organization Greenpeace have expressed their support for the new TLDs.
Katherine Adams, Apple's General Counsel and Senior Vice President of Legal and Global Security, said in a statement, "We are thrilled to support ISOC's initiative to add these new TLDs. They will offer new branding opportunities for businesses and organizations and help promote a more inclusive and innovative internet."
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey also tweeted his support for the new TLDs, saying, "We're excited about the possibilities that these new TLDs will bring to the internet. They will create new opportunities for businesses and organizations to better connect with their audiences."
Greenpeace Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said in a statement, "The new TLDs will help promote sustainability and environmental awareness. We believe they will encourage greater engagement around climate change and other urgent environmental issues."
The new TLDs are expected to go live in the next few months, with some of them already available for pre-registration. However, businesses and organizations should be cautious when deciding to register for the new TLDs.
While the new TLDs offer new branding opportunities, they also come with some risks. For instance, businesses should ensure that their chosen TLDs are not too general or too similar to existing TLDs. They should also conduct proper research to determine the potential impact of a new TLD on their brand and online presence.
However, despite the potential risks, ISOC believes that the new TLDs will bring significant benefits to the internet ecosystem. "We are excited to see the positive impact that these new TLDs will have on the internet," said Sullivan. "We believe that they will promote greater innovation, diversity, and inclusivity, and help build a better and more vibrant online community."
In conclusion, the addition of the seven new TLDs is a significant development in the DNS and the internet ecosystem. The new TLDs will offer new branding opportunities for businesses and organizations, promote sustainability and environmental awareness, and foster greater diversity and inclusivity online. With the support of major companies and organizations, it will be exciting to see how these new TLDs will shape the internet of the future.
