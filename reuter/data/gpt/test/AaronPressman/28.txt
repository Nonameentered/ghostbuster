Senator Bob Kerrey has unveiled new legislation aimed at resolving the ongoing encryption debate. The proposed law would mandate that tech companies award government officials access to encrypted communications if requested with a warrant. Additionally, the bill seeks to establish a commission tasked with addressing the broader issue of balancing privacy and national security. Kerrey, who previously served on the 9/11 Commission, believes the legislation will help break the deadlock over encryption and provide a framework for finding middle ground. The bill already faces opposition from privacy advocates, who argue it effectively undermines encryption altogether.
