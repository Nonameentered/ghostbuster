Premature government regulation could be detrimental to the rapidly evolving market for stored-value cards, warns a leading US bank regulator.
The popularity of stored-value cards, also known as prepaid cards, has grown significantly in recent years. They are used for a variety of purposes, including payroll and government benefits, as well as for gift cards and online transactions.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which supervises and regulates national banks and thrift institutions, is concerned that hasty government regulation could hurt the market for these cards.
“Stored-value cards are a rapidly evolving market that is providing important financial services to consumers across the country,” said OCC Acting Comptroller Michael J. Hsu. “While we recognize the need for appropriate regulatory oversight, we caution that premature regulation could stifle innovation and limit the availability of important financial services.”
Hsu’s comments come as the US Treasury Department is considering proposed changes to regulations on prepaid accounts, including stored-value cards. Among the proposed changes are requirements for stronger consumer protections, enhanced disclosures, and increased transparency.
While these changes are aimed at protecting consumers, the OCC warns that they could harm the market for stored-value cards by imposing unnecessary costs on issuers and limiting their ability to innovate.
“Imposing new costs and requirements on issuers could reduce access to these important financial services, particularly for lower-income consumers,” said Hsu. “We urge regulators to proceed with caution to ensure that any new rules strike the right balance between consumer protection and access to financial services.”
The OCC is not alone in its concerns. Some industry experts also worry that premature regulation could dampen innovation in the market for stored-value cards.
“Stored-value cards are a relatively new and dynamic market that is still evolving,” said Jennifer Tescher, President and CEO of the Financial Health Network, a non-profit organization that promotes financial health for all Americans. “We need to be very careful about imposing regulations that could have unintended consequences and stifle innovation.”
Despite these concerns, regulators are likely to move forward with changes to rules governing stored-value cards. The Treasury Department has indicated that it plans to issue a final rule on prepaid accounts later this year.
“Innovation is critical to the evolution of financial services, and we want to ensure that new regulations do not unintentionally hamper the development of new products and services in this space,” said Hsu. “We will continue to monitor the market for stored-value cards closely and work to strike the right balance between consumer protection and innovation.”
