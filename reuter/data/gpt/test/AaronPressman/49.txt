Washington, D.C. â€“ Senator Max Basser, Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, introduced legislation today to ban ATM surcharges on non-customers. The bill would prohibit banks and other financial institutions from imposing fees on customers who use their ATMs to withdraw cash.
In recent years, ATM surcharges have become increasingly common, with some banks charging fees as high as $3 or more for non-customer ATM transactions. These fees can add up quickly, particularly for people who do not have a bank account and must rely on cash for everyday expenses.
"ATM surcharges are a simple and straightforward way for banks to make money, but they are also unfair to consumers," said Senator Basser. "People should be able to access their money without being hit with excessive fees, particularly if they are already struggling financially."
Under the proposed legislation, financial institutions would also be required to provide customers with clear and concise information about any fees associated with ATM transactions. This would enable customers to make informed decisions about where to withdraw cash and avoid being surprised by hidden fees.
The bill has received widespread support from consumer advocates and public interest groups, who argue that ATM surcharges disproportionately affect low-income and marginalized communities.
"ATM fees are an especially pernicious form of predatory lending because they target people who can least afford to pay them," said Rachel Bloom, Senior Policy Analyst at the Center for Responsible Lending. "Banning surcharges on non-customers is a common-sense step that will help level the playing field for consumers and make banking more accessible and affordable for everyone."
Some financial industry representatives have criticized the proposed legislation, arguing that it will harm smaller banks and credit unions that rely on ATM surcharges to cover the cost of maintaining their networks.
"Without ATM surcharges, smaller banks and credit unions may be forced to reduce services or raise fees on their own customers," said John Smith, President of the National Association of Community Banks. "It's important to remember that ATM networks are expensive to operate, and someone has to pay for them."
Senator Basser said he is open to working with industry stakeholders to address their concerns, but maintains that ATM surcharges are ultimately a burden on consumers.
"Ultimately, the question is who should bear the cost of maintaining ATM networks: the customer or the financial institution?" said Senator Basser. "I believe that it is the responsibility of banks and other financial institutions to provide these services to their customers without imposing excessive fees on non-customers."
