Seven Network Ltd (ASX: SEV) is expected to report a higher annual net profit in its full-year 2021 financial results, despite experiencing a slowdown in the second half of the year.
The Australian television network, which is owned by Seven West Media, is set to announce its full-year results on August 12. According to analyst consensus estimates, Seven Network is forecast to report a net profit of AUD 120 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, up from AUD 116 million in the previous year.
The expected increase in annual net profit comes despite a slowdown in the second half of the financial year, which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the extended lockdowns in several Australian states.
Seven Network's first-half performance was robust, with net profit rising to AUD 85 million, up from AUD 11 million in the same period last year. The strong result was driven by a surge in revenue from the broadcasting of major events, including the Australian Open tennis tournament and the AFL Grand Final.
However, the second half of the year was adversely affected by the pandemic and associated lockdowns, which disrupted the production and broadcasting of some of Seven Network's flagship programs. The cancellation of the Tokyo Olympics, which were due to take place in July and August, also had a significant impact on the network's revenue stream.
Despite the challenges, Seven Network is expected to deliver a solid result for the full year, driven by its successful cost-cutting initiatives and improved advertising revenue in the first half. The network has been implementing a range of efficiency measures, including reducing staff numbers, to reduce costs and improve profitability.
Furthermore, Seven Network has been investing in digital platforms and streaming services to diversify its revenue streams and tap into different audience segments. The network's digital channels, including 7plus and 7news.com.au, have experienced strong growth in the past year, as more Australians turned to online platforms for their news and entertainment needs.
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards digital platforms, and Seven Network has been quick to capitalize on this trend. The network's digital channels have become an increasingly important part of its business model, and are expected to play a significant role in its future growth.
Looking ahead, Seven Network is well-positioned to capitalize on the recovering advertising market and the gradual easing of COVID-19 restrictions in Australia. The network recently secured broadcasting rights for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, which will provide a significant boost to its revenue stream.
In addition, the network is set to benefit from the return of popular reality TV shows, such as Big Brother and Farmer Wants a Wife, which were disrupted by the pandemic in the past year. The network's programming lineup for the remainder of the year is expected to be strong, with several exciting new shows set to premiere.
Overall, Seven Network's financial results for the full year are expected to be positive, despite the second half slowdown. The network's successful cost-cutting initiatives, strong first-half performance, and growing digital channels provide a solid foundation for future growth, as the media landscape continues to evolve in the digital age.
