Westfield, the Australian-based shopping centre developer, has revealed plans to list its U.S. arm with an initial public offering (IPO) worth over $400 million. The move will allow the company to raise funds to expand its presence in the U.S. shopping mall market by acquiring more properties.
The IPO, which is set to take place later this year, will give investors the opportunity to buy shares in Westfield's U.S. arm, which owns and operates 33 shopping centres across the country. The 400 million raised from the IPO will be used to finance further acquisitions and modernisation of the company's existing assets.
"We are excited to take this step in the evolution of our business," said Westfield co-CEO Steven Lowy. "The capital we raise will allow us to aggressively pursue acquisition opportunities in the highly competitive U.S. market and invest in the modernisation of our portfolio to ensure our shopping centres remain the destination of choice for consumers."
The announcement comes as Westfield faces increasing competition from online retailers, with many consumers choosing to shop online rather than visit physical stores. However, Westfield believes that shopping centres will continue to be popular destinations for shoppers, as they offer a wider range of stores, entertainment and dining options.
"We remain confident in the long-term future of shopping centres, and we see real value in our U.S. portfolio," said Lowy. "Our strategy is to create places where people want to spend time, not just shop, and we believe that by continually investing in our properties, we can continue to attract customers and stay ahead of the competition."
Westfield's move to go public with its U.S. arm is part of a wider trend among shopping centre operators, many of whom are looking to raise funds to invest in their properties in order to stay relevant in a rapidly changing retail landscape. Other major players in the industry, including Simon Property Group and GGP, have already gone public with their own subsidiaries in recent years.
The announcement has been welcomed by investors, who are keen to back a company with a strong track record of success in the shopping centre market. Westfield has a long history of developing large, high-end shopping centres, with notable properties including the Westfield London and Westfield World Trade Center in Manhattan.
"Our international portfolio of shopping centres is among the most valuable in the world, and we believe that the IPO of our U.S. arm will provide investors with a unique opportunity to gain exposure to this valuable asset class," said Lowy.
The IPO is expected to take place in the coming months, subject to regulatory approval. If successful, it will mark a major milestone for Westfield, which has been operating in the U.S. market for over 60 years.
Despite the challenges facing the retail sector, Westfield remains confident in its ability to continue providing customers with unique and engaging shopping experiences. With the funds raised from the IPO, the company will be in a strong position to capitalise on future opportunities and maintain its position as a leading player in the U.S. shopping centre market.
