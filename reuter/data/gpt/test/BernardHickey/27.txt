The long-awaited Wallis Inquiry Report on Australia's financial system is set to be released by the Federal Government, with expectations for recommendations for reforms.
This report, conducted by the Financial System Inquiry chaired by Stan Wallis, was released in 1997. It addressed the structure and competitiveness of Australia's financial sector, its regulation, and the development of financial products and services.
The review was undertaken to assess the level of competition in the market, ensure the stability of the financial system, and make recommendations for reforms that would support economic growth.
In the 23 years since the report's release, much has changed about the economy and how we interact with the financial system. As such, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has championed the current review as a necessary update.
In November 2019, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg commissioned a review of the financial system to ensure it is "fit for purpose," with a focus on competition and efficiency.
The review was conducted by Graeme Samuel, former chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and is expected to take into account technological advancements and changes in the regulatory environment.
The release of the Wallis Inquiry Report comes at a time when the industry is grappling with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review is expected to consider the impact of the pandemic on the financial services sector and make recommendations for reforms that will strengthen the sector as it navigates the uncertain economic conditions.
Some of the areas that may be addressed by the report include:
• Competition: The report may recommend reforms to strengthen competition in the financial services industry, such as the introduction of measures to reduce barriers to entry for new players and enable more effective switching between providers.
• Technology: The report may consider the role of technology in the financial system, such as the rise of fintech companies, and how regulatory frameworks need to adapt to these changes.
• Consumer protection: The report may recommend reforms to enhance consumer protection, such as the introduction of stronger disclosure requirements or enhanced dispute resolution mechanisms.
The release of the report will be eagerly anticipated by the financial services sector, government, and consumers alike. The government has promised to release its response to the report within the coming months, which will outline which recommendations it intends to adopt.
While it's difficult to predict exactly what the report will recommend, it's clear that its release comes at a critical time for the industry. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of having a strong and resilient financial system that can support economic recovery, and the recommendations in the report could help shape the future of the industry for years to come.
Overall, the release of the Wallis Inquiry Report is expected to bring about significant changes and reforms in the financial services sector. We can likely expect these to address challenges brought about by technological advancements, increasing competition, and the need for strong consumer protection.
The Federal Government will be hoping that the release of these recommendations will provide a blueprint for a stronger financial sector as we look towards a future impacted long-term by COVID-19.
