Australian construction materials company Boral Ltd is poised for growth as the country's house building sector anticipates an upturn.
Boral CEO Zlatko Todorcevski said the company would benefit from the expected increase in house building if it materialises.
"Recent indicators suggest the construction sector will grow, and we are well placed to benefit from that growth," he said.
Boral has been restructuring its business, selling non-core assets and simplifying operations to focus on core markets. The company has also been investing in its technology and innovation capabilities.
"We have a well-executed strategy in place, with a clear focus on the things that matter most, including sustainability, innovation and employee safety," Todorcevski said.
Boral reported a net profit after tax of AUD 132 million ($95.2 million) for the year to June 30, up from AUD 94 million ($67.7 million) the previous year.
Todorcevski said the company's financial position was strong and it was well placed to navigate the ongoing challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
"We have maintained our strong financial position, with our debt levels remaining low, and we have a solid liquidity position. This gives us the flexibility to respond to any emerging challenges or opportunities," he said.
