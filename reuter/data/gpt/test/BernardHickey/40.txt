Westpac Banking Corp has released its annual financial report which has surprised the market with a strong profit result. The latest results reveal that the bank's after-tax profit rose to $6.8 billion, a 33% increase from last year's $5.2 billion result.
The significant uptick in profit can be attributed to the bank's increase in non-interest income. Westpac reported a 12% increase in non-interest income to $3.3 billion, which makes up a large part of the overall earnings. 
Westpac's Chief Executive, Peter King, expressed his satisfaction with the result, despite the challenging market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. King credited the bank's "disciplined execution and focus on the customer" as crucial factors contributing to the strong result.
The result was also positive news for shareholders, as the bank announced a 40 cent final dividend, bringing the total annual dividend to 70 cents per share. King acknowledged the importance of dividends to shareholders in these trying times, stating that "we understand how important dividends are to our many shareholders and we are conscious of the impact that our dividend has on their income streams".
The bank's retail and institutional banking sectors performed well, with the retail sector increasing profits by 31% to $2.6 billion. While the institutional sector reported a 37% increase in profits to $2.1 billion.
Westpac's wealth management business, BT Financial Group, also performed well with a 16% increase in profits to $460 million. This is despite the significant headwinds caused by the Financial Services Royal Commission.
The strong profit result reflects the bank's effort to improve its service delivery to customers through simplification of product offerings and investment in digital channels. Westpac also reported a reduction in expenses by $9 billion over the year.
Despite the robust profit result, King warned that the pandemic continues to have a significant impact on the economic landscape and that the outlook for the bank's future earnings remains uncertain.
According to King, "The COVID-19 pandemic has created challenging times for the communities and businesses in which we operate, and we recognise the importance of supporting our customers through these difficult times."
Westpac has announced a range of initiatives to support their customers impacted by the pandemic, including deferrals of loan repayments, interest rate reductions and fee waivers.
Overall, Westpac's strong profit result has surprised the market and highlights the resilience of the bank's business strategy. Despite headwinds facing the financial sector relating to the pandemic, Westpac's focus on customer service, simplification, and digital channels has positioned the bank well for future earnings growth.
