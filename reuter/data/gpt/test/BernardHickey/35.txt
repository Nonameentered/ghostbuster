The Australian government has ordered Canadian television group, CanWest, to reduce their stake in Network Ten, the third largest commercial television network in the country. The move comes amid concerns that foreign ownership of Australian media could lead to a lack of diversity and a monopoly on information.
CanWest currently holds a 55% stake in Ten, which they acquired in 2007 for $680 million. The Australian government's order is for CanWest to reduce their stake to 25% by the end of 2022.
The decision was made by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), an Australian government agency that assesses foreign investment proposals. In their statement, FIRB acknowledged CanWest's contribution to Ten, but stated that reducing their stake was necessary to ensure diversity and to promote a competitive media environment.
Critics of the move argue that reducing CanWest's stake in Ten could have negative consequences for the network, potentially leading to job losses and decreased investment in local programming. However, the government has stated that they will work with all parties to ensure a smooth transition and to minimize any negative impact.
The decision to reduce foreign ownership in Australian media comes after years of debate on the issue. Some argue that foreign investment has brought much-needed funding to the struggling industry, while others are concerned about the impact on local content and the ability of foreign owners to control the news and information that Australians receive.
However, the FIRB's decision specifically focuses on the issue of diversity, noting that media ownership concentration can undermine Australia's democracy by limiting the dissemination of diverse viewpoints. By reducing CanWest's stake, the government hopes to promote a more diverse media landscape.
The decision has been welcomed by some in the industry, including the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), who have long been concerned about the impact of foreign ownership on local programming and content. Others, however, have criticized the move, arguing that it could have a negative impact on Ten's financial position.
Ten has struggled financially in recent years, with declining ratings and revenue. The network was forced to enter voluntary administration in 2017 before being acquired by current owners CBS. Critics argue that reducing CanWest's stake could weaken the network's financial position, potentially leading to further job losses and reduced investment in local content.
The Australian government's decision to reduce foreign ownership in media is not unique, with other countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, also imposing limits on foreign investment in their media industries. However, the move has sparked debate among industry experts, with some arguing that the government should focus on promoting local investment and innovation, rather than restricting foreign ownership.
Regardless of the debate, the FIRB's decision is set to have a significant impact on Australia's media industry. CanWest now has three years to divest their stake in Ten, with the government stating that they will work with all parties to ensure a smooth transition. The move is a reminder of the importance of diversity in media, as well as the ongoing debate on the role of foreign ownership in the industry.
