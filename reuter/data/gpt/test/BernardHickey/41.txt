Australia's major banks, including Westpac, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank (NAB), and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), are currently under investigation for allegedly colluding to manipulate interest rates. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has launched an investigation into the matter, which could lead to hefty fines and a damaged reputation for the country's banking sector.
The investigation centers on the banks' practices surrounding the setting of the Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW), which is used to price trillions of dollars in loans, securities, and derivatives. The BBSW is a daily benchmark interest rate that reflects the cost of short-term borrowing between banks. According to the ACCC, the banks may have engaged in anti-competitive behavior by sharing sensitive information and coordinating their rate submissions to influence the BBSW and boost their profits.
The allegations have been brewing for several years, and the ACCC has been working with regulators in other countries, including the United States and Europe. In 2016, ANZ agreed to pay a record penalty of $9 million for attempted cartel conduct related to the BBSW. The bank admitted that several traders had attempted to influence the rate on several occasions between 2010 and 2012. ANZ's settlement followed similar agreements by NAB and Westpac, which paid $6 million and $3.3 million, respectively, for engaging in similar conduct.
The current investigation is more extensive than previous probes and could result in far-reaching consequences for the banking sector. The ACCC's Chairman, Rod Sims, has stated that the investigation is broader than previous investigations and encompasses a wider range of conduct. "We're looking at conduct going back to 2012, and the number of institutions involved is greater than we have previously looked at," he said.
The allegations have prompted calls for stricter regulation of the banking sector and a deeper cultural shift within the industry. The former chief executive of NAB, Andrew Thorburn, has called for a "360-degree review" of the sector to address the root causes of the misconduct. He has suggested that a focus on profit-driven incentives has led to a culture of unethical behavior and calls for a more customer-focused approach.
The investigation comes at a time when the Australian banking sector is facing significant challenges. The fallout from the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry has led to widespread public scrutiny of the sector's practices. The Commission uncovered a range of misconduct, including falsified documents, inappropriate fees, and poor advice, which cost customers billions of dollars. The Commission's final report, released in 2019, called for sweeping reforms, including a restructuring of the industry regulator and a complete overhaul of the banking sector's culture.
The ACCC's investigation adds further pressure on the banks to address concerns over their conduct. The regulator has wide-ranging powers that allow it to levy substantial fines and pursue criminal charges against those found guilty of anticompetitive conduct. The investigation is expected to take some time, but the stakes are high for the banks involved.
The Australian Banking Association has responded to the allegations by stating that the sector takes the matter seriously and is committed to cooperating with the investigation. "The banking industry has already taken steps to reform and strengthen the way the benchmark is set, including introducing more robust governance arrangements and surveillance to prevent misconduct," said ABA CEO, Anna Bligh. "We welcome the ACCC investigation and will work closely with the regulator to ensure any issues are thoroughly investigated and addressed."
The investigation into the major banks' conduct surrounding the BBSW is a timely reminder of the risks associated with an unregulated banking sector. As the banks face renewed scrutiny, they must address the root causes of misconduct and work to rebuild trust with their customers. Only through a concerted effort by the industry can the public be assured that their interests are being protected and that the sector is acting in the best interests of the Australian economy.
