Australia's Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has announced the biggest financial reforms since 1983 in an effort to promote competition and accountability within the banking industry. However, the reforms will not allow for big bank mergers, disappointing some industry leaders.
Frydenberg's announcement comes after a damning report by the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. The report highlighted widespread misconduct within the industry, including charging fees to customers who had died and selling products to customers who could not afford them.
The reforms aim to address the issues raised by the Royal Commission by increasing transparency, improving consumer protection, and promoting competition. Frydenberg stated that the government's goal is to "empower customers, promote competition, and ensure that the regulatory framework is able to keep pace with the changing financial landscape."
One of the key components of the reforms is the creation of a new independent regulator, the Financial Regulator Assessment Authority (FRAA), which will be responsible for conducting regular assessments of the banking industry. The FRAA will be tasked with ensuring that banks are adhering to the new rules and regulations and are acting in the best interests of their customers.
Another significant reform is the introduction of a new Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR). This will require banks to identify key staff responsible for compliance and risk management and hold them accountable for any failures. The regime will also give regulators the power to disqualify individuals from working in the industry if they are found to be in breach of their obligations.
Frydenberg also announced that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) will be given additional resources and powers to enforce compliance with the new rules. This includes the ability to impose tougher penalties on banks and their executives who breach the regulations.
Despite these significant reforms, Frydenberg confirmed that he will not be allowing big bank mergers, citing concerns over competition. He stated that "our banking system is already highly concentrated, and we don't want to see a handful of banks dominating the market and limiting choice for consumers."
This decision will likely disappoint some industry leaders who were hoping that the government would relax the regulations around mergers and acquisitions. The CEOs of Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, and Westpac had all hinted that they would be interested in exploring merger opportunities if the regulations were eased.
However, Frydenberg's decision was welcomed by consumer advocacy groups, who have long argued that the banking industry in Australia is too concentrated and not competitive enough. The CEO of the Australian Consumers' Association, Gwynn Bridge, stated that "the Treasurer's decision is a positive step towards promoting competition and ensuring that banks are focused on serving their customers rather than consolidating their market power."
Overall, Frydenberg's reforms represent a significant step forward for the banking industry in Australia. However, it remains to be seen how successful they will be in addressing the issues raised by the Royal Commission and promoting greater competition within the industry. The Treasury will need to work closely with regulators and industry stakeholders to ensure that the new rules and regulations are implemented effectively and that the banking industry is held to account for any breaches.
