Brierley Investments, a New Zealand-based investment company, has called on the Australian government to relax its investment rules for New Zealand companies. The call follows concerns over the barriers to entry that currently prevent New Zealand businesses from prospering in the Australian market.
Brierley Investments is one of the largest investment companies in New Zealand, with interests in a diverse range of sectors including property, aviation, and financial services. The company has a significant presence in Australia, with investments in a number of businesses including SkyCity Entertainment Group and Advanced Hair Studio.
However, despite its success in the Australian market, Brierley Investments believes that there are still significant barriers to entry for New Zealand companies looking to expand into Australia. These barriers include restrictions on foreign investment, complex regulations, and bureaucratic hurdles that make it difficult for New Zealand businesses to establish themselves in the Australian market.
In a statement, Brierley Investments said that it believes that the Australian government should relax its investment rules to allow more New Zealand businesses to enter the Australian market. According to the company, this would not only benefit New Zealand companies but also help to promote greater economic integration between the two countries.
"We believe that there are significant opportunities for New Zealand businesses in the Australian market, but the current investment rules are preventing many companies from taking advantage of these opportunities," said Brierley Investments CEO, Mr Jonathan Ling. "We urge the Australian government to consider relaxing these rules to promote greater economic integration and mutual benefits for both countries."
The call from Brierley Investments comes at a time when the relationship between Australia and New Zealand is under increasing strain. In recent years, there has been growing concern in New Zealand over Australia's restrictive immigration policies, which have led to a significant number of Kiwis being deported from Australia.
There has also been controversy over the treatment of New Zealand citizens in Australia, including the recent case of a New Zealand woman who was denied residency in Australia because of her son's disability.
Despite these tensions, Brierley Investments believes that there is still a strong case for greater economic cooperation between the two countries, particularly when it comes to investment. The company argues that by relaxing its investment rules, the Australian government would not only be promoting greater economic integration but also helping to create jobs and drive growth in both countries.
The call from Brierley Investments has been welcomed by a number of other businesses and industry groups in New Zealand, who have also expressed frustration over the barriers to entry that currently exist in the Australian market.
"There are significant opportunities for New Zealand businesses in Australia, but we need to be able to compete on a level playing field," said the CEO of the New Zealand International Business Forum, Mr Stephen Jacobi. "By relaxing its investment rules, the Australian government would be sending a strong signal that it is committed to promoting greater economic integration and mutual benefits for both countries."
Despite these calls for action, it remains to be seen whether the Australian government will take any steps to relax its investment rules for New Zealand companies. However, with the relationship between the two countries becoming increasingly strained, there is a growing consensus that greater economic cooperation is needed if both countries are to prosper in the years ahead.
