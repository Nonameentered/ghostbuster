BHP to be Sole Operator of Bayu-Undan Gas Field in Timor Sea, Paving Way for Development Plans
Australian mining giant, BHP, has been chosen to be the sole operator of the Bayu-Undan gas field situated in the Timor Sea. The move will pave the way towards BHP's development plans for its offshore operations that include significant investment and expansion in the region. 
The Bayu-Undan gas field, located around 500 kilometers north-west of Darwin, is one of the largest offshore gas fields with gas reserves of around 5 trillion cubic feet. The gas field has been in operation since 2004 and is expected to continue production for approximately another two decades. 
Recently, two big players in the oil and gas industry, Australia's Woodside Petroleum and Timor-Leste's government, decided to sell their shares in the Bayu-Undan gas field to BHP. This led to BHP acquiring a 100 percent ownership of the field, making them the sole operator in that capacity. 
BHP has long been said to have ambitions to expand its operations in the oil and gas industry, and this acquisition is a significant step in realizing those goals. According to the head of BHP's petroleum division, Geraldine Slattery, this is a "fantastic opportunity to invest in our offshore operations, particularly for the drilling and development of the Scarborough gas field." 
BHP's development plans for the location include drilling and development of the Scarborough gas field, located south of Bayu-Undan. The Scarborough gas field is considered one of the largest in the world, with an estimated gas reserve of approximately 7 trillion cubic feet. BHP plans to extend the existing pipeline from Bayu-Undan to deliver gas from Scarborough to the Darwin liquified natural gas processing plant. 
The development of the Scarborough gas field is seen as essential to Australia's energy security. The country is the world's biggest exporter of liquified natural gas, and the demand is increasing with many countries reducing their reliance on coal-fired powerplants due to environmental concerns. Scarbourgh is also expected to create employment opportunities and generate significant revenue for the Australian economy. 
BHP's plans align with the Australian government's goal of ensuring energy security, reducing energy prices, and contributing to job creation and economic growth. The federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, said in a press conference that, "This is an important investment not just in Australia's economic security but also in the stability of our region's energy supply." He added that the development of Scarborough gas field would "provide critical gas supplies into the domestic market," stating that Australia's "gas supplies to our manufacturing sectors, to commercial and industrial operations and the production of electricity in gas-fired power stations is critical." 
The Australian government's support of BHP's gas supply ambitions may face criticism from environmental activists. BHP has faced scrutiny from environmental groups in the past for its mining activities. Climate campaigner and founder of Market Forces, Julien Vincent, criticized the government's support of BHP's latest venture, stating that "fossil fuel exports should not be presented as a panacea for Australia's economic recovery or energy independence." He added that "there is no way that our Paris (climate agreement) targets can be achieved whilst these massive fossil fuel projects are proceeding."
BHP's expansion plans are not just limited to Scarborough gas field. The company is also competing with Woodside Petroleum and Santos in the race to acquire equity in the Poseidon gas discovery, located north-west of Bayu-Undan. The gas field is estimated to have 3 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas reserves. 
The acquisition of Bayu-Undan gas field by BHP signals a significant shift in the Australian gas industry landscape and is expected to generate significant benefits for the region. The company's development plans align with the Australian government's energy security goals and may contribute to the country's post-pandemic economic recovery. However, BHP may face opposition from environmental groups as it proceeds with its offshore expansion plans.
