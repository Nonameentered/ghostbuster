Sydney Olympics ticket sales struggle, prompting consortium to seek overseas buyers
The upcoming Sydney Olympics in September may be a highly anticipated event among sports fans, but for the consortium behind the Games, ticket sales have been a major concern. With just two months before the Opening Ceremony, the organizers are now stepping up their efforts to attract overseas buyers to fill the empty seats.
According to the consortium, only 70 percent of the available tickets have been sold so far, despite a significant drop in prices earlier this year. The sluggish sales are attributed to several factors, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, strict quarantine protocols, and the uncertainty surrounding travel restrictions.
In response, the consortium is now looking to tap into the international market, particularly in countries where COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted or are less strict. The focus will be on attracting tourists, corporate clients, and sports enthusiasts who are willing to travel to Sydney for the Games.
"We need to fill the seats, and we believe that there is still a lot of interest in the Olympics among fans around the world," said a spokesperson for the consortium. "We are actively seeking buyers from overseas, and we are confident that we can offer them a safe and enjoyable experience."
The consortium has commissioned a team of international marketing experts to help promote the Games abroad, with a focus on social media and digital advertising. The team will also work closely with local tour operators and travel agencies to offer special packages that combine Olympic tickets with accommodation and other perks.
"The idea is to make it as easy as possible for overseas buyers to plan their trip to Sydney," said the spokesperson. "We know that it's a challenging time for travel, but we believe that with the right incentives and assurances, people will be willing to make the journey."
Despite the optimism of the consortium, some experts remain skeptical about the success of the overseas sales strategy. They point out that similar initiatives were attempted during the Tokyo Olympics earlier this year, but failed to attract significant interest due to the pandemic.
"We're in a very different situation now than we were even a few months ago," said Dr. Jane Peters, a sports marketing expert at the University of Sydney. "Many countries are still experiencing high levels of COVID-19 cases, and travel restrictions remain in place in many parts of the world. It's going to be a tough sell."
Peters added that the consortium may need to consider other measures, such as offering refunds or discounts to local buyers who have already purchased tickets but are now unable to attend due to COVID-19 restrictions.
The Sydney Olympics are scheduled to take place from September 23 to October 8, with over 11,000 athletes from 206 countries expected to compete in 34 sports. The Games were originally scheduled for 2020 but were postponed due to the pandemic.
