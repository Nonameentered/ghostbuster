Australia-based James Hardie Industries, a leading manufacturer of construction materials, has forecast a surge in profits from its U.S. units despite posting weaker annual profits. The company's CEO, Jack Truong, revealed in a recent investor conference call that industry growth and innovative product offerings will help it make up for lower earnings from its domestic operations.
In the fiscal year ended March 2021, James Hardie Industries reported a net operating profit before tax of AUD 367.4 million ($283 million), down 3.3% from the previous year. The decline was attributed to supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and increased competition in certain markets.
However, Truong is optimistic about the company's future prospects, especially in the U.S., which accounts for around 80% of its revenues. He pointed out that the American housing market has shown significant resilience amid the pandemic, with low interest rates and increasing demand for new homes driving sales of building materials.
James Hardie Industries is a significant player in the U.S. market, offering a range of fiber cement products such as siding, trim, and roofing. The company has been investing heavily in R&D to develop new, high-tech materials that provide superior performance and improve the energy efficiency of buildings.
Truong believes that the company's innovative product offerings will set it apart from competitors and drive sales growth. He noted that James Hardie Industries has a pipeline of new products that includes high-capacity siding, advanced roofing systems, and pre-finished trim.
These products have already gained traction in the market, with the company reporting a 13% increase in sales of its ColorPlus pre-finished siding products in the U.S. in the fiscal year 2021. Additionally, the company's HardiePlank lap siding and HardieTrim board products continued to be among the top-performing items in its portfolio.
The upbeat outlook for James Hardie Industries is reflected in its financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a 12% increase in adjusted net operating profit before tax from its U.S. operations, driven by strong sales growth in its residential and commercial businesses.
Truong expects this trend to continue in the coming months, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. The company is focusing on expanding its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. to meet the growing demand for its products and capitalize on the favorable market conditions.
"With our industry-leading innovation, a strong demand environment and our committed team, we are well-positioned to drive continued profitable growth," Truong said. "We remain focused on serving our customers with quality products, enhancing our operational efficiencies and delivering on our strategic initiatives to drive long-term value for our stakeholders."
