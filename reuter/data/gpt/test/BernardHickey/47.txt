Coca-Cola Amatil has announced that it has settled a share swap deal with San Miguel Corporation, making it the world's second-largest Coke bottler. The deal will see Coca-Cola Amatil become the exclusive bottler of Coca-Cola products in the Philippines while San Miguel will take over Coca-Cola's bottling operations in Indonesia.
Coca-Cola Amatil's CEO Alison Watkins said that the deal was a major milestone for the company, adding that it had been working towards becoming a "bigger and stronger Coke bottler in the Asia-Pacific region." She also praised San Miguel Corporation, saying that they were a "highly respected and successful company."
Under the terms of the deal, Coca-Cola Amatil will issue 221.5 million new shares to San Miguel, as well as paying $500 million in cash. This will give San Miguel a 15% stake in Coca-Cola Amatil, making it the second-largest shareholder after The Coca-Cola Company.
In exchange, San Miguel will take over Coca-Cola's bottling operations in Indonesia, which include eight plants and more than 12,000 employees. The company will also become the exclusive distributor of Coca-Cola products in the country.
This is a significant move for Coca-Cola Amatil, which has been looking to expand its operations in the Philippines for some time. The country has a population of more than 100 million people and a growing middle class, making it an attractive market for Coca-Cola Amatil.
The deal also strengthens Coca-Cola Amatil's position in the Asia-Pacific region, where it already has operations in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea. The company is now one of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers in the world, with a presence in more than 30 countries.
San Miguel Corporation, on the other hand, gets a foothold in the Indonesian market and access to Coca-Cola's wide range of products. This will help the company diversify its operations, which currently include food and beverage, packaging, and infrastructure.
The deal is expected to be completed by the end of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals. Once completed, it will create a strong partnership between two of the biggest companies in the Asia-Pacific region, with a shared focus on growth and innovation.
In a joint statement, both companies said that the deal was part of their long-term strategy to strengthen their presence in the Asia-Pacific region. They also emphasized their commitment to sustainable business practices and creating long-term value for their stakeholders.
The news of the deal was welcomed by analysts, who said that it would help both companies achieve their goals in the region. However, they also cautioned that there could be challenges ahead, including regulatory hurdles and integration issues.
Overall, the share swap deal between Coca-Cola Amatil and San Miguel Corporation is a significant development for both companies and for the Asia-Pacific region. It reinforces Coca-Cola Amatil's position as one of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers in the world and provides San Miguel with a new avenue for growth. With the deal set to be completed by the end of the year, all eyes will be on how the two companies work together to build a strong and sustainable business.
