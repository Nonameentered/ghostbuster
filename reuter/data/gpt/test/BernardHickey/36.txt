Seven Network Ltd Chairman Kerry Stokes has publicly accused former Australian Prime Minister John Howard of making a "disgraceful" deal to deliver the ownership of Fairfax to media mogul Kerry Packer.
Stokes, who has long been a vocal critic of what he sees as undue influence by the Packer family on Australian politics and media, made the comments during a speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday.
"The fact that John Howard agreed to facilitate the transfer of Fairfax to Kerry Packer is nothing short of a disgrace," Stokes said. "This was a deal between two powerful men that was made without any regard for the interests of the wider Australian public."
The comments came as part of Stokes' broader criticism of the concentration of media ownership in Australia, which he says has led to a lack of independent voices and a diminished democracy.
"This is not just about the Packer family and their influence over the media. It's about the broader issue of who controls what Australians read, watch and listen to," Stokes said.
Fairfax, which owns major newspapers such as The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, was sold to Nine Entertainment Co., owned by the Packer family, in a $2.2 billion deal in 2018.
Stokes has long been seen as a rival to the Packers, with Seven Network competing with Nine in the television industry. He has previously accused Kerry Packer, who died in 2005, of using his wealth and influence to evade taxes and exert control over politicians.
In his speech, Stokes also took aim at Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, which owns many of Australia's major newspapers as well as television and radio stations.
"There is clear evidence that News Corp has used its market power to influence our political system and promote its own interests," he said.
Stokes' comments have divided opinion in Australia, with some praising him for speaking out against media consolidation, while others have accused him of hypocrisy given Seven Network's own ownership of newspapers and other media assets.
The spat between Stokes and the Packers is just one example of the long history of rivalry and animosity between Australia's powerful media elites.
Given the enormous influence that media ownership can have over public opinion and political outcomes, the issue of media consolidation remains a contentious one among Australians.
In recent years, there have been calls to introduce stricter regulations on media ownership, including a ban on cross-ownership of newspapers and television stations and greater transparency around political donations.
Despite the controversy surrounding Stokes' comments, many Australians will no doubt agree with his underlying message: that a free and independent media is essential for a healthy democracy, and that any attempts to manipulate or control the media for narrow commercial or political interests should be roundly condemned.
