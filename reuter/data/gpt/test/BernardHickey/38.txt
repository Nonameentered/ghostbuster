SYDNEY - Australian billionaire Kerry Packer faces possible challenges in his bid to take over John Fairfax Holdings Ltd, the publisher of Australia's oldest newspaper, The Sydney Morning Herald, according to analysts.
Packer's investment firm, Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL), confirmed on Wednesday that it has begun discussions with Fairfax Holdings to acquire some of the company's assets, including The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, and The Australian Financial Review.
However, experts have warned that there could be hurdles for Packer's bid, particularly in light of recent changes to Australian media ownership laws and resistance from Fairfax's current board of directors.
"It's not going to be an easy road for Packer," said Mark McDonnell, analyst at BBY Limited. "There are a lot of moving parts to this deal, and a lot of different stakeholders to satisfy."
One of the main challenges for Packer could be satisfying the requirements of the new media ownership laws, which were introduced by the Australian government in 2017. The laws prevent any one person or entity from owning more than two out of three traditional forms of media – television, radio, or print – in a single market.
Packer already controls significant media assets in Australia through PBL, including the Nine Network, The Australian Women's Weekly, and Zoo Weekly magazine. Acquiring Fairfax Holdings would allow him to expand his media empire even further, but it could also put him in violation of the new ownership laws.
"The ownership laws are definitely a hurdle," said McDonnell. "Packer will need to get creative if he wants to make this deal happen."
Another challenge could be winning over Fairfax's current board of directors, who may be resistant to a takeover by Packer.
"Fairfax has a long history and a respected reputation in Australia's media landscape," said Rachel Dixon, analyst at Deutsche Bank. "The board may be reluctant to sell to someone like Packer, who is more known for his business interests than his love of journalism."
However, Dixon added that Packer could try to sweeten the deal by offering guarantees of editorial independence and investing in the company's digital capabilities.
"Investing in digital could be a real selling point for Fairfax," she said. "Packer could position himself as someone who can help the company thrive in the future."
Despite the potential obstacles, some analysts believe that a deal between Packer and Fairfax Holdings could still be possible.
"Packer has a lot of resources and a lot of clout in the media industry," said McDonnell. "If anyone can make this deal happen, it's him."
Additionally, some experts have speculated that Fairfax Holdings may be in a weakened position due to declining revenues and increased competition from digital players such as Google and Facebook. According to recent data, Fairfax's net profit for the last financial year fell by 54.3 percent, while revenue for its print media division dropped by 10.6 percent.
"The media landscape is changing rapidly, and Fairfax may be struggling to keep up," said Dixon. "They may be more open to a takeover than they would have been in the past."
Packer has yet to release any details about his proposed deal for Fairfax Holdings, and it is not clear when negotiations are expected to be completed. However, the potential takeover has already sparked controversy in Australia's media and political spheres, with some critics raising concerns over media monopolization and the impact on editorial independence.
"There are legitimate concerns about concentration of media ownership in Australia," said McDonnell. "This deal could have significant ramifications for the future of the industry."
