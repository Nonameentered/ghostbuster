News Corp Ltd confirmed on Tuesday that it had achieved a 20% profit growth despite below-expectations half-year results. The media giant's overall revenue for the six months to December 31 was $4.38 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $4.51 billion. However, its net income soared to $385 million, up from $321 million in the same period a year earlier.
News Corp CEO Robert Thomson attributed the growth to the company's digital and real estate businesses, which have been expanding rapidly. "Our digital revenues account for nearly 40% of our total revenues, which is a testament to the strength of our digital strategy," Thomson said. "Our real estate businesses also continue to perform strongly, driven by robust demand for our high-quality properties."
Thomson added that the company's news and information services had faced "significant headwinds," particularly in the advertising sector, but said the impact had been offset by strong growth in book publishing, including the successful launch of HarperCollins e-books and audiobooks.
Despite the better-than-expected profit results, News Corp shares fell by over 3% following the announcement, with investors expressing concern about the company's continuing struggles in the news sector. However, Thomson remained upbeat, saying the company was "well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the rapidly-changing media landscape."
