The Wallis Report, which will be released next week, is expected to ease restrictions on bank mergers and foreign takeovers in Australia, according to industry experts.
The report, which was commissioned by the Australian government in 1996, is a comprehensive review of the financial system. It was headed by businessman and former Reserve Bank board member Stan Wallis.
The report is expected to recommend the abolition of the 15% cap on bank ownership, which has limited foreign investment in the Australian banking sector. It is also expected to recommend the removal of the restriction on mergers between the four major banks - ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, and Westpac.
The Australian Bankers’ Association (ABA) has welcomed the potential changes. The ABA’s CEO, Anna Bligh, said: “We believe that there is merit in the idea of removing ownership restrictions, as this will help to create a more competitive and efficient banking sector.”
Bligh also said that the ABA supported the idea of allowing mergers between the major banks, as long as there were sufficient safeguards in place to protect consumers. “It is important that any changes to the banking sector are balanced and considered, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders,” she said.
However, not everyone is in favour of the proposed changes. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has raised concerns about the potential impact of foreign takeovers on jobs in the sector.
ACTU Secretary Sally McManus said: “The banking sector is an important employer in Australia, and any changes that make it easier for foreign companies to take over local banks could have significant implications for jobs and working conditions in the sector.”
McManus also said that the removal of ownership restrictions could lead to a loss of Australian control over the banking sector. “We need to ensure that our banking sector remains in Australian hands, so that we can protect the interests of Australian consumers and workers,” she said.
The Australian Greens have also expressed concerns about the potential impact of the changes. Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, the Greens’ spokesperson on finance, said: “We need to ensure that any changes to the banking sector are made in the interests of the Australian people, not just the interests of multinational corporations.”
Whish-Wilson also said that the Greens would be pushing for tougher regulation of the banking sector, and greater protections for consumers.
The Australian government has not yet responded to the expected recommendations of the Wallis Report, but Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has previously indicated that he is open to the idea of easing restrictions on bank mergers and foreign takeovers.
“The banking sector is an important part of the Australian economy, and we need to ensure that it remains competitive and efficient,” Frydenberg said in a recent speech. “We will carefully consider any recommendations made by the Wallis Report, and work with all stakeholders to ensure that our financial system is supporting the needs of the Australian people.”
The Wallis Report is expected to be released next week, and it is likely to spark heated debate among stakeholders in the banking sector. Only time will tell whether the proposed changes will be implemented, and how they will impact the Australian economy and consumers.
