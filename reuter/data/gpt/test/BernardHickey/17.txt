News Corp, one of the largest media conglomerates in the world, is expected to report stagnant net profit due to rising newsprint costs and losses incurred by its Star TV network.
The media giant, which owns major newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and The Sun, has been struggling to deal with the increasing prices of newsprint, which has been affecting its bottom line for some time now. The situation has been exacerbated by the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, which have led to increased tariffs on imported newsprint from Canada.
In addition to these challenges, News Corp has also been facing losses from its Star TV operations in Asia, which have been impacted by the rise of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The company’s Star TV network, which broadcasts in India, China, and other countries in the region, has been losing subscribers to these streaming giants, causing a significant impact on the company’s revenue.
As a result of these challenges, analysts expect News Corp to report stagnant net profit for the fiscal year, signaling a difficult year for the company. The stagnant net profit is a stark contrast to the 21% increase the company reported in net profit in the previous fiscal year.
Despite these challenges, News Corp has been working to diversify its operations and invest in digital media, which has shown promising growth in recent years. In 2019, the company acquired the video ad platform, Unruly, which has been growing rapidly, and has also launched new digital initiatives like NewsIQ, a digital advertising platform.
The company has also been investing heavily in its digital news offerings, launching new digital brands like Knewz and acquiring the digital news website, Storyful. These investments in digital media are paying off, as the company’s digital revenues have been steadily growing, offsetting some of the losses experienced by its traditional print and TV operations.
Despite these positive developments, the challenges facing News Corp in the newsprint and TV industries remain significant, and the company will need to continue to diversify its operations and invest in new areas in order to stay competitive in an ever-changing media landscape.
In a statement, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson acknowledged the challenges facing the company but remained optimistic about its future. “This has been a challenging year, but we remain committed to our mission of delivering quality journalism and engaging content to our audiences around the world,” he said. “We are confident that our investments in digital media and our diversification strategy will position us for long-term success.”
The release of News Corp’s fiscal year results is eagerly anticipated by investors and analysts, who will be closely following the company’s performance in the face of these challenges. Despite the difficult environment, the company’s dedication to innovation and its strong brand portfolio are likely to help it weather the storm and emerge stronger in the years to come.
