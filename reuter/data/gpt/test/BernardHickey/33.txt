Australia's largest home mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank, has issued a warning that the country is at risk of falling into a U.S.-style financial collapse. The lender has cautioned that the current property market bubble, combined with household debt and a potential drop in immigration, could lead to a sharp decline in house prices and a wider economic recession.
The warning comes as Australia's already fragile housing market begins to show signs of weakness amid tight lending conditions and a slowing economy. Home prices in Sydney and Melbourne have fallen 11.1% and 6.4% respectively in the past year alone, with many experts predicting a further drop of up to 20%.
Commonwealth Bank's chief executive, Matt Comyn, has urged regulators to take action to prevent a financial crisis and protect Australians from the worst of the fallout. In a speech to the Australian Payment Summit in Sydney, Comyn said, "We can't afford to be complacent, we need to act now before it's too late."
The warnings from Commonwealth Bank have been echoed by other financial institutions and experts, who warn that the housing market bubble, combined with rising interest rates, could lead to a financial crisis that would threaten the stability of the entire Australian economy.
In a recent report, global credit rating agency Moody's warned that the high levels of household debt and low wage growth in Australia could pose a major risk to the economy and the banking sector. The report stated, "Australia's household debt-to-income ratio is among the highest in the world, leaving households particularly vulnerable to any event that could disrupt their ability to service these liabilities."
According to Moody's, the risks to the Australian economy are exacerbated by a slowing global economy, rising trade tensions between the United States and China, and a decline in commodity prices. The agency has warned that a major shock to the economy, such as a sharp decline in house prices, could lead to a sharp rise in loan defaults and a wider economic recession.
The Australian government has attempted to downplay the risks to the economy, with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg stating that the housing market is "cooling, but not collapsing." However, many experts warn that the government's response has been too slow and that urgent action is needed to prevent a financial crisis.
The warnings from Commonwealth Bank and other financial institutions should be taken seriously by both regulators and everyday Australians. The current risks to the economy are real and could have serious consequences for millions of people. It is time for the government to take action to prevent a financial crisis and protect the economy from further damage.
