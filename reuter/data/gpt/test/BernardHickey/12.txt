Westfield America Inc, a subsidiary of the Australian company Scentre Group, has announced that it will list on the New York Stock Exchange in a $400m Initial Public Offering (IPO). The company is one of the biggest mall operators in the United States, with 33 shopping centers across the country.
The IPO is set to be one of the biggest in the retail property sector in the United States in recent years. The company has stated that it will use the money it raises to pay off its debts, invest in new developments, and improve its existing properties.
Westfield America owns some of the United States’ most iconic shopping centers, including Westfield Century City in Los Angeles, Westfield World Trade Center in New York, and Westfield San Francisco Centre. Its properties attract over 300 million visitors each year, making it one of the largest retail property companies in the world.
The decision to list on the New York Stock Exchange follows a period of growth for Westfield America. In 2018, the company generated $2.2bn in revenues and $928m in funds from its operations. Its financial performance has been supported by a strong US economy, which has seen consumer spending remain robust despite the ongoing trade conflict with China.
The company’s CEO, Peter Lowy, said that the decision to list on the New York Stock Exchange was a “significant milestone” for Westfield America. “We believe that the public markets will provide us with the capital we need to continue to grow and expand our business,” he said. “Our properties are some of the most attractive retail spaces in the world, and we’re confident that investors will see value in them.”
Analysts expect that the Westfield America IPO will be well-received by investors, given the company’s strong financial performance and the continued popularity of shopping centers in the United States. However, there are concerns that the ongoing trade conflict with China could have an impact on the company’s revenues if it results in higher tariffs on imported goods.
Despite these concerns, Westfield America remains optimistic about its future prospects. The company has stated that it will continue to invest in new developments and improve its existing properties, while also seeking to acquire new properties in key locations across the United States.
The Westfield America IPO is set to take place in the coming weeks, with the company looking to raise $400m from the sale of its shares. If successful, the IPO will provide a much-needed boost to the retail property sector in the United States, which has been struggling in recent years due to the rise of online shopping and changing consumer trends.
However, the successful listing of Westfield America could also have wider implications for the US economy as a whole. As one of the largest mall operators in the country, the company is a key player in the retail sector, and the success of its IPO could indicate that there is still strong investor demand for retail property assets in the United States.
Overall, the Westfield America IPO is expected to be one of the most closely watched listings of 2020, and could provide a key indication of the health of the retail property sector in the United States. With the ongoing trade war between the United States and China continuing to cloud the economic outlook, the success of the IPO could also provide a much-needed boost of confidence for investors and businesses alike.
