Westpac Banking Corp has announced a strong profit rise despite facing a squeeze on interest margins.
The Australian bank reported a 60% increase in cash earnings to A$2.3bn ($1.7bn) for the six months to the end of March, beating expectations of A$2.1bn ($1.6bn).
However, the bank's net interest margin, which measures the difference between the interest it earns on loans and what it pays on deposits, fell 2 basis points to 2.09%, reflecting the intense competition in the market.
Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer said the bank had managed to grow its income despite the challenging market conditions.
"We've delivered good results, with solid growth in earnings and our balance sheet, which shows the strength of our business," he said.
"We've also made good progress in addressing our regulatory and compliance issues, which will help us to continue to build a sustainable business."
The bank also announced that it had reduced its exposure to the troubled oil and gas sector, with its exposure down from A$795m ($606m) in September 2016 to A$570m ($435m) at the end of March.
Westpac's result follows similar strong performances from fellow Australian banks, with National Australia Bank also reporting a 60% increase in cash earnings and Commonwealth Bank of Australia announcing a 6% increase.
However, the sector has been hit by concerns around misconduct, with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission revealing that it had launched an investigation into several of the country's largest banks over alleged interest rate rigging.
Westpac was also recently fined A$1.3bn ($1bn) for breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations.
Despite these challenges, analysts remain optimistic about the sector's future, with many pointing to the banks' strong capital positions and the Australian economy's relatively solid performance.
"Overall, the results were solid, with the banks continuing to demonstrate their resilience in the face of what has been a challenging period," said Morningstar analyst David Ellis.
"It's clear that they have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned to deal with whatever comes their way, whether it's further regulatory scrutiny or a tough economic environment."
Westpac's shares rose 1.6% following the announcement, outperforming the broader market, which was down 0.2%.
