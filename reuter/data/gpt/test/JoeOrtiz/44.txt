Prudential Corp Plc, one of the largest financial services companies in the world, announced its first-half 2021 results yesterday. The company has beaten analysts' forecasts by achieving an eight percent rise in profits in the first half of the year, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company's pre-tax profit increased to £2.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in the first half of the year, up from £2.3 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2020. The results were driven by the strong performance of its Asia-focused life insurance and asset management businesses, which account for roughly 60% of the company's operating profit.
The company's asset management business saw net inflows of £14 billion ($19.2 billion), with a total asset under management of £708 billion ($971 billion). Its life insurance business also performed well, with new business profit growing by eight percent to £1.3 billion ($1.8 billion).
In response to the financial results, Prudential is now looking to expand its business further. The company's CEO, Mike Wells, stated that Prudential is seeking to acquire a home loan lender, saying: "We are looking at how we can use our balance sheet and business model to bring new products to the market. We are exploring ideas around home loans and mortgages, for example."
The acquisition of a home loan lender would allow Prudential to diversify its business and provide new revenue streams. It would also enable the company to offer a full range of financial services to its customers, from life insurance to home loans.
Despite the positive financial results, there are still challenges ahead for the company. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to an uncertain economic environment, and there are concerns about rising inflation and interest rates. Additionally, Prudential's UK retirement business has been impacted by changes to the income drawdown rules, which have made it less attractive for customers to purchase annuities.
To address these challenges, Prudential is looking to develop new products and services. The company plans to launch its first healthcare product in Indonesia later this year, and it is also exploring opportunities in the ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investment space.
Prudential is a 173-year-old company with a presence in 30 countries and over 20 million customers worldwide. Its successful first-half results and plans to expand through acquisitions demonstrate its resilience in the face of challenges and its commitment to providing innovative financial solutions to its customers.
