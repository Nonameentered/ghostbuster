Halifax Building Society is set to expand its mortgage market growth by acquiring more assets, according to CEO John Brown. Speaking to reporters, Brown said the move was part of the company's strategic plan to boost its market share. The building society remains confident in the housing market despite economic uncertainty due to the pandemic. The acquisition will allow Halifax to offer more competitive mortgage products to its customers. Halifax Building Society is part of Lloyds Banking Group, which has a significant presence in the UK mortgage market. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the next quarter.
