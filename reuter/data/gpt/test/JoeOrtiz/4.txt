Barclays Plc, one of the UK's largest banks, has reported disappointing profits and a slump in its investment banking division, leading to a significant drop in its share price.
The bank's 2019 full-year results showed that profits before tax fell by 9% to £4.4 billion ($5.7 billion), with revenues also dropping by 2% to £21.6 billion ($28 billion).
The main source of the decline in profits was the investment banking division, where revenues fell by 9% to £7.8 billion ($10.1 billion). The bank attributed this to a weaker global economy, ongoing political uncertainty, and the impact of US-China trade tensions.
Barclays' CEO, Jes Staley, described the results as "solid," but acknowledged that the investment bank had "underperformed" compared to its peers. He also highlighted the impact of a "difficult trading environment."
The bank's shares took a hit in response to the news, with the price falling by almost 7% to a three-year low of 162.74p. This wiped almost £2 billion ($2.6 billion) off the bank's market value.
The disappointing results also come at a time of upheaval for Barclays, as the bank faces pressure from activist investor Edward Bramson, who is pushing for a restructuring of the bank to reduce its reliance on investment banking.
Bramson's investment vehicle, Sherborne Investors, has built up a stake of almost 6% in the bank and is seeking a seat on Barclays' board. Bramson has criticized the bank's strategy, arguing that investment banking is too risky and that the bank should focus more on its retail banking and credit card divisions.
Barclays has resisted Bramson's calls for change, with Staley arguing that the bank's "integrated" model, which combines investment banking, retail banking, and credit cards, is the best approach.
However, the bank's weak investment banking performance may give Bramson's arguments more weight. The division has been a key source of profits for the bank in the past, but has come under pressure in recent years from factors such as regulatory changes and increased competition.
Barclays is not alone in facing challenges in the investment banking sector. Other banks such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse have also struggled in this area, leading to widespread job cuts and restructuring.
Overall, the financial sector is facing significant pressure from a range of factors, including low interest rates, increased competition from fintech companies, and ongoing regulatory scrutiny.
Despite these challenges, Barclays and other banks have continued to invest heavily in technology in an effort to improve efficiency and adapt to changing market conditions.
Barclays has also faced criticism over its controversial dealings with Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who killed himself in jail last year while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking. The bank has been accused of facilitating Epstein's financial transactions while he was under investigation for his crimes.
Barclays has launched an internal review in response to the allegations, with Staley saying that the bank would "fully cooperate" with regulators.
The bank has also faced criticism over its role in funding fossil fuel projects, with campaigners calling on the bank to phase out such investments in order to address the climate crisis.
Barclays has responded by setting a target to become "net-zero" by 2050, and by announcing plans to stop financing coal-fired power plants and Arctic oil exploration.
Whether these measures will satisfy the bank's critics remains to be seen, but for now, Barclays will be focusing on improving its financial performance and weathering the current volatility in the markets.
The bank's weak investment banking performance may make this a challenging task, but Staley remained upbeat in his commentary on the results, saying that the bank was "well-positioned" to navigate the current economic environment and that the bank's "long-term strategy remains unchanged."
For now, investors will be watching closely to see how Barclays responds to the current challenges facing the financial sector, and whether it can deliver better results in the future.
