NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of NatWest Group, is facing an investigation over an $81.4 million hole in its options trading book. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is said to be looking into whether the bank had adequate risk controls and whether clients were given sufficient information about the risks involved.
The hole was caused by a series of incorrect valuations of certain equity derivatives trades, which were made by the bank's global markets division. The trades were executed between late 2019 and early 2020 and the losses were discovered in the first quarter of this year.
The bank has said that the losses were isolated and that none of its clients were affected. However, the FCA is said to be concerned about the bank's risk management practices and whether it was transparent with its clients. The regulator has the power to impose fines and other sanctions if it finds that the bank breached any rules or regulations.
NatWest Markets has said that it is cooperating with the investigation and that it is committed to ensuring that it has appropriate risk management processes in place. The bank has also launched an internal review of its options trading business.
The news has come as a blow to NatWest Group, which was known as Royal Bank of Scotland until last year. The bank had been making progress in recent years, following a series of scandals and losses that occurred during the financial crisis. However, the revelations about the options trading book have raised questions about whether the bank has done enough to improve its risk controls and whether it has fully addressed the issues that led to its previous problems.
Analysts have said that the investigation is likely to be a major distraction for NatWest Group and could put pressure on its shares. The bank's share price has already been hit by concerns about the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the possibility of negative interest rates.
The investigation is also likely to increase scrutiny on the FCA, which has been criticized in recent years for not being tough enough on banks and other financial institutions. The regulator has faced calls to take a more aggressive approach to enforcing the rules and to hold senior executives accountable for any wrongdoing.
NatWest Markets is not the only bank to have experienced losses from options trading in recent years. Several other banks, including Credit Suisse and Societe Generale, have also suffered losses from similar trades. The losses have highlighted the risks involved in trading complex financial instruments and have led to calls for greater transparency and tighter regulation.
The investigation into NatWest Markets is likely to take several months and could result in significant fines and other penalties if the bank is found to have breached any rules or regulations. The bank has said that it takes the matter seriously and that it is committed to addressing any issues that are identified.
Investors will be closely watching the outcome of the investigation and the steps that NatWest Group takes to improve its risk management processes. The bank's shares have already fallen by more than 5% since news of the losses was first reported and the investigation is likely to keep the bank in the headlines for some time to come.
