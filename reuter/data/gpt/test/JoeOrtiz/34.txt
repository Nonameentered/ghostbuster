The head of NatWest's markets division is under pressure after the bank revealed a loss of $144 million on derivative trades made in the first quarter of 2021. The loss was attributed to a "number of factors", including fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
NatWest's markets division, which handles the bank's trading and investment activities, is widely seen as a key component of the bank's overall strategy. However, the loss on derivative trades has raised questions about the division's risk management practices and its ability to generate profits.
The bank's CEO, Alison Rose, expressed her disappointment at the loss and said that the bank was taking steps to address the underlying issues. "While we remain committed to our markets business, we are focused on ensuring that we have the right risk management practices in place and that we are generating sustainable profits," she said.
The loss has also sparked concerns among investors, many of whom had been bullish on NatWest's prospects after it reported a strong first quarter overall. NatWest's shares fell by over 2% following the announcement of the loss.
Analysts have been quick to point out that the loss on derivative trades is not an isolated incident in the banking industry. Many banks have been hit hard by volatile market conditions in recent months, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, the size of the loss at NatWest has raised eyebrows, particularly given the bank's reputation as a conservative and risk-averse institution. Some investors have questioned whether the bank's management was too complacent in its approach to risk, and whether it needs to take a more aggressive stance in order to generate profits.
The loss on derivative trades could also have wider implications for NatWest's business. Some analysts have suggested that it may make it harder for the bank to compete with its rivals in the investment banking sector, particularly as it seeks to expand its business in the US.
NatWest has already indicated that it plans to ramp up its investment banking activities in the US, where it sees significant growth opportunities. However, some investors may now be wary of investing in the bank's markets division, which could make it harder for NatWest to attract the talent it needs to pursue its expansion plans.
The bank has also faced criticism from some quarters for the way it has communicated the loss to investors. Some investors have complained that the bank was slow to disclose the loss on derivative trades, and that it has not been transparent about the underlying cause of the loss.
NatWest has defended its approach, arguing that it was following standard practice by waiting until it had all the relevant information before disclosing the loss. However, the incident has highlighted the importance of transparency and timely communication with investors, particularly in an environment where market conditions can change rapidly.
Overall, the loss on derivative trades is a setback for NatWest's markets division and for the bank as a whole. However, it is important to note that the bank remains financially sound, with strong capital reserves and a solid balance sheet. It will be up to the management of the markets division to learn from the incident and ensure that the bank's trading activities are conducted in a more disciplined and profitable manner going forward.
