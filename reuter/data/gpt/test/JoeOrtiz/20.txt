NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of NatWest, has discovered a £50 million hole in its options trading books. The bank revealed the discrepancy to the market, saying the issue was discovered during an internal review of its trading books.
According to reports, the error was made in the bank's risk management system, which failed to pick up on a discrepancy in the pricing of options trades. The bank said the error occurred in its delta hedging models, which are used to manage the risk of option positions.
NatWest has said it is investigating the root cause of the problem and has suspended two employees while it carries out the review. In a statement, the bank said it was "committed to ensuring the highest standards of accuracy in our trading books" and that it was "taking steps to address the issue and prevent similar occurrences in the future".
The news comes amid heightened scrutiny of the banking industry's risk management processes following a number of high-profile trading losses in recent years. The losses have prompted regulators to demand that banks improve their controls and reporting procedures, and to implement more rigorous risk management systems.
NatWest Markets is no stranger to trading losses. The bank has had a number of incidents in recent years where it has been forced to write-down its trading positions due to market volatility or other factors.
The most notable of these was in 2012, when the bank lost £2 billion on a complex derivatives trade. The loss was so significant that it led to the resignations of the bank's CEO and CFO.
Since then, the bank has implemented a number of measures to improve its risk management and has sought to reduce its exposure to complex derivatives trading. However, this latest incident highlights the ongoing challenges facing banks in managing their trading books and ensuring their risk management systems are up to scratch.
NatWest Markets has said it is confident that the error will not impact its overall financial position and that it will not have to revise its financial statements. However, the incident is likely to have a negative impact on investor confidence and could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny.
The bank has said it is cooperating fully with regulators and has informed the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the issue. The FCA has said it is aware of the incident and is monitoring the situation.
The news of the £50 million hole in NatWest's options trading books is also likely to raise concerns among other banks and financial institutions. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of robust risk management processes and the need for companies to be vigilant in identifying and mitigating potential risks.
NatWest Markets has said it is taking steps to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future, including implementing additional controls and reviewing its risk management processes. The bank has also said it is committed to working with regulators to address any issues that arise.
In the meantime, the reputation of NatWest Markets is likely to be dented by this latest incident, and the bank will be keen to reassure investors and regulators that it has taken appropriate action to address the problem and prevent a recurrence.
