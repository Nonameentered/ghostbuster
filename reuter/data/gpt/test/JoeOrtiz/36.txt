London - British banks are once again facing questions over their investment banking strategies, as some experts warn that their current approach may not be sustainable in the long term.
The concerns stem from a recent shift towards more complex financial products, such as derivative instruments, which have been increasingly popular with banks looking to generate higher returns on their investments.
While these products can be lucrative in the short term, there are concerns that they may also pose higher risks to the stability of the banking sector as a whole.
According to some analysts, the use of derivatives by banks has become particularly worrying in recent years, as the products have become more complex and difficult to understand.
"Investment banks are using more and more complex structured products and derivatives that are more difficult to value or understand," said Izabella Kaminska, a financial journalist who has been covering the banking sector for over a decade.
"This creates increased uncertainty and opacity in the market, which can ultimately have damaging effects on the wider financial system."
Kaminska's concerns are echoed by others within the industry, who argue that banks need to take a more cautious approach to their investment strategies and focus more on traditional banking activities, such as lending and deposit-taking.
"Derivatives can be extremely useful financial tools when used properly, but they should be seen as an ancillary rather than a core part of a bank's business," said Keith Black, managing director of curriculum and exams at the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association.
"Instead of relying on complex derivatives to generate returns, banks should focus on building relationships with their clients and providing them with a range of simple, transparent financial products that meet their needs."
There are also concerns that British banks may be overexposed to certain sectors of the economy, such as the property market, which could leave them vulnerable to a sudden downturn or recession.
"The recent surge in property prices has led to a significant increase in mortgage lending by banks, which may leave them exposed if there is a sudden fall in the housing market," said Kaminska.
"Similarly, banks that have invested heavily in fossil fuel companies may also be at risk, as the transition to cleaner energy sources gathers pace."
To address these concerns, some experts are calling for greater regulation of the banking sector, particularly with regard to the use of complex derivatives.
"Regulators need to be more proactive in monitoring the activities of banks and ensuring that they are not taking excessive risks with the money entrusted to them by their clients," said Black.
"There should also be greater transparency in the way that banks value and report their derivative holdings, to enable investors to make informed decisions about the risks involved."
The debate over investment banking strategies is likely to continue for some time, as banks grapple with the challenge of generating higher returns in an increasingly competitive financial landscape.
However, with concerns over the stability of the banking sector still fresh in the public's mind following the 2008 financial crisis, there is growing pressure on banks to adopt a more cautious approach to their investments, and to promote greater transparency and accountability in their operations.
As Kaminska puts it, "The banking sector needs to regain the trust of its clients and the wider public. This can only be achieved by ensuring that banks are operating in a safe, transparent and responsible manner that reflects the needs of their clients and the wider economy."
