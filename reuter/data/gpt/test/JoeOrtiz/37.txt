ABN AMRO, the Dutch banking giant, is in advanced discussions to acquire Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management (CCM), the London-based stockbroker and fund manager.
If the deal goes through, it would mark ABN AMRO's first major acquisition since it was nationalized during the financial crisis in 2008. The deal will also help ABN AMRO expand its business in the UK, where it already has a significant presence.
The talks have been ongoing for several weeks, according to people close to the deal, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private. While they cautioned that a deal is not yet certain, they added that the two sides have been discussing potential terms.
ABN AMRO is looking to add CCM's significant investment expertise to its existing platform. CCM, founded in 2002, manages money for private clients, charities, and institutional investors. The firm has a strong track record in UK equity investment and has a discretionary fund management service that manages assets in excess of Â£1 billion.
ABN AMRO, which operates in over 20 countries, has been looking to expand its wealth and asset management businesses. The acquisition of CCM would signal a strategic move by the bank to bolster its existing platform and expand its investment capabilities in the UK.
Neither ABN AMRO nor CCM has commented on the potential deal, but sources say that the two sides are eager to complete it as soon as possible.
If the acquisition goes ahead, it would be the latest in a series of consolidation moves in the asset management industry. Earlier this year, Brookfield Asset Management agreed to buy a 60% stake in Oaktree Capital Management in a deal that valued the investment firm at $4.8 billion.
The move also comes as the financial sector is undergoing significant change, including the rise of exchange-traded funds and robo-advisory services. The acquisition of CCM would allow ABN AMRO to stay competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace and offer new services to its customers.
The deal is still subject to regulatory approval and may take several months to complete, but if successful, it will strengthen ABN AMRO's position in the UK and position the bank for long-term growth.
