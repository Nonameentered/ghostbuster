London, UK- NatWest's CEO Derek Wanless has expressed his intention to continue with the share repurchase program, given the bank's surplus capital. The news comes amid increasing concerns of a sluggish economic recovery, and a growing demand for companies to invest in their businesses to support growth.
NatWest had already announced a five-year dividend plan worth £3.5 billion, but it seems that further share buybacks could be on the horizon. Mr. Wanless has stated that the bank remains committed to maximising shareholder returns, which could mean more share repurchases.
Speaking to the press, Mr. Wanless said, "We'll certainly continue with the dividend as we've indicated, and beyond that, we've said we'll look to return any surplus capital. We'll look to optimise the use of surplus capital depending on the environment that we find ourselves in. It could be through buybacks, it could be through additional dividends, but we'll be guided by the economic environment that we find ourselves in."
The banking sector in the UK has been impacted heavily by the coronavirus pandemic and continues to face a volatile market. As a result, NatWest has continually been cautious in its approach, building strong capital buffers to ensure a sense of stability for the business.
Despite this, the bank's recent announcement has sparked controversy among experts. Many have criticised the decision to return cash to shareholders, arguing that it could harm the bank's long-term prospects as it attempts to navigate the ongoing economic uncertainty.
Commenting on Mr. Wanless' announcement, Jim Armitage, the City editor at the Evening Standard, stated that "NatWest has not yet completed the painful job of dealing with its non-performing loans, a legacy of the Covid-19 crisis. Only once that's done, and the fallout from Brexit is known, should it be considering how much capital it can return to shareholders."
The bank's recent performance has been mixed, with a drop in profits for the first three months of 2021 as the bank set aside more money than expected to cover potential loan losses. The bank's net income for the first quarter came in at £620 million.
Furthermore, NatWest remains one of the UK's biggest lenders to small and medium-sized businesses, which have been some of the hardest hit by the pandemic. Therefore, some argue that any surplus cash should be invested in supporting the recovery of these businesses rather than returned to shareholders.
However, Mr. Wanless argued that the bank has already taken steps to support SMEs. He noted that the bank had issued £5.5 billion of government-backed loans, and a further £1.5 billion in non-government-backed loans to SMEs hit by the pandemic.
Despite the criticisms, NatWest's decision to return surplus capital to shareholders is not unique. Many companies in the UK have been doing the same as the economy recovers. However, the approach has its fair share of critics. Following the announcement, analysts expressed concern that prioritising shareholder returns above investment in the business might not be the best strategy, given the current economic uncertainty.
In conclusion, NatWest's CEO Derek Wanless has announced a possible continuation of share repurchases, citing the bank's surplus capital. However, the decision has sparked controversy, with many arguing that the bank should invest in businesses affected by the pandemic, rather than prioritising shareholder returns. Regardless, it appears that NatWest remains committed to supporting long-term growth and returning shareholder value in a continually changing business landscape.
