London-based financial services provider, Legal & General, announced on Wednesday that it has exceeded market expectations and raised its dividends for shareholders, despite potential fallout from investment management issues at Morgan Grenfell.
The company witnessed a 10% increase in profits to £2.1bn ($2.75bn) in 2019, surpassing analyst estimates. This remarkable growth was driven by its pension-risk transfer business, real assets unit and personal insurance operations, ultimately placing Legal & General at a higher level of profitability than other leading financial players in the UK market.
Although the profitable outcome is cause for celebration, the company’s investment management arm, LGIM, could still face repercussions given the fluctuation of unit values during 2019. In particular, LGIM’s exposure to significant investments in infrastructure and property assets raised eyebrows amidst market concerns of a potential downturn.
Yet, despite this uncertainty, Legal & General has continued to sustain itself and even raise dividends for its shareholders by 7% to 18.64 pence per share, a remarkable achievement for a company in the face of industry-wide, and indeed, global challenges.
Nigel Wilson, the CEO of Legal & General, commented: “Legal & General delivered a strong operating performance in 2019, demonstrating both our resilience and our ability to successfully execute on our long-term growth plans.”
He further explained that “we continue to navigate through an uncertain economic and political environment and anticipate that the disruptive forces of technology and social change, alongside demographic and environmental pressures, will continue to drive structural growth opportunities.”
Despite market disruption, the company’s pension schemes and wealth management businesses have witnessed growth, with the former accounting for £11.3bn in long-term deals, especially in the US market which has become an increasingly important presence for Legal & General.
Wilson added that the company’s response to the economic landscape has been robust: “In an environment where the world’s financial markets are being buffeted by shifting macro trends, amplified by technological change and global political uncertainty, we continue to demonstrate the ability to adapt and grow.”
While it remains to be seen how LGIM may be affected in the long run, the broader performance of the company has been positive and has created a sense of confidence amid a tumultuous backdrop. Indeed, in the face of Brexit, political instability and a worldwide pandemic, Legal & General has managed to steadily move forward, a testament to the effectiveness of its business strategy.
The company has announced plans to continue its investment in technology, including its digital customer-engagement processes and the implementation of blockchain and artificial intelligence into its businesses, which could contribute to their growth and compete in an increasingly digitalised market.
Legal & General remains one to watch as it continues to maintain its strong position, despite potential struggles in the UK industry and on a global scale, and welcomes further opportunities for growth and innovation.
