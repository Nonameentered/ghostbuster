Capel-Cure Myer Capital Management, a leading investment management firm, is reportedly in talks with ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, a prominent European investment bank, over a potential acquisition deal. According to sources familiar with the matter, the talks are still in the preliminary stages and negotiations are ongoing.
Capel-Cure Myer Capital Management, which has over $6 billion in assets under management, specializes in offering investment solutions to institutional clients such as pension funds, insurance companies, and endowments. The firm is headquartered in London and has offices in several other countries, including the United States and Hong Kong.
ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, on the other hand, is a subsidiary of ABN AMRO Bank and is one of the largest investment banks in Europe. The bank provides a range of services to institutional clients such as corporate finance, securities trading, and asset management. The bank has a strong presence in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
While the exact terms of the potential deal are not yet known, industry experts have speculated that Capel-Cure Myer Capital Management could be seeking to acquire ABN AMRO Hoare Govett's asset management business. This move would help the investment management firm to expand its capabilities and reach in the European market.
Neither Capel-Cure Myer Capital Management nor ABN AMRO Hoare Govett have commented on the reports of the potential acquisition deal. However, sources have suggested that the two parties are keen to finalize the deal before the end of the year.
If the acquisition deal goes ahead, it will be the latest in a series of mergers and acquisitions that have taken place within the investment management industry over the past few years. The industry has been undergoing significant consolidation as firms seek to expand their capabilities and reach in an increasingly competitive market.
