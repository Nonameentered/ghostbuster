Barclays' investment arm, BZW, has been hit with a sanction by the takeover watchdog over its conduct in defending the bid for Northern Electric. The investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that BZW had breached the code of conduct during the takeover bid by Northern Electric in 1995.
BZW was charged with "misbehaviour" in the Northern Electric bid, which was ultimately unsuccessful. The CMA said that BZW did not act in a fair and reasonable manner in some of its dealings with Northern Electric's shareholders and employees.
The watchdog found that BZW had made misleading and inaccurate statements to Northern Electric shareholders, which were designed to undermine the credibility of the Northern Electric board and management. The statement had a material effect on the shareholders' decision-making process, which was a breach of the Code.
BZW also conducted itself in a way that was contrary to the principles of good public relations by engaging in activities which the CMA described as "sharp practice". In particular, BZW had undertaken a "ringing around" operation to try and persuade influential shareholders to support its bid.
As a result, the CMA has imposed a sanction on BZW which includes a requirement that the company cease and desist its activities in relation to Northern Electric shareholders and employees. Additionally, the CMA has asked for a review of the way that BZW operates in relation to its role in takeovers.
The sanction is a significant blow to Barclays, which has been seeking to rebuild its reputation following the financial crisis. The bank is already dealing with a number of investigations and regulatory issues in relation to various areas of its operations.
Barclays is said to be disappointed with the CMA's decision and has indicated that it is considering its options. The bank has previously stated that it believes that it acted in a "professional and responsible" manner during the takeover bid.
The CMA's action against BZW is part of an ongoing effort by the regulatory authorities to ensure that takeovers are conducted in a fair and transparent manner. The watchdog is also reviewing the takeover of Sky by 21st Century Fox, which is an important test case for the future regulation of the media industry.
The Northern Electric sanction is a reminder that even years after the event, regulators are willing to investigate and punish misconduct in financial transactions. It also serves as a warning to other banks and financial institutions that the regulatory authorities continue to scrutinise even the smallest details of their activities.
In conclusion, the sanction imposed on BZW by the CMA is a significant setback for Barclays, which has been trying to restore its reputation following the financial crisis. The bank has indicated that it will consider its options, but it is clear that the regulatory environment surrounding takeovers is becoming much tougher. Banks and other financial institutions will need to be extremely careful in their conduct if they are to avoid regulatory scrutiny.
