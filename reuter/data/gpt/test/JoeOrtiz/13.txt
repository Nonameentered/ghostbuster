NatWest Group, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland, has recently reported a 25% jump in its operating profits for the first half of 2021, but has warned of an economic slowdown and has disappointed the market with no plans for a share repurchase scheme.
Despite the positive news of increased profits, the bank has refrained from following other major banks in carrying out a share buyback program. This has led to a dip in the company's shares by 3.5%.
NatWest reported an operating profit of £2.5 billion ($3.5 billion) for the first half of the year, compared to £2 billion ($2.8 billion) in the same period a year earlier. The bank has attributed the surge in profits to stronger-than-expected economic recovery in the UK, leading to an improved performance of the bank's retail and commercial banking businesses.
However, NatWest has also cautioned that the economic outlook remains uncertain and that there may be a slowdown ahead. The bank has pointed to the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, COVID-19 variants, and the end of government stimulus schemes as factors that could impact economic growth.
One area of concern for the bank is the number of customers who have requested payment holidays on their loans, mortgages and credit card debts during the pandemic. NatWest has warned that if these payment holidays end without the likelihood of customers being able to repay their debts, the bank may have to take provisions against bad debts in the coming months.
Despite the positive results of the bank, it has disappointed investors by not announcing a share repurchase scheme. Earlier this year, Barclays, Lloyds and HSBC have all announced share buyback programs, with Lloyds announcing a £750 million ($1 billion) program.
The lack of a share repurchase scheme from NatWest has led to the company's shares declining by 3.5%. This has been disappointing for investors who were hoping for a share buyback program, which would have increased the value of their shares.
Speaking about the bank's decision, Alison Rose, the CEO of NatWest, said that the bank's priority was to support its customers during this difficult time. She said that the bank had been focused on lending money to customers who needed it, and had extended £15 billion ($20.8 billion) in government-backed loans to help businesses during the pandemic.
Rose said: "Our focus has been very much on providing our customers with the help they need during the pandemic. We're also working hard to transform our bank, investing in technology and innovation to provide better, more efficient services to our customers. We remain committed to creating value for our shareholders, and will continue to explore opportunities to do so in a sustainable way."
Despite the lack of a share repurchase program, analysts are still positive about the performance of NatWest. The bank has made progress towards the goals it set out in its strategic plan, which includes reducing its cost base and investing in technology. In addition, the bank has a strong balance sheet, with a CET1 ratio of 18.2%, which indicates that the bank has adequate capital to withstand any potential economic turbulence.
Overall, NatWest has reported impressive operating profits for the first half of 2021, and has made progress in achieving its strategic goals. However, the bank has also warned that the economic outlook remains uncertain, and that it may face challenges in the months to come. While the lack of a share repurchase program has disappointed some investors, the bank remains committed to creating long-term value for shareholders.
