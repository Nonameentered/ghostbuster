Barclays CEO Jes Staley has defended the bank's decision to invest in its investment banking subsidiary BZW, despite a sharp drop in profits.
Staley said that the investment in BZW was part of the bank's long-term strategy to diversify its business and reduce its reliance on traditional banking.
"We believe that BZW is an important part of our strategy going forward," he said. "It allows us to offer a wide range of financial services to our clients, including investment banking, capital markets, and wealth management."
However, the CEO admitted that the investment had not yet paid off, with BZW reporting a 45% drop in profits in the first quarter of this year.
"This is clearly a disappointing result, and we are taking steps to address this," he said. "But we remain confident that BZW will deliver strong results over the long term."
Staley also addressed concerns that the bank's investment in BZW had come at the expense of its traditional banking business, which saw profits rise by just 3% in Q1.
"We are committed to both businesses, and we believe that they complement each other," he said. "We are confident that we can continue to grow both businesses while maintaining a strong balance sheet."
Despite the profit slump, Barclays' share price remained relatively stable, with analysts praising the bank's commitment to diversification and its ability to weather the current economic uncertainty.
"This is a challenging time for banks, but Barclays has shown that it can adapt and thrive," said analyst David Jones. "Investing in BZW may not pay off immediately, but in the long term, it could be a smart move that sets the bank up for sustained growth."
