Woolwich Building Society is facing tough decisions ahead of its stock market debut due to draft legislation that could affect its profitability. The 160-year-old institution, which recently announced plans to demutualize, is expected to list on the London Stock Exchange in the coming months. However, the proposed Consumer Protection Bill could force Woolwich to change its lending practices, putting pressure on its bottom line. The building society's management team is currently weighing its options and is expected to provide updates on the situation in the near future.
