HSBC Holdings has reported a 23% increase in profits for 2021, driven by lower loan loss provisions and increased customer activity in Asia. However, the bank also warned of a challenging year ahead due to uncertain economic conditions and ongoing regulatory pressures.
The bank's pre-tax profit for the year to December 31st, 2021, rose to $17.2bn from $14bn the previous year. The results exceeded analysts' expectations, with the bank's shares rising by 1% in early trading on 22nd February.
HSBC said that its performance was boosted by a sharp decline in loan loss provisions, which fell by more than half to $3.4bn in 2021. This was due to the improving economic conditions in many of the markets where the bank operates, as well as lower credit-risk charges in its global banking and markets division.
The bank also reported strong growth in its retail banking and wealth management division, which saw a 14% increase in pre-tax profits to $6.9bn. This was driven by increased activity among its affluent Asian clients, who were attracted by the bank's improved digital offerings and its focus on sustainable investing.
In addition, HSBC reported that its global banking and markets division saw a 31% increase in pre-tax profits to $9.1bn. This was due to higher trading revenues and increased business from corporate clients, particularly in Asia.
Despite the positive results, HSBC warned that it faced significant challenges in the year ahead, including rising inflation, uncertain economic conditions, and continuing regulatory pressures. The bank is currently under investigation by regulators in the US and the UK over allegations that it failed to prevent money laundering.
In a statement, HSBC's CEO, Noel Quinn, said: "Whilst we delivered a strong set of results in 2021, we do not take our success for granted. We remain keenly aware of significant headwinds that we face in the year ahead, including the ongoing pandemic, heightened inflation, and ongoing regulatory scrutiny."
Quinn added that the bank would continue to focus on its strategy of shifting its focus to Asia and investing in its digital capabilities. He said that the bank had made good progress in these areas and would continue to do so.
HSBC's announcement comes as other major banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, have also reported strong profits for 2021, despite the ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. However, analysts have warned that banks may face headwinds this year as inflation and regulatory pressures continue to mount.
