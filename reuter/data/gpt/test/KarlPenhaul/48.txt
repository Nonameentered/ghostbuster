Colombia's Interior Minister, Nancy Patricia Gutierrez, has resigned from her position in the government to prepare her bid for presidency in the country's 2022 elections. Gutierrez announced her resignation on Monday, saying that it's time for her to take a step forward in her political career. She has served as the Interior Minister for two years under President Ivan Duque.
Gutierrez is a seasoned politician, with more than 30 years of experience in both the public and private sectors. Before joining Duque's cabinet, she served as a senator for the Liberal Party from 1998 to 2002, and then served again from 2014 to 2018 as a member of the ruling Democratic Centre party. She also served as the mayor of her hometown, Zipaquira, from 2004 to 2007.
Her resignation comes at a time when the country is facing a range of challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing protests against police brutality and economic struggles. With the upcoming presidential campaign, Gutierrez aims to address these issues and provide solutions to the people of Colombia.
"I believe that I can contribute more to the country and its people in a different way, and that is why I have taken the difficult decision to resign from my position as Interior Minister," Gutierrez said at a press conference on Monday. "I will be putting all my energy and experience into my candidacy for the presidency of Colombia."
Gutierrez is seen as a strong candidate for the presidency, with a record of working towards unity and progress in the country. She is known for her work in promoting education, supporting rural development, and enhancing the participation of women in politics. She has also been a vocal supporter of the peace process between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
Many Colombians are looking forward to Gutierrez's campaign, seeing it as an opportunity for positive change in the country. However, she will be facing tough competition from other candidates, including Gustavo Petro, a former mayor of Bogota and left-wing populist, and Sergio Fajardo, a former governor of Antioquia and centrist politician.
Gutierrez's resignation has been met with mixed reactions from other politicians. Some have praised her for her work as Interior Minister and wish her all the best in her candidacy. Others have criticized her for leaving her position at a time when the country is in need of strong leadership.
President Duque expressed his support for Gutierrez's decision, saying that he respects her choice to run for the presidency and wishing her success in the campaign. He also announced that he has appointed Daniel Palacios as the new Interior Minister. Palacios is a member of the Democratic Centre party and has previously served as a Congressman.
The coming months will be crucial for Gutierrez and her campaign team as they work towards securing the votes of the Colombian people. It remains to be seen who will emerge as the country's next president, but one thing is certain â€“ the election will be a pivotal moment for Colombia's future.
