In recent weeks, Colombia's oldest guerrilla army, the National Liberation Army (ELN), has resurged and shown its strength with a series of deadly attacks across the country. The ELN has been fighting the Colombian government for over five decades, and despite a long-standing peace process, it seems as though hostilities are on the rise once again. The ELN has been accused of drug trafficking, kidnapping, and extortion, and while the group was responsible for numerous attacks in the past, its current actions demonstrate that it remains a potent threat to Colombia's stability.
The latest wave of violence has been concentrated in the country's central and northern regions, where ELN fighters have been clashing with government forces in fierce, prolonged battles. The military has sent in special forces and additional troops to counter the ELN, but the guerrilla army has shown itself to be adaptive and resourceful. In some cases, the ELN has relied on ambushes and hit-and-run tactics, while in other instances, it has laid siege to military bases and launched full-frontal assaults.
The most high-profile attack occurred in late July when the ELN targeted the city of Arauca, where it carried out a car bomb attack that killed at least 17 people. The ELN claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said was aimed at a local police station. The blast leveled nearby buildings and sent a strong message to the government that the ELN is willing to go to great lengths to achieve its goals.
The Colombian military has been struggling to adapt to the new tactics employed by the ELN. While the military has historically been well-prepared to fight against the insurgents, the guerrilla army has evolved over the years, and its fighters have become more skilled and sophisticated. The military's attempts to engage the ELN have been met with fierce resistance, with the rebels using surprise attacks and booby traps to inflict heavy losses on government forces.
One of the main issues the military is facing is a lack of intelligence on the ELN's movements and tactics. The guerrilla army has been able to operate in remote areas and use local populations for cover, making it difficult for the military to get a handle on the situation. Additionally, the ELN has reportedly been able to purchase modern weapons on the black market, giving it an edge in firepower over the military.
The Colombian government has expressed concern over the ELN's resurgence, warning that it could derail the peace process. Peace talks between the government and the ELN have been ongoing since 2017, but progress has been slow, with both sides struggling to reach a consensus on key issues. President Ivan Duque has called for increased military pressure on the ELN, but critics say that this approach will only lead to more violence.
Some experts believe that the ELN's resurgence is partially due to the government's failure to follow through on its commitments. The ELN has accused the government of reneging on its promises and failing to address the root causes of the conflict, which include socioeconomic inequality, political corruption, and drug trafficking. Some analysts say that the government needs to do more to address these issues if it wants to bring a lasting peace to Colombia.
The ELN has also been taking advantage of the power vacuum created by the demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), another guerrilla army that signed a peace agreement with the government in 2016. With the FARC largely out of the picture, the ELN has been able to expand its operations and exert more influence in the areas where it operates.
Despite the challenges, there is still hope for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. There have been calls for renewed dialogue between the government and the ELN, with some groups advocating for a multilateral approach that includes civil society and other stakeholders. The UN has also called for a humanitarian ceasefire, citing the impact that the violence is having on civilians in the affected areas.
The crisis in Colombia highlights the complex nature of the country's ongoing conflict and the challenges faced by the military in combating entrenched insurgent groups. While the ELN may be one of the oldest guerrilla armies in the world, it continues to demonstrate its resilience and adaptability, showing that the fight for peace in Colombia is far from over.
