The Colombian government has been overturned in a landmark ruling by the Constitutional Court on the country's economic emergency measures.
The Court declared that the government had overstepped its constitutional powers by introducing a package of measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. These measures included allowing the government to bypass Congress and make unilateral decisions on spending, taxation, and borrowing.
The ruling, which was issued on Friday, has sent shockwaves through the political establishment in Colombia. It is seen as a major blow to President Ivan Duque, who has been struggling to keep the country's economy afloat amid a surge in COVID-19 cases and a slump in oil prices.
In a statement, the Constitutional Court said that the government's emergency measures were a "clear violation of the constitution" and that they represented a "serious threat" to the country's democratic institutions.
"The government has been acting outside its constitutional powers and has undermined the principle of checks and balances," the Court said. "This ruling serves as a reminder that in times of crisis, it is more important than ever to uphold the rule of law and protect the rights of citizens."
The government has responded to the ruling by saying that it will abide by the Court's decision and work with Congress to pass new legislation that complies with the constitution. However, critics of the government say that the ruling highlights a deeper problem with Colombia's political system.
"The fact that this case even had to go to the Constitutional Court is a sign that there are serious flaws in our democracy," said Claudia Lopez, the mayor of Bogota. "We need to have a more robust system of checks and balances to ensure that the government is held accountable to the people."
The ruling comes at a time when Colombia is facing a mounting economic crisis. The country's economy is expected to contract by more than 5% this year, and unemployment has risen to over 20% in some areas.
The government's emergency measures were designed to provide relief to businesses and individuals affected by the pandemic, but critics say that they were too broad and lacked adequate oversight. Some have accused the government of using the pandemic as an excuse to push through unpopular policies that would not have been possible under normal circumstances.
The ruling is likely to have a significant impact on the government's ability to respond to the economic crisis. Without the emergency measures, the government will have to rely on Congress to pass new legislation, which could be a slow and difficult process in the current political climate.
Despite the challenges, many in Colombia see the ruling as a positive step towards strengthening the country's democracy and ensuring that the government is held accountable to the people.
"We cannot allow the government to undermine the constitution and violate our democratic institutions," said Juan Manuel Santos, the former president of Colombia. "This ruling is a victory for the rule of law and for the people of Colombia."
