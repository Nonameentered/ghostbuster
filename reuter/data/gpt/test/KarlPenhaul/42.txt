The former justice minister of Colombia, Rodrigo Uprimny, has accused the government of using the lifting of the extradition ban as a smokescreen to cover up other issues. Speaking in an interview with CNN, the former minister said that the government was trying to distract people from the ongoing protests and the human rights violations that have been occurring in the country.
The Colombian government lifted the extradition ban last week, which had been in place since 2018. The ban had prevented the extradition of Colombian citizens accused of crimes to other countries, including the United States. The move has been welcomed by the United States, which has been seeking the extradition of several Colombian citizens, including former rebels who are accused of drug trafficking.
However, Uprimny has warned that the lifting of the ban could have serious consequences for human rights in Colombia. He believes that the government is trying to send a message to the protesters that it is willing to crack down on dissent, rather than address their grievances.
The ongoing protests in Colombia began in late April over the government's proposed tax reforms. The reforms were aimed at increasing taxes on low and middle-income families, while reducing taxes for wealthy individuals and corporations. The protests quickly grew and became focused on a range of issues, including police brutality, corruption, and inequality.
Uprimny believes that the government's response to the protests has been heavy-handed, with the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and other forms of crowd control. He has called on the government to address the root causes of the protests, rather than resorting to violence.
The former minister has also accused the government of failing to address the issue of human rights violations in the country. He points to a recent report by the United Nations, which found that the Colombian government was responsible for a significant increase in human rights violations last year.
Uprimny believes that the lifting of the extradition ban is a distraction from these pressing issues, and that the government should focus on addressing the concerns of the protesters. He believes that the government should engage in dialogue with the protesters and address their grievances, rather than using force to suppress them.
The issue of human rights violations and the government's response to the protests has gained international attention. The United States has expressed concern over the situation in Colombia, and several members of Congress have called for the suspension of U.S. aid to the country.
Uprimny believes that it is important for the international community to pay attention to what is happening in Colombia. He believes that the government's actions could have serious consequences for democracy and human rights in the country.
In conclusion, the lifting of the extradition ban in Colombia has been controversial, with many accusing the government of using it as a distraction from other pressing issues. The former justice minister has warned that the government's response to the ongoing protests has been heavy-handed, and has called on the government to address the root causes of the protests. It remains to be seen whether the government will listen to these calls and engage in dialogue with the protesters.
