BOGOT√Å, COLOMBIA - The release of 70 captured troops by the National Liberation Army (ELN) on Monday has sparked hopes for peace, but also fears of a full-blown conflict in Colombia.
The ELN, which is Colombia's last remaining guerrilla army, is believed to have kidnapped the soldiers in August and September during skirmishes in the northeastern department of Arauca. In an announcement on Monday, the group said it would release the troops as a gesture of goodwill in response to a call for a unilateral ceasefire by the United Nations.
The move has been welcomed by the Colombian government, which described it as "a significant advance" in the peace process. The ELN has been in talks with the government since 2017, but progress has been slow and marred by a series of setbacks, including the group's refusal to release hostages and attacks on civilians.
The release of the soldiers comes at a critical moment for the ELN and the peace process as a whole. The group has been weakened by a series of military operations by the Colombian army, which has targeted its leadership and infrastructure. However, it still has several thousand fighters and retains the ability to launch attacks on military and civilian targets.
Analysts say the release of the 70 troops could signal the end of Latin America's longest guerrilla insurgency, which has plagued Colombia since the 1960s. However, it could also lead to an all-out war if the ELN decides to abandon the peace process and return to full-scale conflict.
"The release of the soldiers is a positive development, but it is still too early to say whether it will lead to a lasting peace," said Ana Maria Rodriguez, a Colombian security analyst. "The ELN is under significant pressure from the Colombian army, but it still has the capability to launch attacks. If it decides to go back to war, it could be a bloody and protracted conflict."
The release of the soldiers was also welcomed by the United Nations, which has been pushing for a ceasefire between the ELN and the Colombian government. In a statement, the UN called on both sides to "redouble their efforts to achieve a lasting peace."
"The release of the soldiers is a positive step towards building trust between the parties and creating the conditions for a sustainable peace," the statement said. "We urge the ELN and the government to continue their dialogue and work towards a comprehensive peace agreement."
The ELN's decision to release the soldiers has also been seen as a political victory for President Ivan Duque, who has been criticized for his handling of the peace process. Duque, who took office in 2018, has taken a hardline stance towards the guerrilla group, insisting that it must end its criminal activities before any peace talks can take place.
However, Duque has faced criticism from opposition parties and civil society groups, who accuse him of being too focused on military solutions and not doing enough to promote dialogue and reconciliation.
In a statement on Monday, Duque praised the release of the soldiers as "an act of humanity and commitment to peace". He also reiterated his commitment to "a peace without impunity, based on truth, justice, reparation, and non-repetition".
The release of the soldiers has also raised hopes for the release of other hostages held by the ELN, including several Colombian politicians and foreign nationals. The group has demanded the release of some of its own fighters in exchange for the hostages, a demand that has been rejected by the government.
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the peace process, many Colombians remain optimistic about the future. "We have suffered too much from the conflict," said Maria Gomez, a retired teacher. "It's time to put it behind us and move forward as a country. I hope this is the beginning of the end of the violence."
