Colombia – Thousands of government workers across Colombia went on strike on Tuesday to demand better wages and benefits, causing disruptions in various sectors across the country.
The nationwide protest, which was organized by the National Union of State Workers (SINEC), saw employees participating from different government agencies and ministries.
The workers claim that their current pay doesn't keep up with inflation, leaving many of them struggling to make ends meet and pay for basic necessities.
"We want our salaries to be fair and updated according to inflation, so that we don't have to consistently worry about meeting our financial obligations," said a spokesperson for SINEC.
Many public parks and services across the country were forced to close down as a result of the strike. Schools were also affected with reduced staff and services, while hospitals faced significant staffing shortages.
SINEC stated that the strike would be indefinite and would continue until the government addressed their demands and presented adequate solutions.
"We are calling on the government to negotiate with us and find a solution that is equitable for all government workers," added the spokesperson.
The Colombian government has since responded to the call for negotiations and promised to hold talks with SINEC representatives.
Minister of Labor, Ángel Custodio Cabrera, confirmed that the government would seek to find a resolution that benefits both employees and the state.
"The government aims to reach an agreement with SINEC that focuses on sustainable development, the interests of Colombians and the improvement of public services," said Cabrera.
However, not all Colombians support the strike as some believe it is merely an inconvenience. One citizen stated that the government workers should be grateful for their jobs and that they are "lucky" to even have employment during these difficult times.
Nevertheless, this is not the first time Colombian government employees have protested for improved working conditions. In 2019, public school teachers went on strike in multiple cities after the government failed to reach an agreement on salary increases.
The situation is made more critical by the country's current economic recession and high levels of unemployment. According to a recently published OECD report, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unemployment in Colombia to rise by 5.4 percentage points to 19.8%.
The report also reveals that Colombians' incomes have decreased significantly, with those in the bottom 40% of the income distribution being the most affected. This makes it increasingly challenging for government workers to make ends meet, which is the driving force behind their calls for better wages and benefits.
The strike is a significant test for the government of President Ivan Duque, who has already received widespread criticism for his handling of social unrest and diplomacy.
Given the current economic situation, both the workers and the government will need to compromise and find solutions that address their respective concerns. Failure to do so could lead to further instability and social unrest across Colombia.
