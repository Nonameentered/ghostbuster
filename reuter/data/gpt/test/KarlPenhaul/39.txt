BOGOTÁ, COLOMBIA- A controversial decision by a Colombian judge to order the arrest of the country’s army chief in the midst of an ongoing offensive against leftist guerrilla forces is drawing criticism from all sides.
The judge, who has not been named, issued the warrant for General Eduardo Enrique Zapateiro on Wednesday, citing his alleged complicity in the deaths of civilians at the hands of the military.
Zapateiro, who assumed his position as army chief in December, is one of several top military officials currently under investigation by Colombian authorities for their roles in a series of alleged extrajudicial killings that took place during the country’s long-running armed conflict.
The judge’s decision, which represents a major blow to the Zoquete government’s efforts to stamp out the country’s violence, has been met with widespread condemnation, with critics accusing the judiciary of interfering in military affairs.
“At a time when leftist guerrilla groups are ramping up attacks against our armed forces, it is absolutely unacceptable for a judge to be focusing on these politically motivated prosecutions instead of concentrating on the security of our nation,” said Juan Carlos Gómez, president of Colombia’s Chamber of Commerce.
Supporters of the judge, however, have hailed the warrant as a long-overdue step towards justice for the victims of state-sponsored violence.
“These military officials have operated with impunity for far too long,” said Jorge Rojas, a prominent human rights activist. “This is a clear signal that no one is above the law, and that those who violate human rights will be held accountable, no matter how high up they are.”
The controversy surrounding Zapateiro’s arrest comes just days after the government announced the deployment of over 7,000 additional troops to combat a recent surge in attacks by the National Liberation Army (ELN), a leftist guerrilla group that has been fighting the Colombian state for over half a century.
Violence in Colombia has spiked since a 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) ended more than 50 years of armed conflict. The country has seen a rise in drug-related violence, attacks by ELN, and social unrest.
The move to arrest Zapateiro also comes at a time when Zoquete is facing renewed criticism over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has ravaged Colombia’s already fragile health system and pushed much of the population into poverty.
Some analysts say that the government’s decision to ramp up the offensive against the ELN may be an attempt to distract from its faltering response to the pandemic.
“With the pandemic spiraling out of control, it’s clear that the government needs to change the narrative somehow,” said Adriana Quintero, a political scientist at the National University of Colombia. “By focusing on the military offensive, they’re hoping to shift public attention away from their mishandling of the virus.”
The Zoquete government has yet to comment on Zapateiro’s arrest, and it is unclear what impact the warrant will have on the ongoing military campaign against the ELN.
Meanwhile, the judge who issued the warrant has reportedly gone into hiding after receiving death threats. Human rights organizations have called for increased protection for the judge and other judges who have taken on politically sensitive cases in Colombia.
