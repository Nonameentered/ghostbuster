The Colombian Senate has approved a bill that will partially lift the decades-long ban on extradition. The controversial move comes as part of President Ivan Duque's efforts to strengthen the country's justice system and combat drug trafficking.
The bill, which was passed by 69 votes in favor and 15 against, will allow the extradition of Colombians who are accused of drug trafficking, money laundering, and other related crimes, as long as they have not committed crimes against humanity or political offenses.
The lifting of the ban has been a contentious issue in Colombia for many years. The country's constitution prohibits the extradition of its citizens to foreign countries, but exceptions have been made in cases involving drug trafficking and terrorism.
Supporters of the bill argue that it will help Colombia combat drug trafficking and strengthen its justice system. "This is a historic step for Colombia in the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime," said Senator Paloma Valencia, one of the bill's supporters. "We cannot continue to allow these criminals to operate with impunity."
However, opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to the extradition of innocent Colombians who are caught up in the country's drug trade. "This bill is a violation of the rights of Colombians and could lead to the extradition of innocent people," said Senator Ivan Cepeda, one of the bill's opponents.
The debate over the lifting of the extradition ban has been ongoing for many years, and it has been a sensitive issue for many Colombians. The country has a long history of political violence, and many fear that the lifting of the extradition ban could lead to the persecution of political opponents.
President Duque has been a strong advocate for the lifting of the ban, arguing that it is necessary to combat the country's drug trade and strengthen its justice system. He has also promised to ensure that the rights of Colombians are protected, and that the lifting of the ban will not be used to persecute political opponents.
Despite the controversy surrounding the bill, its passage marks a major milestone for Colombia's justice system. The country has long been plagued by drug trafficking and organized crime, and the lifting of the extradition ban is seen as a critical step in the fight against these issues.
In addition to the extradition ban, the bill also includes measures to strengthen the country's justice system, including the creation of a new court to handle cases related to drug trafficking and organized crime.
The bill will now move to the Colombian House of Representatives for consideration. If it is passed, it will be sent to President Duque for final approval.
Overall, the passage of the bill is seen as a critical step in Colombia's efforts to combat drug trafficking and strengthen its justice system. While there are still concerns about the potential impact of the lifting of the ban, its supporters argue that it is necessary to ensure that those who commit crimes are held accountable, regardless of their nationality.
