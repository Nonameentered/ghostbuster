Bogotá, Colombia – After four days of fierce fighting in the rural region of Cauca, leftist guerrilla fighters have managed to flee the grasp of government troops, leaving behind a trail of destruction and dozens of casualties.
Launching a surprise attack on military posts and nearby towns, over 300 members of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, unleashed a wave of violence on the region. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the guerrillas managed to hold the military forces at bay for several days.
During the conflict, regional authorities reported that dozens of civilians were caught in the crossfire, with many forced to flee their homes in search of safety. Reports state that at least 30 people have been killed, including 18 military personnel and several civilians.
The government's initial response to the attack was swift, with President Ivan Duque ordering the deployment of additional troops to the region. However, critics argue that the government's approach has been ineffective in the long-term, as guerrilla groups like ELN are deeply rooted in the region and have continued to operate for many decades.
With their stronghold still secure, the ELN has reportedly gone underground, hiding out in the dense forested areas that surround the region. The group has not yet claimed responsibility for the attack but has been known to use similar tactics in the past.
The ELN's presence in Colombia has long been a thorn in the side of the government, with their involvement in drug trafficking and other criminal activities leading to increased unrest in the region. Despite decades of attempts to stamp out the group, they have continued to operate and even managed to secure a spot at the negotiating table in peace talks back in 2017.
Meanwhile, local residents and activists are calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, arguing that the violence is only causing more pain and suffering for the people of the region.
"This isn't just about the ELN or the military," said Rosa Gutierrez, a local activist. "This conflict has been going on for years, and it is innocent civilians who are paying the price. We need a dialogue, not more violence."
For now, it remains unclear what the next steps will be in the fight against the ELN. With the guerrillas still at large and the region on edge, tensions are high, and the future remains uncertain.
