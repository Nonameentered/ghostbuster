Colombia's government has approved tougher anti-drug penalties, in a move aimed at pleasing the United States. The new measures will see increased punishments handed out to drug traffickers, as well as harsher consequences for those caught using drugs.
President Ivan Duque unveiled the law, which he said would combat the "scourge of drug trafficking" that has plagued Colombia for decades. The law is part of Duque's wider strategy to reduce the production and smuggling of cocaine in the country.
The measures include increasing the maximum sentence for drug trafficking from 30 to 40 years, as well as introducing mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. The law also gives officials the power to seize assets belonging to drug traffickers and their associates.
The president has said that the new law will help Colombia meet international obligations to fight drug trafficking. He also hopes it will boost his country's relationship with the United States, which has long been one of Colombia's firmest allies.
However, not everyone is happy with the new measures. Human rights organizations have criticized the law as being too harsh, arguing that mandatory minimums and asset seizures violate due process and disproportionately affect poorer citizens.
Critics have also pointed out that harsher penalties may not be effective in curtailing the drug trade. Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, and despite the country's longstanding fight against drug trafficking, the industry remains a significant problem.
While the new law may satisfy U.S. demands for tougher measures, it remains to be seen whether it will make a significant dent in the country's drug trade. The Colombian government may need to seek more comprehensive solutions if it hopes to truly make a dent in the problem.
