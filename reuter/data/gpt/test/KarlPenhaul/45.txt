Bogot√°, Colombia - Former Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas, who served as the country's 24th leader from 1986 to 1990, has died at the age of 75 due to stomach cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
Barco, a Liberal Party member, was elected president in 1986, succeeding Belisario Betancur. His term was marked by a strong commitment to reducing violence in the country, boosting the economy, and promoting social progress. However, his efforts to bring peace and security clashed with the ongoing drug war, which was fueled by the notorious drug lord, Pablo Escobar.
Despite the challenges, Barco managed to implement various policies that helped create a more stable and prosperous Colombia. One of his most significant achievements was the creation of the National Commission on Drug Policy, which developed strategies for combating the drug trade and promoting social programs aimed at reducing drug consumption.
Barco also initiated negotiations with the country's largest leftist guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). While the talks ultimately fell apart, they set the groundwork for subsequent efforts to find a peaceful solution to the country's decades-long conflict.
In his later years, Barco was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which gradually deteriorated his health and memory. In recent years, he had been receiving treatment for stomach cancer, which eventually claimed his life.
Colombian President Ivan Duque expressed his condolences over Barco's passing, stating that he would be remembered for his leadership and unwavering dedication to the country. Duque also acknowledged Barco's contributions to peace talks and the fight against narcotrafficking, noting that the former president's legacy would continue to inspire future generations of Colombians.
Barco's death was also mourned by various political figures and organizations. The Organization of American States (OAS) released a statement praising the former president's commitment to democracy and human rights, while the Liberal Party described him as a "statesman" who helped lay the foundation for a more prosperous Colombia.
Funeral arrangements for Barco have not yet been announced. However, it is expected that his passing will be marked by various tributes and memorials, both in Colombia and around the world.
Overall, Barco's legacy will be remembered as one of transformation and progress. Despite the challenges he faced, he remained committed to building a better Colombia for all its citizens, and his contributions will continue to shape the country's future for years to come.
