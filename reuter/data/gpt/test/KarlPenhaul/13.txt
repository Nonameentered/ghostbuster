Colombia is set to experience its first national strike in over two and a half years, with labor unions, student groups, and other civil society organizations calling for protests against the government's economic and social policies.
The strike, which will take place on November 21, has been in the works for weeks and has already garnered support from various sectors of society. Participants are expected to demand increased investment in education, healthcare, and other social services, as well as an end to corruption and violence targeting social leaders and activists.
With tens of thousands of Colombians expected to take to the streets, some analysts have expressed concern that the protests could escalate into violence or threaten the stability of the ruling order. However, others argue that the strike is unlikely to seriously challenge the government's authority, given the limited political and economic power of the participants.
"The strike is a legitimate form of popular mobilization, but it is unlikely to pose a significant threat to the government," said Eduardo Ramos, a political scientist at the University of Bogot√°. "The participants lack the organizational and financial resources to sustain a prolonged campaign, and their demands are not novel or particularly radical."
Ramos added that the government has shown a willingness to engage with protest leaders and address some of their concerns, suggesting that the strike could ultimately result in incremental policy changes rather than a major political upheaval.
Indeed, President Ivan Duque has indicated that his administration is open to dialogue with the protesters and has announced a series of measures aimed at addressing some of their grievances. These include increased funding for education and healthcare, as well as proposals to improve security for social leaders and combat organized crime.
Duque has also sought to downplay the threat of violence, stating that the government will protect citizens' right to protest while taking measures to prevent vandalism and looting.
"We understand that people have legitimate concerns and want to express their views," Duque said in a recent interview. "But we cannot tolerate violence or the destruction of public property. We will ensure that the protests are peaceful and that the rule of law is respected."
Despite these assurances, some Colombians remain skeptical of the government's willingness to address their concerns. The country has been beset by a series of social and political crises over the past year, including the ongoing conflict in the border region with Venezuela, a wave of anti-government protests in September, and a spate of killings targeting social leaders and activists.
Many protesters argue that the strike is a way to hold the government accountable for its failures and to demand real change.
"We are tired of living in a country where basic services are lacking and corruption is rampant," said Lucia Gonzalez, a student activist involved in organizing the protests. "We want the government to listen to us and take real action to improve our lives."
For her and the many others involved, the strike represents a chance to make their voices heard and to challenge a political system they feel has failed them. How far the protests will go and whether they will lead to meaningful change remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Colombians are increasingly fed up with the status quo and are seeking ways to create a better future for themselves and their country.
