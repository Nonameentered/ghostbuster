Colombian State Employees Launch Nationwide Strike with Support from Leftist Rebels
State employees across Colombia have launched a nationwide strike, demanding higher wages, better working conditions, and more investment in public services. The strike, which began on Monday, has received support from leftist rebels and other social groups, who joined the protests to demand more sweeping changes in the country.
The public employees' union, Fecode, said that the government has failed to honor its commitments to workers, leaving them with poor salaries, insufficient health care, and no job security. The Fecode union represents over 300,000 educators across Colombia, and it is leading the protests along with other unions, including healthcare workers, transport workers, and civil servants.
The protests have disrupted public services across the country, including transportation, healthcare, education, and public safety. Schools have been closed, and public transport has come to a standstill, as workers demand better pay and labor rights. Protesters have also taken to the streets to denounce violence against social activists and demand that the government take urgent action to protect them.
The protests have gained support from various social groups, including indigenous communities, Afro-Colombian groups, and leftist rebels from the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The left-wing groups have criticized the government's neoliberal policies and called for a more comprehensive overhaul of the country's economic and social system.
"The Colombian people are demanding a better future, and they will not be silent until their voices are heard," said a spokesperson for the ELN. "We stand with the state employees and all those who demand a fairer society, free from exploitation and oppression."
The FARC, which signed a historic peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016, also expressed support for the protests. In a statement, the former rebel group said that the government had not fulfilled its promises to ensure the implementation of the peace agreement and that the protests were a sign of growing social discontent.
"The strike is an expression of the frustration and anger of thousands of Colombians who have suffered from decades of violence, poverty, and exclusion," the statement read. "The government must listen to their demands and take concrete actions to address their needs."
The government, however, has shown little willingness to negotiate with the protesters or address their demands. President Ivan Duque, who took office in 2018, has pursued an austerity program that has cut public spending, reduced social programs, and pushed for privatization of public services.
Duque has also been criticized for his failure to protect social activists and human rights defenders, who have faced escalating threats and violence from paramilitary groups and drug cartels. According to the United Nations, more than 100 activists were killed in Colombia last year, making it one of the most dangerous countries for human rights defenders.
The government has, however, condemned the protests, saying that they are a threat to public order and security. Interior Minister Alicia Arango has accused the protesters of engaging in vandalism, destroying public property, and disrupting the lives of ordinary Colombians.
"We respect the right to protest, but we cannot allow violent actions that put citizens at risk," Arango said. "We call on the protesters to refrain from violence and seek peaceful solutions to their demands."
Despite the government's warnings, the protests are expected to continue throughout the week. The unions have called for a national strike on Thursday, which is expected to bring together workers from across different sectors and social groups.
The protests reflect the deepening social and economic crisis in Colombia, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the World Bank, poverty rates in Colombia have increased from 27% to 37% in the past year, while unemployment has risen from 10% to 15%.
The strike also comes at a crucial moment for Colombia's political future, as the country prepares for presidential elections next year. The protests could galvanize support for leftist candidates and put pressure on the government to address the demands of workers and social groups.
"The protests are a wake-up call for the government to listen to the voices of the people and take action to address their needs," said a spokesperson for the FARC. "If the government fails to act, there will be more protests, more strikes, and more social unrest in the country."
