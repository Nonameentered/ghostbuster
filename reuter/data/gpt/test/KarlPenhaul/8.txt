BOGOTA- On Monday, April 26, a nationwide strike by state workers began in Colombia, leading to violent clashes in the capital city of Bogota. The strike was called by the national labor union, Central Union of Workers, to demand better salaries, benefits, and working conditions for public workers.
Reports from the ground suggest that the clashes began when the police tried to dismantle a blockade set up by protesters. The blockades were set up to halt traffic along one of the city's main avenues, Carrera Septima. Authorities have reported that the protesters set fires, blocked roads, and threw rocks and other projectiles at buildings and vehicles. The police responded with tear gas and water cannons.
The clashes, which lasted for several hours, resulted in more than 20 injuries on both sides. Two police officers were hospitalized, and several protesters were also injured. Witnesses reported seeing police using excessive force to disperse the protesters.
Maria Bravo, a teacher participating in the strike in Bogota, said, "We are demanding better working conditions and salaries for teachers, health care workers, and other public servants. The government has not paid attention to us, and we have no other option but to strike. We are not violent, but the police are attacking us."
The strike is also being supported by other unions, including those representing health care workers, civil aviation employees, and municipal workers. The protestors have complained about the lack of job security and benefits for public workers, along with low salaries that do not keep pace with inflation.
Several universities across the country have also been participating in the strike, leading to the cancellation of classes. The protests have affected transportation, with major roads and highways being blocked by protesters.
President Ivan Duque has condemned the violence, stating that the government is open to dialogue with the protesters. He has also authorized the use of force by the police to ensure public order.
In a statement, the president said, "We reject any act of violence and vandalism, which harms the citizenry and affects the rights of all Colombians. We call for dialogue and mutual respect to find solutions to the legitimate demands of the workers. However, the national government must ensure public order, and the authorities will fulfill that role."
The union leaders have welcomed the government's willingness to engage in dialogue but have demanded concrete actions to address their demands. In a statement, the union leaders said, "We are ready to talk with the government, but they need to listen to our demands. We have been waiting for too long, and we cannot wait anymore. The country needs to recognize the dignity of public workers and provide better working conditions and wages."
The nationwide strike comes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases in the country and a slow vaccine rollout. Some union leaders have also accused the government of mishandling the pandemic response and failing to provide adequate support to health care workers on the frontlines.
The strike is expected to continue for several days until the government agrees to negotiate with the workers' unions and provide concrete solutions to their demands.
In conclusion, the nationwide strike by state workers in Colombia has led to violent clashes in Bogota, with protesters demanding better working conditions, wages, and benefits. The government has offered to dialog with the union leaders, but it remains to be seen whether concrete solutions will be provided to address the workers' demands. The strike is still ongoing, and the public is advised to avoid the affected areas.
