The Mayor of Istmina, a town in the southwestern Colombian province of Chocó, has raised his voice for peace after witnessing the brutal beheading of a child. The horrific incident occurred on August 15, when a group of armed men stormed a settlement in the Serranía del Baudó, a mountainous area near the border with Panama, and executed a 12-year-old boy in front of his family members.
The gruesome murder, which the authorities blamed on armed groups involved in drug trafficking and illegal mining, has shocked the country and highlighted the ongoing violence and insecurity affecting rural communities in Colombia. According to human rights groups, the armed conflict in Colombia has resulted in more than 260,000 deaths and forced over seven million people to flee their homes since it began in the 1960s.
In an emotional speech delivered at the funeral of the victim, Mayor John Jairo Trujillo Espitia called for an end to the violence and urged the government and the international community to support efforts to build peace and development in the troubled region. "We cannot continue living in fear and despair. We need a future of hope and progress for our children and our communities," he said.
Trujillo, a 37-year-old lawyer and politician who took office as mayor of Istmina in January 2020, has become a leading voice for peace and human rights in Chocó, one of the poorest and most marginalized regions of Colombia. Ever since his inauguration, he has faced numerous challenges, including illegal armed groups, corruption, and ethnic tensions. However, he has remained steadfast in his commitment to serving his constituents and defending their rights.
The beheading of the child, who has been identified as Nohemí Mosquera, has galvanized Trujillo and other local leaders to demand action from the government and the security forces. In a letter addressed to President Ivan Duque and other high-ranking officials, Trujillo denounced the violence in the Serranía del Baudó and called for urgent measures to protect the civilian population and restore the rule of law.
"We are tired of burying our children and our brothers. We demand justice and a peaceful solution to this conflict," he wrote. The letter also emphasized the need for social investments, such as education, health, and infrastructure, to address the root causes of the violence and promote economic development in the region.
Trujillo's advocacy for peace has resonated with many Colombians, who have taken to social media to express their support and appreciation. "Mayor Trujillo is a true hero. He has shown us that it is possible to fight for justice and peace in the midst of adversity," wrote a user on Twitter. Others have called on the government to heed Trujillo's call and take concrete steps to address the crisis in Chocó.
Despite the challenges and risks he faces, Trujillo remains optimistic about the future and the power of collective action. "We are not alone in this struggle. We have the support and solidarity of many people, inside and outside Colombia, who believe in our cause and our right to live in peace," he said in an interview with a local newspaper.
Trujillo's message of hope and resilience has inspired many young people in his community to get involved in social and political activism. One of them is Diana Rodriguez, a 20-year-old student who attended the funeral of Nohemí Mosquera and was deeply moved by Trujillo's speech.
"I want to be like Mayor Trujillo. He is a role model for all of us who want to make a difference in our society. We need more leaders who care about the people and are not afraid to speak up for their rights," she said.
The beheading of Nohemí Mosquera and the violence in Chocó are a tragic reminder of the long-standing challenges facing Colombia and the need for inclusive and sustainable peace-building processes. However, the courage and vision of leaders like Mayor Trujillo offer a ray of hope and a path towards a better future for all Colombians.
