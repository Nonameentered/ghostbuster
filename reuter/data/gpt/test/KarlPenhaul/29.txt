The Colombian truck drivers' union has announced a nationwide strike starting on April 4, in protest against the government's policies on transportation and fuel prices. The union represents more than 400,000 drivers who transport goods across the country, including coffee exports, which account for more than 10% of Colombia's total exports.
However, coffee exporters appear to be unfazed by the upcoming strike, given that they have contingency plans in place to manage operations during the potential disruptions.
Last year, a similar strike took place in Colombia, which lasted for more than a month. Coffee exports were affected, as trucks could not reach ports and airports for shipment. This resulted in a temporary shortage of coffee supplies in some parts of the world. The strike also had a significant impact on the country's economy, which lost more than $350m as a result of the disruption.
This time around, however, coffee exporters are better prepared to deal with the potential disruptions of a strike. Some have already begun to move their coffee shipments ahead of time to avoid bottlenecks at the ports. Others have made alternative arrangements, such as using trains, which are unaffected by the strike.
"We're not too worried about the upcoming strike," said a spokesperson for Colombia's National Federation of Coffee Growers. "We've learned from the last time, and we have contingency plans in place to ensure our exports continue to flow."
The spokesperson added that the federation had already made alternative transportation arrangements, such as using smaller trucks, to ensure that coffee beans reach their destination on time.
The truck drivers' union, however, maintains that the government has ignored their demands for better wages, working conditions, and lower fuel prices. They argue that high fuel prices and low trucking rates are making it difficult for them to make a living.
The union has also expressed dissatisfaction with the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which they say has not been sufficient to protect truck drivers' health and safety.
"The government has ignored our requests for better wages, working conditions, and safety measures during the pandemic," said Andrés García, a spokesperson for the union. "We have no choice but to strike."
The strike is expected to have a significant impact on the transportation and logistics sector in Colombia, which could result in delays and shortages of goods across the country. Some businesses are already making contingency plans to deal with potential disruptions.
David Carrillo, CEO of Pacific Rubiales, Colombia's second-largest oil producer, said the company was preparing for the strike and had made contingency plans to ensure its operations continued without any major disruptions.
"As a responsible company, we always have contingency plans in place to deal with scenarios like these," he said. "We're confident that our operations will continue without any major disruptions, and we will keep working closely with our customers and suppliers to ensure they are not affected either."
The strike is expected to last for an indefinite period, and negotiations between the union and the government are ongoing. The government has urged the union to reconsider their decision and engage in dialogue, but the union has refused to back down.
The government also warned of the potential consequences of the strike on the country's economy, which is already struggling due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
"We urge the union to reconsider their decision and engage in dialogue with the government," said María Paula Moreno, Colombia's Minister of Transport. "We understand their concerns, but we must also consider the impact of the strike on the economy, especially during these difficult times."
Despite the government's concerns, the truck drivers' union appears determined to move forward with the strike. They say their demands are reasonable and that they are willing to fight for their rights.
"We're not asking for anything unreasonable," said García. "We just want better wages, working conditions, and safety measures. And we're willing to fight for them."
