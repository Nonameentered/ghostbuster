BOGOTÁ, COLOMBIA – Workers and labor unions across Colombia are planning a nationwide strike on Wednesday to demand better pay and labor rights from the government. 
The strike comes after weeks of negotiations between labor leaders and government officials failed to reach an agreement on key issues like minimum wage, retirement benefits, and job security. Workers across various industries, including teachers, healthcare workers, miners, and public transportation employees, have vowed to participate in the strike, which is expected to be one of the largest in recent years in Colombia.
“We’ve reached a breaking point. Our wages are too low, our working conditions are unbearable, and our voices are not being heard,” said María Gonzalez, a public school teacher in Bogotá. “We’re calling on the government to listen to us and take decisive action to improve the lives of workers and their families.”
The government, led by President Ivan Duque, has come under fire from labor groups for failing to address the needs of workers in one of the most unequal countries in Latin America. According to the World Bank, Colombia has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the region, with nearly a third of the population living below the poverty line.
The strike is also being fueled by recent protests in neighboring Bolivia and Chile, where workers and students have taken to the streets to demand social and economic justice. Colombian labor leaders say they are inspired by the movements in their neighboring countries and are determined to see change in their own country as well.
“We’re not alone in our struggle. Workers across Latin America are fighting for their rights, and we’re in solidarity with them,” said Hector Garcia, a labor union leader in Medellin. “We’re demanding an end to the neoliberal policies that have only benefited the wealthy and left the rest of us behind.”
The government has warned that the strike could lead to disruptions in public services and transportation, and has urged protesters to demonstrate peacefully and avoid violence. Authorities have also deployed thousands of police officers and soldiers to maintain order during the strike.
“We respect the right to peaceful protest, but we also have a responsibility to protect public safety and maintain order,” said Defense Minister Guillermo Botero. “We’re urging protesters to respect the law and avoid any actions that could put themselves or others in danger.”
Despite the government’s warnings, labor leaders say they are determined to make their voices heard and are prepared to continue the strike until their demands are met.
“We’re not backing down. This is a fight for our future and the future of our country,” said Sofia Castro, a healthcare worker in Cartagena. “We’re ready to do whatever it takes to secure better pay and working conditions for ourselves and our families.”
