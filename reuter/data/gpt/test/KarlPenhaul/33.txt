Drug gangsters who are members of the powerful "Los Rastrojos" group have threatened to kill journalists who have been covering the extradition of one of their leaders to the United States from Colombia. 
The gangsters have made the threats against journalists from several news outlets, including El Tiempo, Semana, and Caracol Radio. This comes after the arrest of one of their leaders, Joaquín Pérez Becerra, who was captured in Guatemala after being on the run for years.
Pérez Becerra is wanted by the United States on drug trafficking charges, and Los Rastrojos have been vocal in their opposition to his extradition. The group has reportedly threatened to kill anyone who reports on the case or supports the extradition.
In a statement, the National Federation of Colombian Journalists (Fecolper) condemned the threats, calling them "an attack on the freedom of the press and the right of citizens to be informed."
The union urged the government to take action to protect journalists and ensure their safety, especially in the regions where Los Rastrojos are active.
The threats against journalists have sparked concerns about the state of press freedom in Colombia, which has been a dangerous place for reporters for years. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Colombia is the second-most dangerous country for journalists in the Americas, after Mexico.
Reporters Without Borders has also voiced concerns about the safety of journalists in the country, calling it a "hostile environment" for the press. In 2020, at least three journalists were killed in Colombia in connection with their work.
The Colombian government has condemned the threats against journalists and said it is taking steps to protect them. The Interior Ministry has reportedly increased security measures for journalists in areas where they are most at risk.
President Iván Duque has also spoken out against the threats, saying that Colombia is a country that values its press freedom and that journalists should be able to do their jobs without fear of violence or intimidation.
"We will not allow anyone to silence the voices of our journalists," Duque said in a statement.
Despite the government's assurances, many journalists remain concerned about their safety. Some have reportedly gone into hiding or stopped reporting on the case altogether.
The situation has also raised concerns about the power of drug cartels in Colombia, which still wield considerable influence despite years of efforts to dismantle them.
Los Rastrojos is just one of several drug gangs operating in the country, and many fear that the threat against journalists could be a sign of their growing power and reach.
In the face of such challenges, journalists in Colombia are calling for greater protections and support from the government and society at large. For them, the fight for press freedom is not just a matter of personal safety – it is a vital part of building a more just and democratic society.
