In a move to improve profitability, Ford announced plans to restructure its Halewood plant in England, which could lead to some job losses. The plant, which employs around 4,000 staff, is known for producing the Ford Transit and the Range Rover Evoque.
The restructuring plan aims to reduce costs and improve efficiency by reducing the number of shifts from three to two and introducing a new shift pattern. The company also plans to adjust production volumes and optimize the layout of the plant to improve flow and reduce waste.
"We are committed to transforming our business and improving profitability, and the restructuring of our Halewood plant is an important step in this process," said Steve Armstrong, Ford of Europe president. "Although it may involve job losses, we will work closely with our employees and their representatives to minimize the impact and provide support during this transition."
The plan is part of Ford's global restructuring program that aims to cut costs by $11 billion by 2022 and prioritize investments in electric and autonomous vehicles. The company has already announced plans to close plants in France and Russia and reduce its salaried workforce by 10%.
Despite the job losses, the restructuring plan has been welcomed by some experts who see it as a necessary step to ensure the long-term viability of the Halewood plant.
"This is a tough decision, but it shows that Ford is serious about restructuring its business and adapting to the changing market conditions," said David Bailey, professor of business at Birmingham University. "It's important to remember that Halewood is a vital part of Ford's European manufacturing footprint and this move is designed to secure its future."
However, the news has been met with concern by trade unions who fear job losses and are calling for assurances from Ford about the future of the plant.
"Any job losses are a serious blow to our members, their families, and the local community," said Unite regional officer Terry Mellor. "We will be engaging with the company to ensure that any reductions are voluntary, the terms are fair, and that there are no compulsory redundancies."
The restructuring plan is expected to be implemented over the next few months and will involve consultations with employees and their representatives. Ford has assured that it will provide support, including training and assistance with finding alternative employment, to those affected by the changes.
Overall, the restructuring of the Halewood plant is seen as a necessary step for Ford to remain competitive and secure its future in the European market. However, it also highlights the challenges facing the automotive industry as it adapts to changing consumer demands and increasing competition from new players in the market.
