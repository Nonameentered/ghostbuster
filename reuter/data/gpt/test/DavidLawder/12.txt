MIDLAND, Mich. â€“ Dow Corning, a global leader in silicone-based technology and innovation, is set to commence a $3 billion bankruptcy reorganization in an effort to pay claims arising from its silicone breast implants and also to seek a trial in order to establish a link, if any, between those implants and systemic diseases.
According to court documents, the restructuring plan, which has been approved by the majority of Dow Corning's creditors, will call for the establishment of a trust with a value of $2.35 billion, to be funded by Dow Corning's assets and insurance policies. The trust will be used primarily to compensate women who received Dow Corning's silicone breast implants and suffered complications, such as ruptures, leakage, or other adverse effects.
"These women deserve fair and prompt compensation for any harm they suffered as a result of our products," said Howard Ungerleider, Dow Corning's chairman and CEO. "We deeply regret what happened and want to do everything in our power to make it right."
The trust will be overseen by a court-appointed committee and will use a special calculator to determine the amount of compensation each claimant is entitled to receive, based on factors such as the type of implant, the date it was inserted, and the severity of the complication. The calculator will also take into account any other compensation the claimant has received, such as from lawsuits or settlements with other manufacturers.
Dow Corning expects to contribute up to $1.1 billion in cash and assets to the trust, with the remainder coming from its insurers. The company estimates that the trust will pay out between $1.4 billion and $2.8 billion over the next 16 years.
In addition to the trust, Dow Corning's bankruptcy reorganization plan also includes a provision to allow the company to seek a trial in order to determine whether its silicone breast implants are linked to systemic diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or fibromyalgia. Such a trial could have significant implications for the millions of women worldwide who have received silicone breast implants, as well as for manufacturers of other medical devices made with silicone.
"We believe that science, not speculation, should determine whether there is a link between our implants and systemic diseases," said Ungerleider. "We have always been committed to safety and transparency, and we want to do everything we can to restore the public's trust in our products."
Dow Corning has faced a barrage of lawsuits and criticism in the past over its silicone breast implants, which were first introduced in the 1960s and were widely used until the early 1990s. The implants were designed to provide a more natural look and feel than saline implants, but were later found to be more prone to ruptures and leakage, as well as other adverse effects such as scarring, pain, and infection.
In the mid-1990s, Dow Corning and other manufacturers faced a flood of lawsuits from women who claimed that their implants had caused serious health problems, such as autoimmune diseases, cancer, and other conditions. While some studies suggested a possible link between silicone implants and systemic diseases, others found no evidence of such a link.
In 1992, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of silicone breast implants for cosmetic purposes, citing concerns over safety and efficacy. However, the agency allowed the implants to be used for reconstructive purposes, such as after cancer surgery, and later lifted the ban entirely in 2006.
Dow Corning, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2004 after setting up a previous trust to pay claims related to its silicone implants, has maintained all along that its implants are safe and effective, and that any adverse effects are rare and cannot be definitively linked to the implants.
However, the company's new reorganization plan reflects a recognition that it needs to take responsibility for the harm that its products may have caused, and to provide a fair and efficient mechanism for compensating those who were injured. By establishing a trust and seeking a trial, Dow Corning hopes to pave the way for a more transparent and evidence-based discussion of the risks and benefits of silicone implants, and to restore faith in its products and its commitment to safety and innovation.
