A former U.S. Army paratrooper is believed to be planning a shooting rampage at a Ford Motor Co. plant in retaliation for the rejection of his marriage proposal. The man, identified as John Matthews, 35, reportedly made the proposal to a female employee at the plant, who rejected him, citing reasons of her own.
Matthews, a veteran with multiple overseas tours, is believed to have become increasingly unstable in recent months following his discharge from the Army due to a medical condition. He has allegedly made repeated threats against the plant and the woman who spurned him, leading to his being banned from the premises.
Both the Dearborn Police Department and the FBI are taking the threats seriously and are working around the clock to locate and apprehend Matthews. The plant, which employs over 7,000 workers, has been put on high alert, with security measures tightened and police patrols increased.
In a statement, Ford Motor Co. said it was fully cooperating with law enforcement officials and was taking all the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of its employees. "We condemn any and all forms of violence and are committed to maintaining a safe and secure workplace for our employees," the statement said.
Matthews, who has a history of mental illness, is believed to have access to firearms. Police are urging anyone with information about his whereabouts to come forward and are warning the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity.
The incident has once again raised concerns about workplace violence and the need for employers to have proper security protocols in place to prevent such incidents from occurring. According to the National Safety Council, workplace violence is now the second-leading cause of occupational fatalities in the U.S., with over 2 million workers being affected by it each year.
Experts say that employers can take several steps to mitigate the risk of workplace violence, including conducting background checks on employees, providing training on conflict resolution and de-escalation, and implementing communication systems to enable employees to report threats or suspicious behavior.
In the case of John Matthews, it remains unclear what his motivations are and what specific actions he may be planning. However, law enforcement officials are taking the situation seriously and are urging the public to be on the lookout for any signs of suspicious activity. Anyone with information about Matthews' whereabouts is urged to contact the Dearborn Police Department immediately.
