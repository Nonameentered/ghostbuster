Ford U.S. Light Vehicle Sales Fall 2.2% in November, Despite Truck Sales Gains.
Ford Motor Co. reported that its U.S. light vehicle sales fell 2.2% in November 2021, despite truck sales gains. The company sold a total of 168,243 vehicles during the month, compared with 172,749 in the same month last year.
The company's car sales suffered the most significant decline, falling 66.5% to 3,452 units, while its SUV sales rose 3.6% to 61,235 vehicles sold. Truck sales were up 6% to 103,556 units sold, led by the F-Series pickup truck. Sales of the F-Series increased by 14.8% to 51,964 trucks in November, representing the best November sales for the model since 2000.
However, despite the strong truck sales performance, Ford's overall vehicle sales lagged behind those of its competitors. General Motors and Stellantis both reported double-digit sales growth in November, with sales up 45% and 39%, respectively. In contrast, Ford's sales fell by 9% in the same period.
The company's sales decline in November was largely attributed to the ongoing global semiconductor chip shortage, which has hit the automotive industry hard, causing production delays and inventory shortages. Ford has been trying to mitigate the impact of the chip shortage by prioritizing production of its most profitable vehicles, such as trucks and SUVs, but the supply chain disruption has still affected its overall sales performance.
Another factor that may have contributed to the decline in Ford's sales in November is the increased competition in the electric vehicle (EV) market. The company has been making significant investments in EVs, with plans to spend over $30 billion by 2025 on electrification and autonomous vehicle technologies. However, its current line-up of EVs is limited compared to its competitors, with only the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning available for purchase.
Despite the challenges, Ford remains optimistic about its future prospects, citing strong demand for its trucks and the launch of several new models in the coming months. The company recently unveiled the all-electric E-Transit van, which is set to go on sale in the U.S. in late 2021, as well as the new Ford Maverick compact pickup truck and Bronco Raptor off-road SUV.
Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement, "We're encouraged by the progress we've made in moving our most profitable vehicles and building out our all-electric lineup. With several new models coming to market in the next few months and continued strong demand for our trucks, we remain optimistic about the future."
Analysts predict that the chip shortage will continue to impact the automotive industry in the near term, but the demand for vehicles is likely to remain high, driven by factors such as low interest rates and a recovering economy. As such, Ford and other automakers will have to navigate these challenges while also adapting to changes in consumer preferences, such as the increased demand for EVs and other sustainable mobility solutions.
