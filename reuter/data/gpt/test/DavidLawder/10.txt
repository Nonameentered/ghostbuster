Chrysler, the American carmaker, has sold its last defense subsidiary, Pentastar Electronics, to an investment group led by its management. The news has created a buzz in the automotive industry, as Chrysler is now solely focused on the automobile sector.
The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year, estimated to be worth more than $80 million. The decision to divest the subsidiary was driven by a strategic review of the company's assets and the decision to concentrate on core automotive business.
Pentastar Electronics has been a part of Chrysler since 1991, providing engineering and technology services to the defense sector. The unit is known for producing critical components for military aircraft and ground vehicles. The group has been consistently profitable with a large portion of revenues coming from contracts with the U.S. government.
The sale of the Pentastar Electronics marks the final step in Chrysler's divestiture of its non-automotive businesses. In 2015, Chrysler sold the rest of its former defense subsidiary, Viper Defense, which had a long history of supplying military equipment for the U.S. Department of Defense.
Chrysler's CEO, Robert Manzone, stated that the decision to sell Pentastar Electronics was strategic and necessary. He said, "We are grateful to the men and women of Pentastar Electronics for their contributions to our company and our country, but our focus is on building great cars and trucks. We are confident that this transition will allow Pentastar Electronics to continue to thrive under new ownership and leadership."
The investment group that is purchasing Pentastar Electronics is led by the subsidiary's current CEO, John DeSanctis. According to the group, the deal will allow them to continue delivering quality technology solutions and services to its customers in the defense industry.
DeSanctis stated, "We are proud of the work we have done at Pentastar Electronics, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We will continue to provide innovative solutions to our customers in the defense industry, building on the strong foundation that we have established over the years. We thank Chrysler for their support and look forward to moving ahead with this new chapter."
While Chrysler will lose a profitable business unit, industry analysts say that this is a smart move for the company. Chrysler has been facing stiff competition from its rivals in the automotive sector and has struggled to gain market share. By focusing solely on building great cars and trucks, Chrysler may have a better chance of succeeding in a competitive marketplace.
The sale of Pentastar Electronics also allows Chrysler to concentrate on new technology investments, particularly in the electric vehicle sector. Electric vehicle sales have been growing at a rapid pace globally, and the company is eyeing a larger share of the market. Chrysler has already announced plans to release electric-powered versions of its popular Jeep models in the near future.
In summary, the sale of Pentastar Electronics is expected to benefit both the investment group and Chrysler. The new ownership will continue to provide quality technology solutions and services to the defense industry, while Chrysler will be better positioned to compete in the automotive sector.
