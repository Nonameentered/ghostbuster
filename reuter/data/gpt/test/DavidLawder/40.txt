General Motors (GM) is set to gain $100 million in annual savings with the sale of its subsidiary, Hughes, to Raytheon Technologies. In a statement released by GM, the company said that the move was part of its ongoing efforts to streamline its business operations and focus on its core automotive business.
The sale of Hughes, which provides satellite communication equipment and services to various sectors, including the military, was announced in March 2020. Under the terms of the deal, Raytheon paid $1.8 billion in cash to acquire Hughes, a move that was expected to have a positive impact on both companies.
For GM, the sale of Hughes meant that the company could divest a business unit that was not directly related to its automotive operations and reinvest the proceeds into its core business. The move was also seen as a way for GM to free up cash and improve its balance sheet, allowing the company to invest in new technologies and pursue growth opportunities.
Meanwhile, for Raytheon, the acquisition of Hughes was seen as a way to expand its capabilities in the fast-growing satellite communication market. As part of the deal, Raytheon also acquired a 50% stake in a joint venture with Viasat, a leading provider of satellite internet services.
Now, nearly a year after the sale was announced, GM has confirmed that it expects to realize significant cost savings as a result of the deal. In a quarterly earnings report released on February 10, 2021, the company said that it expects to save $100 million annually as a result of the sale.
The savings are expected to come from a reduction in overhead costs associated with operating Hughes, as well as from the elimination of duplicative functions between GM and Hughes. All in all, the sale of Hughes is expected to have a positive impact on GM's bottom line, allowing the company to reinvest in its core business and pursue growth opportunities.
In addition to the financial benefits for GM, the sale of Hughes also had implications for Class H shareholders, who received additional shares in the post-merger Raytheon. The Class H shares, which were created to represent the value of GM's equity interest in Hughes, were distributed to GM shareholders as part of the sale.
Under the terms of the deal, GM shareholders received one Class H share for every 10 shares of GM common stock they held. The Class H shares represent an ownership interest in Raytheon, which was created as a result of the merger between Raytheon and United Technologies in April 2020.
The merger created a new company with a broad portfolio of aerospace and defense products and services, including military aircraft, missiles, and radar systems. The addition of Hughes to Raytheon's portfolio was seen as a way to further strengthen the company's position in the satellite communication market and expand its offerings to customers in the military and commercial sectors.
For GM shareholders who received the Class H shares, the value of those shares has fluctuated since the sale was announced. However, with the merger between Raytheon and United Technologies now complete, the value of those shares is expected to be more stable in the future.
Overall, the sale of Hughes to Raytheon was seen as a positive move for both companies. For GM, it allowed the company to divest a non-core business unit and realize significant cost savings, while for Raytheon, it provided an opportunity to expand its capabilities in the growing satellite communication market.
For GM shareholders who received Class H shares, the sale provided them with an ownership interest in a leading aerospace and defense company with a broad portfolio of products and services. With the merger between Raytheon and United Technologies now complete, the future looks bright for both companies, as well as for the Class H shareholders who received additional shares as a result of the sale.
