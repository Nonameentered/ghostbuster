As the clock struck midnight on December 31, 1996, the American automotive industry gave a collective sigh, ending a year that saw strong growth in sales and profits. Although overall sales for the year were up, December sales fell short of expectations, leaving many industry insiders wondering what was behind the decline.
Chrysler was one of the few automakers to break records in 1996, reporting a 7 percent increase in sales over the previous year. The automaker was particularly successful with its line of minivans, which saw an 18 percent increase in sales. However, despite Chrysler's success, other automakers struggled to keep up with the pace.
For the year, industry-wide sales were up 4 percent, with light truck sales leading the way with a 10 percent increase. In contrast, car sales were sluggish, up only 2 percent. Despite the overall increase in sales, December numbers were down, with sales dropping 5 percent compared to the same month in 1995.
General Motors was one of the hardest-hit automakers, reporting a 6 percent decrease in sales for December. The company's new model year vehicles were slow to catch on, leaving dealerships with an overstock of last-year's models. GM's truck sales fared better, however, with an 8 percent increase for the year.
Ford also struggled in December, with sales down 5.5 percent compared to the same period in 1995. The company's car sales were down 11 percent, while truck sales were up 3 percent for the year.
Many industry analysts cited the rising cost of gasoline as a major factor behind the decline in car sales. As gas prices rose throughout the year, consumers gravitated toward more fuel-efficient vehicles or simply cut back on their driving altogether. This trend was particularly evident in the sales of large sedans, which saw a 10 percent decline for the year.
Another possible explanation for the dip in December sales was the weather. The Midwest and Northeast were hit by a series of snowstorms and bitter cold, which made it difficult for consumers to visit dealerships and test drive vehicles.
Despite the overall slowdown in sales, many automakers remained optimistic about the future. Some experts predicted that 1997 would be another strong year for the industry, with a continued focus on trucks and sport-utility vehicles.
One area of particular interest was the booming market for pickup trucks. In 1996, Americans bought more than 1 million pickups, which accounted for almost 15 percent of all light vehicle sales. Many industry insiders believe that this trend will continue, as consumers seek out cars with greater utility and versatility.
Another area of potential growth was the luxury car market. Despite the sluggish overall sales for cars in 1996, luxury cars saw a 5 percent increase in sales for the year. Automakers such as Lexus and Mercedes-Benz continued to ride this trend, with strong sales of their high-end models.
In the end, then, it seemed that the American automotive industry had weathered the minor storm of December 1996. While sales were down for the month, overall growth remained strong, thanks in large part to the success of companies like Chrysler and the continuing trend toward trucks and SUVs.
As automakers looked ahead to 1997, they were optimistic that the industry would continue its upward trend. While challenges would no doubt arise, the underlying strength of the American auto market suggested a bright future for the industry as a whole.
