Detroit, MI – The United Auto Workers (UAW) union is preparing to select a strike target from among the Big Three automakers – General Motors (GM), Ford, and Fiat Chrysler (FCA). Negotiations on a new contract have reached a stalemate, and union officials have warned that a strike is becoming more likely.
The UAW represents roughly 150,000 workers at the three automakers, and their contract expired on September 14. Negotiations have been ongoing since July, but major disagreements remain over wages, healthcare benefits, job security, and the use of temporary workers.
On Monday, UAW President Gary Jones announced that the union’s bargaining committee would meet with representatives from GM, Ford, and FCA on Tuesday to determine the next steps in the negotiations.
“We have three good companies, and the style of bargaining we are engaged in is confrontational,” Jones said in a statement. “But it is essential to arrive at a contract that benefits our members and their families.”
Jones added that the UAW was “still a long way apart” from reaching a deal with the automakers. Some union officials have expressed a willingness to go on strike if a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached, despite the fact that the UAW has not gone on strike since 2007.
“The membership is ready to take whatever steps are necessary to secure a fair and just contract,” said Terry Dittes, the UAW’s vice president in charge of union negotiations with GM. “That includes the possibility of a strike.”
A strike would be a major disruption to all three automakers, who rely on their UAW-represented workers to produce their vehicles. In the event of a strike, production could be halted at dozens of factories across the country, costing the companies millions of dollars per day.
The UAW’s strike target – the company that negotiators will focus on first in the event of a work stoppage – has not been announced. Historically, the union has chosen the largest of the three companies, which is currently GM. However, some union officials have suggested that FCA may be a better target, as they have the fewest UAW-represented workers and may therefore be more vulnerable to a strike.
GM and Ford have both posted strong earnings in recent years, which has led some union members to question why they have not seen larger wage increases or better benefits. However, the automakers argue that they face increasing competition from foreign rivals, and that they need to keep labor costs in check in order to remain competitive.
Meanwhile, the UAW is also dealing with an ongoing corruption scandal that has resulted in several high-ranking union officials being charged with embezzlement and bribery. Last week, a former UAW official was sentenced to 28 months in prison for accepting bribes from Fiat Chrysler executives in exchange for favorable treatment in labor negotiations.
The scandal has weakened the UAW’s bargaining position, as the automakers may be less willing to make concessions to a union that has been tarnished by corruption allegations. However, many union members see the scandal as an opportunity to clean up the UAW and make the organization more accountable to its members.
“We’ve got some people in leadership positions who have been indicted, and that’s not good for anybody,” said Todd Reifsnyder, a UAW member who works at a GM plant in Ohio. “But at the same time, we can’t let that distract us from our goals of securing a fair contract for our workers.”
The negotiations come at a sensitive time for the US auto industry, which is facing rising tariffs and trade tensions with China and other countries. In addition, the industry is grappling with the shift to electric and autonomous vehicles, which will require significant investment in new technology and infrastructure.
Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, it is clear that the UAW and the Big Three automakers are facing a changing and increasingly complex landscape. The union’s decision on which company to target in a potential strike will be a crucial one, and could have significant implications for the future of the industry.
