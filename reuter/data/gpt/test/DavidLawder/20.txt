The manufactured home industry, often referred to as mobile homes, has been seeing a wave of merger activity as communities across the United States help to revamp the image of this once-stigmatized housing option.
In recent years, manufactured homes have undergone significant engineering improvements, with many now offering amenities and features that rival traditional site-built homes. However, the negative stereotypes of mobile homes have persisted, discouraging potential buyers from exploring this type of housing.
To combat this stigma, communities are coming together to promote the benefits of manufactured homes, including reduced costs and improved energy efficiency. As a result, interest in this type of housing is on the rise, leading to an increase in merger activity within the industry.
One such merger was recently announced between Clayton Homes, the nation's largest manufacturer of manufactured homes, and Champion Home Builders, the largest privately held manufacturer of modular homes. The move combines two industry leaders, bringing together Clayton's expertise in affordable housing production and Champion's focus on customization and innovation.
According to Kevin Clayton, CEO of Clayton Homes, the merger will allow the two companies to work together to address the various challenges facing manufactured home buyers, including the need for affordable and customizable housing options.
"This merger will allow us to take the best from each company to deliver more value to our customers, who themselves represent a diverse range of housing needs," Clayton said.
The trend towards consolidation in the industry is expected to continue as manufacturers seek to increase efficiency and broaden their product offerings. Additionally, as more communities take steps to promote manufactured homes, industry experts predict a rise in demand for this type of housing.
One such example of a community actively promoting manufactured homes is the Lake County government in Florida. In 2018, the county launched a program to encourage the development of manufactured home communities, citing the need for affordable housing options for families and individuals.
Since the program's inception, four new developments have been approved, with more in the works. The county has also implemented a voluntary quality-assurance program for manufactured homes, ensuring that homes meet or exceed construction standards.
According to Lake County Commissioner Leslie Campione, the program has been well-received, with many residents seeing the benefits of manufactured homes over traditional site-built homes.
"Manufactured homes are a great option for individuals who want a comfortable, affordable home that is energy-efficient and built to last," Campione said. "We've seen firsthand how this type of housing can transform communities and provide much-needed housing options for families."
Other communities across the nation are following in Lake County's footsteps, with many implementing similar programs to promote affordable and energy-efficient housing options.
In addition to the rise in community-driven initiatives, the manufactured home industry is also seeing an increase in technological advancements. One such innovation is the development of hybrid homes, which incorporate both modular and traditional construction methods. These homes offer the cost savings and efficiency of manufactured homes, with the added customization options of site-built homes.
The rise of hybrid homes has contributed to the increased interest in manufactured homes, with many homebuyers opting for this new type of housing. Industry experts predict that the trend towards hybrid homes will only continue to grow, promoting further innovation within the industry.
As the manufactured home industry continues to evolve, it is clear that communities and manufacturers are working together to revamp the image of mobile homes. With increased efficiency, customization options, and affordability, the future of manufactured homes looks brighter than ever.
