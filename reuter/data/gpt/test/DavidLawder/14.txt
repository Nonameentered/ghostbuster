General Motors has announced that it is replacing the heads of its struggling Buick and Cadillac divisions as part of an ongoing marketing overhaul. The move comes as the automaker seeks to boost sales and regain its position as a leader in the luxury car market.
According to a statement from the company, Steve Carlisle, who currently heads up the Canadian unit, will take over as head of Cadillac, replacing Johan de Nysschen. Carlisle has been with GM for more than three decades and has experience in both sales and product planning.
Meanwhile, Duncan Aldred, who currently leads the GMC brand, will take over as head of Buick and GMC. His predecessor, Duncan Hannon, is leaving the company after just nine months on the job.
GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement that the leadership changes were part of a broader effort to sharpen the focus of the company's marketing and sales efforts.
"The changes we are making today will allow us to further accelerate our efforts to transform our business and better serve our customers," she said.
The moves come as GM struggles to regain its footing in the luxury car market. While Buick has seen some success in recent years, Cadillac has been struggling to compete with the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
De Nysschen, who was brought on board in 2014 to lead Cadillac's turnaround effort, had faced mounting pressure in recent months to deliver results. His strategy had focused on launching new products and expanding the brand into new markets, but sales have remained sluggish.
Now, with Carlisle at the helm, GM is hoping to turn things around. In a statement, the company said that Carlisle would be tasked with "accelerating Cadillac's growth in the United States and China, where it has enjoyed considerable success in recent years."
Meanwhile, Aldred's appointment to lead Buick and GMC comes after the brand saw a drop in sales in the first quarter of 2018. Aldred has been with GM for more than two decades and has experience in both sales and marketing.
In a statement, he said that he was looking forward to the new challenge.
"I am excited to lead the Buick and GMC brands and build on their strong heritage of quality and innovation," he said. "We have a tremendous opportunity to deliver on customer expectations and continue to grow these important brands."
GM has also announced a number of other leadership changes as part of its broader marketing overhaul. Alan Batey, who currently heads up the global Chevrolet brand, will take on a new role as head of GM North America.
Barry Engle, who currently heads up GM International, will take on a new role as executive vice president and president of the company's newly created International Operations division.
The changes are part of a broader effort by GM to streamline its operations and focus on long-term growth. In recent years, the automaker has struggled to keep up with rivals like Tesla, which has shaken up the industry with its electric cars and innovative marketing strategies.
With these leadership changes, GM is hoping to regain its footing and reassert itself as a leader in the auto industry. Whether the moves will be enough to jumpstart sales and reinvigorate the Cadillac and Buick brands remains to be seen, but the automaker is clearly taking a proactive approach to the challenge.
