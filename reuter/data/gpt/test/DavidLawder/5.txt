Kellogg, the multinational food company, announced its acquisition of Lender's Bagels from Kraft Foods for $455 million. The deal was finalized on Monday, with Kellogg taking over the bagel supplier immediately.
Lender's Bagels is a popular brand of frozen bagels in the United States, primarily sold in grocery stores. The acquisition will provide Kellogg with a new platform to expand its breakfast food offerings and will enable the company to enter a new market.
"We're excited to acquire Lender's Bagels and welcome the brand and the team to our family. We see strong growth potential in the frozen breakfast category and an opportunity to bring more people into the frozen aisle," said Chris Hood, president of Kellogg North America.
Kellogg is the parent company of many well-known breakfast brands, including Eggo waffles, Pop-Tarts, and Frosted Flakes. With the acquisition of Lender's Bagels, Kellogg looks to broaden its breakfast product offerings and continue its expansion into frozen foods.
"Combining Lender's Bagels with some of our other brands will create new opportunities for us to innovate and meet the evolving needs of our consumers. Bringing together the portfolios of Kellogg and Lender's Bagels will strengthen our position in the breakfast food category and fuel future growth," Hood said.
The acquisition of Lender's Bagels is part of Kellogg's strategy to expand its product offerings and increase its presence in the frozen food market. The company has been investing in research and development to create innovative breakfast products that cater to changing consumer preferences.
In recent years, Kellogg has faced increasing competition in the breakfast food category, particularly from startups and emerging brands. The acquisition of Lender's Bagels will give the company a new competitive edge and position it for growth in the coming years.
"We look forward to working with the Lender's Bagels team to bring our shared vision to life and build on the brand's legacy," said Hood. "With Kellogg's resources and expertise, we believe we can take Lender's Bagels to new heights and provide even more delicious breakfast options for consumers."
The $455 million acquisition of Lender's Bagels is still subject to customary closing conditions, but it is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Kellogg plans to integrate the bagel brand into its overall operations and begin selling Lender's Bagels under its market-leading brands.
Overall, the acquisition of Lender's Bagels is a significant move for Kellogg as it looks to expand its product offerings and increase its presence in the frozen food market. With its strong portfolio of breakfast brands and the addition of Lender's Bagels, Kellogg is well-positioned to meet the changing needs of consumers and continue its growth trajectory.
