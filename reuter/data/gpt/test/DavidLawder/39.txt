General Motors (GM) is set to benefit from the recent announcement of the Hughes Aircraft Co. sale to Raytheon Co. The automotive giant, which acquired Hughes Aircraft Co. in 1985, will receive an estimated $100 million in annual savings as a result of the sale.
Raytheon Co., a Massachusetts-based defense contractor, announced last month that it had agreed to acquire Hughes Aircraft Co. from GM for $1.67 billion. The acquisition, which is expected to be completed in the first half of next year, will expand Raytheon's presence in the aerospace and defense industry.
While the acquisition is good news for Raytheon, it is also expected to have significant benefits for GM. According to a company statement, GM will receive approximately $1.3 billion in cash from the sale, which will help fund the company's ongoing transformation efforts.
"The sale of Hughes Aircraft Co. to Raytheon Co. is a positive development for General Motors," said Mary Barra, GM's chairman and CEO. "It will provide significant cash proceeds that we can use to accelerate our transformation and create value for our shareholders."
In addition to the cash proceeds, GM is also expected to benefit from the annual savings resulting from the sale. The company has stated that it will no longer have to make contributions to Hughes Aircraft Co.'s pension plan, which had been underfunded in recent years. This is expected to result in annual savings of around $100 million.
The sale of Hughes Aircraft Co. is part of GM's ongoing efforts to streamline its operations and focus on its core automotive business. The company has been selling off non-core assets, including its European Opel and Vauxhall brands, in an attempt to improve its balance sheet and invest in emerging technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles.
"The sale of Hughes Aircraft Co. is another step in our transformation journey," said Barra. "We are focusing on our core business and investing in technologies that will shape the future of mobility."
The sale of Hughes Aircraft Co. to Raytheon Co. is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022.
In conclusion, GM's sale of Hughes Aircraft Co. to Raytheon Co. is expected to have significant benefits for the automotive giant. In addition to the cash proceeds, the sale will result in annual savings of approximately $100 million. This will help GM to accelerate its transformation efforts and create value for shareholders. The sale is part of GM's ongoing efforts to streamline its operations and focus on its core automotive business.
