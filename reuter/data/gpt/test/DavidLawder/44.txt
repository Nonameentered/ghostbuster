Detroit-based financial services company Comerica Inc. has announced that it will be cutting 16% of its workforce in order to boost revenues by $110 million annually. The company, which had 8,134 employees as of December 2020, plans to cut approximately 1,300 jobs over the next 12 months.
The move comes as a part of the company's ongoing efficiency initiative, which aims to streamline operations and reduce costs. Comerica has been struggling to grow its revenues in recent years, with the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbating its financial woes. The company's revenues declined by 12% in 2020, with its net income falling by 43%.
Comerica's CEO, Curt Farmer, announced the job cuts in a statement, saying that the move was necessary to ensure the company's long-term sustainability. "We understand the impact that these decisions have on our colleagues and their families, and we will do everything we can to support them during this difficult time," he said.
The company has not yet provided details on which departments or regions will be affected by the layoffs. However, it has stated that it will be providing severance packages and outplacement services to affected employees.
The news of the job cuts has been met with criticism from some quarters, with labor and union groups expressing concerns over the impact on workers. "These job cuts will hurt families and communities across the country," said Aaron Eckhart, president of the Comerica Workers United union. "We urge the company to reconsider its decision and explore alternative cost-saving measures that do not involve layoffs."
Meanwhile, some analysts have commended the move, saying that it was necessary for Comerica's survival. "The company has been underperforming for some time now, and these job cuts will help it become more efficient and profitable," said John Doe, an analyst at investment bank Goldman Sachs.
Comerica's announcement comes amid a wave of job cuts across the financial sector as companies struggle to adapt to the challenging economic environment. Earlier this month, JPMorgan Chase announced that it would be cutting jobs in its asset and wealth management divisions, while Wells Fargo has also announced plans to cut jobs in its consumer banking unit.
