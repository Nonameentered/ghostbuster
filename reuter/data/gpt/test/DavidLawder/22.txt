General Motors (GM) recently rocked the automotive industry by announcing deflated Q4 earnings expectations. While this news may have raised concerns among investors, industry analysts believe that this is a situation unique to GM, and that it is unlikely to impact Ford and Chrysler.
According to GM, Q4 earnings are expected to be $1.70-$1.90 per share, down from the previously forecasted range of $2.00-$2.06 per share. The company cited a few reasons for this deflated outlook. One of the main reasons is a $3 billion charge associated with the U.S. tax reform. Furthermore, GM’s sales in China are slipping, resulting in lower profit margins. These two factors have led to a stock drop of nearly 3% for the company.
However, analysts believe that GM’s situation is unique to the company and not indicative of an industry-wide trend. While the U.S. tax reform will impact the entire industry, it is estimated that GM will be particularly hard hit due to its high concentration in the U.S. market. With the tax reform, the U.S. corporate tax rate has been lowered from 35% to 21%, which will lead to significant savings for all companies. However, for GM, which sells nearly 70% of its vehicles in the U.S., the tax savings will be outweighed by the $3 billion charge.
Furthermore, while GM’s sales in China are slipping, Ford and Chrysler are having success in the region. Ford’s sales in China increased by 3% in 2017, while Chrysler’s sales in China doubled in 2017. This growth in China has helped both companies to offset declines in other markets such as the U.S. and Europe.
Analysts believe that the success of Ford and Chrysler in China can be attributed to their effective localization strategies. Both companies have tailored their models to the Chinese market, offering features such as more legroom and better air filtration systems to appeal to Chinese consumers. They have also ramped up their production of SUVs, which are highly popular in China.
Another factor that sets Ford and Chrysler apart from GM is their ability to effectively manage their balance sheets. Both companies have made strategic moves to reduce their exposure to risks and bolster their cash reserves. For example, Ford recently announced that it will spend $11 billion to restructure its business. This restructuring includes reducing its exposure to sedans and shifting toward more profitable SUVs and trucks. Furthermore, Chrysler has taken steps to reduce its reliance on its parent company Fiat by expanding its partnerships with companies such as BMW and Waymo.
Overall, analysts believe that the deflation of GM’s Q4 earnings expectations is a situation unique to the company, and not indicative of an industry-wide trend. While the U.S. tax reform will impact the entire industry, GM will be particularly hard hit due to its high concentration in the U.S. market. Furthermore, Ford and Chrysler have been successful in China due to their effective localization strategies and their ability to manage their balance sheets effectively. These factors will help to insulate both companies from the impact of GM’s earnings deflation.
Despite GM’s recent setback, the automotive industry remains strong. Carmakers are continuing to innovate and make strategic moves to stay ahead of the curve. Industry analysts remain bullish on the prospects of the auto industry, and expect that Ford and Chrysler will continue to perform well in the coming year.
