DETROIT, MICHIGAN - The United Auto Workers (UAW) has announced that its top negotiator, Rory Gamble, has once again chosen Bill Ford, the Executive Chairman of Ford Motor Company, as the lead representative in contract talks with the Big Three automakers. The decision comes as the UAW prepares to negotiate on behalf of its members for their next four-year labor contract with the three biggest U.S. automakers, General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler.
This year’s negotiations will be closely watched, particularly after the UAW’s 2019 strike against General Motors, which lasted for 40 days, was the longest in recent years and resulted in an estimated $3.6 billion in losses for the company.
“Bill and the Ford team played an instrumental role in helping us reach a pathway to an agreement with General Motors last year,” Gamble said in a statement released on Tuesday. “His experience and deep knowledge of the industry and his commitment to good-paying union jobs for UAW members make him the perfect lead negotiator for our union this year.”
Bill Ford has a long history of working with the UAW and was instrumental in helping the union secure job and profit-sharing guarantees in the 2019 negotiations with General Motors. He has also been a vocal advocate for investing in U.S. manufacturing and providing good-paying jobs for workers.
“I am honored and humbled to once again have the opportunity to serve as the lead negotiator for the UAW in these important contract talks,” Ford said in a statement. “The UAW is an important partner for us at Ford, and we share a common vision for creating good jobs and a strong manufacturing base in the U.S.”
The UAW will begin negotiations in July as the current contracts are set to expire in September. Among the issues expected to be discussed are wages, healthcare benefits, profit-sharing, and job security. The UAW is also likely to press for investment in electric and autonomous vehicle manufacturing, which is seen as a key growth area for the industry.
“This is not just about getting a good contract for our members,” Gamble said. “It’s about securing the future of American manufacturing and rebuilding the middle class. We know we have a tough fight ahead, but we’re ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work.”
With billions of dollars at stake, the negotiations between the UAW and the Big Three automakers will be closely watched by industry analysts and investors. The outcome will not only affect the 150,000 UAW members, but also the millions of people around the country whose jobs, salaries, and communities depend on the auto industry.
