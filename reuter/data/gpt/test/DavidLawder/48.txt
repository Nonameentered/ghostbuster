General Motors' board of directors has reportedly approved a $2.5 billion share buyback program and a 25% dividend hike, both of which are expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Despite these positive moves, however, the company’s Q2 2021 earnings report shows that it failed to meet Wall Street's expectations.
GM's Q2 2021 profit was $2.8 billion, or $1.97 per share, which exceeded the $1.97-per-share prediction by FactSet. However, analysts had anticipated a revenue of $30.9 billion, while GM only brought in a revenue of $27.6 billion. The revenue decrease is largely attributable to the global semiconductor shortage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in reduced production and supply chain issues for the auto industry.
Despite this setback, GM’s board has authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of GM’s outstanding shares, which they expect to complete by the end of 2021. This move highlights the company's commitment to shareholder returns and signals confidence in its future growth prospects.
Additionally, GM's board has declared a third-quarter dividend of 35 cents per share on the company's common stock – a 25% increase from the previous quarter. This represents the 27th consecutive quarterly dividend paid by GM since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009.
While the buyback and dividend increase are both positive indicators, some analysts argue that they fall short of Wall Street's expectations for the company. With declining earnings and revenue, investors had been hoping for more aggressive action on GM's part to boost their earnings per share.
Furthermore, GM’s announcement comes amid an ongoing industry-wide semiconductor shortage, which has forced automakers worldwide to reduce output of their most popular vehicles. As of yet, there is no timeline for when the shortage will be resolved.
At the same time, GM is facing other challenges. The company is in the midst of a major restructuring effort to focus more on electric and autonomous vehicles, and to shift operations away from combustion engine production. It is also facing increased competition from newer electric automakers like Tesla, which has steadily gained ground over the last few years.
Despite these issues, GM is taking steps to stay ahead of the market by investing in research and development for electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology. The company recently announced plans to develop its Ultium battery technology with South Korean firm LG Energy Solution. GM hopes that this partnership will help it to scale EV production and reduce costs.
In conclusion, while GM has taken measures to return value to shareholders, its Q2 earnings report suggests that it has more work to do in order to meet Wall Street's expectations. Despite this, the company remains committed to investing in the future of electric and autonomous vehicles, and looks set to continue its role as an industry leader in the years to come.
