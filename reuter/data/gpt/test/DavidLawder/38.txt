General Motors (GM) announced on Wednesday that it will consolidate all commercial truck production in Flint, Michigan, as a part of a broader cost-cutting strategy that will also result in cuts to engineering work in other areas.
The consolidation will result in the closure of the assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, which has been producing medium-duty trucks for the U.S. market. GM said that about 2,000 workers at the Oshawa plant will be affected. The company said that it plans to redeploy some of the affected workers to other GM facilities in Ontario, while others will be given a chance to retire or take buyouts.
GM's decision to consolidate its commercial truck production in Flint is part of a broader plan to cut costs and streamline its operations. The company said that it expects to save about $6 billion in total annual costs through 2020 as a result of the restructuring.
"We are taking action now while the company and the economy are strong," said GM CEO Mary Barra in a statement. "We are making strategic and bold moves that set us up for success in the future."
GM said that it will also cut engineering work in other areas of the company, but did not provide specifics on which areas of the business would be affected. The company said that it plans to reduce costs by $1.5 billion in engineering alone.
The announcement comes as GM faces increasing pressure from investors to cut costs and improve profitability. The company has faced declines in profitability in recent years, in part due to high costs associated with the production of electric and autonomous vehicles.
GM said that it plans to focus on the production of electric and autonomous vehicles at its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, which will receive a $300 million investment to support the production of a new electric vehicle. The company also plans to invest $1.8 billion to upgrade its manufacturing facilities in eight states over the next three years.
The announcement was met with criticism from some union leaders and politicians. Jerry Dias, the head of Canadian union Unifor, vowed to fight the closure of GM's Oshawa plant.
"Unifor will not accept this announcement and we will fight tooth and nail tooth to protect these jobs," Dias said in a statement.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also expressed disappointment with GM's decision.
"I have confidence in the Canadian workforce and the talent in Oshawa, and I am deeply disappointed in GM's decision," Trudeau said in a statement. "We will work tirelessly with the company and with our partners to support the workers affected by this decision."
The announcement comes as GM is facing increasing competition in the commercial truck market, particularly from Ford, which recently announced plans to invest $11 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next three years.
Despite the challenges, GM remains optimistic about its future prospects. The company said that its restructuring plan will make it more efficient and better prepared to compete in a rapidly changing industry.
"We are transforming into a more agile, resilient and profitable company to create value for all our stakeholders and to lead in a future defined by zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion," Barra said. "We are committed to investing in the U.S., Canada and Mexico to support jobs and the growth of our vehicle portfolio."
