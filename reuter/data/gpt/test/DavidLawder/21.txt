This week, Magna International announced that it will acquire Douglas & Lomason, a leading manufacturer of engineered automotive components, in a deal valued at $135 million. The acquisition will enable Magna to expand its North American seating business, which currently provides complete seating systems and components for major automotive manufacturers.
According to a press release issued by Magna, this acquisition will further enhance its seating capabilities and customer offerings in North America. Douglas & Lomason has a long-standing reputation for providing high-quality metal stamping and specialized welding components to the automotive industry. The Canada-based Magna currently has a long-established reputation across the world for its innovative automotive supply products and solutions.
“By acquiring Douglas & Lomason, Magna continues to strengthen its seating business while also expanding its engineering expertise and providing added value to our customers,” said Mike Bisson, President of Magna Seating North America. “The team at Douglas & Lomason has built an impressive business with dedicated and talented people, and we look forward to having them join the Magna team.”
The agreement between these two industry giants aims to leverage their collective strengths to better serve existing customers and generate new business. The combined business will bring core competencies in seating design, engineering, and manufacturing, reinforcing its position as a leading provider of innovative seating solutions.
“This acquisition is consistent with our strategy of expanding our customer base and enhancing our product offerings through strategic acquisitions,” said Swamy Kotagiri, Magna CEO. “Douglas & Lomason is a well-established company with a solid reputation for quality and innovation, and these strengths align with Magna’s commitment to delivering operational and technological excellence to our customers.”
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval, customary closing conditions and other shareholder approvals.
With this announcement, Magna has once again demonstrated its commitment to growth and innovation. The company has continued to look for opportunities to strengthen its position as a world leader in providing automotive solutions that are both sustainable and efficient, and this acquisition is yet another example of this ambition.
Douglas & Lomason's diverse product portfolio and technical expertise, combined with Magna's specialized seating systems, will allow the businesses to better serve clients while also increasing their knowledge and expertise levels in the automotive space. The company believes this acquisition positions it strongly to meet the evolving needs of the North American automotive market and provide innovative and differentiated solutions to customers.
