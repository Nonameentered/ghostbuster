Chrysler Names Robert Lutz Vice Chairman, Plans New Generation of Managers
Chrysler has named Robert Lutz as its new Vice Chairman and announced plans for a new generation of managers.
Lutz, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest automotive executives of all time, will be responsible for developing and implementing an all-new strategic plan for the company.
At a press conference in Detroit today, Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne announced that Lutz has been appointed Vice Chairman of the company and will oversee all aspects of the company's operations.
"Robert Lutz is one of the most experienced and respected executives in the automotive industry," Marchionne said. "His expertise and leadership will be invaluable as we continue to transform Chrysler into a highly efficient and profitable company."
Lutz, who has previously served as Vice Chairman at General Motors, and has held top executive positions at Ford and BMW, brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to his new role at Chrysler.
"I am extremely excited to be joining Chrysler at this pivotal moment in its history," Lutz said. "I am confident that, with the right strategy and leadership, we can build a strong, profitable, and sustainable company."
In addition to naming Lutz as Vice Chairman, Chrysler also announced plans to develop a new generation of managers. The company plans to recruit and train a new generation of automotive executives who will be better equipped to help the company succeed in the fast-changing automotive landscape.
"We need to prepare our managers for the challenges of the future," Marchionne said. "We need people who are more agile and better equipped to handle the rapidly changing automotive industry."
Chrysler's new strategy will focus on innovative product development, with an emphasis on electric and hybrid vehicles. The company also plans to expand its global presence, with a particular focus on China and other emerging markets.
"Chrysler has a great opportunity to grow and thrive in the coming years," Lutz said. "We have a talented team of engineers, designers, and executives who can create world-class products and deliver great value to our customers."
Chrysler's new strategy has been met with enthusiasm by industry experts. "Chrysler is taking a bold approach to its future," said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com. "The company is investing in new technologies and new leadership in order to stay ahead of the competition."
Chrysler's announcement comes amid a period of significant change in the automotive industry. Environmental concerns and the shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles are driving major changes in the sector, while new entrants like Tesla are disrupting the traditional auto industry.
Chrysler will face stiff competition from established automakers like GM, Ford, and Toyota, as well as upstart electric vehicle makers like Tesla and Rivian. However, with its new strategic plan and the appointment of Robert Lutz as Vice Chairman, Chrysler is well-positioned to compete in this fast-changing landscape.
"We are confident that we can build a sustainable and profitable company," Marchionne said. "We have the talent, the experience, and the vision to succeed in the years ahead."
