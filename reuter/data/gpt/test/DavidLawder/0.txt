Ford, the renowned manufacturer of automobiles, has recently launched its Certified Used Car Program for Ford and Lincoln brands with factory-backed warranties and money-back guarantees. The program aims to provide the customers with an opportunity to purchase pre-owned cars that go through rigorous inspections and meet high standards of quality.
The new program allows customers to purchase used cars with the same confidence they have when they buy new ones. According to Kumar Galhotra, the president of Ford North America, "Customers can drive off the lot feeling confident that their Ford or Lincoln certified pre-owned vehicle is in top condition and backed by Ford and Lincoln."
The certification process includes a 172-point inspection conducted by certified technicians. Once a car passes the inspection, it is given a comprehensive limited warranty backed by Ford of up to 12 months or 12,000 miles. Additionally, the program includes 24/7 roadside assistance, a full vehicle history report, and a money-back guarantee.
If for any reason a customer is not satisfied with their purchase, they have five days or 250 miles to return the car for a full refund. This policy sets the program ahead of other used car programs, providing customers with a higher level of confidence and security.
The program's launch comes at a time when many people are looking for cost-effective ways to purchase vehicles that can provide the same level of quality and safety as new ones. With pre-owned cars being in high demand due to supply chain issues and rising prices of new vehicles, the timing of Ford's introduction of the Certified Used Car Program is ideal.
The program aims to change the perception of the used car market by offering a wide range of quality pre-owned vehicles at a lower cost. Galhotra goes on to say, "We're leveraging our extensive dealership network, expert technicians, and state-of-the-art technology to provide a world-class customer experience."
The program's launch has been well-received by Ford and Lincoln dealerships across the United States. They are already seeing an increase in inquiries and sales since the certification program's introduction.
In conclusion, Ford's Certified Used Car Program is a game changer in the pre-owned car market. It offers customers peace of mind, with factory-backed warranties, and a money-back guarantee. The program will provide customers with an exciting new way to purchase quality pre-owned vehicles. Ford looks forward to seeing its pre-owned sales grow with this new initiative.
