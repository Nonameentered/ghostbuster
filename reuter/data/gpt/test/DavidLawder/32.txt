Detroit - Chrysler Corporation announced record earnings and sales for the 1996 fiscal year yesterday, boosting the American automaker's net income by $2.4 billion to an all-time high of $4.5 billion. The company's profits rose 20 percent even though car and truck sales were flat last year.
Chairman Robert J. Eaton, at a meeting of financial analysts, called the results "an outstanding achievement during a period of intense competition." He said the company's new product cycle, cost-cutting programs and global expansion would lead to even stronger earnings in 1997.
Chrysler, which is one of the world's largest automakers, reported earnings per share of $7.07 in 1996, up 21 percent over the previous year. The company's earnings for the fourth quarter of 1996 were $918 million, or $1.46 a share, up from $756 million, or $1.16 a share, in the same period in 1995.
Chrysler's total sales for 1996 were $61 billion, compared with $58.4 billion in 1995. The company's sales abroad rose 27 percent to $13.1 billion, while U.S. sales slipped to $47.9 billion.
In 1996, Chrysler produced 2.5 million cars and trucks, up slightly from the previous year. The company spent about $7 billion on capital expenditures last year, including $2.6 billion for product development.
Mr. Eaton said the company's new-product cycle, which includes the introduction of the Dodge Durango sport-utility vehicle and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility, will help boost sales in 1997.
Chrysler's cost-cutting programs have also helped the company, Mr. Eaton said. Chrysler saved $1.9 billion last year through a program that reduced the number of labor hours needed to produce each vehicle. The company also saved $400 million through its supply chain management program.
"We have made significant progress in transforming our company and achieving a more competitive position," Mr. Eaton said. "We are well positioned to achieve even stronger results in the future."
