The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating an accident involving Comair flight 3272 that crashed outside of Detroit's Metropolitan Airport on January 9, 1997. The plane, which was a twin-engine Embraer 120 Brasilia, crashed into a field in nearby Ida Township, killing all 29 passengers and crew members on board.
It has now been revealed that the engine on the plane had been replaced just five days before the crash. The NTSB is now looking into whether there was any link between the engine and the accident.
According to the NTSB, the flight's crew had attempted to shut down the plane's left engine and activate the fire extinguishing system just before the crash. The crew was attempting to deal with an apparent engine-related problem, but their efforts were unsuccessful.
The NTSB is examining whether the engine replacement had anything to do with the problem and whether there were any issues with the fire extinguishing system that prevented it from functioning properly.
The Comair flight was scheduled to fly from Cincinnati to Detroit when the accident occurred. The plane crashed just a few miles from its destination. It was a tragic loss of life that is still being felt by the families of those who were on board.
The investigation into the accident has been ongoing for more than two decades. The NTSB has conducted a thorough review of the flight and the plane to determine what may have gone wrong. The agency has collected data from the flight's black boxes, as well as interviewing witnesses and examining the wreckage.
Now, with this new development regarding the engine replacement, the NTSB has another piece of the puzzle to consider. It's not clear yet what the results of the investigation will be, but it's clear that the NTSB is committed to getting to the bottom of what happened.
Comair, once a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, was a regional airline that operated from 1977 until 2012. The airline had a good safety record prior to the accident and was generally well-regarded in the industry.
The NTSB noted in its initial report after the accident that the plane's left engine was found to be producing thrust just before impact. This suggests that the engine was still operating at the time of the crash. The NTSB has not yet released any further information on what may have caused the engine to malfunction or whether the replacement engine had any defects.
The loss of life in the Comair crash was a tragedy for everyone involved. The NTSB's investigation is helping to shed light on what happened and why. It's a reminder that air travel is still one of the safest forms of transportation, but that there is always room for improvement.
The NTSB's investigation into the Comair accident is part of a larger effort to improve safety in the aviation industry. The agency regularly conducts research, issues recommendations for safety improvements, and investigates accidents to prevent them from happening in the future.
For the families of those who were lost in the Comair crash, the investigation has been a long and difficult process. But they remain committed to finding out what happened and preventing similar accidents from happening in the future. The NTSB is working hard to ensure that the lessons learned from this tragedy are not forgotten.
