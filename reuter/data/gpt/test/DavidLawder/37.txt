Detroit, MI – Ford Motor Co. announced on Monday that it has agreed to sell Budget Rent a Car Corp. to Avis Budget Group Inc. for $350 million. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals.
Budget Rent a Car, founded in 1958, is a global car rental company that operates in more than 120 countries, with about 3,500 locations worldwide. In 2019, the company generated $4 billion in revenue, primarily from rental car sales to individual customers and businesses.
Ford acquired Budget Rent a Car in 1987 as part of a larger acquisition of rental car companies. However, the company has been devoting its resources to its core business of manufacturing automobiles, and Budget has not been a strategic priority.
“Selling Budget Rent a Car is consistent with our strategy to focus on our core business and to allocate capital where we can achieve the highest returns,” said Ford CEO Jim Farley. “The sale will allow us to further strengthen our balance sheet and continue to invest in our future.”
Avis Budget Group, based in Parsippany, NJ, is one of the leading global providers of vehicle rental services. The company operates the Avis and Budget car rental brands, which serve customers in over 180 countries. In 2019, Avis Budget generated $9.2 billion in revenue and rented over 30 million vehicles.
The acquisition of Budget Rent a Car will enhance Avis Budget’s market position and customer reach, particularly in the budget car rental segment. The company will benefit from Budget’s extensive global network and brand recognition, as well as the opportunity to cross-sell to its existing customers.
“We are excited to acquire Budget Rent a Car and welcome its talented employees to Avis Budget Group,” said Joe Ferraro, Avis Budget’s CEO. “This acquisition will enable us to accelerate our growth, enhance our fleet management capabilities, and capture meaningful cost efficiencies.”
The deal will also provide Avis Budget with an opportunity to improve the profitability of Budget Rent a Car. The company has been struggling in recent years, due to increased competition from ride-sharing services and declining demand for rental cars.
Under the terms of the agreement, Avis Budget will acquire all outstanding shares of Budget Rent a Car from Ford. The purchase price of $350 million represents a multiple of about 3.5 times Budget’s 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).
The sale of Budget Rent a Car is part of Ford’s ongoing efforts to streamline its operations and improve its financial performance. In recent years, the company has sold off its non-core businesses and invested in new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles.
Ford has also been restructuring its international operations, particularly in Europe and South America, where it has been facing significant challenges. The company recently announced plans to close its manufacturing facilities in Brazil and Argentina, as part of a broader restructuring of its operations in the region.
However, Ford has been performing well in North America, where it generates the majority of its profits. The company is investing heavily in its truck and SUV lineup, which has been popular with American consumers. It is also introducing new electric vehicles, such as the Mustang Mach-E, to compete with Tesla and other electric carmakers.
The sale of Budget Rent a Car is not expected to have a significant impact on Ford’s financial results. The company will use the proceeds from the sale to invest in its core business and pay down debt.
“This transaction is another example of our commitment to allocate capital in a disciplined manner and to focus on the areas of our business where we can drive the highest value for our customers and shareholders,” said Farley.
In conclusion, the sale of Budget Rent a Car to Avis Budget Group for $350 million is a strategic move for both companies. Avis Budget will benefit from Budget’s global network and brand recognition, while Ford will strengthen its balance sheet and focus on its core business of manufacturing automobiles. The deal also reflects the changing dynamics of the transportation industry, wherein traditional car rental companies are adapting to the rise of ride-sharing and electric vehicles.
