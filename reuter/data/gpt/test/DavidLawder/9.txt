Detroit, MI - Chrysler has broken ground on its new $10 million museum that will showcase its rich automotive history. The museum is expected to open to the public in 2022 and will be located in the heart of the city. 
The company has decided to make this investment to celebrate its long history, from its founding in 1925 to its incredible success throughout the 20th century. The museum will house over 400 exhibits, many of which have never been seen before. 
The museum will be located in the former headquarters of Chrysler, which has been vacant since 2010. The building, which is over 90 years old, is being renovated to accommodate the new museum. 
“Our automotive history is something we’re very proud of and we know our customers are too,” said Mike Manley, CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. “We wanted to create a place where visitors can experience the incredible cars, trucks, and other vehicles that have been produced by Chrysler over the last century.” 
The museum will cover Chrysler’s full range of vehicles, from the earliest cars to the most modern vehicles. There will also be exhibits showcasing the company’s innovations and contributions to the automotive industry. 
Chrysler is one of the oldest and most respected automakers in the world. Over the years, the company has produced many iconic vehicles, including the Dodge Challenger, the Plymouth Road Runner, and the Jeep Wrangler. 
“Chrysler has played an important role in the history of the automotive industry,” said Manley. “We’re thrilled to be able to showcase our history and share it with the world.” 
The museum will also feature interactive exhibits to help visitors better understand Chrysler’s history and impact on the automotive industry. There will be opportunities to take virtual rides in classic cars and to see how Chrysler’s advances in engineering have led to the creation of safer, more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
The company has not yet released information on the cost of admission or hours of operation, but it is expected to be a popular destination for automotive enthusiasts from around the world. It is also expected to benefit the city of Detroit by bringing in tourists and boosting the local economy. 
The new museum is just one example of Chrysler’s commitment to its history and its future. The company has been a leader in the automotive industry for over 90 years and has no plans of slowing down anytime soon.
