After months of negotiations, General Motors Corp. (GM) and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union have finally reached a new labor contract agreement. This comes after a contentious bargaining season that saw a historic 40-day strike by GM workers that ended in October.
The new four-year contract was approved by an overwhelming majority of GM's 48,000 UAW members, with 57% voting in favor of the deal. The new agreement includes some significant gains for workers, but also some concessions that the UAW was forced to make to meet GM's cost-cutting demands.
One of the major wins for workers is a path to permanent employment for temporary workers, who have been a major point of contention between the UAW and GM. Under the new contract, temporary workers who have been employed for three years or more will be offered a permanent job with the company. Additionally, workers will receive an immediate 3% pay raise and a lump sum payment of $11,000 each. There will also be a bonus of $1,000 for meeting quality and productivity targets.
However, the UAW was forced to make some concessions in order to get the deal done, including agreeing to a new healthcare plan that will require workers to pay a greater share of their medical costs. The union also gave up on its demand for GM to reopen the Lordstown, Ohio plant, which closed earlier this year, and instead secured a $3 billion investment in other facilities. The union also agreed to a cap on annual wage increases and a reduction in vacation time for new hires.
Despite these concessions, the UAW is touting the new agreement as a major win for workers. "This contract represents a major step forward for our members and their families," said UAW President Gary Jones. "We were able to secure better wages, benefits, and working conditions for our members, while also protecting their job security and giving temporary workers a path to permanent employment."
GM CEO Mary Barra also praised the new contract, saying it "creates a clear path to maintaining GM's competitiveness and future success. It allows for operating flexibility, provides targeted investments and delivers financial benefits for our employees."
The ratification of the new contract marks the end of a long and difficult bargaining season for GM and the UAW. The strike, which began on September 16, was the longest auto industry strike in over 50 years and cost the company an estimated $2 billion. It also put a strain on GM's suppliers, many of whom were forced to lay off workers as a result of the disruption.
The UAW initially called the strike over a number of issues, including wages, healthcare, and job security. However, the major sticking point in the negotiations was the status of temporary workers, who make up a growing percentage of GM's workforce. The UAW argued that these workers should be given the same pay and benefits as permanent workers, while GM insisted that they were necessary for operational flexibility.
After reaching a tentative agreement on October 16, the UAW leadership recommended that workers vote in favor of the deal. However, the vote was delayed by a few weeks as officials worked to count and verify the votes, and to address some accusations of fraud and intimidation during the voting process.
Now that the new contract has been approved, both GM and the UAW will be able to move forward with plans for the future. The company has already announced several new investments in its U.S. facilities, including $1.5 billion for its Flint, Michigan plant and $1.3 billion for its Orion Township, Michigan plant. The UAW, meanwhile, will continue to fight for better conditions and pay for its members, as well as for greater job security in an uncertain economic climate.
