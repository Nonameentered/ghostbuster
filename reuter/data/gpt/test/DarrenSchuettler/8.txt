Canada has made a radical move by banning lap dancing in strip clubs but continues to allow exotic dancers to perform nude at a distance. The decision came in the light of a study conducted by the Canadian government that highlighted the increased likelihood of sexual assault in strip clubs.
The new laws come into effect immediately, with establishments being given a three-month grace period to adjust to the new regulations or risk losing their licenses. "We recognize the cultural importance of strip clubs in some communities, but we cannot ignore the serious risks involved in lap dancing," said Canadaâ€™s Minister for Women and Gender Equality, Maryam Monsef.
The ban on lap dancing refers to the physical interaction between dancers and patrons, where suggestive moves are performed in close proximity to the customer. In many cases, these interactions can lead to sexual assault, with patrons feeling emboldened to touch and grope the dancers. The new law seeks to prevent such incidents by creating a clear boundary between the dancers and the patrons.
Despite these regulations, exotic dancers can still perform nude on stage, albeit at a safer distance from customers. This move has drawn criticism from some quarters, who argue that the new regulations only target the most visible aspects of strip clubs, ignoring the inherent exploitation of the dancers themselves.
"This decision shows that the government is only interested in the optics of the situation and not in the larger issue of exploitation of women in the sex industry," said Nina Liakos, a feminist activist. She argued that strip clubs operate on a hierarchy of power that empowers the owners, managers, and customers at the expense of the dancers.
Despite these criticisms, the move has been welcomed by many other groups who consider it as a significant step forward in addressing gender-based violence and exploitation. "This decision will go a long way in reducing the harm associated with strip clubs and will provide greater protection for women," said Amber DiLeone, a social worker.
In conclusion, Canada's decision to ban lap dancing in strip clubs has reopened the debate around the inherent exploitation of the dancers in these establishments. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the new regulations will provide greater safety for female performers while keeping the sex industry in check. The next few months will reveal whether strip clubs can adapt to the new rules or whether we will see a drastic reduction in the number of establishments across the country.
