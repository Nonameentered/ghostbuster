Bre-X Minerals’ stock saw an impressive surge after rumors and drill results from its highly-regarded Busang Gold Deposit emerged. The Canadian-based gold mining company, which is primarily focused on exploration, drilling, and development of gold deposits, has been the topic of discussion in the mining industry for the past few weeks.
On Monday, Bre-X announced its latest drilling results, which showed an impressive grade of gold minerals in the Busang deposit in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province. It is reported that the deposit may contain as much as 100 million ounces of gold, and discoveries of such magnitude are rare in the industry.
As a result of the announcement, shares of Bre-X soared as traders rushed to invest in the company, pushing its stock price up by more than 75%. Rumors of the deposit’s potential were first reported in September, and since then, Bre-X's shares have been consistently rising, fuelled by speculation about the size and quality of the mineral reserves at Busang.
Several experts in the industry have been weighing in on the subject, and many believe the deposit is indeed a significant discovery. According to Michael Posey, CEO of Posey Mining Company, “It’s not often that such a significant discovery is reported – this is a game-changer for the industry, and it could potentially shift the balance of power when it comes to gold production.”
Dr. Peter L. Ward, professor of geology at the University of Washington, agrees that the Busang deposit is a unique find. “It’s amazing when you think of the potential this deposit has – the deposits in Nevada, which currently hold the largest gold reserves in the world, contain only about half of what Busang is estimated to hold.”
The Busang deposit was discovered in 1995 by geologist John Felderhof, who was working for Bre-X at the time. The discovery was initially hailed as the largest gold deposit ever discovered, sending Bre-X's stock price soaring. However, it was later discovered that Bre-X had falsified its drill results, leading to the company's eventual collapse.
Despite the controversy that surrounded Bre-X’s previous journey to discover gold, most experts agree that the Busang deposit appears to be a legitimate discovery. However, there is still a lot of work to be done before it can be fully assessed as a viable asset. The drilling and exploration will continue, and the company will need to secure financing for further development of the mine.
One thing is clear, the discovery of such a sizeable deposit has already attracted interest from all over the world. Some of the biggest mining companies, such as Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining, have already expressed their interest in a possible partnership with Bre-X. This is a testament to just how significant this discovery could be, and it also bodes well for Bre-X's future as a serious industry player.
It’s too early to determine exactly how much gold is in the Busang deposit, but early estimates are promising, and the speculation surrounding it is likely to continue for some time. For now, it is bringing attention back to Indonesia as a significant player in the gold-mining industry, and it’s giving Bre-X and its investors plenty of reasons to celebrate.
