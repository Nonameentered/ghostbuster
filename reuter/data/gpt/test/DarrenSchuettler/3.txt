Toronto citizens have taken to the streets to protest the Ontario Conservatives' plan to merge the city with several surrounding municipalities, creating what they call a "megacity." The move has been met with widespread opposition, with residents citing concerns about the impact on local services and democracy.
The plan, which was announced by Premier Doug Ford in January, aims to merge Toronto with the cities of Mississauga, Brampton, and the regions of York, Durham, and Halton. The move would create a city with a population of over 6 million people, making it one of the largest in North America.
Opponents of the plan argue that it would lead to a loss of local control over municipal services, such as garbage collection, public transit, and emergency response. They also expressed concern that the merger would lead to increases in property taxes and a reduction in services in outlying areas.
At a rally on Saturday, protesters carried signs reading "Say No to Megacity" and "Hands off Our City." The event was organized by a coalition of community groups from across the city who are opposed to the merger.
One of the organizers, Natalie Karry, said that the proposed megacity plan was "undemocratic" and would lead to a loss of local representation.
"We want to keep our communities intact and have a say in how our local services are run," she said. "The government is proposing this without consulting us, and we won't stand for it."
Other protesters expressed concern about the impact on public services, such as schools and hospitals, and the potential loss of jobs in local government.
"This is an attack on our communities," said Janice Lee, a resident of Scarborough. "It's going to mean job losses, and it's going to mean cuts to services that we rely on."
The Ontario Conservatives have defended the plan, saying that it will lead to cost savings and a more efficient delivery of services. They also noted that the merger has precedent in other major cities, such as Montreal and New York.
"We believe that this is a necessary step to ensure that our city can compete on a global level," said Steve Clark, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. "It will create economies of scale and make our municipal services more effective and efficient."
However, some experts have raised doubts about the effectiveness of the plan. They noted that previous mergers in Canada, such as the amalgamation of Toronto in 1998, have been controversial and have not always delivered the promised cost savings.
"There's no guarantee that merging these municipalities will lead to a more efficient delivery of services or cost savings," said Enid Slack, the Director of the Institute on Municipal Finance and Governance at the University of Toronto. "In fact, it could lead to the opposite result, with increased costs and a reduction in local representation."
The proposed megacity also faces opposition from several mayors and councillors in the affected areas. They argue that the merger would lead to a loss of local control and representation and could lead to a reduction in services or increased taxes for their constituents.
"I don't believe that merging with Toronto is in the best interests of my residents," said Bonnie Crombie, the Mayor of Mississauga. "We have our own identity and our own unique challenges, and we need to be able to address those in a way that works for us."
Despite the opposition, the Ontario Conservatives have indicated that they plan to move forward with the merger. They have appointed a panel to oversee the process and are expected to release a final report early next year.
For Toronto residents, however, the fight against the megacity plan is far from over. Many are planning to continue to protest and organize in the coming months, hoping to put enough pressure on the government to change course.
"We're not going to give up without a fight," said Karry. "Our city is too important to hand over to the government without a say."
