The sex abuse scandal at Maple Leaf Gardens has widened once again, as an ex-employee now faces 50 new charges related to sexual abuse of minors.
The accused, who had previously been charged with 20 counts of sexual exploitation and assault, was originally arrested in November 2018. Authorities allege he abused young boys between 1967 and 1989, both inside and outside the iconic Toronto arena.
The new charges, announced in late August, are the result of new victims coming forward in the time since the ex-employee's initial charges. Many of the alleged incidents took place while the accused was working as a usher or a groundskeeper at Maple Leaf Gardens.
The accused is currently in his late 70s, and is believed to be living in Quebec. He is scheduled to appear in a Toronto courtroom on September 24 to face the additional charges.
The news of the expanded charges has shaken many in the hockey community, and has brought renewed attention to the widespread issue of sexual abuse in sports. In recent years, a number of high-profile cases have rocked several sports, including gymnastics and swimming.
Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the current owner of the arena, released a statement expressing their support for the victims and their commitment to ensuring such incidents do not occur in the future.
"Our thoughts and sympathies are with the victims of these heinous acts, and we stand firmly with them in their pursuit of justice," said the statement. "We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that our venues are safe and secure places for all, and we encourage anyone who has been the victim of abuse to come forward and seek support."
The incident is an unfortunate reminder of the importance of vigilance and accountability when it comes to safeguarding minors in sports, both at the community and professional levels. As more and more victims come forward in cases like this one, it is crucial that we all remain committed to creating a culture of safety and respect in sports.
