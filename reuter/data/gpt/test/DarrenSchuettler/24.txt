Calgary, Alberta, Canada, January 23, 1997 â€“ Today, Bre-X Minerals Ltd. announced in a press conference that they have enough funds to weather the recent controversy surrounding their Busang gold discovery in Indonesia. The CEO and President of Bre-X, David Walsh, also confirmed that an independent audit will prove that the Busang gold deposit is the richest gold strike in history.
The announcement came amidst growing concerns over the legitimacy of the Busang gold discovery. In late 1996, Bre-X claimed that they had found one of the largest gold deposits ever discovered, estimating it to contain 71 million ounces of gold. This led to a surge in the company's stock price, which reached an all-time high of $286 CAD in early 1997.
However, doubts began to arise when independent geologists were unable to confirm the presence of such a large gold deposit at Busang. The Indonesian government also expressed skepticism, and the country's National Mining Institute launched an investigation into the discovery.
In response to the controversy, Walsh stated that he believes the criticism is "unfounded" and "politically motivated." He defended the company's actions, saying that they followed all proper procedures and that the Busang gold deposit is indeed significant.
"We have done everything by the book," said Walsh. "We have followed all proper procedures, and we are confident that an independent audit will confirm the authenticity of our discovery."
Walsh also addressed concerns over Bre-X's financial stability. Following the negative publicity surrounding the Busang discovery, the company's stock price plummeted, and they faced a potential cash crunch. However, Walsh assured investors that Bre-X has enough funds to withstand the storm.
"We have a strong balance sheet, and we are well-funded to see this through," said Walsh. "We believe in the long-term value of our discovery, and we are committed to seeing it through."
Despite Walsh's assurances, some industry experts remain skeptical. John Ing, President of Maison Placements Canada, has been one of the most vocal critics of the Busang discovery. In an interview with the CBC, Ing questioned the feasibility of extracting such a large amount of gold from the deposit.
"This is not a mining camp, this is a wilderness area," said Ing. "The gold is so dispersed, it's like picking a needle out of a haystack."
Other critics have suggested that the Busang discovery may be a case of fraud. In the past, there have been instances of mining companies exaggerating the size of their deposits in order to boost their stock prices. However, Walsh adamantly denied any fraudulent activity on Bre-X's part.
"There is absolutely no fraud here," said Walsh. "We have been completely transparent in our operations, and we have followed all regulations and guidelines. We are confident that the independent audit will prove the authenticity of our discovery."
The independent audit of the Busang gold deposit is expected to be completed by mid-1997. In the meantime, Bre-X's stock price continues to fluctuate, with investors uncertain about the outcome of the investigation.
Despite the controversy surrounding the Busang discovery, Walsh remains optimistic about the future of Bre-X. He pointed out that the company has several other promising gold projects in Indonesia, and that they are actively exploring for additional deposits.
"We are a strong, vibrant company with a bright future ahead of us," said Walsh. "We believe that the Busang discovery is just the beginning, and we are committed to building a successful mining company in Indonesia."
Only time will tell whether Bre-X's optimism is justified. For now, the company and its investors must weather the storm of criticism and uncertainty surrounding the Busang gold discovery.
