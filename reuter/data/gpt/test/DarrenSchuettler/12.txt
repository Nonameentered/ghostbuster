Molson Coors Brewing Company, one of the largest beer producers in the world, has announced plans to expand its operations in China and Latin America despite pushback from shareholders urging the company to initiate a stock buyback program.
In an earnings call on Tuesday, Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley stated that the company is seeking to grow its presence in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China where the beer market is expected to reach $95 billion by 2025. In addition, he revealed plans to expand into several Latin American countries where beer consumption has been steadily increasing.
“Our focus is on driving growth in the regions where beer consumption is growing the fastest,” Hattersley said. “We believe that expanding our footprint in China and Latin America will be key to achieving that growth.”
However, some shareholders have expressed concern over the company’s decision to prioritize expansion over a stock buyback program. In a letter to the Molson Coors board of directors, activist investor Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp urged the company to initiate a $3 billion share buyback plan, citing the company’s “chronic undervaluation.”
“Molson Coors owns leading brands in attractive markets with considerable scale advantages,” the letter stated. “The company’s resulting cash flow generation should enable Molson Coors to take a variety of actions to reduce its undervaluation, such as share buybacks.”
Despite the pressure, Hattersley defended the company’s decision not to pursue a stock buyback program at this time, stating that the company is prioritizing long-term growth over short-term stock price performance.
“We’re confident in our strategy to drive long-term growth, and we believe that investing in expansion opportunities in China and Latin America will help us achieve that growth,” he said.
Some analysts have expressed support for Molson Coors’ decision to focus on expansion in emerging markets, citing the potential for significant growth in these regions.
“China and Latin America represent huge growth opportunities for Molson Coors,” said David Palmer, an analyst at Evercore ISI. “While a stock buyback program may provide a short-term boost to the company’s stock price, investing in expansion opportunities in these markets could yield significant long-term growth.”
Others, however, remain skeptical of the company’s expansion plans, particularly in light of recent challenges facing the beer industry, including declining beer consumption in many established markets.
“Expanding into new markets is always a risky move, particularly when the beer industry is facing significant challenges,” said Mark Swartzberg, an analyst at Stifel. “While there may be potential for growth in China and Latin America, there’s no guarantee that Molson Coors’ expansion plans will be successful.”
Despite these challenges, Molson Coors remains committed to its expansion plans, with Hattersley stating that the company is exploring a variety of potential partnerships and acquisitions to help facilitate its entry into these markets.
“We’re actively looking at opportunities to expand our presence in China and Latin America, including potential partnerships and acquisitions,” he said. “We’re confident that we can successfully navigate the challenges facing the beer industry and achieve long-term growth in these regions.”
Whether or not Molson Coors’ expansion plans will ultimately prove successful remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the company is committed to pursuing growth opportunities in emerging markets, even in the face of shareholder pressure for a stock buyback program.
