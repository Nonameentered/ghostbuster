Freeport-McMoRan, the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, has extended its review of a controversial gold project in Indonesia. The review, which was initially slated to be completed by the end of March, has now been extended until June 30th.
The project in question is the Grasberg mine in the Indonesian province of Papua. The mine is one of the world's largest gold and copper mines and has been the subject of controversy for years due to a range of environmental and social issues.
Freeport-McMoRan has been grappling with a slew of challenges related to the project. In 2018, the company's Indonesian unit agreed to divest a 51% stake in the mine to the Indonesian government. However, negotiations have been slow, and the deal has yet to be finalized.
In addition to talking to the Indonesian government about the divestment, Freeport-McMoRan has also been reviewing its own operations at the mine. The company has been under pressure from environmental groups and investors to improve its record on environmental and social issues.
The Grasberg mine has been the subject of numerous allegations of environmental damage and human rights abuses over the years. Activists have accused Freeport-McMoRan of neglecting its responsibilities to protect the environment and the rights of local communities.
In recent years, the company has taken steps to address some of the concerns. It has invested in new water treatment facilities and has committed to reducing its reliance on riverine tailings disposal.
However, the company still faces criticism from some quarters. Earlier this year, a coalition of environmental and social justice groups launched a campaign calling for Freeport-McMoRan to take stronger action to protect the environment and human rights in Papua.
In a statement announcing the extension of its review, Freeport-McMoRan said it was committed to "continuous improvement" in its operations at the Grasberg mine. The company said it was working closely with the Indonesian government and other stakeholders to address the concerns raised by activists and investors.
"We understand that the Grasberg mine is an important asset for our shareholders, our employees, our host communities, and the Indonesian government," the statement read. "We are committed to ensuring that the mine operates in a responsible and sustainable manner and that we protect the environment and the rights of local communities."
The extension of the review is likely to draw further scrutiny from environmental groups and investors. Some shareholders have already expressed concern about the pace of progress at the Grasberg mine, and it remains to be seen whether the company will be able to satisfy their demands for greater action on environmental and social issues.
However, Freeport-McMoRan's decision to extend the review is a sign that it is taking the criticisms seriously and is committed to addressing the challenges facing the Grasberg mine. With the deadline for the review now pushed back to June, the company will have more time to engage with stakeholders and devise a comprehensive plan to improve its operations at the mine.
