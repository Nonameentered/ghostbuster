TORONTO - Ontario's Finance Minister, Ernie Eves, announced today that the provincial government is on track to balance the books by the year 2000, with the possibility of achieving a surplus.
During a speech to the Canadian Club of Toronto, Eves stated that the Ontario government's deficit has been reduced from $11 billion in 1995 to $7.3 billion in 1997, and is expected to decrease further to $4.3 billion this year.
Eves attributed the turnaround to the government's tough cost-cutting measures and increased revenue from a stronger economy. "We have taken bold action to reduce the size and cost of government while fostering economic growth and job creation," he said.
The finance minister highlighted some of the government's recent initiatives, including the reduction of provincial employees by 15,000, the privatization of Hydro One, and the restructuring of Ontario's health care system.
"We have made the difficult decisions necessary to put Ontario back on track," Eves said.
However, he acknowledged that the road ahead will not be easy, as the government must continue to manage its spending while investing in areas such as education and health care.
"We will remain vigilant and disciplined in our approach," he said.
Eves' announcement was met with praise from some business groups, who see the possibility of a surplus as a positive sign for Ontario's economy.
"Balancing the books is a good way to restore confidence in the province and pave the way for further investment," said the Canadian Federation of Independent Business in a statement.
Others, however, are concerned that the government's focus on balancing the budget could come at the expense of important social programs.
"The government needs to strike a balance between fiscal responsibility and ensuring that Ontarians have access to quality public services," said the Ontario Federation of Labour.
The opposition parties also weighed in on Eves' announcement, with the NDP criticizing the government's record on health care and education, and the Liberals accusing the government of putting the province's economy at risk with its cuts to public services.
"We need to invest in areas like education and infrastructure to make sure that Ontario remains competitive and prosperous," said Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty.
Eves defended the government's record on social programs, stating that the province is spending more on health care and education than ever before, and that there is still room for further investment.
"Our government is committed to ensuring that all Ontarians have access to quality public services," he said.
The finance minister's announcement comes just weeks before the province's 1998 budget is set to be released. While Eves did not reveal any details about the budget, he did say that it will be responsible and "consistent with our efforts to balance the books."
Ontario's improving financial situation is also expected to have an impact on the province's credit rating. Moody's Investor Service recently upgraded Ontario's credit rating to Aa3, citing the province's "good prospects for deficit reduction."
While Ontario still faces challenges in the years ahead, Eves stressed that the province is headed in the right direction.
"We have made significant progress in turning the economic situation around, and our efforts are paying off," he said. "I am confident that we will continue to build a stronger, more prosperous Ontario for generations to come."
