Molson Coors Brewing Company, one of the world's largest beer companies, is facing increasing pressure from shareholders to initiate a stock buyback program and explore overseas acquisition opportunities.
According to a Wall Street Journal report on Tuesday, Molson's shareholders have been urging the company to buy back its shares for some time now. The company's share price has fallen by nearly 40% over the past year due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the global brewing industry.
While Molson paused its stock buyback program last year as it dealt with the pandemic-related challenges, shareholders now want the company to revisit the program. Molson had repurchased $250 million worth of its shares in 2019.
The company is also looking to explore overseas acquisition opportunities to boost its growth prospects. In an interview with the Financial Times last week, Molson's CEO Gavin Hattersley said that the company was "open-minded" about acquiring companies outside the US, where it gets most of its revenue.
According to Hattersley, Molson is interested in acquiring companies in Europe and Asia, where there is strong growth potential for beer and alcoholic beverages.
"Molson Coors has a long-term focus on growth, and we are always exploring options that can help us achieve that goal," Hattersley said in the interview.
Molson isn't the only beer company looking to expand its footprint overseas. Rival companies like Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken are also targeting growth in emerging markets due to slower growth prospects in developed markets.
In recent years, Molson has been working to diversify its product portfolio to appeal to consumers seeking innovative and alternative alcoholic beverages. The company has launched several new products, including hard seltzers and non-alcoholic drinks.
Molson is also working on reducing its environmental impact, with plans to achieve zero waste in its breweries by 2025 and reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2025.
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Molson reported an increase in sales of its hard seltzer brand, Vizzy, during the first quarter of 2021. The company also reported strong sales of its non-alcoholic Heineken 0.0 and Coors Pure brands.
With pressure from shareholders to initiate a stock buyback program and explore overseas acquisition opportunities, Molson is taking steps to ensure its long-term growth prospects. It remains to be seen what specific companies or opportunities Molson will pursue in the coming months.
