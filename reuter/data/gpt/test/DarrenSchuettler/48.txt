In a startling development today, a consultant report commissioned by Freeport-McMoRan confirmed suspicions that the Busang gold project was indeed the biggest fraud in mining history. For decades, the Indonesian mine, owned by Bre-X Minerals Ltd., had been believed to contain one of the largest gold deposits in the world, but last year the discovery was exposed as a hoax, causing the Canadian firm to go bankrupt and scores of investors to lose billions of dollars.
The Freeport-McMoRan report reveals that the gold samples taken from Busang were deliberately salted, or spiked, with gold particles. Salted gold is essentially fraudulent because it gives the impression that there is more gold in a deposit than there really is. In the case of Busang, the salted samples were used to lure investors and drive up the company's stock price.
Bre-X allegedly began salting its gold samples in 1993, when geologist John Felderhof was hired to evaluate the Busang mine. Felderhof, who was eventually acquitted of fraud charges by a Canadian court, was believed to have been instrumental in the Busang fraud. Bre-X claimed that it had discovered a deposit containing 70 million ounces of gold, a find that would have been worth over $100 billion. In reality, the Busang mine contained little or no gold at all.
The Freeport-McMoRan report was commissioned to investigate how Bre-X could have duped so many people for so long. The report points to a number of factors, including lax standards for mineral exploration in Indonesia, a lack of independent verification, and the eagerness of investors to believe in a miracle discovery.
"The Busang fraud was a perfect storm of greed, ignorance, and malfeasance," said Arturo Rodriquez, the lead author of the report. "Bre-X played on people's hopes and dreams, and it worked for a while, until the truth came out."
The report also raises questions about the quality of due diligence carried out by Freeport-McMoRan, which acquired the Busang project from Bre-X in 1997. The report suggests that Freeport-McMoRan may have overlooked warning signs that the Busang gold samples were fraudulent, in its haste to acquire a large gold deposit. Freeport-McMoRan eventually wrote off the Busang project as a total loss.
"The lesson of Busang is that no one should ever rely on a single source of information, especially when billions of dollars are at stake," Rodriguez said. "Investors need to do their own due diligence, and companies need to be transparent and accountable."
The Busang fraud has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries, and legal battles over the years. Many of the people involved in the scandal have since passed away or disappeared, including Bre-X founder David Walsh, who died in 1998 of a brain aneurysm, and Michael de Guzman, the Bre-X geologist who supposedly discovered the gold deposit and then fell to his death from a helicopter in 1996, just days before the fraud was exposed.
Despite the tarnished legacy of the Busang project, some investors and mining companies are still drawn to Indonesia's vast mineral wealth. The archipelago nation is home to some of the world's largest gold, copper, and nickel deposits, and the government has been eager to attract foreign investment to develop these resources. However, the Freeport-McMoRan report serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering investing in Indonesia's mineral sector.
"It's important to remember that Indonesia is a high-risk, high-reward country when it comes to mining," said Rodriguez. "It's a country with great geological potential, but also a lot of political risk, environmental risk, and social risk. Investors need to weigh the risks and benefits carefully before putting their money into a project."
The Busang fraud may go down in history as one of the most egregious examples of corporate wrongdoing, but it also serves as a reminder of the need for transparency, accountability, and ethical behavior in the mining industry. Experts say that companies must be diligent in their exploration methods to prevent further instances of fraud.
"The Busang fraud may have been an extreme case, but it's a reminder that the mining industry needs to be vigilant against fraud, corruption, and other unethical practices," said Rodriguez. "Investors, regulators, and industry groups all have a role to play in ensuring that mining projects are carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner."
