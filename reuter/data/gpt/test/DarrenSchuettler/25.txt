The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) have come together to introduce new regulations for Canada's mining sector. The new rules were introduced on Monday, 18 October, 2021, and are aimed to increase transparency and accountability in mining companies, thereby pushing them to adopt better environmental and social practices.
The mining sector is a crucial aspect of Canada's economy, accounting for approximately 5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Canada is also home to some of the world's largest mining companies, contributing to its global significance. However, the industry has long been criticised for its negative environmental and social impact. Therefore, the collaboration between OSC and TSE hopes to address these longstanding issues.
The new regulations are set to increase disclosure requirements and provide more transparency for investors, which would, in turn, make it easier for the public to hold mining companies responsible for any negative environmental and social practices. According to TSE's guidelines, companies failing to comply with the new rules may ultimately face financial penalties or suspension from trading.
The guidelines require companies to disclose relevant information concerning significant environmental and social issues, including the firm's impact on ecosystems, human rights, and indigenous communities. Additionally, companies are obliged to disclose the impact of their operations beyond their direct boundaries. This requirement is to ensure that they take responsibility for their entire supply chain, from miners to buyers. The companies are expected to report annually and provide clear and concise information on the progress made on their environmental and social objectives.
Both regulators expressed optimism that the additional disclosure requirements would encourage companies to promote sustainable practices while providing more clarity and certainty for investors. The Chairman & CEO of TSE, John McKenzie, said, “Our goal is to help the mining industry strengthen its reputation and social license to operate by enabling investors to make informed decisions about the companies they invest in and hold to account those that do not meet their commitments.”
The Provinces of Quebec and Manitoba already have oversight agencies that comply with the new regulations. These oversight agencies will also be required to adhere to the new regulations, further ensuring the mining industry's transparency and accountability across Canada.
The Canadian mining industry has had a considerable impact on the country's growth and development, however, it has also had adverse effects on the environment and surrounding communities. In recent years, there have been vocal demands for more ethical and environmentally responsible practices by mining companies. As a result, there has been an increase in interest in ethical investments, and investors are now increasingly focusing on Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) issues.
ESG issues have been at the forefront of discussions and development regarding social responsibility in the corporate world. ESG ratings are data-backed assessments that measure the company's adherence to environmental, social, and corporate governance rules. These ratings are used by investors to get insight into companies' ESG performances, allowing them to make more informed investment decisions. Investors and regulators no longer solely focus on financial performance; they now demand that companies fulfil their broader social responsibilities, especially in regards to environmental protection.
The new regulations will also require companies to provide information that will be used in the development of ESG ratings. With this information, investors can perform an ESG assessment of the mining companies, thereby promoting a more responsible investment approach. These disclosure requirements will provide new data allowing investors to better evaluate mining companies' environmental and social impact and align their investments with their values.
The need for transparency and accountability has never been greater, and with the mining industry being central to Canada's economy, the industry must demonstrate higher levels of social responsibility. The OSC and TSE's new regulations are a significant step towards ensuring that companies operating in the mining sector adopt global best practices, stay accountable and transparent and become responsible stewards of Canada's natural resources.
In conclusion, the regulations will increase the mining industry's transparency and accountability and help in creating more responsible investment options. By prioritizing environmental and social responsibility, the mining industry can regain the public's trust while also ensuring the sustainable development of the Canadian economy. By introducing these regulations, Canada has shown its commitment to promoting responsible sustainable practices while also ensuring its leadership in the mining sector.
