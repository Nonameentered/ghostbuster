In what is being called the largest scandal in the history of the mining industry, Bre-X Minerals' Busang gold discovery has been proven to be one of the biggest frauds ever perpetrated on the public.
The story began in 1993 when Bre-X, a small Canadian exploration company, claimed to have discovered the largest gold deposit in the world in the jungles of Borneo. The find was said to contain over 70 million ounces of gold and was valued at over $6 billion dollars.
The stock price of Bre-X skyrocketed from just a few dollars to over $280 per share in a matter of months, making its founders and shareholders instant billionaires.
The company's success attracted the attention of major mining companies such as Barrick Gold and Freeport-McMoRan, which invested heavily in the project, hoping to secure a piece of the massive gold find.
However, in March of 1997, it was announced that the Busang gold deposit was a fraud. A series of independent investigations revealed that the gold deposits had been salted with large amounts of gold dust, samples had been tampered with and that the company had used false assays to inflate the value of the gold find.
The fraud was so large that it bankrupted Bre-X and resulted in millions of dollars in losses for shareholders and investors. It also led to litigation against the company's founders, David Walsh and John Felderhof, who were eventually acquitted of fraud charges years later.
The Bre-X scandal rocked the mining industry and led to increased scrutiny of the practices of mining companies, as well as a greater emphasis on independent verification of mineral deposits.
The scandal also resulted in a change in the way mineral exploration companies are valued. Prior to the scandal, companies were often valued based on the potential of their mining claims, rather than on actual mineral deposits. The Bre-X scandal, however, showed that these valuations could be based on false or misleading information, leading to a reevaluation of the industry's valuation practices.
Today, the Busang gold deposit remains one of the most infamous cases of mining fraud in history and continues to be a cautionary tale for investors and mining companies alike.
