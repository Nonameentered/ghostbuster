Freeport-McMoRan, the US-based multinational mining company, has announced that it is pulling out of the Busang gold project in Indonesia after an independent report revealed "unprecedented" levels of fraud and misconduct within the project.
The Busang gold project, located on the island of Borneo, has been beset by controversy and legal challenges since it was first developed in the 1990s. Freeport-McMoRan acquired a controlling interest in the project in 2017, but has faced criticism from activists and indigenous communities over allegations of land grabbing, human rights abuses, and environmental degradation.
The latest blow to the project came on Friday when an independent report commissioned by Freeport-McMoRan revealed that its predecessor company, Bre-X Minerals, had engaged in "massive and coordinated fraud" to deceive investors and inflate the value of the Busang gold deposit.
The report, which was conducted by forensic accounting firm Kroll and released on Friday, found that Bre-X Minerals had falsified core samples, mined material from outside the project area, and even hired actors to dress up as workers to give the appearance of a functioning mine.
"These findings are deeply troubling and shocking," said Richard Adkerson, CEO of Freeport-McMoRan, in a statement. "We are committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct and transparency, and we cannot continue with this project in light of what we have learned."
The Busang gold deposit was once touted as one of the world's largest gold deposits, with estimates of its value reaching as high as $6 billion. However, these estimates were based on the fraudulent claims of Bre-X Minerals, which had manipulated the core samples to suggest that there was far more gold in the deposit than there actually was.
The fraud was eventually uncovered in 1997, when independent analysts found that the core samples contained little or no gold. Bre-X Minerals collapsed soon after, and its CEO, David Walsh, committed suicide amid the scandal.
Despite the revelation of the fraud, the Busang gold project continued to be developed by other companies, including Freeport-McMoRan. However, the project has faced ongoing challenges, including legal disputes with local communities and environmental activists.
Freeport-McMoRan had recently been granted a 10-year extension on its mining license for the Busang project, but the independent report has made it clear that the company cannot continue with the project in its current state.
"Given the fundamental issues identified in the report, we believe that it would be impossible to operate the project in accordance with our values and commitments to ethical conduct and transparency," said Adkerson.
The decision to pull out of the Busang project comes as Freeport-McMoRan faces increasing scrutiny over its environmental and human rights record in Indonesia. The company operates the world's largest copper and gold mine in the country, and has been criticized by activists for polluting rivers, destroying forests, and displacing indigenous communities.
Earlier this year, a coalition of Indonesian civil society organizations submitted a complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging that Freeport-McMoRan had violated securities laws by failing to disclose the risks of its operations in Indonesia.
Freeport-McMoRan has denied the allegations and defended its record in Indonesia, but the decision to pull out of the Busang project is likely to raise further questions about the company's commitment to responsible mining practices.
"We are committed to conducting our business in a responsible and sustainable manner, and we recognize the importance of engaging with our stakeholders, particularly in communities where we operate," said Adkerson. "We will continue to work to build strong relationships with our host communities and to advance responsible mining practices."
