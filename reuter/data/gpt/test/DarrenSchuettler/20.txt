Toronto, Canada - Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) has announced its plans for a massive share buyback program in a bid to bolster its shareholder value. The bank's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $6 billion worth of common shares over the next 12 months.
The announcement comes as the Canadian economy rebounds from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unprecedented challenges faced by businesses and individuals, RBC has remained stable throughout the crisis, and its financial position has allowed for the expansion of its share buyback program.
RBC's CEO, Dave McKay, stated that the bank's strong capital position enabled the company to execute this repurchase program while still investing in the business for future growth. He added, "The additional investment in RBC reflects our continued confidence in our future, and we remain committed to generating long-term returns for our shareholders."
The bank's share buyback program is expected to benefit current shareholders by reducing the number of outstanding shares, increasing earnings per share and dividends. The program is also intended to support the bank's ongoing growth strategies in its core markets of Canada and the United States.
The buyback program is expected to begin on August 3, 2021 and continue until August 2, 2022. The bank has indicated that the purchases will be made through the Toronto Stock Exchange and another equivalent trading platform. The buyback will be subject to regulatory approval.
Analysts have applauded RBC's decision to launch the share buyback program. John Aiken, an analyst with Barclays Capital, stated, "The increased buyback authorization demonstrates RBC's confidence in its future growth prospects and despite the Canada-wide housing bubble concerns, the bank's strong fundamentals will drive continued earnings growth and capital generation over the next several years."
This announcement follows a positive earnings report for the second quarter of 2021, signaling an uptick in demand for financial services including wealth management, personal and commercial banking, insurance and investment banking services.
Shares in the bank rose four percent following the announcement, to close at CAD 132.91 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. RBC's market capitalization was CAD 189 billion, making it the largest bank in Canada by market capitalization.
In conclusion, RBC's buyback program reiterates the bank's commitment to its customers and shareholders and positions it well for continued long-term growth. The move will undoubtedly have a positive impact by increasing shareholder value and driving RBC's growth in core markets while benefiting current shareholders in the financial year 2021/2022.
