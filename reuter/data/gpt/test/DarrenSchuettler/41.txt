Bre-X's Busang Gold Find May Be in Trouble, Pending Test Results
The fortunes of the Canadian-based mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd. may be in jeopardy, as preliminary results of an ongoing gold analysis suggest that the Busang gold find in Borneo, Indonesia may not be as profitable as initially thought. The report has caused a dip in Bre-X's stock prices, prompting the company to call for a halt in trading while further investigations are carried out.
The Busang gold find was believed to be one of the largest gold deposits in the world, with initial estimates placing the value of the find at around $200 billion. Bre-X acquired the rights to the site in 1993 and began operations with the help of Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc., a US-based mining company.
The gold deposits at Busang were discovered by Bre-X geologist Michael de Guzman in 1995, and the discovery caused a flurry of excitement and speculation in the mining industry. The stock prices of Bre-X skyrocketed, making millionaires out of the company's executives and investors.
However, things began to unravel in March 1997, when the Indonesian government ordered an investigation into the gold deposits at Busang. The investigation revealed that the gold samples submitted by Bre-X were tampered with, and that the company had exaggerated the value of the gold deposits by a significant amount. De Guzman, the geologist who had made the initial discovery, was found dead a few days after the investigation began, in what was ruled a suicide.
Bre-X's reputation was severely damaged by the scandal, and the company filed for bankruptcy in 2002. Investors lost billions of dollars, and the Busang gold find was dismissed as a fraud.
However, in recent years, new investors have taken an interest in Busang, with some believing that there may be gold deposits yet to be discovered. Bre-X's former CEO, David Walsh, had claimed that the company had found a "mother lode" of gold at the site, and some investors believe that his claims may have some merit.
In a move that has drawn criticism from some quarters, a group of investors led by Canadian mining investor John Felderhof acquired the rights to the Busang site in 2013. Felderhof was a former executive at Bre-X and had been charged with insider trading and securities fraud by Canadian authorities in connection with the scandal, although he was acquitted of the charges in 2007.
The current revelations about the Busang gold find could have serious repercussions for Felderhof and his associates, as well as for Bre-X's former executives and investors. The ongoing investigation, which is being carried out by a team of independent experts, aims to determine the true value of the gold deposits at Busang and whether the find is worth pursuing.
The preliminary results of the investigation indicate that the gold samples taken from the site may not be as valuable as previously thought. The experts have cautioned, however, that more testing needs to be done before a definitive conclusion can be reached.
Bre-X's current CEO, J. Brian McAuley, has vowed to cooperate fully with the investigation and has expressed hopes that the true value of the Busang gold find will be established. "We believe that the Busang site still holds great potential for gold deposits, and we are committed to finding out the truth about its value," he said in a statement.
Meanwhile, investors and industry observers are keeping a close eye on the developments at Busang, with many wondering whether the site will prove to be a profitable investment or yet another cautionary tale about the risks of the mining industry.
As the investigation continues, the fate of Bre-X and its high-profile gold find hangs in the balance. The final results of the investigation could have far-reaching consequences for the company, the industry, and investors around the world.
