Barrick Gold Corp. has reported their expectations for higher earnings in 1997, due to increased production in the second half of the year. The gold mining company is anticipating higher earnings after a slow start to the year, with production levels expected to increase in the latter half of 1997.
The company has attributed the higher expected earnings to a number of factors, including the successful implementation of cost-cutting measures, recent acquisitions, and a focus on improving their operational efficiency.
Barrick has set a target of producing around 5.25 million ounces of gold in 1997, which represents an increase of around 5% on the previous year. This target is expected to be reached through the development of new mines, expansion of existing mines, and optimization of existing operations.
According to Barrick’s President and CEO, Jamie Sokalsky, the company is well positioned to take advantage of the improving gold market. He said, “We’re seeing positive momentum in the market, and we’re well positioned to capitalize on that. We have a solid operating platform, with a strong portfolio of assets, and a focus on delivering value to our shareholders.”
Barrick has also recently completed a number of key acquisitions, including the acquisition of Randgold, which has provided the company with access to high-quality mines in Africa. The company has also focused on reducing costs, with cost savings of around $500 million achieved in 2018.
Overall, the company has expressed confidence in their ability to deliver on their targets for 1997. Barrick’s Chief Financial Officer, Catherine Raw, said, “We have a clear strategy in place, and we’re executing on that strategy. We’re confident in our ability to deliver strong earnings growth in 1997, and to continue delivering value to our shareholders.”
