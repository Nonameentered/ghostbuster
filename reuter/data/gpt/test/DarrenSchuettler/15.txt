Bre-X Corporation's announcement of a massive gold discovery in Indonesia is being questioned by partner company Freeport-McMoRan. Bre-X announced on October 8, 1995, that it had found a significant amount of gold in Busang, Indonesia, and company shares soared from $2 a share to $280 a share in just over two years. However, on March 19, 1997, Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world's largest mining companies, cast doubt on Bre-X's claim, sending shares tumbling and throwing the future of the Canadian gold mining company into question.
Freeport-McMoRan issued a press release stating that extensive drilling by its geologists revealed no evidence of significant gold reserves in the Busang area. Freeport-McMoRan had first partnered with Bre-X to explore for gold in Indonesia in early 1994, and the two companies worked on the project together for over two years. Bre-X had said it found 70 million ounces of gold in Busang, which would be worth $70 billion at the time, making it the largest gold discovery in history. But Freeport-McMoRan's assessment countered this claim, saying that Bre-X's gold deposits were "uneconomic."
Bre-X and its stock experienced a dramatic fall following Freeport-McMoRan's move. The Canadian gold mining company saw its shares tumble 83%, falling from $21.50 to $3.75 in just one trading day. The company's reputation, which had previously been boosted by the Busang discovery, was also damaged significantly. In the years that followed, investors and shareholders would file lawsuits against Bre-X, alleging fraud and seeking compensation for the loss suffered. The Indonesian government had also launched an extensive investigation into the claims of the Busang find.
Many individuals involved in the case, including Bre-X's founder David Walsh, company geologist John Felderhof, and Freeport-McMoRan, were under scrutiny. Bre-X was eventually delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1997, and in 1999, Walton International, a subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation, purchased almost all of Bre-X's remaining assets. However, the legal ramifications of the case continued for years, with several lawsuits filed against different parties in the matter.
The fallout of the Bre-X scandal continued to ripple through the mining industry for years after the events unfolded. Many investors and shareholders were left wary of investing in gold mining projects, specifically those in developing countries. Many called on stricter regulations governing mining exploration and reporting of discoveries. The case serves as a cautionary tale to investors and companies involved in the mining industry, highlighting the importance of transparency in reporting and vigilance in verifying claims.
In conclusion, Freeport-McMoRan's doubt of Bre-X Corporation's claim of a significant gold find in Indonesia dealt a severe blow to both the Canadian mining company's reputation and share value. The fallout continued for years, with legal proceedings and investigations taking place. The Bre-X scandal serves as a reminder to investors and companies alike of the importance of due diligence and transparency in all stages of mining exploration and reporting.
