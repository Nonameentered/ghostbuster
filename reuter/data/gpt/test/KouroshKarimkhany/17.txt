Sony has announced a 25% price reduction for its PlayStation gaming console, in a move expected to give a significant boost to the video game industry. The announcement came on Thursday, and the new price will come into effect from next month. The PlayStation 4 Pro console, which was previously being sold for $399, will now be sold for $299, and the PlayStation 4 Slim will cost $199, down from $259.
Sony has taken this step in response to the tough competition in the gaming console market, with rivals such as Microsoft and Nintendo offering similar devices at lower prices. The company has been under pressure to keep ahead of its competitors and maintain a commanding share of the market.
The news has been welcomed by gaming enthusiasts and industry analysts alike. According to experts, the move could increase the number of PlayStation users and, in turn, boost game sales, which have slowed down in recent years. Sony expects the price reduction to lead to an increase in overall sales and a positive impact on revenue.
Sony’s gaming division has been growing steadily over the years, largely due to the popularity of the PlayStation console, which has sold more than 110 million units since it was launched in 2013. In the last quarter, Sony's gaming business has pulled in $5.63 billion in revenue. Sony is also set to release its highly anticipated PlayStation 5 console in time for the holiday season, which is expected to drive the company's revenue even higher.
The video game industry, which has suffered a slump in its fortunes over the last decade, may see a comeback with Sony's announcement. The pandemic has given a boost to gaming, as more people have been working from home, and social distancing measures have limited social interaction. The gaming industry has reported huge sales volumes in recent months with games such as Animal Crossing: New Horizon and The Last Of Us Part II garnering widespread popularity.
Sony’s chief executive, Kenichiro Yoshida, has said, "The gaming industry is a high-growth and stable business opportunity that has come into the spotlight more than ever in the recent times as a broader entertainment-industry due to people staying at home." 
The price reduction is welcome news for gamers who have been hesitant to purchase the PlayStation console due to its high price point. With the new pricing, Sony expects to lure in new customers, who may be more inclined to buy the device. Sony's decision could have a ripple effect on the industry, prompting rivals to reduce their prices to match Sony's.
In conclusion, Sony's price reduction could give a significant boost to the gaming industry at a time when it is most needed. With the launch of the new PlayStation 5 console, Sony is likely to see sales surge, and its revenue grow. The company's decision to reduce the price of its products is a smart move that could prove to be a game-changer in the industry.
