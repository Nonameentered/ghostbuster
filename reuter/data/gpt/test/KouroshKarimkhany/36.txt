Cupertino-based tech giant, Apple, has reported a staggering $708 million loss in its second quarter, despite recording strong sales of new PCs and laptops, leaving analysts scratching their heads as to why the company ran at a deficit.
In a statement released yesterday, Apple announced a revenue of $89.6 billion for the period spanning January 1, 2022, through to March 31, 2022. The figure exceeded the $77.4 billion revenue it garnered in the same period in 2021, representing a 16% year-on-year growth. Surprisingly, the company's net profit fell close to 35% as it recorded a loss of $708 million.
Apple's financial statement showed that it shipped about 25 million Mac devices in the quarter, compared to 21.7 million in 2021 â€” a 14% increase. The average sale price of a MacBook was $1,267, generating a 12% increase in revenue. The new MacBook Air and MacBook Pros models received widespread demand in the quarter.
Additionally, Apple's iPad sales surged to $9.8 billion, thanks to strong demand from remote work and schooling. The company noted that iPad sales rose by 11% YoY, with shipments reaching 14 million devices. Meanwhile, the iPhone recorded a decline in sales, with revenue slumping by 6% YoY to settle at $45.6 billion. The company sold 52.2 million iPhones, an apparent 11% decrease YoY.
Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, attributed the otherwise good results to the company's push for diversification in its product line. He emphasized that Apple focuses more on producing high-end products to boost its bottom line than churning out large volumes at reduced prices. Cook said, "We remain satisfied with our performance, particularly given the economic uncertainty that surrounds the global pandemic."
Several analysts speculate that Apple's loss may have been due to significant legal fees in its ongoing patent war with Qualcomm. After losing a legal tussle with Qualcomm in 2021, Apple has been paying a substantial amount in licensing fees. Also, the company's recent expansion into new markets worldwide is said to have compounded its expenses.
Apple has continued to work on new products, including exploring the possibility of creating an electric car. The company has also been working on its augmented-reality (AR) glasses, which are set to be unveiled to the public next year.
Despite the loss, Apple remains one of the most capitalized companies in the world, with cash reserves of over $200 billion. The company has continued to invest heavily in research and development, with a 31% YoY increase in its R&D budget, which now stands at $4.5 billion.
Apple's stock price has been relatively stable, settling at $134.16 at the end of trading on Thursday despite the reported loss, signaling that investors remain upbeat about the company's future.
In conclusion, Apple's quarterly results have revealed mixed fortunes for the company, with unprecedented losses despite surging sales. The company's future prospects remain positive, with the release of its AR glasses and electric car set to usher in a new era of technological innovation.
