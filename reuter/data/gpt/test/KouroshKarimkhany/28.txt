Informix Corp. shares plummeted by over 20% following the company's announcement of weaker-than-expected sales and substantial losses reported in the first quarter of the year.
The technology company recorded a loss of $56.5 million or 36 cents per share in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $45 million or 29 cents per share a year earlier.
The company's revenue also declined to $256.8 million from $282.9 million in the first quarter of the previous year, reflecting a 9.2% drop in sales.
The decline in revenue was attributed to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted supply chains and caused a general slowdown in economic activity around the world.
"We expected the pandemic to have an impact on our business, but the decline in revenue was greater than we anticipated," said Informix CEO Barry Smith in a statement.
The company's stock fell by over 20% immediately after the announcement, with investors concerned about the company's ability to weather the ongoing economic downturn.
Informix, which specializes in database management solutions, faces stiff competition from larger rivals such as Oracle and IBM, which have been able to maintain strong revenue growth despite the pandemic.
Analysts have expressed concern about the company's long-term prospects, given the continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the economic recovery.
"With the pandemic expected to continue for the foreseeable future, it's unclear how much longer Informix can sustain losses of this magnitude," said Michael O'Brien, an analyst with investment firm J.P. Morgan.
The company has already taken steps to cut costs, including reducing headcount and trimming its marketing budget.
However, some analysts have suggested that further measures may be necessary if the company is to stay afloat.
"Informix needs to find a way to boost sales and cut costs if it wants to survive in the long term," said David Klein, an analyst with investment bank Goldman Sachs.
The company's shares are currently trading at around $15, down from a high of over $25 earlier in the year.
Despite the challenges facing the company, CEO Barry Smith remains optimistic about its future prospects.
"Although the pandemic has posed significant challenges for us, we believe that the investments we have made in our technology and our people will enable us to emerge stronger from this crisis," he said. "We remain committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders and customers."
