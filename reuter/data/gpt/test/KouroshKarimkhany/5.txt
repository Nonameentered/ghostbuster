Cupertino, California - Apple's attempts to turn the company's fortunes around have come unstuck once again, with a report released yesterday revealing that the company has sustained further losses over the past quarter. Furthermore, with rumors circulating of potential job cuts on the horizon, the question of when - or if - Apple can return to its former glory hangs heavy in the air.
According to a report released yesterday, the company's quarterly revenue figures have fallen by an alarming 20%, compared to the same period last year. Total revenue for the quarter topped out at $58.8 billion - a figure which, although still higher than most companies could ever dream of, represents a loss of over $14 billion compared to Q2 2019.
Perhaps even more worrying for Apple, the report also revealed that net income for the quarter came in at $11.25 billion - again, an impressive figure in and of itself - but a sharp drop from the $15.8 billion net income the company posted in the second quarter of last year. The primary driver behind the disappointing figures is being attributed to a drastic reduction in iPhone sales - traditionally Apple's cash cow - as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take its toll on consumer demand.
CEO Tim Cook was quick to address the disappointing figures in a statement released alongside the report: "These are tough times for everyone, and Apple is no exception. We've been hit hard by the pandemic, and we know that our customers are feeling the pinch too. Nevertheless, we believe that Apple still has a strong future ahead of it, and we'll be doing everything in our power to put the company back on the road to success."
Nonetheless, despite Cook's bullish statement, whispers of potential layoffs within the company have been circulating for some time now. With Apple's core business of iPhone sales currently in freefall, it's anyone's guess as to where the company may look to slim down in order to weather the storm.
One indication of potential job cuts could be seen in Apple's latest earnings statement, which showed that the company's research and development spending had remained flat over the past six months, despite the fact that many of Apple's core technologies - such as the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook - are in desperate need of a refresh.
Additionally, many analysts are pointing to Apple's recent decision to slash the prices of its flagship devices as a sign that the company is struggling to shift units. While this may be good news for consumers, it's unlikely to be a sustainable business strategy in the long run, particularly given the tight margins that Apple operates on.
For many, the question of what Apple can do in order to return the company to its former glory is one that will be crucial in the coming months. Some have suggested that Apple may need to move away from its current focus on hardware - and instead invest more heavily in the software and services sectors, such as the company's recently-launched Apple TV+ streaming service.
Others have pointed to potential new markets for Apple to target - such as the healthcare or automotive industries - in an attempt to diversify away from its current heavy reliance on the fickle consumer technology market.
Whatever Apple decides to do, there can be no doubt that the coming months and years will be crucial in determining the future of the company. With the pandemic showing no signs of letting up, and with Apple's core business currently in decline, it's clear that some tough decisions will need to be made if the company is to continue to thrive in the years to come.
For now, all eyes will be on Tim Cook and his team to see what steps they'll take next. But with Apple's turnaround plans faltering in the face of continued losses and potential layoffs looming, the road ahead looks to be a rocky one.
