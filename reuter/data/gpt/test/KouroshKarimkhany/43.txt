Citrix Stock Soars 69% As Microsoft Licenses Software Technology For Upcoming Windows NT Versions
Citrix Systems Inc. stock took off, soaring 69% in trading on Monday, as Microsoft Corp. licensed Citrix's software technology for use in its upcoming Windows NT versions. The move is expected to expand Microsoft's dominance of the desktop market and make it easier for companies to centralize applications and manage their information technology infrastructure.
Citrix's software technology, known as XenApp, allows companies to run applications on servers rather than individual computers. This means that applications can be accessed from any location and shared by multiple users, making it easier to manage and control software and data across an organization.
"By incorporating Citrix's technology into Windows NT, Microsoft is positioning itself to be the leader in application delivery and management, which is critical for businesses that need to efficiently manage their IT infrastructure," said David Henshall, Citrix's chief financial officer.
This news comes after months of speculation that Microsoft and Citrix were in talks. The licensing deal is expected to be a boon for both companies, with Citrix gaining greater exposure to Microsoft's massive customer base and Microsoft gaining access to a key technology that helps it compete against other desktop software vendors.
"This agreement is a testament to the strength of the relationship between Citrix and Microsoft, and it will enable us to deliver even more value to our customers and partners," said Mark Templeton, Citrix's CEO.
Analysts are bullish on the deal, with many seeing it as a significant win for Citrix. "This is a huge validation of Citrix's technology and a major milestone for the company," said Michael Turits, an analyst at Raymond James.
Citrix's stock closed up $26.30, or 69%, at $63.97 on Monday, one of the biggest gains for a technology stock in recent memory. The company's stock has been on a tear lately, up nearly 200% over the past year, fueled by strong demand for its XenApp software.
Microsoft has been making a big push into cloud computing and other areas that rely heavily on centralized computing. The licensing deal with Citrix will help it better compete against other cloud software vendors, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.
"This licensing agreement further strengthens our desktop and application virtualization offerings and supports our ongoing commitment to delivering innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers," said Brad Anderson, corporate vice president of enterprise mobility and security at Microsoft.
As Citrix's stock continues to soar, many investors are betting on continued growth and profitability for the company. With its technology now a critical part of Microsoft's desktop software strategy, Citrix is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing trend of centralized computing and application management.
