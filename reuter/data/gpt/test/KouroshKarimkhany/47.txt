Apple is all set to release a new operating system that can run Mac software on personal computers with Intel chips and the Microsoft Windows operating system. The announcement was made by Apple during the virtual Worldwide Developers Conference, held on 7th June 2021. The new operating system, called MacOS Monterey, is expected to be released later this year.
This new feature is a significant shift for the company, which has long been known for its exclusive hardware and software integration. This development is expected to bring a major change in the personal computing landscape, as it will allow users to use Mac software on a standard Windows laptop or desktop computer.
With the release of MacOS Monterey, Apple is bringing its popular iOS applications to the Mac operating system. This means that popular iPhone apps such as FaceTime and iMessage will now be available on Mac computers. The new operating system also includes universal control, which will allow users to operate their Mac and iPad together using a single keyboard and mouse.
According to Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, the new operating system is designed to seamlessly integrate with the users' existing workflows. He said, "With macOS Monterey, we're bringing powerful new features to the Mac, including the ability to run thousands of iPhone and iPad apps right on your Mac, a new way to work across multiple devices, and more."
Apple has also introduced a new feature called "Focus", which lets users create custom focus modes that can be used to filter out notifications and distractions. The feature can be customized for work, personal time, reading, and more.
The new operating system also includes updates to the Safari web browser, including a new tab design and an improved feature that blocks third-party trackers. Digital identification cards that can be stored in the Apple Wallet app are also being introduced in the new MacOS Monterey, including driver's licenses and state IDs.
The new operating system also brings more advanced tools and features for developers, including Xcode Cloud, a new platform for building and testing applications. This new system will allow developers to create and test their applications on Apple's cloud infrastructure.
In conclusion, the new operating system MacOS Monterey, with its ability to run Mac software on personal computers with Intel chips and Microsoft Windows, is expected to bring significant changes to the personal computing world. The new features and updates will provide a better user experience, improved workflow, and more advanced tools for developers.
