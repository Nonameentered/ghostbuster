AirTouch Communications, a leading global provider of wireless communications services, has announced that it will acquire the cellular phone operations of U S West Media Group for a total price of $4.5 billion in stock and debt. This move further strengthens AirTouch’s position as one of the largest wireless communication service providers in the world.
The acquisition includes U S West’s 1.2 million cellular phone customers, as well as their current network infrastructure and valuable mobile spectrum licenses. AirTouch will assume U S West's network operations and related facilities, ensuring that service to U S West’s customers is not disrupted during the transition period.
“We are excited to announce this acquisition, which will significantly enhance our already strong presence in the US market. We are confident that the addition of U S West’s cellular phone operations will provide us with immediate and long-term strategic benefits,” said Sam Ginn, Chairman, and CEO of AirTouch Communications.
The acquisition will be completed through the issuance of approximately 80 million shares of AirTouch common stock, with a total value of $2.5 billion, and assumption of approximately $2 billion of U S West’s existing debt. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval.
U S West Media Group’s President and CEO, Sol Trujillo, stated, “We are pleased to have reached an agreement to sell our cellular phone operations to AirTouch, a company that shares our commitment to providing outstanding service to our customers. This transaction will allow us to focus on our core businesses, while our customers will continue to receive quality service from a proven wireless communications provider.”
AirTouch Communications has been aggressively expanding its wireless communications services, particularly in the US market. The company has been investing heavily in its next-generation network infrastructure, including its new “digital PCS” wireless technology, which has been successfully deployed in many major cities across the US.
This acquisition represents a significant step forward for AirTouch’s growth strategy, as it adds a substantial number of customers to its already impressive roster of subscribers. It also provides access to valuable spectrum licenses that will enable AirTouch to further expand and enhance its network capacity and coverage, as well as improve the overall quality of its services to its customers.
In conclusion, the acquisition of U S West Media Group’s cellular phone operations by AirTouch Communications is a significant development in the wireless communication industry. With its expanded customer base, improved network infrastructure, and valuable spectrum licenses, AirTouch is well-positioned to deliver even better services to its customers, while continuing its growth trajectory in the US and beyond.
