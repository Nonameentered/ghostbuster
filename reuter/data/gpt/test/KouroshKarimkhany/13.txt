Versant Object Technology Corp Expects to Continue Business with MCI Despite Stalled Project, Says CEO
Versant Object Technology Corp, a software development company specializing in object-oriented databases, has announced that it expects to continue its business relationship with MCI, a leading telecommunications company, despite a project that has been stalled due to delays in MCI's acquisition by Verizon.
The project in question involves the development of a network management system that would allow MCI to monitor its vast network of communication infrastructure more effectively. Versant Object Technology was chosen to develop the system in late 2019 and was making good progress before the pandemic hit, causing delays in the project. The delay was then further exacerbated by Verizon's acquisition of MCI, which has put the project on hold.
However, Versant Object Technology's CEO, Shawn McArthur, has assured investors that the company's relationship with MCI remains strong and that they are committed to seeing the project through to completion. "We have a long-standing relationship with MCI, and we understand the challenges that they are facing," he said. "Our team has been working closely with MCI to ensure that we are ready to resume the project as soon as possible."
McArthur added that the company has been able to capitalize on the delay by using the extra time to refine the network management system, making it more robust and adaptable to any future changes in MCI's infrastructure. "We have taken advantage of this extra time to really make sure that the system we are developing is going to be the most efficient and effective one for MCI," he said. "We want to ensure that when the project is finally completed, it will be something that can help MCI be even more successful."
Versant Object Technology has a strong reputation in the software development industry, with over two decades of experience in creating object-oriented databases. The company's expertise in this area has made it an attractive partner for telecommunication companies like MCI, who rely on complex networks to deliver their services. The network management system being developed by Versant Object Technology for MCI is expected to be a game-changer, allowing the company to monitor its infrastructure more closely and respond more quickly to any issues that arise.
Despite the delays in the project, Versant Object Technology remains optimistic about the future of its business relationship with MCI. The company has continued to provide support to MCI throughout the pandemic, and McArthur said that he was confident that the project would eventually be completed to the satisfaction of both parties.
"We believe in the value of this project and the potential it has to help MCI achieve its goals," he said. "We are committed to seeing it through to completion and to continuing to work with MCI to provide them with the best possible software solutions for their business."
