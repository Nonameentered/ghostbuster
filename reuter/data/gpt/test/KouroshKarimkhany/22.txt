3Com, a leading network infrastructure provider, reported a 17% increase in profits for the third quarter of 2021 and predicted a further pickup in business during the fourth quarter.
The company, which is headquartered in Santa Clara, California, announced that its net income for the three months to February 28 had risen to $87 million, up from $74 million during the same period in 2020. Meanwhile, revenue increased by 5% to $1.3 billion.
Eric Benhamou, 3Com's chairman, gave an upbeat assessment of the results, describing them as "solid" and pointing to the company's continued investment in research and development as a key factor in its success.
"We're seeing very strong demand for our networking solutions in a variety of markets and geographies around the world," he said. "Our customers are looking for high-quality products that are reliable, secure, and easy to use, and we're delivering on that promise."
Among the markets that have seen particularly strong growth are healthcare, education, and government, according to Benhamou. He added that 3Com's partnerships with leading technology companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, have also helped to drive demand for its products.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Benhamou predicted that business would continue to pick up, thanks to a number of factors, including the ongoing rollout of 5G technology and the increasing importance of cybersecurity in a world where remote working has become the norm.
"We're seeing a lot of interest from customers who are looking to upgrade their infrastructure and improve their security posture," he said. "We're also seeing strong demand for our wireless and cloud-based networking solutions, and we expect that to continue in the coming months."
The company's results were broadly in line with analysts' expectations, with many pointing to the continued strong demand for networking and cybersecurity products as a key driver of growth in the sector.
"3Com is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing digital transformation that is taking place across a range of industries," said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. "They have a strong product portfolio and a very loyal customer base, which should help drive growth in the coming quarters."
However, there were some concerns raised about the company's reliance on a few key customers, with around 20% of its revenue coming from just three customers. Some analysts also questioned whether 3Com's continued investment in research and development was sustainable in the face of increasing competition from other technology giants such as Cisco and Juniper Networks.
Despite these concerns, 3Com's leadership remained upbeat about the company's prospects, pointing to its strong financial position and solid balance sheet as evidence of its ability to weather any short-term challenges.
"We're confident that we're on the right track," said CEO Bob Mao. "We're continuing to invest in our business and our people, and I'm very proud of the progress we've made over the past year."
Mao added that the company was focused on expanding its customer base, particularly in emerging markets such as China, where it already has a significant presence. He said that 3Com was also looking to diversify its product offerings, with a particular focus on cloud-based solutions and the internet of things.
"We're constantly looking for new ways to leverage our expertise in networking and security to help our customers achieve their business goals," he said. "And with the ongoing support of our shareholders and employees, I'm confident that we'll continue to succeed in the years ahead."
