According to a recent report released by Dataquest, global PC shipments increased by a staggering 18% in 1996. The report also showed that Compaq, IBM, and Dell led the way in sales, while Apple suffered the biggest decline.
Compaq had the highest number of shipments in 1996, with over 8.5 million units sold. IBM followed closely behind with around 7.5 million units sold, and Dell came in third place with nearly 4.5 million units sold. These companies dominated the PC market, with their combined sales accounting for over 50% of all PC shipments worldwide.
In contrast, Apple experienced the biggest decline in sales, with its shipments dropping by over 27% in 1996. This could be attributed to various factors, including the company's high prices, lack of innovation, and fierce competition from other PC manufacturers.
Dataquest also highlighted the increased demand for portable PCs in 1996, with laptop sales growing by over 60%. This trend was driven by advancements in technology, such as longer battery life and improved processing power, making laptops a more convenient and efficient option for both personal and professional use.
The report also revealed that the United States remained the largest PC market in the world, accounting for 30% of all shipments. Japan followed closely behind, with a 16% share of the market, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined accounted for 34%.
Analysts predict that the PC market will continue to grow in the coming years, fueled by advancements in technology and the increasing demand for personal computers across various industries. However, the competition among PC manufacturers is expected to intensify, with new players entering the market and established companies constantly innovating to stay ahead.
Overall, the 1996 PC market was marked by significant growth and domination by a few major players, while Apple suffered a notable decline. As technology continues to evolve, it remains to be seen which companies will come out on top in the ever-changing world of personal computers.
