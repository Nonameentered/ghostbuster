The video game software industry has bounced back with a strong December quarter, with the industry’s revenue increasing by almost 20% YoY. The sector, which had been facing headwinds over the past few years, has seen a resurgence in demand and has benefited from the pandemic-driven shift towards more digital entertainment.
According to data released by the Interactive Entertainment Software Association (IESA), the industry’s revenues for the December quarter stood at $12.6 billion, up from $10.5 billion in the same quarter last year. The strong performance was driven by strong sales of both console and mobile games, as well as subscription-based services.
The console gaming segment, which involves games played on gaming consoles like PlayStation and Xbox, witnessed tremendous growth during the quarter. With the launch of the next-generation consoles by both Microsoft and Sony, the segment recorded a YoY growth of 29%. Sony’s PlayStation 5 led the way, with record sales in the first month since its launch in November.
The mobile gaming segment also recorded a strong growth of 28% YoY, driven by increased adoption of smartphones and mobile devices, as well as the popularity of games like Among Us and Genshin Impact. The segment has been a boon for smaller game developers, who have been able to reach a wider audience through app stores like Apple’s App Store and Google Play.
Another contributing factor to the industry’s success was the shift towards subscription-based models, which have become increasingly popular among users. Subscription-based services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Now, which offer access to a library of games for a monthly fee, have seen a significant increase in subscribers during the quarter.
Overall, the strong performance of the video game software industry is a welcome reprieve for the sector, which has been grappling with declining revenue and sales over the past few years. With the pandemic accelerating the shift towards digital entertainment, the industry is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory in the coming years.
Looking forward, the industry is poised to benefit from the launch of new games and consoles, as well as the increasing popularity of e-sports and streaming services. The industry’s resurgence has also sparked renewed interest from investors, with several companies in the space going public through IPOs or SPACs. The future of the industry looks promising, with the momentum likely to continue in the years to come.
