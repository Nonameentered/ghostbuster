Federal-Mogul Corp., a leading global supplier of auto products, recently announced that it will undergo a massive restructuring that will result in the loss of 2,900 jobs. The move is part of the company's ongoing efforts to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.
According to a press release issued by the company, the restructuring will involve the consolidation and optimization of manufacturing, engineering, and administrative facilities around the world. The goal is to create a more streamlined and efficient organizational structure that can better support the company's products and services.
As part of the restructuring, Federal-Mogul will be closing some of its less profitable facilities and consolidating operations into larger, more efficient facilities. The company expects to incur restructuring charges of $225 million to $275 million over the next few years, which will be primarily related to employee severance and facility closure costs.
Federal-Mogul's CEO, Rainer Jueckstock, said that the restructuring is necessary to support the company's long-term growth and profitability. "We need to be more agile, more responsive, and more efficient in everything we do," he said. "This restructuring will help us achieve that goal."
The company expects that the restructuring will result in annual cost savings of $160 million to $200 million once fully implemented. These savings will come from a combination of reduced overhead costs, improved productivity, and greater operational efficiency.
In addition to the job cuts, the restructuring will also result in changes to the company's management structure. The company plans to consolidate its four business units into two divisions – Powertrain and Motorparts – which will be led by new executive leadership teams.
The Powertrain division will focus on providing products and services to the commercial vehicle, industrial, and aftermarket segments. The Motorparts division will focus on providing products and services to the automotive aftermarket.
Jueckstock said that the new organizational structure will allow the company to leverage its strengths and expertise in each of these areas. "By better aligning our organizational structure with our customer segments, we will be able to provide more targeted, innovative solutions to our customers," he said.
The announcement of the restructuring comes as Federal-Mogul is facing increasing competition in the global automotive industry. The company has struggled to maintain its market position in recent years, as low-cost competitors from Asia have gained market share.
The company's revenue has also been impacted by declining demand for certain products in the automotive industry. According to the company's most recent financial statements, revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was down 4.5% compared to the same quarter in the previous year.
Despite these challenges, Jueckstock said that he is confident that the company's restructuring efforts will help it to remain competitive and grow in the future. "We have a strong portfolio of products and services, and a talented and dedicated workforce," he said. "With the right organizational structure and focus, I believe that we can succeed in this competitive market."
The company expects that the restructuring will be completed by the end of 2022, with most of the job cuts occurring in 2021. The company will provide severance packages and other support to affected employees.
In conclusion, Federal-Mogul Corp.'s massive restructuring plans and imminent job cuts mark a pivotal moment for the global auto products supplier as it navigates through a highly competitive industry. Despite the challenges, the company remains confident that the restructuring will enable it to achieve sustained growth and profitability in the future.
