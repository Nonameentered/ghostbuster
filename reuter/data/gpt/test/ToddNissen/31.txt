Federal-Mogul Corp, a leading American manufacturer of advanced automotive technologies, has announced that it is selling its global auto parts retail empire to focus on its core business. The company has been a major player in the auto parts industry for several decades, but in recent years has shifted its focus towards developing cutting-edge technologies for cars and trucks.
The decision to divest its retail operations is part of a broader strategy to streamline the company's operations and concentrate on its core strengths. According to the company's CEO, Rainer Jueckstock, the move will allow Federal-Mogul to invest more resources into research and development, and to continue to position itself as a leader in the automotive technology space.
"Over the past several years, we have made significant investments in our core technology platforms, including powertrain, electrification, and braking," Jueckstock said in a statement. "We are now in a position where we believe that divesting our auto parts retail empire is the best course of action to optimize our focus and resources, and to drive continued growth for our business."
Federal-Mogul's retail empire includes several well-known brands such as Wagner Brake, Moog Steering and Suspension, and Champion Spark Plugs. The company also operates a network of retail locations across North America and Europe. The retail business generated approximately $4 billion in sales in 2020, which accounted for roughly 20% of the company's total revenue.
The decision to sell the retail business has been well received by investors, who have long pushed the company to focus more on its core strengths. Following the announcement, shares of Federal-Mogul rose nearly 10%, to an all-time high.
"Federal-Mogul has been a great company for many years, but it's clear that the future of the automotive industry lies in advanced technologies like electrification and autonomous driving," said Jack Smith, a senior analyst at Morningstar. "By divesting its retail business and doubling down on its core strengths, Federal-Mogul is positioning itself to be a major player in these emerging markets."
The sale of Federal-Mogul's retail operations is expected to generate significant cash proceeds, which the company plans to use to invest in key growth areas and to pay down debt. The company has not yet disclosed the terms of the deal, but it is expected to close later this year.
Overall, the move to divest its retail empire is a bold and strategic decision for Federal-Mogul. By focusing on its core strengths in advanced automotive technologies, the company is positioning itself to succeed in the rapidly evolving automotive industry. With a solid financial position and a clear vision for the future, Federal-Mogul is poised to remain a leader in the automotive space for years to come.
