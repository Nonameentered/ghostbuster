Ford Motor Co. has announced its plans to idle its production lines in the United States for at least two weeks starting August 9th as talks with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union and its key supplier, Johnson Controls, continue to resolve a dispute over seat plant workers at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant.
The Flat Rock plant, which primarily assembles mustangs, would be the most affected, with production halted from the start of next week until the end of August. This decision, according to the company, is due to parts scarcity, which was caused by disruptions in the supply chain due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The halt would be in addition to previously announced shutdowns at other facilities, including the Ford-Getrag transmissions plant in Indiana and the Chicago Assembly and Stamping plants, which already went offline on July 26th and are not scheduled to resume production till August 16th.
The manufacturing giant has long been dealing with a shortage of computer chips and semiconductor materials, which are used in various aspects of a car's electronics, including battery management systems, airbags, and digital displays.
News agencies report that the UAW strike by more than 100 workers at the Flat Rock assembly plant on July 19th, which demanded equal pay and similar benefits to other workers in the company's production plants, could be intensifying pressure on Ford and Johnson Controls to reach an agreement and avoid severe impacts on the company's production schedules.
It is reported that Johnson Controls, Ford's biggest supplier, is working with the automaker and the UAW to resolve the dispute and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Johnson Controls provides seats and interior components for the Flat Rock Assembly Plant and has almost 40 production plants in North America alone.
Ford is not the only automaker grappling with production line disruptions. In July, General Motors announced a temporary production shutdown at several of its factories due to the chip supply shortage.
This halt would not, however, affect the production of the F-150 pickup truck at the Dearborn Truck Plant or Kentucky truck and Ford Transit van plants, where the automaker has focused its manufacturing firepower.
Nonetheless, this decision would have an impact on the timelines for Ford's switch to making electric vehicles, which have batteries that require chips and other semiconductor materials that have been in short supply.
The news of halting production lines in the United States comes merely days after Ford announced its intentions to dispense with the planned Mexican expansion of its $900 million investment to retrofit its facility in Kentucky with battery electric capability. This will allow Ford to produce more electric vehicles in the United States and ensure sustainable production going forward.
Ford has affirmed that it is optimistic about resolving its differences with Johnson Controls and UAW and referred to the temporary production shutdown as an unfortunate course of action that was necessary due to the ongoing supply chain disruptions.
