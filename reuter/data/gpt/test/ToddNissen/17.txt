Ford Refuses Non-Union Made Seats in Support of Striking Johnson Control Inc. Workers
In a recent move that has gained applause from labor unions and workers rights advocates, Ford has refused to use non-union made seats in production in support of striking Johnson Control Inc. (JCI) workers. The striking JCI workers are embroiled in a labor dispute due to the company's refusal to recognize their right to unionize.
Ford, one of the largest manufacturers of automobiles in the world, has put its money where its mouth is and is refusing to use seats made by JCI if they are made by non-union workers. The decision has come after a stand-off with the United Auto Workers (UAW), who are standing in solidarity with the JCI workers.
The UAW is demanding that JCI recognize the employee's right to unionize and negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment. JCI has refused, and as a result, the UAW has launched a campaign calling on major automakers to support their cause by refusing to use non-union-made components.
Ford has been the first to take a stand, with President and CEO Jim Farley saying, "We stand with our UAW brothers and sisters at JCI in their fight for fair treatment and respect for their right to organize. We will not support any supplier who seeks to undermine or deny the rights of our workers."
This decision by Ford is a significant win for labor unions and workers' rights activists, who have long been calling for corporations to put their values into practice and support the rights of workers to unionize. The move by Ford will also put pressure on other major automakers to follow suit.
The UAW has welcomed Ford's decision, with President Ray Curry saying, "This action by Ford is significant and encouraging. It sends a clear message that companies that disrespect workers' rights will not be tolerated in the marketplace."
JCI workers have been striking for weeks now, demanding better wages, benefits, and working conditions. The company has responded by hiring replacement workers and pushing production to other plants. However, the strikers have remained resolute, and the decision by Ford to support them is a significant boost to their cause.
In conclusion, Ford's decision to refuse non-union made seats is a significant win for worker's rights and shows that corporations can make a real difference in these issues. It is a clear message that going forward; companies must take active steps to support workers' rights and not stand by while they are being trampled upon.
