Washington D.C. - The auto industry lobbyist today predicted an improved working relationship with Congress under the leadership of President-elect Hillary Clinton. The statement came at a time when the industry is grappling with tough new regulations aimed at reducing emissions.
The spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Dan Gage, said that they expect to work closely with the Clinton administration to ensure that regulations are fair, reasonable, and take into account the interests of the auto industry.
Gage said, "We are looking forward to the incoming administration with optimism and eagerness to work closely with them. We believe that we can work with their team to achieve the best possible outcomes for the auto industry while keeping in mind the interest of our customers."
The auto industry has been facing a lot of challenges lately. In particular, President Obama's Clean Power Plan requires auto makers to produce vehicles with higher fuel efficiency, lower carbon emissions, and to adopt more electric vehicle technology. The new rules enacted by the outgoing president are aimed at cutting carbon pollution.
Gage suggested that under President-elect Hillary Clinton, the relationship between the auto industry and the government would be different. "We believe that the new administration will work more collaboratively and constructively with our industry. We have been impressed by the transition so far and are encouraged by the level of engagement weâ€™ve experienced."
The alliance representing 12 automakers in the US is hoping that Clinton's policies will be more sensible and less burdening for the auto industry. One of the key initiatives by the Obama Administration which they hope will be revised is the new corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. Under the current rule, the average new car and truck must reach 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) in 2025.
Opponents to the plan say that the regulations are unrealistic, as the requirements are too aggressive and could cause irreparable harm to the auto industry. Auto industry officials have expressed concerns about the cost of meeting the tough new fuel standards.
However, Gage said that they remained committed to meeting the fuel efficiency standards. "We fully support increased fuel efficiency and reduced emissions but at the same time, we are concerned about the significant cost of implementing the regulations. It's a balancing act, and we believe that working collaboratively with the new administration will help us achieve the best possible outcomes for everyone involved, especially our customers."
Clinton has pledged to invest in infrastructure as well as promoting green energy. Many in the automotive industry are optimistic that the incoming administration will provide the necessary support to make Congress more amenable to their agenda.
