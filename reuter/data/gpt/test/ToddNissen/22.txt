Detroit, Michigan - On Wednesday, Ford Motor Co reported an 82% increase in fourth quarter profits, surpassing Wall Street estimates due to increasing demand for high-profit pickup trucks and SUVs in North America.
The automaker reported net income of $2.4 billion, or 60 cents per share in the quarter, up from $1.3 billion, or 32 cents per share, during the same period a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Ford earned 37 cents per share, beating analysts' expectations of 29 cents per share.
Revenue rose 7% to $41.8 billion from $39.7 billion a year earlier. The company said sales of its F-Series pickup truck were up nearly 10% in the quarter, while sales of the Expedition and Navigator SUVs both increased by double digits.
"Our results show that Ford is on the right track to continuing to create value for all of our stakeholders," said Jim Hackett, Ford's president, and CEO. "We have a lot of momentum heading into 2018."
The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker has been increasing its investment in self-driving cars, electric and hybrid technology, and ride-sharing services. The company announced earlier this month that it will boost its investment in electric vehicles to $11 billion by 2022.
The automaker has also been focusing on restructuring its global operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Last year, Ford announced it would invest $1 billion in its plants in Chicago where it will build redesigned Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator models starting in 2019. The company is also moving production of its Ford Focus compact car from Michigan to China in order to reduce costs.
"Ford has to be a leaner, more efficient and more profitable company," said Hackett in a conference call with analysts and reporters. "We are taking action to fundamentally transform our operations to create more value for customers and shareholders."
Ford's fourth-quarter results also come as the company faces increasing competition from rival automakers, including General Motors and Toyota, who have also been ramping up production of high-profit trucks and SUVs.
Last month, General Motors reported a 17.7% increase in profits during the fourth quarter, driven by strong sales of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck and GMC Sierra SUV. Meanwhile, Toyota reported a 16% increase in profits during the quarter, due in part to demand for its RAV4 and Highlander SUVs.
Ford's fourth-quarter performance also follows a difficult year for the automaker, in which it saw a decline in sales in China and Europe while grappling with rising commodity costs and a slowdown in U.S. auto sales after years of record-setting growth.
Hackett has been implementing a years-long plan to cut costs and improve profitability at the automaker, including a focus on streamlining its product lineup and shifting production to more profitable models.
Looking ahead to 2018, Hackett said he remains cautious about the U.S. auto market, which he expects to remain challenging. However, he said he is optimistic about Ford's prospects in China, where the automaker has been ramping up production and sales of its Lincoln brand.
"We've made tremendous progress, but there is still much more work to do," he said. "Our focus remains on delivering more value to our customers and all of our stakeholders."
