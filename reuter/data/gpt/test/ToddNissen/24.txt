DETROIT - It's been a year since Chrysler signed a deal with CarMax to sell used vehicles at the CarMax franchise locations across the country, and the automaker has declared it a resounding success.
In a statement, Chrysler said the partnership with CarMax has helped to boost sales of its used vehicles, with customer satisfaction rates at the CarMax locations above the industry average.
"Chrysler's partnership with CarMax has been a win-win for both companies," said Jim Morrison, vice president of Jeep Brand North America. "We're thrilled with the results the partnership has produced, and we look forward to continuing our work together to deliver even more value to customers."
As part of the partnership, CarMax has been stocking its lots with a wide variety of used vehicles from the Chrysler brand, including popular models like the Jeep Wrangler, Chrysler 300 and Dodge Durango. The dealer also provides customers with a range of financing options, extended warranties and other services to help make the car-buying process as smooth and hassle-free as possible.
"We're delighted with the performance of the Chrysler vehicles at our franchise locations," said Diane Cafritz, CarMax's executive vice president of store operations. "Customers have responded positively to the quality and affordability of these vehicles, and we're proud to be able to offer them such a diverse selection."
While some industry analysts questioned Chrysler's decision to partner with CarMax at the time, the automaker has proven the naysayers wrong. According to Morrison, sales of used Chrysler vehicles at CarMax locations have exceeded expectations, and the dealer has been able to maintain a strong inventory of the cars despite high demand.
"The partnership has been a great way for Chrysler to reach a broader audience of customers who might not have otherwise considered our vehicles," Morrison said. "It has allowed us to show people the quality and value that our cars provide, and we're proud to continue working with CarMax to deliver that message."
The success of the CarMax partnership is just the latest in a string of recent wins for Chrysler. The automaker has been enjoying strong sales and revenue growth in recent quarters, driven largely by strong demand for its Jeep and Ram truck brands. And with the launch of several new models in the coming months, including the highly anticipated Jeep Wrangler, Chrysler is poised to continue its success in the competitive automotive market.
For CarMax, the success of the partnership has helped the dealer expand its reach into new markets and attract a wider base of customers. The company has been expanding aggressively in recent years, opening new locations and increasing its online presence to stay ahead of the competition.
"We're proud to be able to offer customers such a great selection of used vehicles from Chrysler and other top brands," Cafritz said. "And we look forward to continuing to work with Chrysler to deliver even more value to our customers in the years ahead."
