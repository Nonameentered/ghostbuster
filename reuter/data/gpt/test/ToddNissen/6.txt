Thirty-one people were onboard a commuter plane that crashed in the city of Detroit on Monday evening, leaving 29 dead and only two survivors. The small plane was flying from Cleveland to Detroit, with the passengers and crew onboard. The investigation is ongoing, but officials believe the crash may have been caused by the severe snowstorm that hit the area recently.
The crash occurred around 8:30 pm on Monday, just as the snowstorm was subsiding. The plane crashed in a residential area near the Detroit Metro Airport. According to eyewitnesses, the plane was flying low before it crashed into the roof of a home. The house was completely destroyed, and the fire department had to work for hours to extinguish the flames. Most of the passengers on the plane were killed instantly, with only two survivors identified as the flight crew.
Officials have not released the names of the victims, but they did confirm that the passengers were mostly businesspeople and families returning from vacation. One of the survivors is the pilot, who has been taken to the hospital with severe burns. The other survivor is a flight attendant, who is being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has launched an investigation into the crash, and officials are looking at the weather conditions and the plane's mechanical issues. The plane was a twin-engine Beechcraft King Air 300, operated by a charter company called Execuflight. The company has released a statement expressing their condolences to the families affected by the crash and promised their full cooperation with the investigation.
Following the crash, the Detroit Metro Airport remained closed for several hours, causing significant disruptions to air travel. However, the airport has since resumed operations but with some delays expected due to ongoing recovery efforts.
The Detroit mayor, Mike Duggan, expressed his condolences and thanked the first responders who arrived quickly on the scene. He urged the community to come together during this difficult time and offer their support to the families who lost their loved ones.
The crash is a tragic reminder of the risks involved in air travel. Although flying is largely considered to be safe, incidents like this serve as a reminder that accidents do happen. The investigation will uncover more details about the cause of the crash, but for now, the community mourns the loss of 29 lives in this tragic event.
