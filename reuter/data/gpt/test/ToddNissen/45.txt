Detroit, MI- The threat of a strike at one of General Motors’ (GM) suppliers looms as American Axle & Manufacturing Inc. (AAM) continues to negotiate a new contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.
The current contract between AAM and UAW, which covers about 1,800 workers at five Michigan facilities, is set to expire on February 14. The two sides have been in talks since January 2021 but have yet to reach a resolution.
AAM is a significant supplier to GM and provides powertrain components for trucks and SUVs. A potential strike at AAM would disrupt production at several GM plants that rely on these parts, including factories in Flint and Fort Wayne.
Although both sides have not disclosed the details of the negotiations, AAM has stated that they are committed to “reaching a mutually beneficial agreement” with the UAW. The UAW, on the other hand, has emphasized the need for job security and fair wages for its members.
“We are taking every precaution to ensure job security and fair wages for our members at AAM,” said UAW Vice President Terry Dittes. “We will do whatever it takes to achieve a contract that benefits our members and their families.”
The UAW has been ramping up its efforts to secure better wages and working conditions for its members after a year of increased safety concerns due to the COVID -19 pandemic. It recently secured a new contract with Ford Motor Company that includes significant investments in electric vehicle production and job security measures for its members.
A potential strike at AAM would also come as GM faces pressure to transition to electric vehicles and reduce its carbon footprint. Last month, GM announced that it plans to phase out gasoline and diesel engines from its light-duty vehicles by 2035 as part of its efforts to become carbon-neutral by 2040.
The negotiations between AAM and UAW come at a time of increased scrutiny of labor practices in the auto industry. Last year, a strike by UAW members at GM shut down production for over a month, costing the company billions of dollars in lost revenue.
If negotiations between AAM and UAW break down and a strike occurs, it would be a significant setback for both companies and disrupt the auto industry’s recovery from the pandemic.
However, many workers at AAM are hopeful that a new contract can be reached without a strike. Wages and job security are crucial issues for them, but they also appreciate the importance of their role in the transition to electric vehicles.
“We all want to see AAM and GM succeed,” said one AAM worker. “But we also need fair wages and job security to support our families. I hope we can find a solution that works for everyone.”
The clock is ticking for AAM and UAW to reach an agreement before the current contract expires on February 14. If negotiations continue to stall, a strike could be on the horizon, one that would not only hurt AAM and UAW, but also GM and the entire auto industry.
