Detroit, Michigan - Contract talks have resumed between American Axle and the United Automobile Workers (UAW) with hopes of reaching a deal that is amenable to both parties.
American Axle, which manufactures driveline components for a variety of vehicles, has been in negotiations with the UAW since their last contract expired in February. The UAW represents approximately 1,300 workers at American Axle's headquarters in Detroit and at its plant in Three Rivers, Michigan.
The two sides resumed the talks on Tuesday after a break of several weeks. The UAW had said earlier that it was willing to call a strike if a new contract was not reached soon.
The negotiations between the company and the union are being watched closely by many in the auto industry. In recent years, American Axle has faced competition from lower-cost foreign producers and has tried to cut costs. The auto industry has also been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and a global semiconductor shortage.
Frank Stuglin, American Axle's chief financial officer, said, "We're continuing to negotiate in good faith, and we're confident that we'll come to an agreement that's in the best interest of all parties."
Jeffrey Brauer, a representative for the UAW, said in a statement, "Our goal is to negotiate a fair contract that recognizes the sacrifices and contributions of our members."
The contract talks come as the UAW has been more aggressive in fighting for better wages and benefits for its members. In recent years, the union has called a number of strikes against major auto companies, including General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler.
The UAW has also been involved in a number of high-profile disputes with companies over wages and benefits, including a recent strike at Kellogg's. In that case, the union members went on strike for more than two months before reaching a new contract agreement.
The American Axle workers are hoping to secure a contract that includes higher pay and improved benefits. They are also looking for the company to address safety concerns at their facilities.
For its part, American Axle is hoping to negotiate a contract that will allow it to remain competitive in the industry while still providing its workers with fair compensation and benefits.
The talks are expected to continue for several days, and it is unclear when a new contract agreement will be reached. However, both sides have expressed a desire to work together to reach an agreement that is beneficial for everyone involved.
