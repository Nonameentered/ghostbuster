Detroit, Michigan - A commuter plane crashed in a heavy snowstorm on Tuesday evening, killing all 30 people on board. The tragedy struck the local community as people all across the state began to mourn. 
The small plane, operated by a regional carrier that was under contract with a major airline, was headed to Detroit Metropolitan Airport from nearby Lansing. As it descended towards the city, the plane began to experience difficulties, ultimately leading to the fatal crash. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the plane spiral out of control before it crashed into a field near the airport. 
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has already launched an investigation into the crash. They have sent a team of investigators to the site in order to determine what caused the plane to malfunction. While there is still much to be learned, early indications suggest that the heavy snowstorm may have played a role in the incident.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan issued a statement expressing his condolences for the family members of those who passed away in the crash. "The City of Detroit is mourning the loss of these 30 individuals, and our thoughts and prayers are with their families at this difficult time," he said. "We are grateful to all the first responders who rushed to the scene of the crash, risking their own lives to help those in need."
Many people in the community also took to social media to share their thoughts on the incident. One user wrote, "My heart goes out to the families of those who passed away in the Detroit plane crash." Others expressed concern about the safety of regional airlines, and called for more oversight by federal regulators.
As the investigation into the crash continues, it is clear that this tragedy will have a lasting impact on the local community. The loss of 30 lives is a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with air travel. However, it is also a testament to the bravery and dedication of those who work in the aviation industry, from the pilots who fly the planes to the first responders who rush to the scene of a crash. Only time will tell what caused the crash, but for now, the thoughts and prayers of the entire country are with the families of those who lost their lives.
