It was a decision that sparked controversy and raised questions about the future of General Motors - the $5.1 billion acquisition of Hughes Aircraft Co in 1985. More than a decade later, the verdict is mixed on whether the deal was a success or a failure.
When GM made the purchase, it seemed like a logical move - the company was looking to diversify its portfolio and expand into the aerospace industry, while Hughes was in a financially shaky position and looking for a buyer. However, the acquisition faced immediate hurdles. First and foremost, GM's management had no experience in the aerospace industry, and many questioned whether the company was up to the task of managing Hughes' complicated operations.
In the years following the acquisition, GM struggled to integrate Hughes into its existing business model. One problem was the culture clash between the two companies. Hughes had a long history of innovation and risk-taking, while GM was more conservative and focused on incremental improvements. As a result, some of Hughes' top talent left the company, frustrated with the slower pace of innovation at GM.
Another challenge was the complexity of Hughes' operations. The company was involved in a broad range of aerospace activities, from satellite communications to defense contracting. GM struggled to manage such a diverse set of businesses, and many of Hughes' operations were ultimately sold off or spun off into separate companies.
Despite these challenges, there were some bright spots for GM. One of the biggest successes to come out of the Hughes purchase was the creation of GM Hughes Electronics, which became a significant player in the defense contracting industry. In 1997, GM Hughes was sold to Raytheon for $9.5 billion, providing a significant return on GM's original investment.
However, the sale of GM Hughes did not come without criticism. Some argued that the sale price was too low, given the success of the business under GM's ownership. Others questioned whether GM had made the right decision in selling off a business that it had spent so much time and money integrating into its portfolio.
Overall, it is difficult to say whether GM's purchase of Hughes was a success or a failure. While there were certainly challenges and missteps along the way, it is also clear that GM was able to create significant value through the acquisition. Ultimately, the purchase and subsequent sale of Hughes may serve as a cautionary tale for companies looking to diversify their portfolios - it is important to carefully consider whether such a move makes sense from a strategic, cultural, and financial perspective, and to be prepared for the challenges that may arise along the way.
