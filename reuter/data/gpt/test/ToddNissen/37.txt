Ford Resorting to Replacement Seat Suppliers Amid Strike
Ford Motor Co. announced today that it will be turning to replacement seat suppliers as the ongoing strike by the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) takes its toll on the company's ability to create vehicles.
The strike, which began on September 16, has already cost Ford millions of dollars in lost revenue. The company has had to shut down production at multiple plants across the US, and it estimates that it has already lost more than 125,000 units of production.
Now, the company is turning to alternative suppliers to keep production running as smoothly as possible. In an official statement, Ford said that it was "working closely with our supply base to mitigate the impact of the UAW strike on our operations. This includes adjusting production schedules and, in some cases, utilizing alternate sources for parts."
One of the areas where Ford is experiencing the most disruption is in the production of seats. With the UAW strike affecting the company's main seat supplier, Lear Corp., Ford has had to find alternative sources for the parts.
The company is reportedly looking to a number of other seat suppliers to fill the gap left by Lear. This includes Magna International Inc. and Adient PLC, two of the largest automotive seat manufacturers in the world.
Despite these efforts, the strike is still having a significant impact on Ford's operations. The company has already had to lay off thousands of workers, and the strike is expected to continue until a new labor agreement is reached between the UAW and the company.
The UAW is seeking a range of concessions from Ford, including better wages, better benefits, and increased job security for its members. However, negotiations have been slow, with both sides struggling to reach an agreement.
Despite the challenges, Ford remains optimistic about the future. In its statement today, the company said that it was "confident that we will come to an agreement with the UAW that will allow us to continue to build great products and serve our customers."
For now, however, Ford and its suppliers will have to work hard to keep production going in the face of the ongoing strike.
