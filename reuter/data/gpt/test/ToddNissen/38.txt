Negotiations have resumed between Johnson Controls Inc. and the United Automobile Workers (UAW) as the company faces a 15-day strike over the wages and benefits of employees at its auto seat maker. The strike affected operations at multiple manufacturing plants across the United States.
The negotiations resumed on Monday after being halted due to a lack of progress in the previous meetings. The UAW says that Johnson Controls has not shown enough commitment towards addressing the workers’ concerns and has been unwilling to make any meaningful concessions.
“Johnson Controls’ lack of respect for their own employees shows that they value profits over people,” said UAW President Ray Curry in a press release. “Our members are asking for nothing more than fair compensation for the hard work they do every day.”
On the other hand, Johnson Controls has argued that it has already made significant efforts towards addressing the concerns of the workers. The company has stated that it has made a fair and reasonable wage offer to the UAW and has been open to negotiating on other benefits, such as healthcare and retirement.
“We believe we have made a fair offer to our employees,” said a spokesperson for Johnson Controls. “We are committed to working with the union to reach an agreement that is beneficial for all parties involved.”
The 15-day strike has already taken a toll on both sides, with Johnson Controls losing millions of dollars in revenue and the UAW members facing uncertainty over their paychecks and job security. The UAW has also accused the company of using scab workers to replace the striking employees, which has led to further tension between the two sides.
The negotiations are being closely watched by industry experts, who believe that they could set a precedent for other strikes in the auto manufacturing sector. The strike has also attracted the attention of lawmakers, with some politicians calling for Johnson Controls to be held accountable for its treatment of workers.
“Johnson Controls has a responsibility to treat its employees with respect and fairness,” said Senator Bernie Sanders. “We cannot allow corporations like this to exploit their workers for profit.”
It remains to be seen whether the negotiations between Johnson Controls and the UAW will lead to a resolution of the strike. In the meantime, the company and the employees continue to bear the costs of the ongoing dispute.
