As the automotive market continues to shift towards online sales, traditional dealerships are poised to grab a larger share of the used car market, according to National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) economist Patrick Manzi.
Although online sales have been growing rapidly in recent years, traditional dealerships have remained a strong force in the used car market. And with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many consumers are turning to established dealerships for guidance and support during uncertain times.
"Consumers are still looking for the expertise and reassurance that comes from working with a knowledgeable dealer," says Manzi. "Traditional dealerships have an advantage in building trust with buyers, and that's going to be increasingly important as we move towards a more online-focused market."
One factor driving the shift back towards traditional dealerships is the increased demand for certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles. These vehicles have been thoroughly inspected and refurbished by the manufacturer or dealer, making them a more attractive option for buyers who want a reliable vehicle without the cost of a brand new model.
"Certified pre-owned vehicles are a sweet spot for traditional dealerships," explains Manzi. "They offer buyers the peace of mind of a new car, but at a lower price point. And dealerships are able to offer warranties and other perks that help build trust with buyers."
In addition to CPO vehicles, traditional dealerships also have an advantage when it comes to trade-ins and financing. Many online car buying platforms do not offer trade-in options, which means consumers have to navigate the process on their own. Dealerships, on the other hand, are equipped to handle trade-ins and financing, giving buyers a one-stop-shop for all their car-buying needs.
But dealerships are not without their challenges. One of the biggest hurdles they face is the perception that they are not transparent or trustworthy. With the rise of online reviews and social media, consumers are more informed than ever before and are quick to share negative experiences.
To combat this, dealerships are making a concerted effort to improve their reputation by offering transparent pricing, better customer service, and more personalized experiences.
"We're seeing a shift towards a more customer-focused approach," says Manzi. "Dealerships are moving away from the old sales tactics of pushing customers towards a sale and towards a more consultative approach, where they're focusing on building relationships and offering guidance instead of just trying to close a deal."
Ultimately, the success of traditional dealerships in the used car market will come down to their ability to adapt to changing consumer trends. The rise of online sales is not going anywhere, and dealerships that can effectively integrate digital tools and strategies into their operations will be better positioned to succeed.
"At the end of the day, it's about meeting customers where they are and providing them with the best possible experience," concludes Manzi. "Whether it's in person or online, dealerships that can do that will be the ones that come out on top."
