The Explorer has been Ford's best-selling SUV with over 7 million sold since its introduction in 1990. However, the coronavirus pandemic has caused a decline in sales, prompting Ford to offer incentives on the 2020 and 2021 models.
According to industry analysts, the Explorer has faced stiff competition from other midsize SUVs, including the Toyota Highlander and the Honda Pilot. In addition, the pandemic has led to a shift in consumer preferences towards smaller, more affordable vehicles, causing sales of larger SUVs to suffer.
To boost sales, Ford has announced that it will offer its first-ever sales incentives on the Explorer, starting in August 2020. The incentives will give buyers an additional $1,000 off the purchase price of the 2020 model, in addition to any other discounts offered by the dealer.
Ford hopes that these incentives will encourage buyers to consider the Explorer, which has undergone significant improvements in recent years. The 2020 model features a more refined exterior design, a spacious and comfortable interior, and a range of advanced safety features.
The Explorer also offers a choice of powertrains, including a 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine, and a hybrid powertrain that combines a 3.3-liter V6 engine with an electric motor. With these options, buyers can choose the level of performance and fuel efficiency that best suits their needs.
Ford has also introduced a range of new technologies on the Explorer, including an available 10.1-inch touchscreen display, a wireless charging pad, and a 14-speaker B&O sound system. These features are designed to make the driving experience more enjoyable and convenient for both drivers and passengers.
"We're excited to offer our customers these new incentives on the Explorer," said Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford's Americas and International Markets Group. "We believe that the Explorer is a great choice for anyone in the market for a midsize SUV, and we're confident that these incentives will help us reach more customers and continue to grow our sales."
The incentives will be available to buyers in the United States and will be offered through the end of September 2020. With this offer, Ford hopes to boost sales of the Explorer and reinforce its position as one of the leading automakers in the midsize SUV market.
