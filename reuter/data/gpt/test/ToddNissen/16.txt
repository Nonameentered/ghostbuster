General Motors Q4 Earnings Fall More Than 50% Due to Labor Strife, Costing $700 Million in Profits
General Motors (GM), the largest American automaker, announced that its fourth-quarter earnings for 2020 fell more than 50% due to labor strife, which cost the company around $700 million in profits.
GM reported earnings of $2.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019. However, the automaker's earnings for Q4 2020 dropped to $1.2 billion, significantly affected by two prolonged labor disruptions at its U.S. factories.
In the third quarter of 2019, GM experienced a 40-day strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW), which impacted its Q3 earnings. The following year, in February 2020, another strike by the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) affected fourth-quarter production at GM's Oshawa plant in Ontario.
According to GM CEO Mary Barra, "the combined impact of the two strikes on our bottom line is around $700 million. These were regrettable events for everyone involved, including our employees, dealers, suppliers, and most importantly, our customers."
GM's fourth-quarter revenue fell by 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, from $32.9 billion to $30.8 billion.
The strike that began in September 2019 halted production at more than 30 GM factories, causing significant disruptions to the company's supply chain. The 40-day strike impacted the shipment of parts to GM's assembly plants, which led to a decline in sales.
GM's Q4 2019 sales fell 6.3% year-over-year. The company's Cadillac and Chevrolet brands were among the hardest hit, with sales declining by 18.6% and 7.4%, respectively.
The strike also impacted GM's international operations, leading to a 6.5% decline in sales in China, the world's largest car market, during the fourth quarter of 2019.
GM's sales in China have been decreasing since 2017, and the company has been restructuring its operations in the country to improve profitability. GM has a joint venture with SAIC Motor, the largest automaker in China, and also operates two Cadillac factories in the country.
GM's second labor dispute in 2020 occurred in February when more than 2,400 workers at the Oshawa plant in Ontario went on strike. The strike, which lasted for three weeks, led to a halt in production at the plant.
The Oshawa plant is one of GM's largest plants in Canada, producing around 300,000 vehicles per year. The strike disrupted the supply of the Chevrolet Equinox, the GMC Terrain, and the Cadillac XTS, which are produced at the plant.
The strike significantly impacted GM's sales in Canada, which fell 3.3% during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.
GM's labor strife in 2019 and 2020 was not the first time the automaker had experienced significant labor disputes. In 1998, GM experienced a 54-day strike by the UAW, which led to a $2.2 billion loss in revenue and led to the closure of several GM factories.
GM's recent labor disputes have underscored the challenges the company faces in balancing its investments in electric and autonomous vehicles with its legacy operations. The company has been investing heavily in electric vehicles, and in 2020 announced plans to launch 30 new electric vehicles globally by 2025.
Despite its struggles in 2019 and 2020, GM is optimistic about its future. The company has a strong balance sheet, with $40 billion in cash and $7 billion in credit facilities as of December 31, 2020.
GM's CEO Mary Barra said, "We are well positioned to continue our investment in electric and autonomous vehicles, which we believe will drive future growth and profitability for our company."
GM's fourth-quarter earnings report comes as the company faces increased competition from Tesla, which has become the world's most valuable automaker. Tesla's stock price has risen more than 740% over the past year, driven by strong demand for its electric vehicles and growth in its energy storage business.
GM has been working to catch up to Tesla in the electric vehicle market, launching its first all-electric vehicle, the Chevrolet Bolt, in 2016. The company plans to launch a new electric truck, the GMC Hummer EV, later this year.
In conclusion, GM's labor strife in 2019 and 2020 significantly impacted the automaker's earnings, leading to a loss of $700 million in profits. The company is optimistic about its future, citing its strong balance sheet and investments in electric and autonomous vehicles as drivers of future growth and profitability. However, the automaker faces increased competition from Tesla, which has become the world's most valuable automaker. GM will need to continue investing in electric and autonomous vehicles to maintain its competitiveness in the market.
