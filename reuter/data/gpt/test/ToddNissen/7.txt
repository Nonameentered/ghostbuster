New York, NY - A Delta Comair plane crashed earlier today during a snowstorm, killing all 29 people who were onboard. The plane, a CRJ-200, was en route from Buffalo, New York to Atlanta, Georgia when the crash occurred.
According to witnesses, the plane appeared to be struggling in snowy conditions as it attempted to take off from Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The aircraft reportedly reversed its thrust in an attempt to slow down but was unable to stop in time, sliding off the runway and into a nearby field.
Emergency responders rushed to the scene but were unable to save any of the passengers or crew on board. The crash has been described as one of the worst in recent aviation history.
The cause of the crash is still unknown but is under investigation by federal officials. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has already dispatched a team to the crash site to begin their investigation.
Delta Air Lines, the parent company of Comair, released a statement expressing their condolences and promising to fully cooperate with authorities. "We are deeply saddened by this tragic event and our hearts go out to the families and loved ones of those who perished," the statement read.
The passengers on board the flight were individuals from all walks of life, including businesspeople, families, and college students. Some were returning home after visiting relatives for the holidays, while others were heading to Atlanta for work or vacation.
The crash has sent shockwaves through the aviation community, prompting calls for increased safety protocols and preventative measures during inclement weather. It is unclear at this time whether or not the snowstorm played a role in the crash.
Despite the tragedy, some are already beginning to ask questions about Comair's safety record. The airline has had several incidents in recent years, including a 2006 crash in Kentucky that killed 49 people. Delta Air Lines has also been under scrutiny for its safety practices, with some accusing the company of putting profits over passenger safety.
As the investigation continues, families and friends of the victims are left to mourn their loss. The tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with air travel, and the importance of continually striving to improve safety measures in the aviation industry.
