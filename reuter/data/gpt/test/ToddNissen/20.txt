Ford Motor Co.'s Fourth Quarter Profit Soars by 82% to $1.2 Billion
Ford Motor Co., an American multinational automaker, has reported a fourth-quarter net income of $1.2 billion, which is an 82% increase from the previous year. The company had earned $671 million during the same period last year.
According to the company's financial results released on Thursday, the net income per share was 34 cents in the fourth quarter, compared to 18 cents in the previous year. The company's revenue for the fourth quarter was $36 billion, up from $33.2 billion from the previous year.
Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford Motor Co., said that the fourth-quarter results indicated that the company is on track to deliver sustainable profitability and positive free cash flow.
"The team made significant progress on our efforts to redesign and de-risk our business, including executing our plan with discipline and making quick decisions to pivot where necessary," Farley said.
The automaker's North American operations saw its best fourth-quarter financial result in the company's history, with a pre-tax profit of $1.8 billion, compared to $2.2 billion in the previous year. However, the company's market share in the region reached 13.3%, a 0.7 point increase from the previous year.
Despite the overall growth, Ford has faced continued challenges in Europe and South America, which have resulted in a $197 million loss in the previous quarter.
Ford's recent partnership with Volkswagen in Europe is expected to provide the company with a boost in 2021. The company plans to introduce several electrified vehicles this year, including an all-electric Mustang Mach-E and an electric version of its Transit van.
In addition to its partnership with Volkswagen, Farley said the automaker's agreement with Google to use the tech giant's cloud-computing services would improve the efficiency of its operations.
"We made a very strategic choice to partner with Google, primarily because of the platform capabilities, including the reliability and scalability," Farley said.
The automaker has also announced plans to invest more than $22 billion in electrification through 2025, and Ford aims to have 40% of its global sales volume to be all-electric by 2030.
In conclusion, Ford Motor Co.'s fourth-quarter net income increased by 82% to $1.2 billion, driven by strong North American operations. As the company continues to invest in electrification, partnerships with Volkswagen and Google, Ford aims to maintain sustainable profitability and positive free cash flow in the future.
