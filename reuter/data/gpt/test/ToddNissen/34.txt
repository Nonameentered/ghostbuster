Federal-Mogul Corp, a global supplier of automotive, aerospace and industrial products, has announced its plans to pay off $185 million in debt, undergo restructuring and eye acquisitions in 1997. This follows a year of financial difficulties for the company, which saw a decrease in sales and a rise in debt.
“The actions we are taking are in response to the changing market dynamics and are intended to better position us for future growth,” said Dick Snell, CEO of Federal-Mogul Corp. “We recognize that our financial performance in 1996 was not up to our usual standards and are committed to taking the necessary steps to improve our performance in the future.”
The debt pay-off will be achieved through a combination of internal cash generation and a $100 million equity investment from Turnberry Capital Management, a private investment firm. This move will reduce the company’s leverage ratio to approximately 2.5x EBITDA, down from 3.2x at the end of 1996.
In addition, Federal-Mogul Corp will undergo a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency. This will include the consolidation of operations, the streamlining of its management structure, and the closure of certain facilities. “Our restructuring plan will ensure that we are a leaner, more agile organization that is better able to respond to the needs of our customers and the market,” said Snell.
The company also plans to enter into several acquisitions in 1997, aimed at expanding its product offerings and increasing its global reach. These will be financed through a combination of internal cash resources and debt financing.
“Our acquisitions will be strategic in nature, aimed at strengthening our position in key markets and expanding our capabilities,” said Snell. “We are confident that these initiatives will allow us to continue to grow and thrive in the years to come.”
Analysts have given a mixed response to Federal-Mogul Corp’s plans, with some expressing skepticism over the company’s ability to execute its restructuring plan and successfully integrate any acquisitions. However, others have praised the company’s proactive approach and willingness to make necessary changes in order to remain competitive.
“Federal-Mogul Corp has recognized the need to adapt to a changing market environment and is taking concrete steps to do so,” said John Smith, an automotive industry analyst. “While there are certainly risks involved in any major restructuring and acquisition program, the company’s management has shown a willingness to take bold action and should be commended for that.”
The announcement follows a difficult year for the company, which saw a decrease in sales and net income compared to the previous year. However, Snell remained optimistic about the future. “While our financial performance in 1996 was disappointing, we believe that our plans for 1997 and beyond will allow us to emerge as a stronger, more competitive company,” he said.
