The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) continues to investigate the “unexplained event” that occurred prior to the deadly Delta Comair crash that took place near the Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, Kentucky on August 27, 2006.
The event occurred during the taxiing of the plane, which was carrying 47 passengers and two crew members. The plane suddenly veered off the runway, crashed through a fence, and slammed into trees and a field, killing all but one of the passengers on board. The lone survivor, first officer James Polehinke, suffered serious injuries and was left permanently disabled.
In a preliminary report released by the NTSB just weeks after the crash, investigators noted that there was no evidence of mechanical problems with the plane, but that the crew had failed to follow standard procedures during taxiing. However, subsequent investigations have suggested that there may have been other factors at play.
According to one theory, the plane may have encountered a sudden gust of wind or a microburst, which can cause drastic changes in wind speed and direction and can be particularly dangerous for planes during takeoff or landing. Another possibility is that the pilots may have experienced some form of spatial disorientation, in which they became confused about their position or orientation while taxiing.
The investigation has been complicated by several factors, including the lack of a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) or flight data recorder (FDR) on the plane. In a statement released in 2009, the NTSB noted that the lack of these “black box” recorders severely limited their ability to reconstruct the events leading up to the crash.
Despite these challenges, investigators have continued to pursue leads in the case, including conducting extensive interviews with the surviving crew member and examining the wreckage of the plane. They have also been aided by advances in technology, such as computer simulations and advanced weather forecasting tools.
In a statement released on the 15th anniversary of the crash, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt emphasized the agency’s commitment to finding out what happened. “The Delta Comair crash was a tragedy that shook our entire nation,” he said. “We owe it to the families of the victims, as well as to the aviation community as a whole, to do everything we can to understand what went wrong and to prevent it from happening again.”
Sumwalt also noted that the NTSB has made a number of recommendations based on its findings from the investigation, including improvements to cockpit resource management training, enhanced weather forecasting and reporting, and increased use of safety management systems.
As the investigation continues, the families of the victims continue to hold out hope for answers and closure. In a statement released to the press, the family of one of the victims said, “We pray that the truth will be discovered and that lessons will be learned from this tragedy so that no other family will have to suffer the same devastating loss.”
