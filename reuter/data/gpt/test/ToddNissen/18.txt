Ford Motor Co. has reported an 82% leap in its fourth-quarter profits, its largest increase in three years. This remarkable financial performance is due to the booming truck sales in the US, led by the F-series pickups, as well as the company's successful restructuring efforts in North America, Asia, and Europe.
The automaker stated that its earnings climbed to $2.2 billion, or 55 cents per share, from $1.2 billion, or 31 cents per share, a year ago. Wall Street had been anticipating earnings of only 49 cents per share. Moreover, Ford's operating margin in North America rose to 8.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 6.7% a year earlier, surpassing the 8% margin it had set as a goal for the quarter.
"Ford's performance in the fourth quarter was exceptional, driven by strong products and disciplined execution," said Bill Ford Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive.
However, Ford warned that it expects weaker financial results for the first quarter of 1997. This is attributed to the launches of new vehicles, the end of production for the lucrative Ford Taurus/Sable, and the ongoing investments in new projects. "We anticipate that earnings per share in the first quarter will be down significantly from last year's very strong first quarter earnings," Ford said in a statement. "However, we do expect continued improvement in results through the balance of the year."
In light of the expected earnings dip, the Dearborn-based company is planning to cut costs and streamline operations in 1997. Ford has already embarked on a $3 billion cost-cutting initiative, which includes layoffs, plant closures, and the elimination of unprofitable product lines. The company claims it is on track to achieve its target of reducing costs by $1.5 billion in 1997.
"We will continue to aggressively pursue our cost reduction efforts while investing in future growth opportunities," said Ford.
Ford's restructuring plan has resulted in the closure of several plants in Europe, including the Dagenham plant in the UK, and the overhaul of its Asian operations. In North America, the automaker has announced the shutdown of the St. Louis assembly plant and the elimination of 2,000 jobs by the end of the decade. The company is also cutting its number of suppliers and consolidating its vehicle platforms.
While the cost-cutting measures have been met with criticism and opposition from some quarters, Ford maintains that they are crucial to its long-term success. "We recognize that tough actions are necessary to support our long-term viability and competitiveness in the global marketplace," said Ford.
The company is optimistic about its prospects for 1997, despite the expected dip in earnings for the first quarter. Ford expects to benefit from the successful launch of several new vehicles, including the redesigned F-150 pickup truck, the new Ford Expedition SUV, and the Mercury Mountaineer. The company also plans to introduce a new minivan, the Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest, and a new sport-utility vehicle, the Ford Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer.
"We have a robust product plan for 1997 and beyond, supported by strong consumer interest and demand," said Ford.
The automaker's solid financial results and ambitious restructuring efforts have pleased investors and analysts. However, some observers remain cautious about Ford's long-term prospects, given the fierce competition in the auto industry and the rapidly changing consumer preferences.
"Investors should recognize the cyclical nature of the auto business and exercise caution," said Tom Gale, a portfolio manager at Evergreen Funds. "Ford is a well-managed company with a strong product line, but investors should not overlook the risks and uncertainties in the industry."
Despite the challenges ahead, Ford appears to be on a steady path to recovery and growth, bolstered by its strong financial results and its determination to cut costs and increase efficiency. The company's 82% profit jump in the fourth quarter is a clear indication of its potential for success, and a sign that the company is moving in the right direction.
