Federal-Mogul Corp., the American multinational company that specializes in producing automobile parts, has announced today that it will undergo a significant restructuring process. The move comes amid declining sales and mounting pressure from competitors in the automotive industry.
As part of the restructuring, Federal-Mogul Corp. plans to cut jobs and end its ambitions to enter the retail auto parts sector. The company has stated that it will reduce its workforce by around 750 people globally. The job cuts will affect both office-based and factory-based positions.
Stefan Knirsch, Federal-Mogul Corp.'s CEO, said in a statement: "Our decision to restructure is a difficult but necessary step. As we adapt to the rapidly changing market, we must streamline our operations and focus our investments on core areas of the business. Unfortunately, this means that some roles will be impacted, and we will do everything we can to support our employees through these changes."
The company also announced that it will halt its plans to enter the retail auto parts sector. Federal-Mogul Corp. had previously expressed its intentions to expand its business to brick-and-mortar stores and online marketplaces. However, the company has since decided that focusing on its core business areas, such as engine components and powertrain systems, is vital for its future success.
The restructuring process is not expected to impact Federal-Mogul Corp.'s customer base. The company has stated that it will continue to supply and support its clients as usual and that there will be no changes to product availability or delivery times.
The announcement comes at a challenging time for the automotive industry as a whole, which has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. With vehicle sales down and supply chain disruptions, many companies have had to adapt and restructure to remain profitable.
This is not the first time that Federal-Mogul Corp. has undergone significant changes. The company was acquired by Tenneco Inc. in 2018 and has since been integrated into the broader Tenneco business. A large part of this integration involved consolidating operations and reducing costs, which led to job cuts and the closure of several plants worldwide.
Dan Hearsch, an automotive industry analyst, said that the restructuring is a necessary step for Federal-Mogul Corp. to remain competitive in the current market. "The automotive industry is undergoing significant changes, with the rise of electric vehicles, autonomous technology, and increased competition from new players. To succeed in this environment, companies must be willing to adapt and focus on their core strengths," he said.
The restructuring process is expected to take several months, with job cuts being implemented gradually over the next year. Federal-Mogul Corp. has stated that it will provide support to affected employees, including severance payments, job training, and placement services.
In conclusion, Federal-Mogul Corp.'s decision to undergo restructuring, cut jobs, and end its retail ambitions is a necessary step to remain competitive in the challenging automotive market. While the decision will undoubtedly impact some employees, the company's commitment to its customers and core business areas remains unchanged. The restructuring process is expected to take time, and Federal-Mogul Corp. will navigate these changes with transparency and with the support of its employees and stakeholders.
