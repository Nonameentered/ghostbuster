The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) has come out to defend traditional dealerships, which have been under scrutiny recently with the rise of online car buying options. Citing approval from etiquette expert Miss Manners and strong sales growth, NADA argues that traditional dealerships are still the best way to purchase a vehicle.
In an interview with CNBC, NADA Chairman Wes Lutz noted that traditional dealerships provide customers with a more personalized experience. "You can't just click on the internet and trust the website to deliver the car you want," he said. "You need to see it, touch it, and talk to a salesperson who can answer any questions you have."
NADA cites sales data from 2020, which showed that traditional dealerships accounted for 83% of all new vehicle sales in the United States. While online car buying has undeniably grown in popularity, it still only accounts for a small fraction of total sales.
But perhaps one of the most interesting arguments in favor of traditional dealerships comes from Miss Manners herself. In a column for The Washington Post, the etiquette expert responded to a reader who asked if it was appropriate to buy a car online.
Miss Manners argued that buying a car is "an expensive and emotional transaction" that requires the human touch. She wrote, "You should walk into the showroom, be treated civilly and honestly, ask all your questions, take a test drive, and be given a fair deal on your trade-in." Miss Manners added that the convenience of online car buying is not worth sacrificing the personal touch of a dealership.
Some industry experts have pushed back against NADA's defense of traditional dealerships. For example, a recent report from Cars.com found that more than half of car buyers are willing to buy a car entirely online. In addition, the report noted that online car buying can save consumers money and time.
However, NADA remains confident in the strength of traditional dealerships. Lutz pointed out that dealerships offer more than just a car buying experience. They also provide maintenance, repairs, and other services that online car buying platforms cannot match. In addition, Lutz emphasized that dealerships drive local economies by providing jobs and supporting other businesses.
Despite the rise of online car buying options, it's clear that traditional dealerships still have a place in the auto industry. Whether you prefer to buy a car in person or online, it's important to weigh the pros and cons of both options before making a decision.
