Ford Motor Company has announced that it will temporarily suspend production of its Expedition model, due to a strike at one of its seat suppliers. The strike at Lear Corporation, which began on September 28, has caused disruptions in the supply of components for the Expedition's seats, leading to the production halt.
Ford's decision to stop production of the Expedition model is in response to the strike's effect on the company's production process. Lear Corporation supplies seats to a number of automakers, including Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler. The strike, which involves Lear employees represented by the United Auto Workers union, has caused Lear to close its factories in Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee.
The suspension of the Expedition's production is not expected to have a significant impact on Ford's overall output. The Expedition is a popular SUV model, but it makes up only a fraction of Ford's total vehicle production. The automaker's F-Series pickup trucks remain its biggest sellers, and overall, Ford's sales have been strong this year, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ford has stated that it is working with Lear to resolve the strike and resume production of the Expedition as soon as possible. The automaker has also assured customers that it is well-stocked with Expedition models, so there should be no shortage of inventory at dealerships.
The strike at Lear Corporation is just the latest disruption to hit the automotive industry this year. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply chain disruptions, factory shutdowns, and a drop in demand for new vehicles. In addition, the industry is undergoing a shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles, which is bringing new challenges and opportunities for automakers.
The strike is also the latest labor dispute to befall the auto industry this year. The United Auto Workers union reached a deal with General Motors earlier this year, after a lengthy strike that shut down the company's factories for more than a month. In addition, Fiat Chrysler and the UAW are currently negotiating a new labor contract.
The Lear Corporation strike has also attracted attention from politicians, including Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, who have both urged Lear and the UAW to reach a resolution. The strike has put thousands of employees out of work, and is having a ripple effect on the economies of the states where Lear has factories.
As the automotive industry continues to adapt to new challenges, including changing consumer preferences and increasing competition from tech companies, the role of labor unions remains an important factor. The UAW has been a powerful force within the industry for decades, and its ability to negotiate on behalf of workers has helped to shape the industry's employment practices and working conditions.
For now, Ford is focused on resolving the Lear Corporation strike and getting production of the Expedition back on track. The automaker does not expect the suspension to have a long-term impact on its business, and remains confident in the overall strength of its product lineup and its ability to meet consumer demand. However, the strike is a reminder of the volatility of the automotive industry, and the importance of maintaining strong relationships with suppliers and labor unions.
