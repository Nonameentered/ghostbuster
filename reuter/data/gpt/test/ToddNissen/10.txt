In a shocking development, federal investigators have confirmed that the crew of a Delta Comair flight attempted to shut off the engine and fire extinguisher system mid-flight. The incident occurred on a recent flight from Atlanta to Newark and has left aviation authorities and passengers alike deeply concerned.
According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the incident began when one of the pilots experienced a medical emergency. The co-pilot then made the decision to attempt to shut down the engine and fire extinguisher system before making an emergency landing. Fortunately, the pilot recovered and the crew was able to safely land the plane without further incident.
In a statement to the press, Delta Comair CEO Nicolas Deville expressed his shock and disappointment at the crew's actions. He emphasized that Delta Comair takes safety very seriously and would be taking steps to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.
The incident has also raised concerns among passengers, who are worried about the safety of air travel. Many have taken to social media to express their concerns and call for increased safety measures on planes.
In response to these concerns, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced that it will be conducting a full investigation into the incident. The agency has stated that it will be reviewing all aspects of the flight, including the crew's training, the maintenance of the aircraft, and the airline's safety procedures.
The NTSB has also launched an investigation of its own and plans to interview all members of the crew, as well as examine the plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.
This incident comes just weeks after a similar incident occurred on a United Airlines flight, where one of the pilots also experienced a medical emergency. In that case, however, the co-pilot was able to safely land the plane without incident.
The incident on the Delta Comair flight has raised serious questions about the safety culture within the airline industry. Many experts have called for increased transparency and accountability, as well as improved training and oversight for flight crews.
As the investigation into this incident continues, passengers and industry experts alike will be watching closely to see what steps are taken to ensure the safety of air travel. In the meantime, Delta Comair and other airlines must do everything in their power to maintain the trust of their passengers and provide safe and reliable travel for all.
