In a last-minute deal that saved General Motors from a potential work stoppage, American Axle & Manufacturing (AAM) reached a tentative contract with United Automobile Workers (UAW). The agreement was made just minutes before the strike deadline, averting a potentially devastating strike that would have affected the automotive giant's production operations.
The UAW had earlier warned that it was ready to call for a strike at the 5 AAM plants in Michigan and New York if an agreement was not reached by the set deadline. This development would have disrupted General Motor's production as AAM is a key supplier of axles, driveshafts, and other vehicle parts to the automaker.
The UAW indicated in a statement that "After weeks of intense bargaining, the UAW and American Axle & Manufacturing have reached a tentative agreement which offers significant wage increases, bonuses, and other benefits for our members." The union did not provide details on the compensation package for the workers.
AAM, on its part, expressed delight in reaching an agreement with its workers. "We are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement that recognizes the important contribution of our workforce to the success of the company," the company said in a statement.
The company employs more than 5,000 workers, and its plants are located in Detroit, Warren, and St. Clair Shores in Michigan, as well as in Tonawanda and Cheektowaga, both in New York. The deal between AAM and the UAW will now go to the union members for a ratification vote.
A potential strike would have been a huge blow to General Motors, which is already grappling with widespread production disruptions due to a global chip shortage. The chip shortage has disrupted the supply chain, leading to shutdowns at some of GM's plants. It has also led to a decline in vehicle sales, impacting the automobile giant's bottom line.
The UAW has been negotiating with AAM for several weeks, and the talks have been intense and protracted. Workers at AAM have been seeking higher wages and better benefits, as they claim that their wages have not kept pace with inflation and the cost of living.
The UAW has been embroiled in several high-profile negotiations in recent months. In September, it reached a deal with John Deere, which averted a strike by more than 10,000 workers. The agreement was reached after a 5-week lockout at the company's facilities.
The UAW also made headlines earlier this year when its workers at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site went on strike, protesting against the potential harm the pipeline could cause to the environment. The strike lasted for more than a month but ended in June after a tentative agreement was reached with the pipeline company.
The deal between AAM and the UAW is expected to serve as a benchmark for other automotive suppliers and manufacturers who are seeking to renegotiate their contracts with workers. It will also provide a much-needed boost to General Motors, which has been struggling to maintain its output amid a global chip shortage and other supply chain disruptions.
