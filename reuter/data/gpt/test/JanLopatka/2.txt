The Czech government has ordered a thorough investigation into the failure of a major bank in the country. The bank, which has not been named, collapsed earlier this week, leaving thousands of customers in financial distress.
The government stated that the investigation will be carried out by the Czech National Bank (CNB) and financial regulators. It will be conducted to determine the causes of the failure, including any possible wrongdoing or lack of oversight.
The Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babis, said in a statement that the government is "deeply concerned about the impact of this bank failure on customers, many of whom have lost their savings and investments."
"We need to ensure that this does not happen again, and that customers are protected from such events in the future. That is why we have ordered a full investigation into the causes of this bank failure."
The bank had been experiencing financial difficulties for some time, and the CNB had recently placed it under increased supervision. However, efforts to save the bank had failed, and it was ultimately forced to close its doors.
Customers of the bank have expressed anger and frustration at the situation. Many have lost their life savings or are unable to access their funds and investments.
The government has pledged to work with the CNB and financial regulators to provide assistance to affected customers. However, it is unclear how much compensation will be available to those impacted by the bank's failure.
The investigation into the bank's collapse is expected to take several months. The government has called for full transparency and accountability, stating that "the public has a right to know what happened and why, and who is responsible."
