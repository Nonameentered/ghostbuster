The Czech utility company CEZ reported lower profits in the first quarter of 2021 due to a battle over price agreements with distributors. The company's net profit fell by 30% to CZK 6.3 billion ($294 million), compared to the same period last year.
CEZ stated that the decrease in profit was due to the ongoing dispute with electricity distributors over price agreements. The company has been locked in negotiations with distributors over the proper price for the power it supplies to them, which has led to uncertainty and decreased profitability for CEZ.
The disputes are mainly over the prices that distributors pay for CEZ's supply of electricity, with distributors pushing for lower prices due to declining demand and increased competition. However, CEZ argues that lower prices could hurt the company, as it would lower its revenue and profits.
Jaroslav Klima, CEO of CEZ, said in a statement, "The reduced price of electricity on the market and significant competitive pressure on the supply of electricity to end customers has a negative impact on the results of our distribution business."
He added, "We are fighting for fair prices for our services and for the stability of the Czech energy market. We will continue to work hard to reach an agreement with the distributors and are optimistic that a mutually beneficial solution can be found."
Despite the challenges, CEZ reported strong growth in its renewable energy business, which saw its first-quarter profits increase by 12%. The company is continuing to invest in renewable energy, including wind and solar power, which it sees as crucial for its future growth and profitability.
CEZ is also seeking to expand its business outside of the Czech Republic, with plans to acquire new assets in Europe and a potential move into the US market. The company is currently in talks with several potential partners and is actively looking for new investment opportunities.
In conclusion, CEZ is facing challenges in its domestic market due to disputes over price agreements with distributors. However, the company is continuing to invest in renewable energy and is seeking to expand its business beyond the Czech Republic. Despite lower profits in the first quarter of 2021, CEZ remains optimistic about its future growth prospects.
