Prague, Czech Republic – After months of anticipation, the controversial Czech Defence Ministry tender has finally been won by a U.S.-led consortium led by Unisys. However, the decision has already been met with criticism as Unisys plans to appeal.
The tender involved a contract for the modernization of the Czech army’s command and control system, with the bids received in March 2021. It was one of the largest defence procurements in the country’s history, with an estimated cost of around 10 billion Czech crowns ($468 million).
Unisys, a multinational information technology company based in the United States, was named the winner of the tender on Friday. They were chosen over other bidders, including a consortium led by local company ERA.
However, the decision has already been met with skepticism, as Unisys plans to appeal the result. The company claims that the tender process was not conducted fairly, and that there were irregularities in the evaluation of bids.
In a statement, Unisys said: “We were surprised and disappointed by the Defense Ministry’s decision, which we believe was based on an incomplete and irregular evaluation process”.
The company added that they plan to take legal action in order to gain a better understanding of why they were not selected as the winner of the tender.
The decision to award the tender to Unisys has also faced criticism from some Czech politicians. Jan Lipavsky, a member of the centre-right Civic Democratic Party, called the decision a “catastrophe”. He said in a statement: “We were expecting the contract to go to the local suppliers, who have been serving the country’s needs for years. Giving it away to a foreign company is a mistake”.
The Defence Ministry has defended the decision, saying that it was made based on the merits of each bid. In a statement, the Ministry said: “We followed the procedures outlined in the tender conditions and chose the best bid based on the evaluation criteria”.
The controversy surrounding the tender is likely to continue as Unisys moves forward with its appeal. The company’s statement suggests that they are not willing to accept the decision without a fight.
The Czech Republic’s military has been seeking to modernize its command and control system for several years, with the aim of making it more efficient and capable of responding to new threats. The winning bidder will be expected to provide support for the system for at least a decade.
It remains to be seen how the controversy will affect the implementation of the new system. Some analysts have suggested that the delay caused by Unisys’s appeal could disrupt the modernization effort, while others have argued that the selection of a foreign company could bring new expertise and perspectives to the project.
