The Czech parliament is currently the center of a heated debate on the post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany. As the discussions rage on, an opposition uproar has ensued, with the opposing side vowing to prevent the approval of the proposal.
The agreement under consideration is a pact that would see the Czech Republic and Germany work towards mending their historically strained relations. The proposed deal would follow in the footsteps of similar agreements that were reached between Germany and other countries hit hard by the Second World War, such as Poland.
This proposed agreement is not a new political agenda – it has been in discussion since 2014. It has, however, been gathering steam in recent months after the German parliament passed a motion calling for the recognition of Germany's historical responsibility for the damage caused by the Nazi regime in the Czech Republic. 
The pact, which was supposed to be ratified on the fifth of May 2021 to commemorate the end of World War Two, has been met with strong opposition from Czech lawmakers. The controversy surrounding the proposed agreement is centered on the issue of financial compensation.
The opposition argues that Germany should pay the Czech Republic reparations for the damage caused by the Nazis during the Second World War. They believe the pact is a way of circumventing this responsibility and are very vocal in their dissent. They argue that Germany is yet to fully acknowledge and take responsibility for the human toll of the Nazi era, and until this happens, any reconciliation efforts is meaningless.
Their argument is that this proposed agreement is the proverbial “slap on the wrist” Germany received for its past actions. Opponents argue that the agreement would coat Germany a free pass, letting them off the hook without paying for their gruesome past.
However, proponents of the reconciliation agreement with Germany argue that it is not down to the Czech Republic to demand reparations. They argue that the issue of compensation has already been discussed and addressed, and the agreement being proposed would be a way of starting the journey towards healing. 
The proponents believe that the agreement would pave the way for a renewed relationship between Germany and the Czech Republic, a relationship built on respect and understanding. They maintain that the pact is an essential step towards working together, with Germany and the Czech Republic playing roles in the EU and NATO.
The opposing side maintains that the proposed agreement is insufficient and that the discussions surrounding it are a waste of time. They insist that its introduction into parliament is a political opportunity for the supporters of the current government to score political points.
One notable figure that has spoken out against the deal is former Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg. He has been particularly vocal in his dissent, taking an opposing stance to his cousin and former Czech President, Vaclav Havel. Havel had been an active participant in the talks in Geneva that led to the signing of the agreement in the early nineties.  
In conclusion, the debate around the reconciliation agreement with Germany is ongoing. While the agreement's primary focus is to find common ground between the Czech Republic and Germany, there is still significant opposition against it. The topic of financial compensation has been an area of concern from the opposing group, and they are not backing down anytime soon. The reconciliation agreement's fate is now in the hands of the Czech parliament as they continue their debates and deliberations on the subject.
