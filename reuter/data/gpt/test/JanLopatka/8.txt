The Czech Agriculture Ministry has announced that it will pursue a management buyout of Budejovicky Budvar, the makers of Czech Budweiser beer, after talks with US-based Anheuser Busch broke down.
Budvar, founded in 1895 in Ceske Budejovice, has been embroiled in a long-running trademark dispute with Anheuser Busch over the use of the name Budweiser. Budvar claims to have the exclusive right to use the name in Europe, while Anheuser Busch argues that the name is generic and has been used in the US for over a century.
The dispute has played out in courts around the world, with both sides scoring victories and defeats. In 2010, the European Union ruled that Budvar had the right to use the name in the EU, but Anheuser Busch has continued to push for a global settlement.
Last year, it seemed that a deal was close when the Czech government, which owns a majority stake in Budvar, entered into negotiations with Anheuser Busch. Under the proposed agreement, Anheuser Busch would have acquired a majority stake in Budvar and granted the company the right to use the Budweiser name in Europe.
However, talks broke down last month over disagreements about the valuation of Budvar. Anheuser Busch reportedly offered around â‚¬1 billion ($1.2 billion) for a 51% stake in the company, while the Czech government sought a higher price.
Now, the Agriculture Ministry has announced that it will pursue a management buyout plan instead. The ministry has said that it aims to maintain the independence of Budvar and preserve the company's heritage as a traditional Czech brewer.
"The management buyout plan will ensure that Budvar remains a Czech company, with its headquarters in Ceske Budejovice," said Agriculture Minister Miroslav Toman. "We believe that this is the best option for protecting the interests of Czech beer lovers and preserving the tradition of brewing in our country."
The buyout plan will be led by Budvar's current management team, which will have to secure financing for the acquisition. The ministry has said that it will provide support in the form of loan guarantees and other financial assistance.
The announcement has been welcomed by Czech beer enthusiasts and industry experts, who see it as a positive development for the domestic brewing sector.
"Budvar is one of the jewels of Czech brewing, and it's important that it remains under Czech ownership," said beer historian Petr Jedinak. "The management buyout plan is a good solution that will allow the company to continue its tradition of making high-quality beer."
The management buyout is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending approval from regulators and minority shareholders.
