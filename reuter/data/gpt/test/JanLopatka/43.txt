Unisys Corp, a global information technology company, is facing a setback in its bid to secure a contract with the Czech army. The Czech Republic's Defense Ministry has decided to reject Unisys Corp's bid to provide IT support to the army, citing technical issues with the company's proposal.
However, Unisys Corp is not taking the decision lying down. The company has announced that it is appealing the decision and is seeking a review of the technical issues that were cited by the Czech Defense Ministry.
In a statement, Unisys Corp said that it believes that its bid was both technically sound and competitively priced. The company also noted that it has a long and successful track record of providing IT support to military organizations around the world.
"We are disappointed with the decision made by the Czech Defense Ministry, but we remain committed to providing high-quality IT support to military organizations," said Travis Adkins, Unisys Corp's vice president and general manager, Defense and Intelligence Solutions.
Unisys Corp's appeal will now be heard by an independent review board appointed by the Czech government. The review board will examine the technical issues cited by the Defense Ministry and will determine whether Unisys Corp's bid was indeed not up to the required standards.
The Czech army contract is an important one for Unisys Corp. The company has been looking to expand its presence in Europe's defense industry, and the Czech contract would have been a significant step in that direction.
Unisys Corp is not the only company vying for the Czech army contract. Several other companies, including global IT giants such as IBM and HP, have also submitted proposals for the contract.
The Czech army contract is an important one for the country's defense forces. The contract is expected to provide the army with essential IT support, including network management, cyber security, and information assurance.
The decision by the Czech Defense Ministry to reject Unisys Corp's bid is a setback for the company. However, Unisys Corp remains hopeful that its appeal will be successful and that it will be able to secure the important contract.
"We stand by our bid and believe that we have the best solution to meet the needs of the Czech army," said Adkins. "We will continue to work with the review board to ensure that our bid is evaluated fairly and objectively."
