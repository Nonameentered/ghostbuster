Czech engineering group Skoda has won a $170m contract to build 60 new trolleybuses for San Francisco’s public transportation system. The new trolleybuses will replace many of the older buses in the fleet, most of which were built in the 1990s.
The Skoda trolleybuses are designed to be more reliable and efficient than the current fleet. They feature state-of-the-art technology, such as regenerative braking, which captures and reuses energy from deceleration. This technology will help to reduce operating costs, decrease maintenance, and improve overall performance.
“Skoda is excited to work with San Francisco to bring our latest trolleybus technology to the city’s public transportation system,” said Skoda CEO Petr Karasek. “We are committed to ensuring that San Francisco’s trolleybuses are reliable, efficient, and environmentally friendly.”
The new trolleybuses will also improve the rider experience. They will be equipped with new low floor technology, allowing for easier boarding and exiting for passengers. The buses will also feature Wi-Fi and USB charging ports, making the ride more comfortable for commuters and tourists alike.
“San Francisco’s public transportation system plays a crucial role in the city’s economy and quality of life,” said Mayor London Breed. “Investing in modern, reliable, and efficient trolleybuses will help us to continue to provide high-quality transit services to all of our residents and visitors.”
The new trolleybuses are also designed with sustainability in mind. They will be powered by renewable energy sources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping to mitigate climate change.
The contract between Skoda and San Francisco is a win-win for both parties. For Skoda, it represents a significant opportunity to expand its presence in the U.S. market. For San Francisco, it means a more reliable and efficient public transportation system.
The decision to award the contract to Skoda was made after a competitive bidding process. Several other companies were considered, but Skoda’s proposal was selected as the best option due to its combination of technology, cost, and environmental sustainability.
The Skoda trolleybuses will be built at the company’s factory in Pilsen, Czech Republic, with deliveries expected to begin in the second half of 2022. The buses will be shipped to San Francisco, where they will undergo final assembly and testing.
The contract is not only good news for Skoda, but also for the Czech Republic as a whole. It demonstrates the country’s ability to produce high-quality engineering products that meet the needs of international markets.
“Skoda’s success in winning this contract is a testament to the quality of Czech engineering and the skills of its workforce,” said Czech Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlicek. “We are proud that Skoda is playing such an important role in bringing modern, sustainable transportation to one of the world’s great cities.”
The Skoda trolleybus contract is just the latest example of San Francisco’s commitment to sustainable transportation. The city has been a leader in promoting electric vehicles, bike sharing, and other forms of sustainable transportation for many years.
With the new trolleybuses set to hit the streets in 2022, San Francisco is poised to further cement its reputation as a model of sustainable, effective public transportation.
