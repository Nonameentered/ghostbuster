The Czech Republic has achieved a major milestone in its energy independence by signing a new gas supply contract with Russia's Gazprom. The deal is expected to reduce the Czech Republic's dependence on Russian gas supplies and ensure a stable supply of energy for years to come.
Under the agreement, Gazprom will supply the Czech Republic with 5.35 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year for a period of five years starting from January 1, 2022. This amounts to nearly a third of the Czech Republic's annual gas consumption and is expected to strengthen the country's energy security and independence.
The deal was signed in Prague on Tuesday by Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis and Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Babis hailed the agreement as a "historic achievement" for the country and said it would help the Czech Republic to achieve its goal of becoming energy independent.
"This is a great moment for the Czech Republic," Babis said. "We have been working on this for years and now we have achieved our goal of reducing our dependence on Russian gas supplies."
The new gas supply contract is part of the Czech Republic's efforts to diversify its energy sources and reduce its reliance on Russian gas. In recent years, the country has invested heavily in renewable energy and has set a goal of increasing the share of renewable energy in its electricity mix to 22% by 2025.
The Czech Republic's energy independence has been a key topic of discussion in recent months, as fears have grown over the country's dependence on Russian gas supplies. In 2019, the country imported 89% of its gas from Russia, making it vulnerable to any disruptions in supply.
However, with the new gas supply contract in place, the Czech Republic is set to reduce its dependence on Russian gas and ensure a stable supply of energy for the years to come. The deal is expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy, creating jobs and driving growth in the energy sector.
Overall, the new gas supply contract is a major achievement for the Czech Republic and a significant step towards achieving energy independence. With the country's commitment to renewable energy and diversification of energy sources, the future looks bright for the Czech Republic's energy sector.
