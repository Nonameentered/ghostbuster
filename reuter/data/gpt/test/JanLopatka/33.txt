CEZ a.s., the largest energy company in the Czech Republic, has announced its financial results for 1996, and the numbers are impressive. The company reported a net profit of 2.54 billion Czech crowns ($88.6 million), a 26 percent increase over the previous year. The company had projected a profit of 2.2 billion Czech crowns ($77 million), making the actual result much higher than expected.
The company's revenue also rose by 9 percent in 1996, reaching 38.5 billion Czech crowns ($1.34 billion), primarily due to an increased electricity production and sales. The company generated 31,593 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity, an increase of 5.6 percent over the previous year. The company's efficiency also improved as it was able to reduce its costs by 1 percent and keep its debt-to-equity ratio at a healthy level of 70 percent.
"We are very satisfied with the results of 1996, which exceed our expectations significantly," said Pavel Cyrani, CEO of CEZ. "Our company has been able to increase its profitability by increasing its electricity production and efficiency while keeping our costs down. This has enabled us to invest in modernizing our power facilities, increase our shareholders' value and now pay dividend to our shareholders."
CEZ, which is majority-owned by the Czech government, operates 16 power plants, including two nuclear power plants, and controls 65% of the country's electricity production. The company distributes electricity to 6.7 million customers in the Czech Republic and exports electricity to several neighboring countries, including Austria, Poland, and Slovakia.
In light of the company's strong financial performance, CEZ's board of directors has proposed paying a dividend of 94 Czech crowns ($3.28) per share to its shareholders, compared to 73 Czech crowns ($2.54) per share paid last year.
"This is great news for our shareholders who will reap the benefits of the company's strong performance," said Marketa Tvrdonova, an equity analyst at Wood & Company. "The company's ability to increase its profitability and control its costs is a testament to its management's efficiency."
CEZ's success is a welcome boost for the Czech economy, which has been struggling with a high unemployment rate and slow economic growth. The country's GDP growth was only 1.9 percent in 1996, and the unemployment rate was around 10 percent.
CEZ's outlook for 1997 also appears positive, with an expected increase in electricity sales, cost-cutting measures, and further investments in modernizing its power facilities. The company has previously announced plans to spend 40 billion Czech crowns ($1.4 billion) on modernizations over the next five years.
The company's modernization plans will focus on improving the efficiency of its existing power plants, building new sources of renewable energy, reducing emissions, and expanding its distribution network. The modernization strategy is in line with the Czech government's goal of reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and increasing the share of renewable energy in the country's energy mix.
CEZ's strong financial performance and modernization plans have impressed the industry and the investors, with its share price rising by 21 percent this year. The company's success is expected to continue, providing a much-needed boost for the Czech economy and its people.
