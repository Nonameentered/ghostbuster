The Chemapol Group, a regional conglomerate with interests in chemicals, energy, and logistics, faced a turbulent debut on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) as its shares started trading on Tuesday. The initial public offering (IPO) had raised Php 7.8 billion (roughly US$ 153 million), but investor sentiment remained cautious amid concerns about the company's financial health, governance practices, and growth prospects.
Chemapol's IPO was oversubscribed, with demand exceeding the available shares by more than four times. However, most of the bids came from institutional investors and high net worth individuals, while retail investors were less enthusiastic. The offering price of Php 10.68 per share was at the lower end of the indicative range of Php 10.50 to Php 12.00, indicating weak appetite among buyers.
One reason for the tepid response to Chemapol's IPO is the lack of clarity about its operations and strategy. The company has a diverse portfolio of businesses, ranging from oil refineries to warehouse logistics, but it has not communicated a coherent vision for how it plans to create value for shareholders. Moreover, investors have raised concerns about the transparency and governance standards of a company that is controlled by a family dynasty.
Chemapol was founded in 1965 by the late businessman Rolando Piñon, who built it into a leading provider of chemicals and energy products in the Philippines. His sons, Ramon and Rolito, now run the company as chairman and president, respectively. The Piñons own more than 70 percent of the company's shares, and they have not disclosed any plans to dilute their control or invite external directors to their board.
This lack of independent oversight has raised red flags among corporate watchdogs and investors who fear that Chemapol could engage in self-dealing, related-party transactions, or other conflicts of interest that could harm minority shareholders. The company's financial statements have also been criticized for their complexity and opacity, making it hard to assess its true performance and prospects.
Another challenge facing Chemapol is the uncertain macroeconomic outlook in the Philippines, which has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, political turmoil, and domestic security issues. The country's GDP shrank by 9.6 percent in 2020, the worst contraction since World War II. Many businesses have struggled to survive, and consumer confidence remains fragile. Chemapol's operations are exposed to the cyclical swings of the oil and chemicals markets, as well as the logistics and transportation industries, which have been disrupted by the pandemic and the lockdown measures.
To address these challenges, Chemapol has said it plans to use the proceeds from its IPO to retire its debt and invest in new projects, such as renewable energy, e-commerce, and digitalization. However, the company has not provided specific details on how it will allocate its capital, nor has it presented a compelling case for why it can succeed in these new ventures.
In a statement, Chemapol said it was "pleased with the strong reception" from investors and that it was committed to creating value for its stakeholders. The company said it was "confident in our ability to navigate the challenges of the current environment and deliver sustainable growth over the long term."
However, some analysts remain skeptical. "Chemapol has a lot of potential, but it also has a lot of baggage," said Jose Mari Lacson, head of research at ATR Asset Management in Manila. "Investors are worried about the lack of transparency and governance, as well as the macroeconomic risks facing the Philippines. The Piñons need to show that they have a clear plan for how to unlock the value of their businesses and deliver returns to shareholders."
As of Wednesday, Chemapol's shares had fallen by 2.2 percent to Php 10.43, despite a broad rally in the PSE index. The stock remains under pressure from profit-taking and caution among investors, who are waiting for more clarity from the company about its future direction. Chemapol's management will need to address these concerns if it wants to succeed on the public market and build the trust of its stakeholders.
