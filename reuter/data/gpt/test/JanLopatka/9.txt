Prague, Czech Republic - The German Chancellor Angela Merkel's arrival to sign the post-war reconciliation accord with the Czech Republic was met with protests by the far-right Republicans. The accord aimed to strengthen the relationship between the two countries and to mark a symbolic end to the era of Czech-German hostility.
Despite pleas from the Czech government and public figures to welcome the German Chancellor, the Republican protesters stood firm in their opposition. They marched through the streets of Prague holding placards that read "Merkel should stay home" and "We do not need German occupation." They also chanted slogans such as "Czechs, defend your borders" and "Merkel is not welcome here."
The Czech government has expressed its concern at the growing hostility towards Germany, which has been fueled by far-right groups. In a statement, the government called on the protesters to stop their demonstration and emphasized the importance of maintaining good relations with Germany.
The signing of the reconciliation agreement began with a visit by Merkel to the Lidice Memorial, which commemorates the victims of a Nazi massacre during World War II. In her speech, Merkel emphasized the importance of remembering the past and working towards a better future.
The post-war reconciliation accord aimed to address the painful history between the two countries, including the expulsion of Sudeten Germans after World War II, which has been a source of tension between the two countries. The agreement was seen as a significant step towards building a stronger relationship between the two nations.
Despite the protests, the signing of the reconciliation accord went ahead as planned. Merkel and Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babi≈° signed the agreement, which was witnessed by members of both governments. The accord was then followed by a joint press conference, where Merkel emphasized the importance of continuing to work towards better relations between the two countries.
The Republican protest has been seen as a setback in the efforts to build a stronger relationship between the Czech Republic and Germany. The government has called on citizens to remain welcoming to Germany and to work towards a better future. The protests have been criticized for promoting xenophobia and damaging the image of the Czech Republic on the international stage.
