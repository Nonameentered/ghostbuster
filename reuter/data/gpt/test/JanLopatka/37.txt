Czech automobile manufacturer Skoda a.s. has recently announced that it has signed a contract worth over $170 million to supply trolleybuses for the public transportation system in San Francisco.
According to the agreement, Skoda a.s. will produce a total of 100 trolleybuses over the next two years, which will replace the older buses currently in use on certain routes within the city.
The project, which is part of San Francisco's ongoing efforts to improve its public transportation system, is expected to significantly reduce carbon emissions by utilizing environmentally-friendly vehicles.
"We are thrilled to partner with Skoda a.s. on this significant investment in our city's transportation infrastructure," said San Francisco Mayor London Breed in a press release. "Not only will these trolleybuses improve the overall rider experience, but they will also help us to achieve our ambitious sustainability goals."
Trolleybuses, which are electric-powered vehicles that have overhead wires that provide power to the bus, are a popular form of public transportation in many cities due to their low carbon emissions and quiet operation.
In addition to being environmentally-friendly, the new trolleybuses provided by Skoda will also feature several technological advancements aimed at improving the passenger experience.
The buses will be equipped with Wi-Fi, USB ports, and charging stations for smartphones and other devices, as well as improved ventilation systems and LED lighting for increased energy efficiency.
"Not only are these new trolleybuses good for the environment, but they also represent a significant step forward in terms of technological innovation," said Petr Karasek, the CEO of Skoda a.s. "We are proud to be working with the city of San Francisco to provide residents with a convenient and sustainable form of public transportation."
The new trolleybuses will be rolled out gradually over the next two years, with the first buses expected to hit the streets by the end of 2022.
The contract with Skoda a.s. is just one example of San Francisco's ongoing commitment to sustainability and the environment.
In recent years, the city has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting clean energy, including a ban on plastic straws and bags, the establishment of a task force focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the adoption of a goal of achieving 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.
"We recognize that transportation is a key area where we can make a difference in terms of reducing our carbon footprint and improving the overall quality of life for our residents," said Reuben Turner, San Francisco's Transportation Director.
"As part of our commitment to sustainability, we are investing in new and innovative forms of public transportation, including these new trolleybuses provided by Skoda a.s."
While San Francisco has been an early adopter of many sustainability initiatives, it is not alone in its efforts to create a cleaner, greener future.
Across the United States and around the world, cities are increasingly turning to sustainable public transportation options like electric buses, light rail, and trolleybuses in an effort to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality.
As the demand for sustainable transportation grows, companies like Skoda a.s. are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunity by providing innovative and environmentally-friendly solutions.
With the contract to supply trolleybuses to San Francisco, Skoda is taking a big step forward in its efforts to become a global leader in sustainable transportation. And for residents of San Francisco, the new trolleybuses will represent a tangible improvement in their daily lives, making it easier and more convenient than ever to get around the city.
