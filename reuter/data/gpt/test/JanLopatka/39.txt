Skoda Transportation has secured a $170 million order to supply electric buses to San Francisco, marking the largest ever goods supply from the Czech Republic to the United States. The order includes 70 electric buses with a range of up to 160km on a single charge, which will replace the current diesel buses in San Francisco.
The Mayor of San Francisco, London Breed, announced the deal with Skoda on Wednesday, declaring it a major milestone for the city's efforts to combat climate change. "Our city is facing a climate emergency, and we need to do everything we can to reduce emissions and improve air quality," she said in a statement. "These electric buses will help us achieve that goal."
Skoda Transportation, which is part of the Volkswagen Group, won the contract after an extensive bidding process that involved several other international companies. The company's proven track record in designing and manufacturing electric buses was a key factor in its selection, according to San Francisco officials.
The new electric buses will be equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including regenerative braking and energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. Skoda will also provide training and support to San Francisco's drivers and maintenance staff to ensure the smooth operation of the new fleet.
The contract with San Francisco is a major boost for Skoda Transportation, which has been expanding its business in electric mobility in recent years. The company has already supplied electric buses to cities in Poland, Germany, and Italy, and is currently working on new projects in Central and Eastern Europe.
The Czech Republic's Minister of Industry and Trade, Karel Havlíček, hailed the Skoda-San Francisco contract as a "historic achievement" for Czech businesses. "We are proud to see our companies succeed on the global stage, and this deal is a testament to the quality and innovation of Czech engineering," he said.
The first Skoda electric buses are expected to begin service in San Francisco in late 2021, with the full fleet expected to be operational by 2022. The move is part of San Francisco's plan to transition to a zero-emissions public transportation system by 2035.
