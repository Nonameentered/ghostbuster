Czech engineering group Skoda, known for producing trams, trolleybuses, and other transportation infrastructure, has won a bid worth $170 million to supply San Francisco with 70 new state-of-the-art trolleybuses. This marks the company's largest ever sale of goods to the United States.
The deal, signed by Skoda Transportation North America and the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, will see the trolleybuses replace older models on the city's busiest routes. The new trolleybuses feature a sleek, modern design, low floors for easier access and exit, and modern amenities such as USB charge ports and Wi-Fi.
San Francisco's Mayor, London Breed, welcomed the news, saying: "These new trolleybuses will bring a significant upgrade to our public transportation network and further our efforts to create a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable city."
The purchase of the new trolleybuses is part of a wider push by San Francisco towards more efficient and eco-friendly public transportation. They are expected to reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, and help the city meet its ambitious climate goals.
The order is also a significant achievement for Skoda, which has been aggressively expanding in North America since establishing a Canadian subsidiary in 2018. The firm has already secured contracts in Toronto, Ottawa, and Seattle, and this latest sale to San Francisco will further cement its position as a key player in the North American transportation market.
According to the CEO of Skoda Transportation North America, Petr Brzezina, the company is "delighted to have won this tender and to be able to contribute to the development of sustainable mobility in San Francisco." He added that Skoda's "proven track record of delivering reliable, efficient, and high-quality products" was a key factor in winning the bid.
Skoda's trolleybuses are renowned for their durability and reliability, with many models still in operation decades after their manufacture. The company is committed to sustainable transportation solutions and has invested heavily in research and development to produce cutting-edge vehicles that meet the highest environmental standards.
The new trolleybuses are expected to be delivered to San Francisco in 2022, with the first units entering service later that year. They will serve key routes across the city, including Market Street, the city's busiest thoroughfare, and are expected to help improve the overall efficiency and reliability of San Francisco's transit system.
