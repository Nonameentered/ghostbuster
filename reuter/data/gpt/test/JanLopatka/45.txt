The Czech government has introduced import deposits in an attempt to combat their growing trade deficit, but analysts suggest that limiting public sector salary growth will have a greater impact.
The Ministry of Finance has implemented a deposit requirement of 10% on selected imported goods in the non-EU countries. This means that importers will now be required to pay 10% of the value of the imported goods into a special deposit account set up by the Czech National Bank.
The main goal of this policy is to reduce the country's trade deficit, which had reached a record high of 251.1 billion CZK ($11 billion) in 2019. To put this into perspective, the trade deficit amounted to about 7% of the country's GDP, highlighting the significant impact it had on the economy.
The introduction of the import deposits is expected to reduce the trade deficit as it will make it more expensive to import goods. The increased cost of imports will lead to a decrease in demand, and with domestic producers likely to fill in the gap, the trade balance is then expected to improve.
However, some analysts suggest that the impact of import deposits could be limited. While it will make some imported goods more expensive, it will not effectively target all the products contributing to the trade deficit, and it is unlikely to drive significant changes in trade patterns.
Instead, analysts suggest that the government should focus on reducing public sector wage growth. The wage growth of public sector employees has been outpacing that of private sector employees, with public sector wages growing by an average of 7.5% in the last three years, compared to 5.4% for the private sector.
Reducing public sector wage growth, which accounts for about one-third of the overall wage bill, would reduce government spending and free up resources for investment in sectors such as infrastructure and education. This, in turn, would create a more efficient and productive economy that could drive economic growth and boost exports.
The government has begun to take steps towards capping public sector wage growth, with the Ministry of Interior proposing a 0% wage increase for public sector workers in 2021. The proposal has been met with resistance from unions, but the government remains committed to reducing the wage bill.
While both import deposits and limiting public sector wage growth may have a positive impact on the economy, there are concerns that the policies may have unintended negative consequences.
The introduction of import deposits, for example, could lead to increased prices and reduced competition, as importers are forced to pass on the additional cost to consumers. This could reduce consumer welfare and hurt the poorest members of society who rely on imported goods.
Similarly, limiting public sector wage growth could lead to a brain drain, as skilled workers move to the private sector where wages are higher. This could have long-term negative effects on the quality of public services and the economy as a whole.
Overall, the Czech government's efforts to combat the trade deficit and target public sector wages are commendable. However, there is a need to carefully balance these policies against potential negative consequences and to ensure that the country's most vulnerable groups are not disproportionately affected.
As the government continues to fine-tune its economic policies, it will be important to focus on creating a competitive and innovative economy that can drive long-term sustainable growth and boost the standard of living for all Czechs.
