Prague heritage officials have rejected the renovation plans submitted by Planet Hollywood, fearing that the proposed changes could irreparably damage the city's cultural heritage.
The plans, which were inspired by the science-fiction classic, Terminator, were designed to transform an old art nouveau hotel in the historic city center of Prague into a futuristic and ultra-modern attraction for tourists.
However, the Prague heritage office, which is responsible for preserving the city's unique cultural heritage, has strongly criticized the proposed changes, saying that they would be completely out of place in one of the most historic and well-preserved cities in Europe.
"The hotel in question is located in one of the most historic and popular areas of Prague, and it is essential that any renovations take into account the city's unique cultural heritage," said a spokesperson for the Prague heritage office.
"We are opposed to the so-called Terminator-style renovation plans proposed by Planet Hollywood because we believe that they would irreversibly change the character of this historic building and the surrounding area."
The proposed renovations included the installation of a giant robotic arm, a new entranceway shaped like the head of the Terminator robot, and the addition of large-scale LED screens displaying images of the iconic movie.
In a statement, Planet Hollywood defended its plans, saying that they were designed to attract new visitors to the city and to help create jobs and boost the local economy.
However, heritage officials argued that the proposed changes would risk turning Prague into just another tourist destination, without preserving the unique character and charm that make the city such an attractive destination in the first place.
The controversy surrounding the Terminator-style renovation plans highlights a growing debate over the future of Prague's cultural heritage, and the need to strike a balance between preserving the city's historic identity and embracing new developments and innovations.
In the end, the Prague heritage office's rejection of Planet Hollywood's renovation plans is a win for those who want to see the city's unique cultural heritage preserved for generations to come.
