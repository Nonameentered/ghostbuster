Kingfisher, the parent company of DIY chain B&Q, has announced it will cut 1,200 jobs and close 15 stores as part of its ongoing integration plan with Norweb and Comet chains. The move is expected to cost the company Â£75 million ($94 million).
The closures will affect B&Q and Screwfix stores across the UK, with the majority to occur in 2021. Kingfisher has said that the job cuts will mostly occur at its head office and support centres, with the aim of creating a more streamlined and customer-focused organisation.
The company has also said that it will invest in improving its online sales platform and enhancing the in-store customer experience. It plans to focus on product ranges that are most popular with its customers, and will increase its focus on sustainable and eco-friendly products.
In a statement, Kingfisher CEO Thierry Garnier said that the changes were necessary to ensure the long-term success of the company.
"We are facing significant challenges in our market, including increased competition, changing customer behaviours, and the impact of the pandemic," he said. "We believe that these changes will help us to become a more agile and efficient organisation, better able to meet the needs of our customers and stay competitive in a fast-moving market."
The news of the job cuts has been met with concern by trade unions and employee representatives, who have called on Kingfisher to do more to protect workers' rights.
"Kingfisher has a responsibility to its employees, as well as its shareholders, and we urge the company to do everything in its power to support those affected by these job losses," said Paul Grigson, national officer for retail and distribution at the GMB Union.
Grigson added that the union would be working closely with its members to ensure they received the support they needed during this difficult time.
In response to the criticism, Kingfisher has said that it will provide a comprehensive package of support to its employees, including offering redeployment opportunities where possible and working with local job centres to help those affected find new employment.
The company has also pledged to honour the terms of collective agreements with trade unions and to provide fair redundancy compensation to affected workers.
The news of the job cuts and store closures comes at a difficult time for the retail sector in the UK. High street retailers have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with many struggling to survive in the face of reduced footfall and rising costs.
Experts have warned that the sector is likely to face further challenges in the months ahead, with the UK economy expected to enter a period of recession as a result of the pandemic and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
Despite the challenges facing the sector, Kingfisher remains optimistic about its future. The company has said that it is committed to investing in its business and is confident that it can weather the current economic storm.
"We know that there will be tough times ahead, but we are focused on building a resilient business that is capable of withstanding these challenges," said Garnier.
"We believe that by investing in our people, our products, and our processes, we can create a business that is fit for the future and can continue to provide high-quality products and services to our customers across the UK."
