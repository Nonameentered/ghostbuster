CalEnergy Inc. has increased its bid for Northern Electric Plc from £1.2 billion to £1.4 billion, in a move that has been labeled as "hostile" by industry experts. The offer comes just weeks after Northern Electric Plc rejected CalEnergy's initial offer and dismissed its interest.
CalEnergy, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway energy company, has set a deadline of two weeks for Northern Electric Plc to accept the bid. The company has stated that it will not increase the offer beyond £1.4 billion, and if the bid is rejected once again, it will withdraw its interest in the company.
In a statement, CalEnergy said, "We believe that Northern Electric Plc is a strong strategic fit for our business and we are committed to making this deal happen. Our revised offer of £1.4 billion represents a fair and compelling value for Northern Electric's shareholders."
Northern Electric Plc has yet to comment on the revised bid, but industry experts believe that the company may be open to negotiations. The utility company has struggled in recent years due to tough competition and increased scrutiny from regulators, and a sale to CalEnergy may be seen as a positive outcome by some investors.
However, Northern Electric Plc may also be exploring other options, such as a merger with another company or a restructuring plan. The utility company has a substantial presence in the North East of England, providing electricity and gas services to over 3 million customers.
The revised bid by CalEnergy has also raised concerns from unions, who have called for safeguards on jobs and working conditions in the event of a sale. The GMB trade union has called for assurances that workers' rights will be protected, and that the company will not be broken up or sold off in parts.
The acquisition of Northern Electric Plc would be a significant move for CalEnergy, which has been expanding its presence in the UK energy market in recent years. The company already owns several wind farms and has an interest in gas storage facilities.
The deadline set by CalEnergy puts pressure on Northern Electric Plc's board to make a decision quickly. The company's shareholders will need to weigh up the benefits and risks of accepting the bid, particularly as the energy market continues to face uncertainty and instability due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
