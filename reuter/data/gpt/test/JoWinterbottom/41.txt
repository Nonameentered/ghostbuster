Sainsbury Shares Drop as Sales Improvement Costs Hit Profits
Sainsbury, one of the UK's major supermarket chains, saw its shares drop as much as 7% after announcing a decline in profits due to the cost of improving sales. The company reported a larger than expected drop in half-year profits, sending its shares to their lowest level in almost three years.
The supermarket chain's pre-tax profits for the six months to September 2019 fell by 15% to £238m, compared to the same period last year. This was due to the company spending an additional £150m to improve its stores and supply chain, leading to higher operating costs.
Sainsbury's was one of the first UK supermarkets to address the growing issue of plastic waste, by committing to reduce its use of plastic packaging by 50% by 2025. This will require a significant investment in packaging alternatives, which has been reflected in the company's spending.
In addition, the company has been investing in technology to improve its supply chain, which has also incurred additional costs. Sainsbury's CEO, Mike Coupe, explained that "our transformation plan involves significant investment in our stores, customer propositions and technology, to deliver against our strategy of being the most trusted retailer where people love to work and shop."
Despite the decline in profits, Sainsbury's reported an increase in sales. The company's total retail sales, including fuel, were up 0.1% to £16.8bn, driven by strong sales in its convenience stores and online grocery business.
However, sales in its larger stores, which account for the majority of its revenue, continued to decline. Sainsbury's reported a 1.2% drop in like-for-like sales, which exclude fuel, in its larger stores. This was partially offset by a 1% increase in like-for-like sales in its convenience stores.
The decline in sales in larger stores has been a trend for Sainsbury's and other UK supermarkets, as consumers increasingly prefer to shop online or in smaller stores that are more convenient and offer a better shopping experience.
Sainsbury's has been trying to address this trend by improving its larger stores, with a focus on fresh and prepared food, which has been performing well. The company has also been investing in online grocery, which it sees as a key growth area.
Sainsbury's has been playing catch up with rivals Tesco and Morrisons in the online grocery market, but its sales in this area are growing faster than its competitors. The company reported a 7.1% increase in online grocery sales, ahead of Tesco and Morrisons, which reported growth of 2.7% and 4.8%, respectively.
Mike Coupe highlighted the importance of online grocery to Sainsbury's business, saying that "our digital channels are growing, and we continue to innovate to meet the changing needs of our customers."
Despite the decline in profits, Sainsbury's maintained its dividend payout to shareholders, which will be welcome news to investors. However, the company's share price fell sharply in response to the news, as investors were disappointed with the decline in profits.
The drop in Sainsbury's share price reflects growing concerns about the UK's retail sector and the impact of Brexit on consumer confidence. Sainsbury's and other UK supermarkets have also been facing competition from discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl, which have been gaining market share in recent years.
Sainsbury's future success will depend on its ability to continue investing in its business to improve sales, while balancing its costs and maintaining its dividend payout. The company's focus on convenience and technology could put it ahead of its competitors in the long term, but it will need to convince investors that the investment is worth the short-term pain.
