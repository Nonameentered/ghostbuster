Safeway, one of the UK's largest supermarket chains, has warned that sales growth has slowed and that inflation has returned to zero. The announcement has sparked concerns for the wider supermarket sector, which has already been hit hard by the pandemic-driven recession.
Figures released by Safeway show that like-for-like sales in the three months to the end of September were up just 0.2%, compared with growth of 1.5% in the previous quarter. The company cites a combination of factors, including the end of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and the reintroduction of restrictions on hospitality venues.
However, the biggest worry for Safeway and other supermarkets is the return of zero inflation. After a period of deflation earlier in the year, prices in the grocery sector began to rise again in the summer. But the latest figures show that inflation is now back down to zero, which could spell trouble for retailers that have already been squeezed by rising costs.
Responding to the news, Safeway CEO Emma Watkins said: "We're experiencing an extremely challenging retail environment at the moment, with a number of headwinds affecting our business. The return of zero inflation is just the latest blow, and we're working hard to manage costs and maintain profitability in this tough climate."
Safeway's warning comes after a tough year for the supermarket sector as a whole. The pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online shopping, with some estimates suggesting that online sales now account for around 20% of all grocery purchases in the UK. At the same time, the growth of discount chains such as Lidl and Aldi has eaten into the market share of established players like Safeway, Tesco, and Morrisons.
Many analysts believe that the coming months will be make or break for traditional supermarkets. With a second wave of Covid-19 cases sweeping across the UK and the threat of a no-deal Brexit looming, there are fears that consumer confidence will be further eroded. Meanwhile, the growth of online shopping and discounters shows no sign of slowing down, meaning that retailers will need to adapt quickly if they are to survive.
"Supermarkets are facing an unprecedented set of challenges at the moment," says retail analyst Catherine Smith. "They need to keep prices low while also investing in e-commerce and sustainability initiatives. At the same time, they're competing with newer, slicker retail options that offer a more convenient and personalised shopping experience. It's going to be tough for the traditional players to keep up."
Some experts believe that Safeway's warning is just the tip of the iceberg. "We could well see a wave of announcements from other supermarkets over the coming weeks," predicts Jane Green, head of retail at Deloitte. "The reality is that everyone is struggling at the moment. It's a very difficult time to be in retail, and we expect to see ongoing challenges for the foreseeable future."
Despite the gloomy outlook, there are still some reasons for optimism in the supermarket sector. Many retailers have invested heavily in online platforms and logistics in recent months, positioning themselves for the long-term shift towards e-commerce. And while discounters continue to grow their market share, there are also signs that consumers are starting to value quality and sustainability over cheap prices.
However, the ongoing pandemic and economic uncertainty mean that the future remains uncertain for supermarkets. In the short term, retailers will need to focus on keeping prices low, managing costs, and adapting to the changing needs of their customers. And in the longer term, they will need to embrace new technologies and business models if they are to thrive in an increasingly competitive and challenging retail environment.
