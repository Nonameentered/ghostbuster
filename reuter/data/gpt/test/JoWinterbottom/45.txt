Arjo Wiggins Appleton has reported a significant drop in profits, reflecting a fragile outlook for the next half-year. The firm's results for the first six months of the year showed a fall in net profits of 32%, resulting in the company's share price dropping by almost 6%.
The paper and packaging manufacturer cited several factors contributing to this decline, including the negative impact of currency fluctuations, higher raw material costs, and increased competition. The company has also been impacted by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit, which has affected trading and investments across the United Kingdom.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton is one of the world's leading manufacturers of paper-based products, including specialised papers for the luxury goods, tobacco, and beverage industries. The firm operates across Europe, North America, and Asia, and has joint ventures in Brazil, Russia, and China.
The company's CEO, Steve Cole, expressed his concerns about the current state of the market and the challenges that the firm is facing. He commented, "The first half has been tough, and we anticipate the second half to be equally challenging, if not more so. We have seen increased competition from new players entering the market, and pricing pressures from our customers."
Cole explained that the company has been implementing measures to address these challenges, including increasing its focus on cost efficiency, strategic investments in new equipment and technology, and streamlining operations.
Despite these initiatives, the company remains cautious about the future. Cole stated, "Our outlook remains fragile, given the uncertainties surrounding Brexit, and the potential impact on our customers and supply chains. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and adjust our strategy accordingly."
The company has also announced a dividend cut, with shareholders receiving a reduced payout of 1.8p per share, down from 2p per share in the same period last year.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton's results highlight the continued challenges faced by businesses in the manufacturing sector, particularly in light of ongoing political, economic, and environmental uncertainties. However, Cole remains confident that the company will emerge stronger from this period of change, stating, "We are committed to investing in our future and building a sustainable business that can weather any storm."
Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring the company's performance over the coming months, as it navigates the complex and unpredictable market conditions.
