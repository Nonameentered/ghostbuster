Tesco, the UK's largest retailer, has announced plans to enter the financial industry by launching a joint venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) called Tesco Bank. The supermarket giant hopes to build on its reputation as one of the country’s most trusted brands and its customer base of over 20 million, to make a significant impact in the competitive world of financial services.
The partnership will formally launch in the coming months and will offer a range of products such as savings accounts, credit cards, mortgages and insurance to its customers. The launch will mark a significant milestone for Tesco, which has long been rumoured to be considering entering the financial sector.
Tesco CEO Dave Lewis announced that the venture builds on the success of the Tesco Clubcard loyalty programme, adding that “by leveraging our existing customer base and banking on the trusted Tesco brand, we believe that we can make a real difference in the banking sector". He also noted that the move was in response to customer demand for easier and more affordable banking services.
Tesco Bank CEO, Benny Higgins, said that the venture will aim to offer a “compelling alternative” to established banking players and said that the partnership with RBS will provide the necessary expertise to help build a long-term sustainable business.
The joint venture with RBS will see Tesco gain access to the bank’s banking license and will give the supermarket giant a much-needed entry into the financial sector. RBS also looks set to benefit from the partnership, as it struggles to improve its financial performance in the wake of the global financial crisis.
The venture is not without its critics, however. Some observers have raised concerns about the potential risks associated with the venture. Tesco has a previously tarnished reputation in the banking sector, after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined the retailer in 2013 for misleading customers over its insurance products.
Despite this, Tesco has taken steps to ensure the venture is compliant with regulatory standards, including hiring industry experts to oversee its launch and seeking regulatory clearance from the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority. 
Overall, the move is expected to be a big success for both Tesco and RBS, as the joint venture looks set to disrupt the established banking players by offering innovative and accessible financial products to UK customers.
