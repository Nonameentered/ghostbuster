Northern Electric is facing scrutiny from the UK's Takeover Panel over a bid to prevent a hostile takeover from a US company. The company, which provides energy to the North East of England, has been fighting off a bid from AmeriGas since last year. However, it has now come to light that Northern Electric may have breached UK takeover rules.
The Takeover Panel is an independent body that oversees mergers and acquisitions in the UK. Its primary role is to ensure that all parties involved in a takeover adhere to strict rules and regulations. These regulations are designed to protect shareholders and ensure that the market operates fairly. The panel has been investigating Northern Electric's response to AmeriGas' bid since January.
The investigation centers around a clause in the UK's takeover rules that forbid a company from implementing what is known as a "poison pill." This means that a company cannot take actions that would make it difficult or impossible for a hostile bidder to take control. In this case, Northern Electric introduced a "golden share" arrangement as part of its bid defense strategy. This means that any attempt to gain control of Northern Electric would require the approval of a special shareholder with a "golden share."
The Takeover Panel is investigating whether this "golden share" arrangement breaches UK takeover rules. In a statement, the panel said: "The panel is investigating whether there has been a breach of the Code by Northern Electric in relation to the implementation of its anti-takeover arrangements, and if so, whether such a breach is so serious as to result in the panel making a public statement."
Northern Electric has defended its actions, stating that the "golden share" arrangement was introduced to protect the interests of its shareholders. In a statement, the company said: "Northern Electric has always acted in the best interests of its shareholders. The 'golden share' arrangement was introduced as part of our bid defense strategy to protect the long-term interests of our shareholders."
AmeriGas, the US company behind the hostile takeover bid, has not yet commented on the investigation. The company announced its intention to acquire Northern Electric last year, describing it as a "compelling opportunity to acquire a valuable asset." Northern Electric's board rejected the bid, stating that it "significantly undervalued" the company.
The investigation by the Takeover Panel is not the only issue facing Northern Electric. The company is also facing pressure from its shareholders to improve its financial performance. In a letter to the board last month, a group of shareholders criticized the company's "disappointing financial results" and called for a change in strategy.
The letter stated: "We are deeply concerned about the company's financial performance and believe that urgent action is needed to address the issues that have led to these disappointing results. We believe that a change in strategy is required to put the company on a more sustainable footing."
Northern Electric has responded to the letter by stating that it is "fully committed" to improving its financial performance. The company has recently announced plans to invest in renewable energy projects, including wind and solar power. It has also promised to increase its dividend payouts to shareholders.
The ongoing battle over Northern Electric highlights the challenges facing UK companies in the face of hostile takeover bids. The UK's takeover rules are designed to protect shareholders and ensure that the market operates fairly. However, companies that are subject to takeover bids are under pressure to defend themselves and protect their interests.
The investigation by the Takeover Panel will be closely watched by the market. If Northern Electric is found to have breached UK takeover rules, it could face significant financial penalties and damage to its reputation. Whatever the outcome of the investigation, the battle over Northern Electric is likely to continue for some time to come.
