British supermarkets are preparing for a price war as the race to claim the most significant share of the consumer market heats up. Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda are currently experimenting with new pricing policies, with the expectation that Morrison’s will follow closely behind.
Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket, has already significantly lowered its prices in response to the rise of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, both of whom have been steadily encroaching on the supermarket behemoth’s once dominant market position. Tesco’s new “Low Price Promise” campaign sees the supermarket vowing to match Aldi and Lidl’s prices on a selection of own-brand and branded products.
Sainsbury’s has also introduced a new pricing strategy which they’ve dubbed “fair and consistent pricing” which provides shoppers with low prices across a broader range of products instead of offering promotions or deals. Asda, the UK’s third-largest supermarket, has responded to existing pricing pressures by undertaking a thorough overhaul of its existing strategy.
Whilst these developments may seem like a new era for the UK grocery market in which customers reap the benefits of a price war, some industry analysts remain skeptical of a full-scale battle. Instead, some commentators assert that the supermarkets’ recent behavior represents more of a re-evaluation in response to sustained pressure from discounters rather than a genuine price war.
Reports suggest that discounters Aldi and Lidl have a combined market share of approximately 12%, with a recent Kantar report indicating that Lidl has enjoyed a 7.7% market share increase in recent months compared to just 0.1% for more traditional supermarkets. Additionally, Lidl was named the cheapest supermarket in the UK in January 2021, highlighting the pressure more established players face.
Some analysts remain skeptical of a full-fledged price war, opining that the UK’s traditional supermarket chains can’t afford to lose their premium pricing models as doing so would likely lead to increased competition and reduced profit margins. Furthermore, discounters’ operating models are significantly different from established supermarkets and as a result, a comprehensive price war may be unsustainable and too expensive to undertake.
While the prospect of sustained, low prices is appealing to the average shopper, some believe that too much competition may result in supermarkets engaging in anticompetitive activities to maintain dominance. Such practices, if undertaken, would likely lead to more expensive prices for consumers in the medium to long term as they’ll result in a lack of competition.
This issue of market dominance was emphasized last year when a history-making £8 billion merger between Sainsbury’s and Asda was blocked by UK regulators due to concerns that the combined entity would dominate the market to the detriment of smaller players.
Despite the doubts surrounding the possibility of a full-scale price war, it is becoming increasingly clear that traditional supermarkets are taking note of changing consumer buying habits and adjusting pricing policies accordingly.
The last decade has seen a significant shift in shopping habits, with shoppers increasingly favoring discounters and buying an ever-increasing proportion of their groceries online. As a result, traditional supermarket chains have had to adapt to the changing environment, with many investing in technology platforms to optimize their digital operations.
Despite the doubts about the sustainability of a full-fledged price war, it’s clear that the UK’s traditional players are undergoing a significant shift in response to fast-moving trends that are transforming the UK’s grocery landscape. As such, UK shoppers are set to benefit from a new era of low prices and increased competition, with the promise of more to come as the UK’s various supermarkets turn to new strategies to retain market share and appeal to a new kind of shopper.
