United Utilities has won the highly contested contract for water and sewage operations in the metropolitan area of Manila, Philippines. The contract is expected to be a turning point for the UK-based company, as it expands to a new market with a population of over 12 million people. However, analysts predict that United Utilities may face delays in achieving profits due to the complex and challenging nature of the project.
The Philippine government launched an extensive bidding process for the contract, which was hotly contested by several international companies. United Utilities ultimately won the contract, committing to a 25-year agreement to provide water and sanitation services to the Manila metropolitan area. According to the company's CEO, Steve Mogford, United Utilities plans to bring its expertise and experience from the UK to develop a sustainable water and wastewater system for Manila.
The Manila water market is a crucial one for United Utilities, which is seeking to expand its operations overseas. The Manila project is the biggest investment made by United Utilities outside of the UK and Ireland, putting significant pressure on the company to deliver strong performance. However, United Utilities is no stranger to water operations, having been in the industry for over 25 years and providing water and sewage services for over 7 million people.
Despite United Utilities' experience, the Manila project could prove challenging and risky. An analyst from Jefferies financial services firm predicts that United Utilities may face significant delays in generating profits due to the complexities of the project. The Manila metropolitan area is an urban hub with a sprawling population and inadequate infrastructure, making it a challenging market to operate in.
Furthermore, the investment required to roll out new water and sewage infrastructure could be an obstacle. United Utilities may have to fund this project with significant capital expenditure (capex) upfront. According to Jefferies, the company will likely have to invest 3.5 billion pesos per year ($70.7m) in capex, far higher than the current investment in the UK of 2.5 billion pesos ($50.5m) per year. This translates to United Utilities having to exceed capex levels by 40%, which puts a strain on the company.
The payout from Manila water may also be lower than expected. United Utilities' revenue from the Manila project is set to be approximately 1.2 billion pesos ($24m) per year. However, according to Jefferies, the cost structure of the project could reduce this payout. "We estimate that the overall profitability will be lower than forecasted due to lower water volumes being supplied than anticipated. Combined with the higher capex costs being incurred, United Utilities may face a delayed breakeven point," said a Jefferies analyst.
Ultimately, United Utilities will have to navigate the complexities of the Manila project and work closely with the Philippine government to streamline infrastructure and operations. The company may also face challenges in meeting regulatory requirements and meeting the adequate service level agreements (SLAs) for water services. Nonetheless, United Utilities has significant experience in the water industry and strong technical capabilities. The company is confident in its ability to deliver the best experience possible to the population of Manila.
In conclusion, United Utilities' win of the Manila water and sewage contract marks an important milestone for the company as it expands into a new territory. Nonetheless, the company will face significant challenges concerning funding, capex, and regulatory compliance. United Utilities may also face delayed profitability due to lower-than-expected volumes and high investment costs. Ultimately, United Utilities' success in the Manila market will come down to how well it navigates these challenges and addresses the needs of millions of Manila residents.
