The Chemical Industries Association (CIA) has called for an urgent reform of the electricity wholesale market. In a statement released on Monday, the association said that the current market structure is not fit for purpose and is leading to higher electricity costs for businesses.
The CIA, which represents over 100 companies in the UK chemical and pharmaceutical sectors, argues that the current wholesale market incentivises suppliers to charge higher prices during periods of high demand. This, in turn, leads to higher costs for businesses that rely on electricity as a key input.
The association is calling for a number of reforms, including the introduction of a more dynamic pricing system and a reduction in system charges. It also wants to see more investment in energy storage and demand response technologies, which could help to reduce peak demand and ease pressure on the electricity grid.
In its statement, the CIA warned that failure to reform the electricity wholesale market could lead to job losses and reduced investment in the UK chemical and pharmaceutical sectors.
"We urgently need a fair and transparent electricity market that works for businesses of all sizes," said Steve Elliott, CEO of the CIA. "If we don't take action now, we risk seeing increasing electricity costs that will undermine the competitiveness of our industry and put jobs at risk."
The call for reform comes as the UK government prepares to introduce new legislation aimed at reducing carbon emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy sources. The Energy White Paper, which is expected to be published later this year, will outline the government's plans for a "green industrial revolution".
However, the CIA warns that without significant changes to the electricity wholesale market, the government's plans may not succeed in reducing emissions and promoting renewable energy.
"The government's ambition for a green industrial revolution is laudable, but it will only succeed if we have a competitive and efficient electricity market that supports investment in low-carbon technologies," said Elliott.
The CIA's call for reform has been welcomed by other business groups, including the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Institute of Directors (IoD).
"The current system is not fit for purpose and is leading to higher costs for businesses, particularly those in energy-intensive sectors," said Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI. "We need urgent reform to ensure a fair and transparent electricity market that supports the UK's transition to a low-carbon economy."
