London- British utility stocks have gained following Southern Electric's announcement of a share buyback plan to return capital to shareholders, igniting hopes that other utilities would follow suit.
Shares of companies such as National Grid, United Utilities, and Severn Trent have risen, together with Southern Electric's parent company, Centrica, whose shares rose by 5.4%. The buyback plan by Southern Electric comes after years of pressure from investors to improve shareholder returns.
In a statement released on Friday, Southern Electric announced that it would buy back up to $401m worth of shares, adding that the move was part of its strategy to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in growth opportunities.
Southern Electric's move has been taken by investors as a positive sign that other utilities could follow in its footsteps. Utility stocks, traditionally viewed as stable but low-yielding investments, have been under pressure from investors who have been calling for them to improve returns.
"The move by Southern Electric is welcome news for investors, who have been looking for ways in which the sector can be made more attractive," said analyst Neil Wilson of Markets.com. "This buyback could encourage other utilities to take similar measures, which would be positive for investors."
Southern Electric's share buyback plan is the latest move by Centrica to improve shareholder returns. In 2017, the company sold off its exploration and production assets for $250m, and last year it announced a cost-cutting program aimed at reducing costs by $1.25bn by 2022.
According to Centrica chief executive Iain Conn, the company's cost-cutting program has made it more agile and able to invest in growth opportunities. He added that the share buyback plan was a further step in the company's strategy to return cash to shareholders.
"We are taking a balanced approach to capital allocation, ensuring we remain focused on investing in our customer-facing businesses whilst also returning surplus capital to our shareholders," said Conn in a statement.
The share buyback plan is being seen as a sign that utilities are becoming more responsive to investor demands for better returns. It comes at a time when many investors are looking for ways to preserve capital and generate income in a low-interest-rate environment.
According to analysts, utilities are likely to become more attractive to investors if they can improve shareholder returns. The sector has traditionally been viewed as a stable source of income for investors, but low yields and rising costs have made it less appealing to some investors.
Southern Electric's buyback plan is seen as a good first step towards improving returns for shareholders. However, analysts caution that utilities will need to continue to find ways to improve returns if they are to attract more investors.
"The move by Southern Electric is positive for the sector, but it is only one step," said Wilson. "Utilities will need to continue to look for new ways to generate income and return value to shareholders if they are to become more attractive to investors."
