Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc, one of the UK's largest energy companies, has reported lower than expected profits for the fiscal year ending in March 2021. However, the company has increased its dividend payout by 11%, in a move that is likely to soothe investor concerns.
The Glasgow-based firm's profits for the year were down by 3%, at Â£480m ($670m), compared to the previous year. This was attributed to lower demand for electricity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as increased costs related to infrastructure upgrades and maintenance.
Despite the subdued financial performance, Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc's board of directors has decided to increase the dividend payout to investors by 11%, to 60p per share. This is likely to be seen as a positive move by the company, as it indicates that management is confident in the firm's long-term sustainability and growth prospects.
Commenting on the results, Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc CEO, Keith Anderson, said: "It has been a challenging year for our business, as well as for the energy sector as a whole. However, we are pleased with how we have performed, given the circumstances. We have continued to invest in our infrastructure, while ensuring that our customers receive a reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity."
He added: "Our decision to increase the dividend payout is a reflection of our confidence in the business and our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders."
Despite the dip in profits, the company has made progress on a number of key strategic initiatives. One of these is the rollout of smart meters across its customer base, which is expected to be completed by 2023. This will enable customers to manage their energy consumption more effectively, while also helping the company to better manage its supply and demand.
The company has also made significant investments in renewable energy, with plans to increase its current capacity of 2.6GW by a further 1GW by 2025. This is in line with the UK government's target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and will involve the development of new wind, hydro and solar power projects.
In a separate development, Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc has announced that it will partner with a number of leading technology firms to explore the potential of blockchain technology in the energy sector. Blockchain is a decentralised ledger technology that enables secure and transparent transactions, and has the potential to transform the way energy is produced, distributed and consumed.
The partnership will involve the development of a blockchain-based platform that will enable customers to sell their excess energy back to the grid, and receive payments in real-time. This will help to incentivise the uptake of renewable energy, and enable customers to generate additional income from their renewable energy investments.
Overall, Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc's financial results for the year ending in March 2021 may have been disappointing, but the company's decision to increase the dividend payout by 11% suggests that management is confident in the company's long-term prospects. With the energy sector undergoing significant transformation, driven by advances in technology and changing customer preferences, the firm's investments in renewable energy and blockchain are likely to position it well for the future.
