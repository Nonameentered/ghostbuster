Wessex Water, one of the leading water supply and sewage treatment companies in the UK, has announced a 10 percent rise in half-year pre-tax profits and a 14 percent increase in dividends, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. The company saw its pre-tax profits reach £55.4 million in the six months to the end of September.
Although the results have pleased investors in the company, shareholders have expressed disappointment over the lack of immediate benefits being passed on to them. This news comes as the company, which serves 2.8 million customers in the South of England, announced its strategy for the next five years.
The company has assured its shareholders that they intend to invest £2 billion over the next five years, largely towards reducing the carbon footprint of the business. This is in line with the company's sustainability and environmental objectives, including reducing carbon by 70 percent by 2025 and closing their coal-powered gas turbines by 2023.
The company's CEO, Colin Skellett, said that the business had performed well in the first six months of this financial year despite the Covid-19 pandemic, which has affected many businesses across the UK. However, shareholders have criticised the lack of immediate benefits for them.
One shareholder, John Jones, said: "I understand that the company needs to invest in reducing its carbon footprint, but as shareholders, we want to see some immediate benefits, that is what we invest for. A 14 percent increase in dividends is great, but what about a reduction in our water bills?"
Wessex Water was also criticised in the report by the Environmental Audit Committee for the underinvestment in wastewater treatment.
Speaking about the criticism the company has received, Mr Skellett has said that Wessex Water is committed to investing in wastewater treatment, and that a new treatment plant in Salisbury is set to open soon.
Mr Skellett added: “We are committed to providing great customer service and we understand that our shareholders have invested in the business with the hope of a return. However, we must balance the need to invest in our infrastructure and reduce our carbon footprint to meet our sustainability objectives with the need to benefit our shareholders.
"We are confident that the investments we are making will pay off in the long run, but we urge our shareholders to be patient in the short term."
