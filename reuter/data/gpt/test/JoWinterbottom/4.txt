Scottish Power, one of the major energy providers in the UK, has announced a 19% increase in dividends for its shareholders, following the release of impressive half-year results and cost savings from its recent takeover.
The energy giant said that the increase in dividends, which will be paid to shareholders in December, was directly linked to its strong financial performance in the first six months of the year.
Scottish Power reported a 20% increase in profits before tax for the first half of 2021, compared to the same period last year. The company revealed that it had generated £159.8m in profit, up from £132.2m the previous year, thanks to a rise in energy prices and a boost to demand from customers as a result of the pandemic.
Moreover, Scottish Power's recent acquisition of the majority stake in Spanish energy firm, Naturgy, helped it to achieve £10.8m in cost savings during the first half of the year, which could further increase the dividends of shareholders.
Scottish Power's CEO, Keith Anderson, noted the benefits of the Naturgy deal in generating cost savings. He said, "We are on track to deliver our commitments and have already achieved significant cost savings in the first half of the year, demonstrating the benefits of the Naturgy acquisition. We remain committed to our long-term strategy to deliver a cleaner, more sustainable energy system for the benefit of our customers, employees and stakeholders."
The dividend increase marks a significant moment for Scottish Power and its shareholders, particularly after the company suspended their dividend payouts last year due to the pandemic. However, the company now maintains a dividend policy aiming to offer a payout ratio of 80% of earnings until 2025.
The substantial increase in dividends is set to benefit many of Scottish Power's shareholders, including Spanish energy company, Iberdrola, which owns 80% of Scottish Power. The remaining 20% is held by Australian investment bank, Macquarie.
The dividend increase is not only a boost for Scottish Power's shareholders, but it also reflects the positive momentum of the energy sector as a whole. Renewable energy companies have benefited from an increase in energy prices and demand due to lockdowns and working from home arrangements. Similarly, fossil fuel companies have experienced a surge in oil prices and higher demand for gas.
In conclusion, Scottish Power's announcement of a dividend increase represents a significant boost for the company and its shareholders. The half-year results and cost savings from the Naturgy acquisition have reflected the robustness of the energy sector despite the impacts of the pandemic. This development also connotes a potential increase in market confidence and a continuing momentum in the energy sector going forward.
