British retailers have reported a festive boost in sales, despite the ongoing pandemic. However, the spending patterns of consumers have not returned to the extravagant culture of the 1980s.
According to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the sales volumes in December rose by 1.8% compared to the same period in 2019. Meanwhile, online sales increased by 50.4%, marking a record high for e-commerce.
Helen Dickinson, the Chief Executive at BRC, has praised the retailers for their hard work amid the challenges of COVID-19. "2020 has been an extraordinary year," she said. "Retailers have had to take significant steps to ensure customers can shop safely, whether in store or online."
However, the growth in sales during Christmas was mostly driven by groceries and household goods, as opposed to non-essential items. The sales of fashion and footwear were reported to have dropped by 25.1%, and beauty and cosmetics by 22.6%.
Moreover, despite the overall increase in sales, the pattern of spending did not reflect the lavishness of the 1980s. High levels of uncertainty and job losses have left many consumers cautious with their purchases. Therefore, instead of splurging on designer clothes and accessories, shoppers were more likely to buy practical and affordable items.
The BRC also confirmed that the retailers had heavily discounted their products, with the average price of non-food items dropping by 3.8%. This, however, impacted the profit margins of the retailers, and many have now urged the government to provide more support.
Andrew Goodacre, the CEO of the British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA), has warned of the long-term consequences for the industry. "Whilst this is an improvement compared to the rest of the year," he said, "in reality, the current situation is unsustainable for the retail industry in the long term. The Government must do more to support the industry and create an environment where retailers can survive and thrive."
The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has also impacted the retail sector, with many retailers experiencing delays and disruptions amid the ongoing negotiations. The BRC has now urged the government to expedite the trade negotiations and provide clarity for the industry's sake.
Despite the challenges, some retailers managed to thrive during the festive period. JD Sports reported an increase in sales by 5%, while John Lewis saw a rise in online sales by 70%. Even Primark, which relies entirely on its physical stores, was able to recover somewhat during the Christmas period.
Nevertheless, with the pandemic still ongoing, the road to recovery will likely be long and treacherous. The retail industry will need to adapt to the changing needs and spending habits of their customers, while also adopting innovative strategies to keep their profits afloat.
In summary, British retailers have reported some good news regarding the growth in Christmas sales. However, it's clear that the spending patterns of consumers have not returned to the excesses of the 1980s. Instead, consumers remained cautious and practical with their purchases, leaving retailers with challenges on the road ahead.
