CE Electric has won an extension in the bid battle for Northern Electric with a new deadline of 31st March 2021 for the company to be sold to the highest bidder. The electric distribution network in Northern United Kingdom, which is owned by the German utility company E.ON, has been put up for sale since June 2020 as part of its plans to exit the UK market.
Northern Electric comprises of three distribution companies - Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) and Electricity North West. The network serves 8 million customers in the north of England, the north east of Scotland, and parts of North Wales, Lancashire and Cumbria.
CE Electric, also known as Cheung Kong Infrastructure, is a Hong Kong-based company and is one of four bidders still in the running for Northern Electric. The other three bidders are Australian fund manager Macquarie, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and one consortium formed by UK-based pension funds.
As part of the competitive bidding process, a review of Northern Electric's financial and management data has been ongoing. The extension of the bid deadline until March 2021 has been granted to allow the review process to be completed.
CE Electric has been the frontrunner in the bid battle, having submitted an offer of around £8.5 billion ($11.3 billion). The company has a global portfolio of infrastructure investments in energy, transportation, water, and waste management and seeks to expand its assets in Northern Electric to further diversify its operations.
Northern Powergrid, which is part of Northern Electric, had raised concerns over the bidding process last November. It highlighted the top bidders' potential conflicts of interests and the need to ensure that the sale would not affect the quality of service to customers.
In response, CE Electric, which already has infrastructure investments in the UK, said that it was committed to maintaining the high standards of customer service provided by the Northern Electric companies. CE Electric said it would continue to work towards a smooth ownership transition of Northern Electric, which should not create any disruption to customers or employees.
Northern Electric has stated that its priority is to ensure a smooth ownership transition that will benefit customers, employees and the communities it serves. It has set out a number of requirements for potential bidders including their ability to demonstrate a sound financial position, their experience in running regulated utilities, maintaining a high standard of customer service and their ability to respect the interests of stakeholders.
The other bidders have not released details of their offers, but the sale is regarded as a hotly contested one, with a number of overseas companies seeking to purchase Northern Electric. There are concerns among some industry experts that foreign ownership of the Northern Electric network could impact the UK's energy security and increase the chances of energy price hikes for consumers.
The UK government has vowed to take a more cautious approach to foreign investment in sensitive sectors of the economy in recent years. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is responsible for overseeing the sale of Northern Electric, and it expects a rigorous review process to be completed.
Meanwhile, Northern Electric's employees have expressed concerns about job security and the potential impact overseas ownership could have on their pensions. Some of the bidders have sought to allay these fears, with some expressing a commitment to retaining a UK-based management team and to honouring the existing employee benefits and pension arrangements.
The extension of the bid deadline gives potential bidders more time to assess Northern Electric's financial and management data and submit a final offer. As the deadline approaches, the competition is expected to intensify, with the outcome of the bid battle to be known by March 31st, 2021. 
In conclusion, the extension of the bid deadline for Northern Electric has given Cheung Kong Infrastructure more time to assess the network's financial and management data. CE Electric remains the frontrunner in the bid battle, having submitted an offer of around £8.5 billion. The sale is seen as controversial, with fears over foreign ownership impacting the UK's energy security and increasing prices for consumers. Northern Electric has set out a number of requirements for potential bidders, including their ability to demonstrate a sound financial position and high standard of customer service.
