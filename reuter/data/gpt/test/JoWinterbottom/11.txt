After months of speculation, sources close to the matter have revealed that the UK government is likely to approve CE Electric's bid for Northern Electric, despite political concerns.
The proposed acquisition, which was first announced in March, has faced public backlash as well as resistance from members of the opposition Labour Party, who have accused CE Electric of being nothing more than a "Chinese state-owned enterprise."
Critics have also voiced concerns over potential job losses in the North East, where Northern Electric is based, as well as fears over national security and Chinese influence in an essential sector such as energy.
However, sources have stated that the government is expected to approve the deal after the companies provided assurances that it would not impact on jobs and energy security.
CE Electric, which is a subsidiary of the state-owned China Electricity Power Company, has stated that the acquisition would increase the company's investment in renewable energy and reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.
"We see significant opportunities for growth in the UK's energy sector, particularly in the renewable energy space," a spokesperson for CE Electric said. "This acquisition would enable us to leverage our expertise and resources and build a more sustainable energy future for the UK."
The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval.
The news has been met with mixed reactions, with some expressing concern over the involvement of a Chinese company in the UK's energy sector.
"There are legitimate concerns around national security when it comes to Chinese involvement in our energy sector," Shadow Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry said. "We need to ensure that we are not leaving ourselves vulnerable to foreign influence or manipulation."
Others have welcomed the move, citing the potential benefits for renewable energy in the UK.
"This is a positive development for the UK's energy sector," said Dr. Nina Skorupska, Chief Executive of the Renewable Energy Association. "CE Electric has significant experience in renewable energy and this acquisition could help to boost investment in this area."
Northern Electric is the second-largest electricity distributor in the UK, serving over 3 million customers in the North East, Yorkshire, and northern Lincolnshire.
The company has faced its own challenges in recent years, with the regulator Ofgem imposing a Â£10.5 million penalty on Northern Electric in 2020 for "poor customer service and complaints handling."
CE Electric has stated that it plans to invest in Northern Electric's infrastructure and customer service as part of the acquisition.
Despite the political concerns surrounding the deal, it is not uncommon for foreign companies to invest in the UK's energy sector. In 2018, Scottish Power was acquired by the Spanish company Iberdrola, and German energy company E.On acquired UK energy supplier npower in 2019.
Energy Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan has previously stated that the UK is "open for business" when it comes to foreign investment in its energy sector.
"We are committed to attracting international investment in our energy sector to help drive growth and create jobs," Trevelyan said. "However, we also need to ensure that any investment is in line with our national security and economic interests."
It remains to be seen how the government's approval of CE Electric's bid for Northern Electric will play out in the coming months. With the UK's energy sector facing increasing pressure to reduce emissions and embrace renewable energy, the acquisition could have significant implications for the country's energy future.
