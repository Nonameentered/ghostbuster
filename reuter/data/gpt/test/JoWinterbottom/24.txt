The Takeover Panel has launched a probe into Northern Electric's fight against a hostile takeover bid from a U.S.-based company. The move comes after the British utility company escalated its efforts to fend off the bid, which it says undervalues the company and threatens its future development.
The U.S. company, which has not been named, made an unsolicited offer to buy Northern Electric earlier this year. At the time, Northern Electric rejected the offer, saying it did not reflect the true value of the company. The U.S. company then increased its bid, but Northern Electric again rejected the offer.
Since then, the two companies have been engaged in a bitter battle, with Northern Electric making a series of moves to protect itself from the takeover. These moves include making acquisitions to strengthen the company, cutting costs, and launching a share buyback program.
The Takeover Panel, which regulates takeovers in the UK, has now launched an investigation into these actions. The panel will look at whether Northern Electric's efforts to fend off the bid have been in compliance with UK takeover rules and whether they are in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.
Northern Electric has welcomed the investigation, saying that it has acted in the best interests of its shareholders. "We are confident that our actions have been entirely appropriate and in compliance with all relevant regulations," the company said in a statement.
However, the U.S. company has criticized Northern Electric's actions, saying that they are designed to prevent shareholders from accepting its offer. "We believe that our offer represents fair value for Northern Electric and we are disappointed that the company has not engaged with us in a constructive way," the U.S. company said in a statement.
The takeover battle has caused concern among Northern Electric's employees, who fear that a takeover by the U.S. company could lead to job losses and a deterioration in working conditions. The company has sought to reassure employees that their jobs are safe and that the company will continue to pursue its growth strategy regardless of the outcome of the bid.
Some analysts have suggested that Northern Electric could be a target for other bidders if the U.S. company is successful in its takeover attempt. "Northern Electric is a valuable asset and there are likely to be other companies interested in acquiring it," said one analyst.
However, others have said that the takeover battle is a distraction for the company and could lead to a decline in its fortunes. "All this fighting is not good for the company. It distracts management from focusing on the business and could lead to a decline in performance," said another analyst.
The Takeover Panel's investigation is expected to take several months, during which time the battle for Northern Electric will continue. Both companies have said that they are determined to see the bid through to the end, regardless of the outcome. For now, Northern Electric's shareholders will have to wait and see how the bid unfolds and whether the company's efforts to fend it off are successful.
