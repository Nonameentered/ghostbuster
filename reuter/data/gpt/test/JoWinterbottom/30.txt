Dixons Group profits soar 53% thanks to strong PC sales, but concern over tax increases impacts shares.
Dixons Group, the UK's leading retailer of consumer electronics and appliances, has reported a massive 53% surge in profits for the fiscal year ending March 2021. The company's strong performance was attributed to the robust demand for personal computers and related devices during the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced people to work and study from home.
Dixons' annual profits before tax came in at £331m, up from £216m the previous year, while its revenue rose by 14% to £10.7bn. The company recognized a strong growth in its online sales, which jumped by 121% year-on-year, assisting the retailer to offset the effect of lockdowns and restrictions imposed on brick-and-mortar stores.
Dixons said the success of its business during the pandemic could be attributed to its fast pivot from retail stores to an online-first model, coupled with a customer-focused strategy. The company also concentrated on redesigning its supply chain and reducing operational costs, resulting in a 2.3% rise in operational efficiency.
"We are pleased with our overall results, particularly given the significant challenges we faced during the year. As the pandemic-driven demands for home electronics and appliances continue, we are well-positioned to benefit," said Alex Baldock, Dixons Group's CEO.
Despite Dixons' impressive financial performance, the company's shares dropped by 4.6% following its announcement. Investors concerned about the UK's plan to raise corporation tax from 19% to 25% by 2023 may be responsible for the dip.
The UK government announced its intention to increase the corporate tax rate during the Budget presentation on March 3, as part of its measures to revive the economy after the pandemic and support public finances. The move follows similar actions by other countries, including the USA and Japan, which have raised their corporation tax rates recently.
The Chancellor provided exemptions to smaller companies with profits under £50,000, who will continue to pay the current 19% tax. Those with earnings between £50,000 and £250,000 will pay higher tax gradually, with the levy going up by 3% to 23% in 2023.
Baldock said in a statement that despite uncertainty about the upcoming tax increase, the company expected to maintain its momentum. "While the tax increase is a concern, we do not expect it to affect our immediate financial performance significantly," he said.
Dixons said it anticipated that demand for electronics and home appliances would remain high for the remainder of this year due to ongoing lockdown restrictions. The company is planning to increase its investment in the digital space and expand its geographic footprint while also focusing on sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint.
"We are confident in our ability to sustain our positive performance, uphold our customer-centric strategy and execute on our future plans despite the challenges arising from the global economy," Baldock added.
In conclusion, Dixons' impressive profit report shows that demand for electronic devices has increased sharply during the pandemic, which has forced businesses and consumers to switch to digital working because it is safer. However, investors remain cautious about the outlook as global economies recover, vaccine rollout continues, and corporation tax rates rise.
