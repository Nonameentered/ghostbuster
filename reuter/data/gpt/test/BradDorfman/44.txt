Harnischfeger Industries Inc. has offered $747 million to acquire Giddings & Lewis Inc., the latest in a string of major deals in the manufacturing sector. The move is aimed at expanding Harnischfeger's presence in the machine tool and automation industries, as well as diversifying its customer base.
The offer, which was announced on Thursday, represents a premium of 62% over Giddings & Lewis' closing stock price on Wednesday. The deal would be financed through a combination of cash on hand and debt.
"We are excited about the opportunity to bring Giddings & Lewis into our portfolio," said Peter Leibinger, CEO of Harnischfeger. "Their strong position in the machine tool industry, combined with our expertise in automation and material handling, would create a powerful platform for growth and innovation."
Giddings & Lewis specializes in the design and manufacture of large-scale machine tools, including boring mills, vertical turning centers, and horizontal machining centers. The company's products are used in a variety of industries, including aerospace, automotive, energy, and defense.
Harnischfeger, meanwhile, is a global provider of cranes, lift trucks, and other material handling equipment, as well as automation and software solutions. The company has a presence in more than 50 countries and generated $2.7 billion in revenue in 2020.
The acquisition of Giddings & Lewis would allow Harnischfeger to expand its offerings in the machine tool segment, which has seen strong demand in recent years due to the growth of advanced manufacturing and the need for precision machining.
"This is a strategic move for Harnischfeger," said John Larkin, an analyst at Stifel. "Giddings & Lewis is a well-respected player in the machine tool industry and has a loyal customer base. By acquiring them, Harnischfeger can offer a more complete solution to customers and gain access to new markets."
The deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Upon completion, Giddings & Lewis will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harnischfeger.
Shares of Giddings & Lewis soared on the news, rising more than 50% in premarket trading. Harnischfeger's stock was also up, although by a more modest 2%.
The acquisition of Giddings & Lewis is just the latest in a series of major deals in the manufacturing sector. Earlier this year, Emerson Electric acquired Pentair's valves and controls business for $3.15 billion, while Parker Hannifin agreed to purchase UK-based Meggitt for $8.8 billion. Analysts expect the trend toward industry consolidation to continue as companies look to build scale and expand their offerings.
