Minneapolis-based TCF Financial Corporation (NYSE: TCF) has announced that it is acquiring Winthrop Resources Corporation, a major player in the equipment leasing industry, for $326 million. This move marks TCF's entry into the equipment leasing field, and expands the bank's leasing capabilities and offerings.
Winthrop, based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, provides customized, technology-driven, equipment leasing solutions to clients in a range of industries throughout the US. The company's portfolio has a value of over $1 billion and includes leases for a variety of assets such as technology, healthcare, energy, transportation and manufacturing equipment.
TCF Chairman and CEO Craig Dahl said in a statement that the acquisition would be a "meaningful step" for the bank in expanding its commercial banking business. "We believe that our products and services, combined with Winthrop's expertise and experience in the industry, will provide our customers with high-quality equipment financing solutions," he said.
Winthrop President and CEO Chris Hunnicutt said he was "thrilled" to be joining forces with TCF and that the move would provide "significant momentum" for both companies. "Our people, processes, and technology are a great fit with TCF's culture and focus on providing superior customer service," he said in a statement.
The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. TCF anticipates that the deal will be accretive to earnings in 2018, and that it will generate a return on investment of 15% over the next three years.
The acquisition also reflects a wider trend of consolidation in the financial services industry, as smaller banks look to gain scale and broader capabilities in order to compete with larger institutions. As demand for equipment leasing continues to grow among businesses in a range of industries, TCF is positioning itself to benefit from this trend and expand its offerings to customers.
