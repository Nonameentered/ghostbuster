Banyan Strategic Realty Trust (BSRT), a real estate investment trust (REIT), recently reported a decline in their Q4 funds from operations (FFO). The company's FFO was $0.34 per share, which is down from $0.41 per share in the Q4 of 2015.
BSRT President and CEO, John P. Bailey, cited several reasons for the decrease in FFO. He indicated that the company experienced higher property management and repair costs, as well as lower occupancy rates and higher tenant concessions. Bailey also mentioned that there were fewer property acquisitions during the quarter, which contributed to the decline.
Despite the drop in Q4 FFO, Bailey remains optimistic about the future of the company. He projects an increase in FFO during 2017 due to recent property acquisitions and an improving real estate market. "We have taken actions to increase occupancy rates and improve our properties, and we expect these efforts to result in higher FFO going forward," said Bailey.
The company's strategy for 2017 includes continued property acquisitions and improvements, as well as a focus on leasing and retaining tenants. Bailey also stated that BSRT plans to diversify its portfolio by investing in properties outside of its primary market in the Southeastern United States.
BSRT's portfolio includes a mix of multi-family residential and commercial properties, with a total of 35 properties in seven states. The company's focus on properties in growing markets has helped to attract tenants and increase occupancy rates in recent years.
Industry experts generally agree with Bailey's prediction of an upswing in FFO for BSRT in 2017. "BSRT's strategy of acquiring properties in growing markets and improving them has been successful in the past, and I see no reason why it wouldn't continue to be successful," said Jane Smith, a real estate analyst with Smith & Associates. "I think we'll see positive results for BSRT in the coming year."
Overall, BSRT's Q4 report was lower than expected, but Bailey's outlook for the future of the company is positive. The company's focus on property acquisitions and improvements, as well as diversifying its portfolio, should help to ensure growth and success in the coming years.
