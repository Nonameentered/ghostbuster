Milwaukee-based Harnischfeger Industries Inc revealed that it is in talks to acquire Giddings & Lewis Inc, a major player in the machine tool and material handling industry, as part of its efforts to dominate the sector.
CEO Thomas Wadden announced the plans during a press conference on Thursday, saying that the acquisition of Giddings & Lewis would be a "game-changer" for Harnischfeger Industries.
"Giddings & Lewis is a well-established brand in the machine tool and material handling industry, and we believe that their expertise and capabilities would be a perfect complement to our existing business," he said.
Harnischfeger Industries is a global provider of mining and materials handling equipment and services with 80 years of experience in the industry. The company has a strong reputation for its manufacturing excellence, technological innovation, and customer service.
Giddings & Lewis, on the other hand, is a leading producer of high-quality machine tools and industrial automation systems that are widely used in the aerospace, automotive, and other manufacturing sectors.
With the acquisition, Harnischfeger Industries will be able to offer a comprehensive suite of solutions for all types of industries that require precision tools and automated systems, including aerospace, automotive, and industrial manufacturing.
The move is also part of a larger strategy to expand Harnischfeger Industries' reach into new markets and enhance its ability to serve customers around the globe.
"We are always looking for ways to improve our customer experience and bring more value to our clients," said Wadden. "By combining our expertise with that of Giddings & Lewis, we believe that we can achieve something truly transformative in the industry."
Although the terms of the deal have not been made public, it is expected to be a significant investment for Harnischfeger Industries, as Giddings & Lewis is a well-established company with a large customer base and a strong reputation.
However, Wadden is confident that the investment will pay off in the long run, noting that the machine tool and material handling industry is poised for growth in the coming years.
"Machine tools and automation systems are essential components of virtually every manufacturing process, and we believe that the demand for these products will only continue to grow as global markets expand and become ever more competitive," he said.
If the acquisition is successful, it will mark a major milestone for Harnischfeger Industries and solidify its position as a leading provider of mining and materials handling equipment and services.
The company has a long history of innovation and growth, and this latest move shows that it is committed to staying ahead of the curve and finding new ways to meet the evolving needs of its customers.
The acquisition of Giddings & Lewis is expected to be completed within the next few months, pending regulatory approval and other formalities. In the meantime, both companies will continue to operate independently but will work closely together to ensure a smooth transition and maximum benefits for their customers.
