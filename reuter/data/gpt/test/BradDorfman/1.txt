Investors were left stunned as Mercury Finance Co.'s proposed acquisition of a consumer finance business collapsed following the revelation of accounting fraud. The deal valued at $1.2 billion had been seen as a major strategic move for the company that specializes in providing loans for customers that have been turned down by mainstream lenders.
Mercury had been in discussions for weeks and had completed due diligence on the finance business before completely dismantling the deal. The fraud occurred at the firm with the result that revenues and profits had been inflated, and the company's true financial position obscured from view, which was only discovered when Mercury's auditors conducted an additional level of forensic checks.
In a statement, Mercury CEO, Thomas Austin said, "We were misled about the financial performance of the business. While it's deeply regrettable that we weren't able to conclude this transaction, we must operate with integrity and transparency. We cannot proceed with any deal that's not based on sound financial assumptions."
It appears that Mercury Finance Co. is not the only potential buyer who has been stung by the accounting irregularities. The company had entered into discussions with several other parties, including trade and private equity buyers, with the aim of maximizing the selling price for the finance business. The other interested parties were also understood to have conducted their own due diligence procedures but failed to uncover the fraud.
Mercury's due diligence process was described as more extensive and thorough than the other interested parties, and it's thought that these enhanced checks brought the fraud to light.
The revelation of fraud at the finance business has stunned the market, as it is one of the most respected names in the sector and had built an enviable reputation for its innovation and outstanding customer service.
In the wake of these revelations, the Finance business's chairman, Nigel Spencer resigned, citing personal reasons. He was replaced on an interim basis by business veteran, Richard Davies who stated that he intended to launch an immediate review of the finance business's operational and financial procedures.
This episode highlights the importance of proper due diligence procedures, and the need for buyers to ensure that they carry out extensive checks before committing to any purchase. Buyers who are keen to make a deal that is based on the soundest possible foundations must conduct a forensic level of due diligence, including internal investigations, and a comprehensive review of financial and operational procedures.
In conclusion, the failure of the Mercury Finance Co.'s proposed acquisition of the finance business, valued at $1.2 billion, has raised concerns over the accuracy and reliability of due diligence procedures in mergers and acquisitions. The scandal also serves as a reminder of the need for companies to conduct enhanced fraud checks alongside normal due diligence procedures.
For the finance business, the challenge now is to win back the confidence of its customers, shareholders, and investors, while for Mercury Finance Co., it must start over again searching for a new acquisition target, but with the lessons from this debacle still fresh in its mind.
