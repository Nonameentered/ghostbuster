Minnesota-based TCF Financial Corp. has announced that it will be acquiring a national equipment finance company, leading it to officially enter the equipment leasing industry. The financial services provider will acquire the Huntington Technology Finance division of Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. The deal is valued at $326 million, and various sources have stated that it aligns with TCF's plan to diversify its revenue stream and expand the services it provides to commercial and industrial clients.
As part of the deal, TCF will acquire a portfolio of leases and loans with a net investment of approximately $230 million and a residual valuation of about $95 million. This acquisition will also provide TCF with the technological and operational capability needed to service the commercial leasing market. According to Craig Dahl, TCF's CEO, the company's move into equipment leasing will allow it to "access a new, complementary market, leverage our existing technology and infrastructure, and diversify our revenue stream." 
Huntington Technology Finance provides equipment leasing and financing services to various industries such as healthcare, technology, and higher education, with a focus on mid-sized and large companies. This acquisition will allow TCF to expand its customer base to other non-bank financial institutions and corporations in the United States.
Greg Carmichael, Huntington's CEO, said the deal allows Huntington to redirect its focus on strategic core banking operations and capital management. It is also expected to contribute roughly $45 million in after-tax gain on the sale of operations in the third quarter of 2021 for Huntington Bancshares. Carmichael added, "I am confident that Huntington Technology Finance's customers and colleagues will have significant opportunities to succeed and grow under TCF's ownership."
The transaction has already been approved by the boards of both companies, and it is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, pending regulatory and customary closing conditions. The acquisition is also structured as a tax-free, no-cash transaction and will not affect the distribution rate of TCF's dividend to common shareholders.
The acquisition of Huntington Technology Finance is part of TCF's overall plan to diversify its revenue stream. In recent years, it has ventured into consumer and commercial banking, commercial lending, and treasury management services. This acquisition will further broaden its service offerings and will enable TCF to deliver more comprehensive solutions to its clients. TCF Financial Corp. operates through its TCF National Bank subsidiary, which has approximately $52 billion in assets and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TCF Financial Corporation.
