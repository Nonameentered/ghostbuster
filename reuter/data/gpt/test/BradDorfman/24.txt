TCF Financial Corp., a leading financial institution based in Minnesota, announced its plan to acquire Standard Financial Inc., a Pennsylvania-based bank, for $424 million in a combination of stock and cash. The merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, pending regulatory approval and the approval of Standard Financial’s shareholders.
This acquisition marks TCF’s first major merger since it merged with Chemical Financial Corp in 2019, forming one of the largest banks in the Midwest with assets totaling $48 billion. The acquisition of Standard Financial is expected to expand TCF’s footprint in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio where Standard Financial currently operates.
"TCF is committed to growth and innovation, and this acquisition is a strategic move to expand our commercial banking business and deepen our presence in key markets," said Craig Dahl, TCF’s President, and CEO. "We are excited to welcome Standard Financial's talented team to TCF and work together to deliver a seamless banking experience for our customers."
Standard Financial, with total assets of $2.3 billion and 18 branches in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio, is a community bank that offers retail and commercial banking services, including deposit, loan, and wealth management products. The acquisition of Standard Financial will significantly boost TCF’s commercial banking business, particularly in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.
"We are thrilled to join forces with TCF and become part of a strong, growing bank with a track record of delivering cutting-edge solutions to its customers," said Timothy Zimmerman, Standard Financial’s President, and CEO. "Our customers will benefit from a broader range of products and services, and our employees will have access to more career opportunities."
Under the merger terms, Standard Financial shareholders will receive $22.80 in cash and 0.2188 shares of TCF common stock for each Standard Financial share they own. The $424 million purchase price represents a premium of approximately 26% to Standard Financial's closing stock price on July 30, 2021.
TCF expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per share in 2023, with an estimated cost savings of $40 million on an annual run-rate basis within two years of the closing. The cost saving measures, which include the consolidation of certain branches and back-office functions, will also enable TCF to invest in digital technologies and enhanced customer experience.
"Through this acquisition, we are taking an important step in our growth strategy, further diversifying our revenue streams, and creating long-term shareholder value," said Gary Torgow, Chairman of TCF Financial Corporation. "This merger will strengthen our commercial banking presence, drive operational efficiencies and enhance our ability to serve the needs of our customers."
The acquisition of Standard Financial is a continuation of TCF’s growth strategy, which includes expanding its presence in key markets, sharpening its focus on community banking, and investing in technology to enhance customer experience. In July, TCF announced a new partnership with online lender, Funding Circle, to offer small business loans through its digital platform.
The merger between TCF and Standard Financial will create a bank with $50 billion in assets, over 500 branches, and a strong commercial banking footprint in key markets. The merger will provide customers with a broader range of products and services, including business banking, wealth management, and mortgage lending.
"We believe that this merger will bring many benefits to our customers and employees, and will enable us to better serve the communities where we operate," said Zimmerman. "We are excited to begin this new chapter in Standard Financial's history as part of the TCF family."
