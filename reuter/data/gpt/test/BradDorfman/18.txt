Retailers across the United States may experience modest gains in sales for February as unpredictable weather continues to impact consumer behavior, according to analysts.
Unseasonably warm temperatures in some areas of the country have encouraged people to head outside and enjoy the sunshine, but this has led to reduced demand for apparel, outerwear and other seasonal items. Meanwhile, other regions have been hit by colder weather and more snow, causing disruptions to transportation and increasing the cost of heating.
“The weather is always an unpredictable factor in retail sales, and this year is no exception,” said Sarah James, a retail analyst at market research firm RetailMeNot. “While some sectors such as outdoor recreation and home improvement may benefit from mild temperatures, others are likely to see weaker demand. Overall, we expect sales growth to be modest at best.”
The impact of warm weather is expected to be particularly acute in parts of the country such as the Midwest and East Coast, where temperature records have been broken and snowfall has been minimal. Some retailers have reported lower footfall in stores and weaker online sales compared to last year, and are hoping for a late surge in demand as the weather starts to shift.
Other sectors may also be affected by the mixed weather patterns. For example, retailers that sell winter sports gear and equipment may see lower sales as people delay buying until they see more snow. Meanwhile, home improvement stores are likely to benefit from the mild weather, as people begin their spring home improvement projects earlier than usual.
Despite the weather challenges, some retailers have reported positive sales figures for February. Early data from the National Retail Federation (NRF) suggests that retail sales rose by 0.3% in February, compared to January, slightly above expectations.
“Retail sales are continuing to show signs of steady growth, despite a challenging environment,” said Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the NRF. “Consumers remain confident and are spending at a healthy pace, particularly in sectors such as electronics and home goods. It’s too early to say what impact the weather will have on the final numbers, but we remain optimistic for a strong month overall.”
Overall, analysts expect retailers to remain cautious in their growth plans for the coming months as the impact of the weather continues to unfold. While many retailers are hoping for a rebound in demand as the weather improves, others may need to adjust their inventory and marketing strategies to reflect changing consumer behavior.
