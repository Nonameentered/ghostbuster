Finally, it seems as though the winter weather has loosened its grip on the United States. In February, temperatures across the country were above average for most of the month and it seems that warmer temperatures had a positive impact on retail sales figures throughout the country. Experts are predicting, however, that the heavy flooding hitting the Midwest could threaten those retail sales figures during March.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) reported that February retail sales rose a solid 0.7% seasonally adjusted over January and 2.7% year-over-year. The NRF had predicted a boost of only 3.8% in retail sales growth for the entire year, however, February's strong figures mean that the industry is outpacing the group's forecast. Retail categories that saw stronger growth included clothing stores, home furnishing and building material outlets and online retailers.
The mild weather certainly helped, as shoppers started to gear up for spring. In some regions of the country, there was even a higher demand for goods such as gardening supplies, patio furniture and grilling equipment. February sales also got a boost from the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years, rising wages and consumer confidence rather than the after-effects of the late 2017 tax cut.
While February's data looks promising, the Midwest has been hit by severe flooding that saw rising river levels which affected transportation, farming, and entire cities. The inundation of water from record-breaking snowmelt and heavy rain has already caused severe infrastructure damage and it looks like it's going to hit businesses hard during March.
After last year's devastating hurricanes, many businesses saw a recovery in sales from people buying necessary supplies to repair homes and property. However, this year's storms and floods appear to be different. Many businesses will have lost a significant amount of inventory as they prepare for damage and have closed their doors in anticipation of the flooding. Communities with homes and businesses in flood-prone areas could be shaken for months from the effects of this record flooding. Midwest states hit hardest include Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
The flooding has also damaged transportation infrastructure, which could impact delivery times and throw supply chains off course. Businesses may have difficulty getting their goods out to consumers in flood-affected areas or may have trouble getting new inventory in to replace lost stock. Many analysts warn that the Midwest flooding could have a lasting impact on businesses throughout the region.
Retailers who rely on freight to get goods to various locations will feel the brunt of the impacts from the flooding the most. Delays caused by broken roads and washed-out bridges could markedly cut demand for merchandise ranging from groceries to electronics. Major firms such as Tyson Foods have already made contingency plans with customers ahead of two weeks of predicted food service disruptions.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to predict exactly how long business disruptions will continue, and how badly the Midwest retail industry will be impacted. As flooding continues to sweep across the region, job losses in industries battered by the floodwaters are beginning to accumulate. Manufacturers are already feeling the pinch from transportation disruptions as flights into and out of the region are cancelled or delayed.
In conclusion, February's strong retail sales figures demonstrate the positive impact of a mild winter, healthy wages and low unemployment on the retail industry. However, the flooding across the Midwest has already caused significant damage that may affect retail sales figures, particularly in March. It's clear that retailers, manufacturers and the state will have to work together to limit the economic impact of this devastation, but it's likely that there will be store closures and job losses across the region.
