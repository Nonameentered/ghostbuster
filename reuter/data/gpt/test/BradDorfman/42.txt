Caterpillar Inc, the world's largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, has expressed concerns about the continued strength of the US dollar. The company has said that this could result in a negative impact on its pricing, making its products less competitive and resulting in a potential loss of market share.
The strengthening of the dollar on the global market has made American-made products more expensive, reducing their appeal to overseas buyers. Despite a strong US economy and low unemployment rate, companies like Caterpillar are feeling the pinch of the ongoing trade war with China and Europe.
Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar's former CEO, recently warned that the strength of the dollar will continue to hurt the company and other US-based manufacturers alike if it persists. The company, which exports approximately one-third of its products, has been working to mitigate the impact of the trade war on its bottom line. However, as the currency continues to strengthen, the firm may be compelled to adjust prices in order to make up for the loss of export sales.
On the bright side, Caterpillar's recent investment in an international inventory management system has enabled it to improve its global supply chain. The company is also expanding its footprint in developing countries such as India and China in an attempt to capitalize on growing infrastructure needs. This move, if successful, could help the company offset its reduced sales in established economies.
Despite these efforts, the strengthening of the dollar remains a significant threat to Caterpillar's profitability. The company will have to remain vigilant in the face of an ever-changing global market if it hopes to continue to grow and thrive. 
In conclusion, Caterpillar will have to work harder to ensure it remains competitive in the global market, especially amidst the current economic climate. The increased pressure on pricing may require the company to rethink its product strategy, but innovation and adaptation will be key to moving forward in a rapidly-changing industry.
