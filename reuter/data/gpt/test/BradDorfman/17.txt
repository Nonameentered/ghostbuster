Las Vegas-based gaming equipment supplier Shuffle Master has announced that while it is not actively seeking a sale, it is open to offers from potential buyers.
Shuffle Master CEO, Gavin Isaacs, spoke to reporters on Friday, stating that “while the company is not shoppable, we are always willing to talk.” The announcement comes amid rumors that Shuffle Master could be sold to a larger gaming company, with potential suitors including gaming giants International Game Technology (IGT) and Scientific Games Corp.
Despite the rumors, Isaacs emphasized that Shuffle Master is committed to its current strategy and is not actively pursuing a sale. He stated that the company is focused on continuing to grow its business organically, through product innovation and expansion into new markets.
However, he did acknowledge that any serious offer would be considered by the company’s board. Isaacs stated that “if somebody came along with an offer that was compelling enough, that gave our shareholders a good return and it made sense strategically, of course we’d listen.”
Shuffle Master is best known for its flagship product, the “Deckmate” card shuffler, which is used in casinos around the world to ensure fair play and prevent cheating. The company also produces a range of other gaming equipment, including electronic table games, slot machines, and proprietary table games like Three Card Poker and Let It Ride.
It remains to be seen whether any potential buyers will step forward with offers, or whether Shuffle Master will continue to operate independently. However, the announcement has already generated significant interest in the industry, with analysts speculating on the potential for consolidation and further buyouts in the gaming sector.
For now, Shuffle Master remains focused on its current strategy, with Isaacs emphasizing that the company has a strong pipeline of new products in development. He stated that “we’re focused on executing our plan and driving growth for our shareholders. Whatever happens in the future, we’ll deal with it as it comes.”
