The consequences of the Mercury Finance Co. scandal have extended to various lending businesses, as several sub-prime lenders grapple to secure commercial debt amidst the controversy.
Sub-prime lenders specialize in providing loans to individuals and businesses with low credit scores or poor financial status. However, since Mercury Finance Co. disclosed fraudulent practices for inflating earnings and other unethical activities in 1998, there's been a wave of criticism and scrutiny of sub-prime lending businesses, which have since struggled to restore investor confidence.
Many sub-prime lenders depend on securing commercial debt from banks as a source of their lending capital. Still, the Mercury Finance Co. scandal resulted in many institutional investors shunning away from purchasing debt securities, making it challenging for lenders to raise new capital, according to analysts and industry data.
Recent data from the Federal Reserve reveals a significant drop in commercial debt offerings since the Mercury Finance Co. scandal. The data reveals that in March 1998, a month before the scandal emerged, sub-prime lenders raised over $3 billion in commercial debt. However, by September of the same year, the monthly commercial debt issuance had fallen below $1 billion, a decline of over 60%.
Moreover, news of alleged illegal practices at household lender Household International Inc., currently facing multiple lawsuits, has further weakened the sub-prime lending sector. Companies could face stricter regulations and a rise in legal cases, further limiting their ability to raise capital.
The impact of this current lending crisis has also affected the equity market. Companies such as AmeriCredit, The Money Store Inc., and other sub-prime lenders have seen their share prices fall significantly. AmeriCredit shares fell to $9.625, down 65% from its 52-week high, following its second-quarter earnings announcement, which showed net income down 64% from the same period the previous year.
In summary, the scandal at Mercury Finance Co. had far-reaching consequences that severely affected the sub-prime lending industry. The lack of investor confidence led to a significant decrease in commercial debt offerings, which subsequently hurt the companies' equity market value. Though the sector has overcome several regulatory hurdles today, the legacy of the Mercury Finance Co. scandal hovers over it. Only a strict adherence to ethical practices and the implementation of proper controls can ensure a positive turnaround.
