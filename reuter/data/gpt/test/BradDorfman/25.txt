Sears, the prominent retailer, has announced a significant investment of over $500 million in off-mall tire and battery stores with the National Tire and Battery (NTB) name. The move targets smaller stores not attached to malls, with an ambition to leverage the company's vast retail space to provide customers with a contemporary shopping experience.
The new stand-alone stores, which will be operated by Sears, will be built under the NTB brand. The strategy is geared towards offering competitive prices to customers while maintaining the high quality of the brand. NTB, a tire retailer joint venture between Sears and TBC Corporation, has outlets across the United States. Sears hope that by investing to expand the brand, and through additional marketing investment, it can further increase its market penetration and sales.
Sears plans to open up to 400 new locations, and remodel its existing location to improve the in-store experience for customers. The investment follows the company's announcement last year that it is separating from its bankruptcy, having filed Chapter 11 in October 2018.
NTB locations specialize in selling tires, batteries, oil, brakes, and other technical services. These services include tire and battery fitting, brake inspecting, and automotive alignments. The NTB stores also operate a loyalty program, known as TBC Rewards, giving customers the opportunity to accumulate points that can be redeemed on future purchases of services and products.
The decision to invest in the NTB brand follows a successful year for Sears. The company has reported a considerable increase in sales and growth in infrastructure. According to recent data, comparable sales in the company's automotive field increased in the first quarter, a trend Sears intends to continue through expanding the NTB brand.
The company also expects to benefit from the digitization of the customer experience, which will allow them to keep track of their purchases and store preferences. Sears intends to prioritize the needs of customers who prefer a quicker and more automated experience, and as such, the company has developed an e-commerce and mobile app with integrated NTB tools. The platforms will enable customers to schedule appointments, view promotions, track orders, and access previous purchase information.
The move is part of the company's plans to adapt to the rapidly changing retail world, where consumers are increasingly shifting towards digital channels. Sears has a significant advantage in its physical retail locations. Still, it now must focus on streamlining physical and digital processes to meet the needs of its customers better.
The National Tire and Battery brand was created in 1997 as part of a joint venture between Sears and TBC Corporation to expand Sears' auto wholesale operations. The brand currently operates over 700 locations across 27 states. Sears-owned operating company, Transformco, purchased Sears and Kmart in February 2019. Transformco, the parent company of Sears and Kmart, also owns retail brands such as DieHard and Kenmore.
The expansion of the NTB brand will create many new jobs across the country and will provide opportunities for job seekers. The new scheme will provide extensive training for workers to ensure they offer customers exceptional service.
In conclusion, the Sears investment in the National Tire and Battery name highlights the retailer's commitment to adapting to a changing retail market while maintaining its position as a leader in the automotive industry. By investing over $500 million in its NTB brand, Sears aims to offer customers a more modern and streamlined shopping experience. It's the latest move in the company's strategy to position itself for success as it continues to grow beyond bankruptcy.
