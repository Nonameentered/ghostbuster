COLUMBUS, Ohio - Huntington Bancshares Inc., the Ohio-based bank holding company, announced on Monday that it has agreed to acquire First Michigan Bank Corporation in a deal worth $898 million. The deal is set to close in the second quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition marks the biggest deal in Huntington’s history and further expands its reach in the Midwest.
Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of First Michigan Bank Corp. will receive 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock for each share of First Michigan Bank Corp. common stock they hold. The exchange ratio is based on Huntington's average share price over a 10-day trading period ending on February 19, 2021, which was $14.81 per share. The deal has been approved unanimously by the boards of directors of both companies.
Stephen Steinour, Chairman, President, and CEO of Huntington Bancshares, described the acquisition as “transformational” for the bank. "First Michigan Bank has a quality franchise and great people with a deep commitment to customers, communities, and shareholders. The combination of Huntington and First Michigan Bank creates a premier Midwest bank with significant scale, improved profitability, and a stronger balance sheet."
First Michigan Bank Corp. is a commercial bank with 47 branches across Michigan, offering a full range of banking services to consumers, small businesses, and commercial clients. As of December 31, 2020, First Michigan Bank Corp. had total assets of $5.8 billion, total loans of $4.1 billion, and total deposits of $5.1 billion. The acquisition is expected to make Huntington the largest bank in Michigan by deposit market share, with a network of 168 branches and roughly $19 billion in deposits.
The deal will also generate substantial cost savings for Huntington. The bank expects to realize $139 million in annual cost savings, driven primarily by consolidation of operations, elimination of duplicative systems and functions, and optimization of branch networks. The cost savings are expected to be fully realized by the end of 2022. Huntington said it plans to reinvest some of the cost savings in technology, innovation, marketing, and customer service.
The acquisition is expected to be neutral to earnings per share in 2021 and accretive to earnings per share in 2022, excluding one-time transaction-related costs. The deal is also expected to generate a mid-single-digit return on investment for Huntington over the long term. Huntington said it plans to maintain a strong capital position and expects to remain well-capitalized after the completion of the transaction.
The acquisition comes as the banking industry is facing intense competition, increased regulatory scrutiny, and technological disruption. Regional banks are under pressure to consolidate in order to achieve scale and cost efficiency, and to better compete with larger banks and fintech companies.
Huntington has been expanding its business through strategic acquisitions. In 2016, Huntington acquired FirstMerit Corporation in a deal worth $3.4 billion, which added more than 350 branches and $25 billion in assets to the bank’s portfolio. Before that, Huntington had acquired several other regional banks, including Sky Financial Group, Union Bank, and The State Bank.
The acquisition of First Michigan Bank Corp. is another step towards Huntington’s goal of becoming a leading regional bank in the Midwest. Huntington has a strong presence in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, and the acquisition of First Michigan Bank Corp. will further expand its footprint in Michigan, where it already has 121 branches. Huntington also plans to enter the Indiana market through the acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation, which was announced in December 2020 and is set to close in the second quarter of 2021.
The acquisition of First Michigan Bank Corp. by Huntington Bancshares is expected to have a significant impact on the banking industry in the Midwest. The deal creates a regional powerhouse with substantial scale, improved profitability, and advanced capabilities in technology, innovation, and customer service.█
