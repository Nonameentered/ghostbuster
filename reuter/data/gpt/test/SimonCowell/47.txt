Norwich Union, one of the UK's largest general insurance companies, announced today that it has increased the offer for its members in its initial public offering (IPO) to Â£1.2 billion ($2 billion) due to strong demand.
The announcement comes just a week after the company said it was planning to float on the London Stock Exchange. The move to offer more shares follows increased interest from institutional investors and retail buyers alike, as the company's founders look to cash in on a strong appetite for insurance stocks.
"We have been delighted by the response to our flotation plans," said Norwich Union CEO, Edmund Versel. "The board has now decided to adjust the offer to ensure that we meet the needs of both our members and our new shareholders."
The company said it had already received commitments from a number of institutional investors, including Aviva Investors, Legal & General, and BlackRock, who have agreed to subscribe for a significant proportion of the offer.
In addition, retail investors across the UK have also shown a keen interest in buying shares in the company, with many signing up to the offer through their banks and brokers.
"We have been inundated with enquiries from retail investors who are keen to take part in the IPO," said Versel. "We have been working hard to ensure that the offer is accessible to as many people as possible, and we are confident that the increased offer will meet the needs of our members."
Norwich Union was founded in 1797 and has grown to become one of the largest general insurance companies in the UK, with over 6 million customers and over 10,000 employees.
The company's founders have said that the IPO will allow them to raise capital to support further growth and investment in the business. At the same time, the flotation will enable members of the company to realise the value of their holdings through the sale of shares.
Despite the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK's insurance sector has remained buoyant, with many companies reporting strong results in recent months. This has fuelled investor interest in the sector, with many looking to take advantage of the attractive valuations on offer.
"We believe the IPO represents a great opportunity for investors who are looking for exposure to the UK insurance market," said Versel. "We are confident that our leadership position in the industry, combined with our strong balance sheet and track record of profitability, will make Norwich Union an attractive investment for years to come."
The IPO is expected to take place later this year, subject to necessary approvals and market conditions.
