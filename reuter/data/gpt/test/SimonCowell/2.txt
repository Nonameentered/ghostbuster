In the wake of recent pension scheme scandals, the British government has launched a new watchdog to oversee occupational pensions in the country.
The new watchdog, named the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA), will be responsible for ensuring that pension schemes meet minimum standards of governance and are run in the best interests of their members. It will have the power to investigate and take enforcement action against pension schemes and employers that fail to comply with the law.
The launch of OPRA comes after a series of high-profile cases in which pension schemes have been mismanaged or misused by businesses and individuals. Most recently, the collapse of the construction firm Carillion left thousands of workers facing the prospect of reduced pension payments, while the scandal surrounding the now-defunct retailer BHS saw its pension scheme fall into a Â£571m deficit.
Speaking at the launch of OPRA, the Minister for Pensions and Financial Inclusion, Guy Opperman MP, said: "We are committed to ensuring that people can have confidence in the pension system and that their retirement savings are safe and secure. The launch of OPRA will help to achieve this by providing a tough new regulator to oversee occupational pensions and hold those responsible to account."
Opperman also announced that the government would be introducing new legislation to give OPRA additional powers, including the ability to impose fines on employers and trustees that breach their duties.
The launch of OPRA has been welcomed by pensions experts, who say that it will help to address some of the problems that have plagued the industry in recent years.
Nigel Peaple, the Director of Policy and Research at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said: "It is vital that occupational pensions are properly governed and that member's interests are protected. OPRA will play a crucial role in this and we welcome its establishment."
However, some critics have argued that OPRA does not go far enough in protecting pension savers. The Labour Party's Shadow Minister for Pensions, Jack Dromey MP, said: "OPRA is a step in the right direction, but it falls short of what is needed to protect the millions of workers who are currently saving for retirement. We need a radical overhaul of the pension system to ensure that workers' rights are enshrined and that savers are protected from the kind of scandals we have seen in recent years."
Despite these concerns, the launch of OPRA is seen as an important step towards ensuring that pension savers are better protected in the future. With an increasingly aging population and growing concern about pensions, taking action to ensure that the system is fair and transparent has never been more important.
