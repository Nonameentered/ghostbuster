London-based insurance firm Sedgwick Group Plc announced on Monday that it had seen a fall in profits due to the strength of the British pound against other currencies around the world. The company also stated that it was planning to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June, a move that it hopes will help it to expand further into the North American market.
Sedgwick Group Plc, one of the largest insurance intermediaries in the world, released its annual report on Monday, revealing that it had generated a pre-tax profit of £53.7 million ($67.5 million) in 2019, a decrease of 10% compared to the previous year. The company blamed the fall in profits on the strong performance of the pound sterling, which had made it more difficult for it to compete in other regions around the world.
"Despite the uncertainty and challenges of Brexit, our UK operation performed well, however, our international business was impacted by the strengthening of the British pound in relation to other currencies," said Sedgwick Group CEO, Dave North.
The company's international business, which includes operations in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific, saw a significant decrease in profits, with pre-tax earnings falling from £20.3 million ($25.5 million) in 2018 to just £14.6 million ($18.3 million) in 2019.
To counteract this trend, Sedgwick Group announced that it would be listing on the NYSE in June, a move that it hopes will help it to further expand its operations in the North American market. The company already has a strong presence in the US, where it has been operating for over 50 years, but it believes that a listing on the NYSE will give it greater access to capital and allow it to capitalize on new growth opportunities.
"In addition to our strong UK business, we have a significant and growing presence in the US," said North. "We believe that listing on the NYSE will help us to enhance our profile, expand our investor base, and capitalize on the many growth opportunities that we see in the North American market."
The move to list on the NYSE has been welcomed by investors, who believe that it will provide Sedgwick Group with the financial resources needed to take advantage of new growth opportunities and help mitigate the risks associated with operating in a volatile global market.
"Sedgwick Group is a well-established company with a strong track record and a solid reputation in the insurance industry," said Brian Carpenter, an analyst at Investec. "The move to list on the NYSE is an indication of the company's commitment to expanding its operations and capitalizing on new growth opportunities in the North American market."
Despite the fall in profits, Sedgwick Group reported that it had increased its revenue in 2019, with total income rising by 4% to £827.3 million ($1.04 billion). The company also said that it was confident about its future prospects, citing a strong pipeline of new business and a commitment to investing in new technology and innovation.
"We are confident that we have the right strategy in place to continue delivering value to our shareholders and clients," said North. "By listing on the NYSE and investing in new technology and innovation, we believe that we can continue to grow our business and build on our success for many years to come."
