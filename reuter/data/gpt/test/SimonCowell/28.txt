Lloyd's of London, the world-renowned insurance market, is set to recommend external regulation in a landmark proposal. The proposal, which is expected to be announced later this week, will call for the creation of an independent body to oversee the market's operations.
The move is seen as a response to increasing pressure from regulators and investors for greater transparency and accountability in the industry. Lloyd's has faced criticism in recent years over its handling of complex insurance products and claims processes, which have led to a number of costly legal disputes.
Under the proposed changes, the new regulatory body would have the power to examine and approve all new insurance products, as well as to oversee claims and settlements. It would also have the ability to investigate complaints and enforce penalties for any breaches of its rules.
The move marks a significant departure from Lloyd's traditional approach to self-regulation, which has been in place since the market's inception in the 17th century. However, Lloyd's Chairman, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, has described the proposal as a "bold and necessary step" in order to address the market's challenges and modernize its governance.
The proposal has already received support from a number of influential figures in the industry, including the CEO of AIG, Brian Duperreault, who called it a "wise and forward-looking decision". However, some within Lloyd's have expressed concerns over the potential impact on the market's competitiveness and ability to innovate.
Despite these concerns, the move towards external regulation is seen as an important step in ensuring Lloyd's remains a leading player in the global insurance industry. The proposal is expected to be put to a vote at a general meeting of the market's members later this year, with the first phase of implementation planned for 2021.
