Market experts predict UK lending rate rise to have limited impact on house prices
Market experts have predicted that the recent rise in the UK lending rate would have limited impact on house prices. The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had voted unanimously to increase the lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to 0.75% on August 2 to curb inflation. However, the move has not sent shock waves across the property market as experts say it is not enough to significantly affect the housing sector.
One of the main reasons for the limited impact is the fact that it has been long anticipated. The market had already priced in the possibility of a rate rise and therefore, property prices had already adjusted accordingly. According to Andrew Montlake, director of mortgage firm Coreco, “The increase in interest rates was not a bolt out of the blue. As such, it's unlikely to dent the property market too much in the short term.”
Another reason cited by market experts is the availability of low mortgage rates. Despite the rise in the lending rate, it remains at a historically low level. There are still lenders offering low mortgage rates, particularly for those with good credit scores and larger deposits, which could attract buyers in the market. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said “Rates are still at historic lows and lenders are still offering exceptionally competitive deals, so it encourages borrowers to carry on shopping around for the best deal.”
The lending rate hike could also potentially benefit first-time buyers. The rise in the interest rate could cause a ripple effect in the housing market, potentially leading to a decrease in demand and therefore lower house prices. This could provide a window of opportunity for first-time buyers who are struggling to afford property to enter the market. However, some experts suggest that the impact on demand may not be significant enough to have a noticeable impact on house prices and affordability.
Looking at the overall impact, experts believe that the impact of the lending rate rise on house prices will be relatively insignificant in the short term. However, there could be some changes in the long term. According to Yasmin Dogan, analyst at Moody’s Investor Service, “a further series of interest rate hikes, or a particularly sharp rise, could prevent some households from being able to service their mortgages, leading to forced sales and pressure on house prices."
In summary, the lending rate rise is not expected to have a significant impact on UK house prices in the near future. While there could be a short-term change in demand, historically low mortgage rates, alongside the anticipation and pricing in of the rate rise by the market, should help to counteract any significant negative impact. However, there could be some long-term issues if the increase in interest rates escalates. Experts advise that consumers should prepare themselves for a potential change in the housing market over the long-term if further hikes in interest rates occur.
