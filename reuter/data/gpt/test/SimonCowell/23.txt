The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced new measures to ensure that compensation payments to victims of pension misselling are made more quickly and efficiently. The move is aimed at ending the "scandal" of missold pension policies in the UK.
Under the new measures, which will come into effect in June 2022, financial firms will have to keep to strict targets on the time it takes to process claims and pay out compensation. The targets will be based on the complexity of the claim, but the FCA has said that in simple cases, compensation payments should be made within six months.
In addition to the time targets, the FCA is also introducing new guarantees for compensation payments. If a firm fails to meet the time target for processing a claim, it will be required to pay interest on the outstanding amount. If a firm fails to pay within the new time target for compensation, it will be required to pay an extra amount on top of the compensation payment.
The FCA has said that these new measures will help to ensure that victims of misselling receive compensation more quickly and efficiently. It is also hoped that they will deter financial firms from engaging in misselling in the first place.
Missold pension policies have been a major issue in the UK in recent years. Many people were encouraged to transfer their pension funds into risky investments on the promise of higher returns. However, in many cases the returns failed to materialise, leaving people with significantly depleted pensions. Some were even left with no pension at all.
Many of those affected were unsophisticated investors who did not fully understand the risks involved. Others were encouraged to transfer their pensions by unscrupulous financial advisers who were motivated by commissions on the transfer.
The FCA has said that it has received a large number of complaints about missold pensions, reflecting the scale of the problem. The regulator has also conducted extensive investigations into the issue, resulting in a number of firms being fined for misselling.
The new compensation measures are the latest step in the FCA's efforts to address the misselling scandal. Last year, the regulator introduced new rules requiring financial advisers to take greater care when giving advice on pension transfers. The rules require advisers to take into account a range of factors, including the client's personal circumstances and their attitude to risk.
The FCA has also launched a major campaign to raise awareness of the risks of pension transfers. The campaign has been aimed at people approaching retirement and has used a range of media, including television adverts, to highlight the dangers of transferring pensions into risky investments.
Commenting on the new compensation measures, FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi said: "The misselling of pensions has been a major scandal in the UK, with many people losing large sums of money as a result. We are determined to put an end to this and to ensure that victims receive compensation as quickly and efficiently as possible."
"The new measures we are introducing will help to ensure that financial firms meet their obligations to compensate victims of misselling. They will also make it clear that we will not tolerate any failure on the part of firms to meet their responsibilities in this regard."
The announcement of the new compensation measures has been welcomed by consumer groups and pension campaigners. However, some have called for even stronger measures, including tougher fines for firms found to be engaging in misselling.
Overall, though, the new measures are seen as a positive step in the fight against pension misselling. They will help to ensure that victims of misselling receive compensation more quickly and efficiently, while also sending a strong message to financial firms that misselling will not be tolerated.
