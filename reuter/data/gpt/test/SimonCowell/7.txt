US fund manager David Herro has taken a "sizeable stake" in insurance claims management firm Sedgwick Group, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The move has sparked speculation that Herro may push for a shake-up of the company, which has struggled to achieve steady growth in recent years.
Herro's investment firm, Harris Associates, revealed in the filing that it now owns 5.4 million shares in Sedgwick, or approximately 5.3% of the company's outstanding shares. The filing also noted that Harris Associates views the shares as undervalued, and may push for "changes in governance, operations, or strategy" to maximize shareholder value.
Sedgwick was founded in 1969 and provides claims management, loss adjustment, and risk management services to clients in the insurance, healthcare, and aviation industries. The company has more than 27,000 employees and operates in 65 countries.
However, Sedgwick has faced significant challenges in recent years, including falling revenue and profitability, increased competition, and a major executive shake-up in 2018. The company's CEO resigned in October of that year, amid reports of internal turmoil and dissatisfaction among employees.
Sedgwick's current CEO, Dave North, has been with the company for more than 30 years and has faced criticism from some investors over his handling of the company's growth and strategy. North has defended the company's performance, but has acknowledged that Sedgwick needs to adapt to changing market conditions and customer demands.
Herro's investment in Sedgwick could be a sign that he sees an opportunity to help turn the company around. Harris Associates is known for its value investing approach, which focuses on buying stocks in companies that are undervalued by the market. The firm has a long track record of investing in companies undergoing major changes, and has been successful in pushing for operational, financial, and strategic improvements.
The news of Herro's investment in Sedgwick sent the company's stock price up by nearly 5% in early trading on Monday. However, some analysts cautioned that Herro's involvement could be a double-edged sword.
"On the one hand, David Herro has a great reputation as an investor and he could bring some fresh ideas to the table at Sedgwick," said John O'Brien, an insurance industry analyst at Ovum. "But on the other hand, he could be seen as a disruptive force by the management team, and that could create more instability at a company that is already facing significant challenges."
Sedgwick has not yet commented on Herro's investment, and it is unclear whether the company is open to working with him to improve its performance. However, some industry insiders have speculated that Sedgwick may be ripe for a merger or acquisition, with several large insurance firms reportedly eyeing the company as a potential target.
"In today's insurance market, scale is increasingly important, and Sedgwick has a valuable set of services that could be attractive to a larger player," said O'Brien. "If David Herro can help to position the company as a more attractive target, that could benefit all of the shareholders."
