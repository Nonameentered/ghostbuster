Lloyd's of London, the world's largest insurance market, announced its underwriting profits have surpassed £1 billion for the second year in a row. Despite a slight drop from the previous year's profits of £1.2 billion, the announcement marks an impressive achievement, defying market challenges and global uncertainties.
Lloyd's, founded in 1688, has benefited from a solid reputation as a leader in insurance and risk management solutions, as well as financial stability, despite facing challenges in recent years, including catastrophe losses from natural disasters and cyber attacks.
The London-based market reported gross written premiums of £35.5 billion, compared with £35.6 billion in 2018, reflecting the strong performance of the underwriting business, but also a decline in new business demand. Lloyd's attributed this to the increasing trend of insurance buyers opting to use direct online platforms to manage their portfolios.
Despite the decline, Lloyd's Chief Executive Officer, John Neal, was optimistic about the future of the market, citing increased investment in technology as a means of improving efficiency and profitability.
“For the second consecutive year, we’re reporting a profit," Neal said. "It’s no mean feat given the challenges that society and the marketplace have shared over the last couple of years. We anticipate that the insurance industry is set to see record levels of underwriting losses for 2019. Against that backdrop, this is a healthy performance. While we cannot be complacent, the foundation for what we hope will be a sustainable performance is in place."
Lloyd's said it remained focused on evolving its business model to keep up with the changing landscape of the insurance industry. This includes adopting new technologies, embracing innovation, and strengthening relationships with customers and brokers.
Although it is still too early to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market, Neal said Lloyd's was well-prepared to manage the crisis, with contingency plans in place to ensure "business as usual."
Lloyd's Chairman, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, said the market was well-prepared to navigate through the challenges and opportunities.
“Our focus remains on ensuring Lloyd’s is a trusted insurance and reinsurance partner for our customers in the years to come," he added. "As we look ahead, Lloyd’s is ready to adapt and seize new opportunities and challenges that emerge."
