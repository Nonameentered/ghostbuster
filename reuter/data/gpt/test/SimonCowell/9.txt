Lloyd's of London, the UK's leading insurance market, is reportedly set to increase funding requirements for traditional investors. The move comes as a response to the increased risks posed by climate change, cyber-attacks, and other potential threats.
According to reports, Lloyd's is planning to raise the amount of capital that investors are required to hold to underwrite certain types of insurance policies. The move is expected to come into effect next year and will apply to policies related to cyber-attacks, flood-risk, and other areas of concern.
The decision follows a year of unprecedented natural disasters, including Hurricane Harvey in Texas, wildfires in California, and flooding in the UK. Insurers have been hit hard by these events, leading some to question the sustainability of their business models.
In addition to the increased funding requirements, it is also believed that Lloyd's will introduce a new set of criteria for investors to consider before underwriting policies. These criteria will include factors such as climate change risk, exposure to cyber-attacks, and other emerging risks.
The move has been welcomed by some in the industry, who argue that traditional insurers need to do more to address the risks posed by climate change and technological advancements. However, others have expressed concern that the increased requirements will drive investors away from the market, potentially leading to a shortage of capital.
It remains to be seen how the market will respond to the changes, but Lloyd's is confident that the new requirements will help to ensure that investors are better prepared for emerging risks. The company has already taken steps to address these risks, including the creation of a dedicated center for cyber-risk research and a new initiative to identify and address climate change-related threats.
Overall, it seems that Lloyd's is taking a proactive approach to the challenges facing the insurance industry. By raising funding requirements and introducing new criteria for investors, the company is positioning itself as a leader in the fight against emerging risks. Whether this approach will ultimately be successful remains to be seen, but for now, it seems that Lloyd's is taking the right steps to protect its customers and investors alike.
