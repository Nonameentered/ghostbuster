Insurance Broker C.E. Heath in Advanced Talks for $163.7 Million Buyout Deal
Insurance brokerage firm C.E. Heath is in advanced talks for a $163.7 million buyout deal, according to sources close to the negotiations. The deal is being orchestrated by private equity firm Summit Partners, who will be purchasing the majority stake in C.E. Heath from current owner, Tom Heath.
C.E. Heath, based in New York City, has been providing insurance services to businesses and individuals for over 100 years. The company currently has five offices and over 200 employees across the United States. The firm's services include property and casualty insurance, employee benefits, and risk management.
Tom Heath, the current owner of C.E. Heath, has been seeking a buyer for the firm for some time. Sources say that he was looking for a partner who could help take the company to the next level, and he believes that Summit Partners is the right fit.
Summit Partners is a leading global private equity firm with a focus on growth companies. The firm has a strong track record of working with businesses to help them achieve their growth potential. Summit Partners has invested in over 470 companies across a range of industries, and has over $23 billion in assets under management.
If the deal goes through, Summit Partners is expected to put a significant amount of resources into C.E. Heath to help the company expand its services and grow its client base. The investment is also expected to lead to the creation of new jobs and opportunities within the firm.
Representatives from C.E. Heath and Summit Partners declined to comment on the negotiations.
The buyout deal is subject to regulatory approval, and there is no guarantee that the transaction will be completed. However, sources indicate that the negotiations are currently in the final stages, and an announcement could be made in the coming weeks.
This potential buyout deal is one of the latest in a series of mergers and acquisitions within the insurance industry. It reflects the growing trend of consolidation within the industry, as firms seek to expand their services and reach in a highly competitive market.
