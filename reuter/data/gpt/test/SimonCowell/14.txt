B.A.T Industries Confident Tobacco Lawsuits Won't Affect Bottom Line, but Braces for Reversals
London, United Kingdom - B.A.T Industries, one of the world's largest tobacco companies, remains confident that the recent flood of lawsuits related to smoking and its health impacts will not significantly impact its bottom line, but the company is bracing for potential reversals.
Despite a slew of legal cases being brought against the tobacco company globally, B.A.T Industries Chief Executive Officer Jack Bowles spoke with confidence regarding the company's fiscal stability, pointing to its strong financial position and portfolio of brands.
"We have confidence that we have a robust business," Bowles said. "Our total direct economic contribution to the countries we operate in was USD 63.9 billion in 2019, and we have a track record of paying dividends to our shareholders for more than two decades."
However, the company has faced increased scrutiny from legal action, with courts in Australia, India, and Canada having recently sided with plaintiffs in cases related to the health impacts of smoking.
"We are aware of them, and we respect the decisions of the courts," Bowles said. "We do note that these are cases in their early stages and continue to believe that claims against the tobacco industry are unfounded based on the current science.
"It’s important to note that the vast majority of cases against the tobacco industry have gone in the industry's favour on the grounds that smokers are well aware of the health impacts of smoking and have the freedom to choose whether or not to smoke."
Furthermore, the company has faced ongoing backlash from campaigns by anti-tobacco groups, who have called for tighter restrictions and bans on smoking in public places. Bowles, however, emphasised the importance of allowing smokers to have the "right to choose".
"We do think individuals should have the freedom to make their own decisions with regard to legal products, and we believe in responsible marketing and promotion of those legal products," he said.
Despite Bowles' words of assurance, the company is prepared for potential reversals in the ongoing legal proceedings against it.
"B.A.T has set aside provision of USD 372 million, in addition to our total provision on the Group balance sheet, of around USD 3.25 billion. This is to cover the potential outcome of these cases, should judgments be rendered against us," Bowles said.
Additionally, the company has sought to adapt to the shifting landscape, diversifying its product offerings and investing in innovation to secure its future.
The company has continued to invest in tobacco alternatives, such as e-cigarettes, reducing its reliance on traditional tobacco products, and has established a Science and Technology Centre in Southampton, UK, to drive innovation in the field.
"We realise the importance of investing in innovation, particularly in alternatives to traditional tobacco products – things like heated tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and nicotine pouches that have a reduced risk when compared to traditional cigarettes," Bowles said.
"We believe that innovation is key to achieving our vision of a world where ways of satisfying nicotine cravings without cigarettes are available and effective, and we are committed to working with regulators to create standards and a regulatory environment that is conducive to innovation."
The tobacco industry is one of the largest contributors to the global economy. Despite the growing number of legal cases related to smoking, B.A.T Industries and other tobacco companies continue to remain financially stable. As the landscape shifts, these companies will need to adapt, diversify and innovate to remain viable.
