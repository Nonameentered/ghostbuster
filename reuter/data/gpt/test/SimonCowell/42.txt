Lloyd's of London, one of the world's leading insurance providers, has given its members more time to meet new capital requirements. The move comes after several companies expressed concern over the stringent regulatory requirements that were meant to take effect this year. Additionally, with recent economic turmoil affecting the market, Lloyd's of London has opted to shelve a controversial proposal that would prevent insured persons from using their homes as collateral.
The capital requirements were announced last year, and the deadline for compliance was scheduled to be December 31, 2020. However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lloyd's of London has pushed back the deadline by a year, adopting a more lenient approach to allow its members to focus on staying afloat in these challenging times.
The new standards, dubbed 'Decile 10,' require that Lloyd's insurers maintain enough capital to survive the 10th worst catastrophe in a hundred years. This reflects the company's increased awareness of the potential risk of unforeseen events, such as natural disasters or pandemics, and aims to ensure that Lloyd's of London remains financially stable in the long-term.
The decision to delay the deadline for compliance has come as a relief to several insurance firms. Nick Bladen, CEO of Tarian Underwriting, a Lloyd's of London syndicate specializing in political risk, said, "it's great news for our business. We have been actively re-underwriting and rebuilding our portfolio to ensure we are compliant, but this should ease concerns for those who are struggling to meet the standard."
Likewise, Nicky Burridge from The Telegraph said, "the decision will be welcomed by many players in the sector, who have been grappling with the economic impact of the pandemic, as well as catastrophic climate events."
The announcement follows calls for the British government to extend the deadline for implementing the regulations, given the substantial financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the insurance industry. Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, and MP for Runnymede and Weybridge had also called on the government to extend the period in which these rules would take effect.
In addition, Lloyd's of London has announced that it is dropping a controversial proposal that would prevent insured individuals from using their homes as collateral. The proposed regulation, known as 'multi-trigger,' created an uproar among several insurers and brokers, as it would disqualify a vast number of homeowners from obtaining coverage.
Under the multi-trigger approach, policyholders who defaulted on their mortgage payments would lose their coverage. Following this, insurers would take control of their homes and repay the remaining debt to the lender. This was seen as unfair, particularly given the financial destabilization caused by COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns.
The proposal faced stiff opposition from brokers and insurers who argued that the regulation would effectively leave homeowners homeless. They argued that individuals would not be able to pay off their debts, and so insurers would be forced to seize the homes, leading to an increase in homelessness.
Lloyd's of London recognized the concerns raised and suspended the proposal, confirming that it would "no longer be pursuing it." This move has been widely welcomed, with many industry experts citing it as an example of the company's willingness to take decisive action in response to feedback from its members.
The changes to the Decile 10 regulations and the multi-trigger proposal demonstrate the unity and solidarity of the insurance industry. They highlight the importance of communication and consultation in the regulatory process, as well as the need for flexibility and adaptability in the rapidly evolving market.
In conclusion, Lloyd's of London has given its members more time to comply with the new capital requirements. The decision reflects the company's awareness of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the company has dropped its controversial proposal to prevent insured individuals from using their homes as collateral. This highlights the importance of consultation and flexibility in the regulatory process and the need for the industry to work together to maintain stability and protect policyholders during times of crisis.
