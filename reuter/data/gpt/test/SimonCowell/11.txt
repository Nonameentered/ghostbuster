Norwich Union Members to Receive Over £3 Billion in Free Shares After Demutualization Approval
Norwich Union, one of the UK's oldest and largest insurers, has announced that its members will receive over £3 billion in free shares, following the approval of its demutualization plan by the courts.
The plan, which was first proposed in 2020, will see Norwich Union restructured as a public company, offering its shares on the London Stock Exchange. The company's members, who are currently its policyholders, will receive shares in the new company.
The demutualization plan was subject to approval by the courts, as well as the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.
In a statement, Norwich Union said that the demutualization "represents a significant milestone in the transformation of our business, enabling us to deliver greater value to our customers and shareholders, and to position ourselves for long-term sustainable growth."
The statement continued: "We remain committed to delivering high-quality insurance and investment products and services to our customers, and to building a stronger, more resilient business for the future."
Norwich Union was founded in 1797 as the Norwich Union Society for Insurances on Lives and Survivorship. It has since grown to become one of the UK's largest insurers, with over 7 million customers and £363 billion in assets under management.
The demutualization plan has been controversial, with some policyholders expressing concerns that they will lose the mutual benefits they currently enjoy, such as the right to vote on company decisions.
However, Norwich Union has sought to reassure its members that they will continue to have a say in the company's future. In a letter to policyholders in March 2021, the company said: "We want to assure you that, as a shareholder, you will still have a voice in the way the company is run. You will be able to attend and vote at our annual general meetings, and you will be entitled to receive dividends if and when we pay them."
The free shares that Norwich Union members will receive are expected to be worth around £1,500 each, although the exact value will depend on the company's share price when they are issued. Members will be able to choose whether to keep their shares, sell them, or transfer them to a stocks and shares ISA.
The demutualization is expected to take place in the second half of 2021, subject to final regulatory approvals. Norwich Union has said that it will provide regular updates to its members on the process.
The demutualization is part of a wider trend in the insurance industry, as companies seek to modernize and become more competitive in a rapidly changing market. In recent years, other insurers such as Standard Life and Friends Provident have also demutualized.
Critics of demutualization argue that it can lead to a loss of customer focus, as companies become more focused on delivering returns to shareholders. However, supporters say that demutualization can provide benefits such as improved access to capital, greater agility in the face of market changes, and increased opportunities for growth.
Norwich Union's demutualization is likely to be closely watched by analysts and investors, as a bellwether for the wider insurance industry. It remains to be seen whether the company will be able to successfully navigate the transition to public ownership, and maintain its position as one of the UK's leading insurers.
For policyholders, the demutualization is a unique opportunity to receive a significant windfall, in the form of free shares in a major UK company. Whether they choose to hold on to their shares or sell them for a profit, the demutualization marks a major moment in Norwich Union's history, and a significant change in the UK insurance industry as a whole.
