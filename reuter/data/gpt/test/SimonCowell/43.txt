Lloyd's of London, the renowned insurance market, has extended its deadline for underwriting members to increase their capital holdings amid the coronavirus crisis. The institution has also dropped proposals that would have allowed members to use their homes as collateral for underwriting risks.
The decision was announced on Wednesday following consultation with members of the market. The deadline for members to increase their capital holdings has now been pushed from September to the end of December.
"The covid-19 crisis has had a significant impact on many of our customers and members, and we understand that some may need more time," said Lloyd's in a statement.
The market also revealed that it will not be pursuing proposals that would have allowed members to use their homes as collateral to support underwriting risks. The idea was met with significant opposition from some members, who argued that the move would put their personal assets at risk.
Lloyd's said it had taken the feedback into account and had dropped the proposals. The market added that it remained committed to exploring alternative options that would help members who might be struggling to meet capital requirements.
The decision to extend the deadline and drop the proposals has been warmly welcomed by members of the market. Lloyd's Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said the move provided important flexibility for customers and members during a difficult period.
"Lloyd's has a responsibility to protect the interests of customers and members, and we believe this extension will be beneficial to both," he said.
The decision comes after a challenging year for Lloyd's, which has been hit by rising claims, low investment returns, and the impact of the pandemic. The institution has been working to modernize its operations and improve profitability, with an ongoing program of reforms known as "Lloyd's Blueprint Two."
Lloyd's Chief Executive John Neal thanked members for their feedback and said the market would continue to work closely with them as it implements its reforms.
"We remain committed to delivering the changes outlined in Lloyd's Blueprint Two, which are critical to our long-term success, as well as supporting our customers and members during this challenging time," he said. 
In conclusion, the extension of the deadline and dropping of the proposals regarding backersâ€™ capital increases and use of own homes as collateral for underwriting by Lloyd's of London, has been seen as a relief by members of the market during this challenging period of COVID-19 pandemic.
