Royal and Sun Alliance Group (RSA) has announced that it will be carrying out a share buyback after posting strong financial results in the first half of 2021. The insurance provider's operating profits rose by 17% to £538m ($743m), and its net written premiums increased by 2% to £4.8bn ($6.6bn).
As a result of these positive figures, RSA's board has approved a buyback of up to £150m ($207m) of its ordinary shares, which will begin immediately and continue over the next six months. The decision comes after a period of sustained growth for RSA, which has seen its share price rise steadily over the past year.
Commenting on the announcement, RSA's CEO, Stephen Hester, said: "We are pleased with the progress we have made in the first half of the year, and the board's decision to approve a share buyback reflects our confidence in the ongoing strength of our business."
The buyback will be funded from RSA's existing cash resources, which stood at £1.5bn ($2.1bn) at the end of June. The company will also continue to invest in strategic initiatives aimed at driving future growth, particularly in areas such as climate risk and healthcare.
The news has been welcomed by investors, with RSA's share price rising by more than 2% following the announcement. The company's performance has been particularly impressive given the challenges posed by the pandemic and ongoing economic uncertainty.
RSA's results were driven by growth in its UK and International and Scandinavia business units, which saw their operating profits rise by 18% and 26% respectively. The company also benefited from a lower level of large losses and favourable exchange rates.
Looking ahead, RSA is well-positioned to capitalise on emerging opportunities in the insurance sector. The company has identified climate risk as a key focus area, and has established a dedicated team to develop new products and services in this space.
In addition, RSA is also investing in digital capabilities to enhance its customer experience and streamline its operations. This includes the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve claims handling and underwriting processes.
The company's strong financial position also puts it in a good position to consider further acquisitions or partnerships in the future. RSA has a history of successful partnerships, including its joint venture with Tesco Bank to provide car and home insurance products.
Overall, the announcement of the share buyback is a positive sign for RSA and its shareholders. The company's strong financial performance, combined with its strategic focus on growth areas such as climate risk, suggests that it is well-placed to deliver sustainable long-term value.
As Stephen Hester noted: "Our success over the first six months of 2021 has been driven by our operational focus and resilience, underpinned by the strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to delivering outstanding service and value to our customers, while driving sustainable growth and returns for our shareholders."
