The SIB (Securities and Investments Board) has launched a 400,000 pound campaign to raise awareness of the pension mis-selling review. The campaign is aimed at those who were mis-sold pensions in the past and may be eligible for compensation.
The campaign will include radio and online advertising as well as leaflets being distributed to key areas across the country. The aim is to reach as many people as possible, particularly those who may be unaware that they were mis-sold a pension.
The SIB has been reviewing pension mis-selling cases since 2018 and has identified thousands of individuals who may be eligible for compensation. The mis-selling occurred when individuals were advised to transfer their existing pension into a new plan which was not suitable for them.
Many of those affected were not made aware of the risks and potential high fees associated with the new pension plan. The SIB's review has identified cases where people have lost significant sums of money as a result of the mis-selling, often impacting their retirement income.
The SIB's campaign is aimed at raising awareness among those who may have been affected, but also at encouraging them to come forward and make a claim for compensation. The process for making a claim is simple and straightforward, and the SIB is urging anyone who believes they may have been mis-sold a pension to get in touch.
The SIB's CEO, Paul Stevens, said: "The mis-selling of pensions is a serious issue, and we want to ensure that anyone who has been affected is aware of the review and the compensation options available to them. Our campaign aims to reach as many people as possible and encourage them to come forward and make a claim. We urge anyone who has concerns about their pension to get in touch and find out if they are eligible for compensation."
The SIB's campaign is set to run for several months, and the hope is that it will raise awareness among those who may have been affected by pension mis-selling and help them to claim the compensation they are entitled to.
