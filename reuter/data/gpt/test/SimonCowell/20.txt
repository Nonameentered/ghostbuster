Direct Line Sees Signs of Improved Results in Motor Insurance Market, but Warns of Possible "Irrationality"
UK-based insurance company Direct Line has reported signs of improved results in the motor insurance market, but has also warned of possible "irrationality" in the sector.
In a trading update released on Friday, the company said that it had seen a rise in gross written premiums (GWP) in the motor insurance segment in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher average premiums and stronger customer retention, the company said.
Direct Line also said that claims frequency had remained lower than pre-pandemic levels, and that claims severity had been broadly stable. However, the company warned that the market remained highly competitive, with aggressive pricing by some players.
"The motor insurance market is showing signs of improvement, but it remains highly competitive and we are seeing pockets of irrationality in some areas," said Penny James, CEO of Direct Line. "We remain prudent in our approach to pricing and underwriting, and we will continue to focus on delivering excellent customer service and driving efficiencies in our operations."
Direct Line said that it was well-positioned to navigate the current market conditions, with its strong brand, leading market position, and diversified product offering. The company said that it would continue to invest in digital capabilities and innovation to enhance the customer experience and improve operational efficiency.
The company's update comes amid a flurry of activity in the motor insurance sector. In March, the UK government announced plans to reform the whiplash claims system, which is expected to reduce the cost of motor insurance premiums for drivers. The reforms, which will come into effect in May, aim to clamp down on fake and exaggerated whiplash claims, which are estimated to cost the insurance sector around Â£2bn ($2.8bn) per year.
In addition, the sector has been grappling with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to changes in driving patterns and claims trends. Motor insurers have faced a surge in demand for car and van insurance from delivery drivers and other essential workers, while claims from other drivers have fallen as lockdowns and other restrictions limit travel.
However, some experts have warned that the sector could face further turbulence in the coming months, as the UK emerges from lockdown and driving patterns return to normal. They have also cautioned that the impact of Brexit on the sector remains uncertain, with potential implications for pricing and claims management.
Despite these challenges, Direct Line said that it remained confident in its ability to deliver sustainable growth and value for shareholders.
"We are focused on delivering profitable growth, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital management," James said. "We believe that our diversified product offering, strong brand, and digital capabilities will help us to continue to grow our customer base and drive long-term shareholder value."
Direct Line's shares rose by more than 2% in early trading on Friday, following the announcement. The company is due to release its full-year results for 2020 on March 2.
