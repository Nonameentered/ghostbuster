London-based insurance market, Lloyd's of London, has moved to placate traditional backers who expressed concern about a hidden agenda within the company. The assurance came as Lloyd's set out a five-year plan to boost profitability and modernize underwriting.
Lloyd's has long been seen as the home of "the face-to-face deal", with underwriters meeting with brokers to work out terms for niche insurance policies. However, the market is now facing mounting pressure from alternative capital providers such as insurance-linked securities, which use technology to replace the personal touch.
Some of Lloyd's traditional underwriters expressed concern that new backers from Silicon Valley could have designs on taking over and changing the market beyond recognition. In response, CEO Inga Beale sought to reassure the naysayers that the five-year plan aimed at increasing profitability and driving innovation would not dilute the market's unique selling point.
"We are not going to abandon our roots, our traditions or our strengths," said Beale. "What we are going to do is build upon them and find new ways to deliver value to our customers."
The five-year plan seeks to increase efficiency by streamlining processes and boosting digitization, while also expanding into new markets. Beale also highlighted new initiatives to attract millennials, stating that the company must "change the perception of insurance" to appeal to the younger generation.
Lloyd's has faced some setbacks in recent years, with a string of natural disasters such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria leading to a net loss of Â£2 billion in 2017. But Beale remained upbeat about the market's prospects, stating that the "dynamic, proactive and innovative spirit of our marketplace" would see it thrive.
The reassurance appeared to have worked, with the Lloyd's market reportedly seeing strong demand from both traditional underwriters and new entrants. However, some analysts cautioned that the five-year plan would face significant challenges, particularly around retaining the personal touch that has long been Lloyd's hallmark.
"While it's good to see Lloyd's reassurance of its traditional backers, there is a danger that the market could become too focused on technological solutions and lose sight of the importance of the personal relationship," said analyst Tom Jenkins of insurance consultancy Zeguro.
Nevertheless, there is little doubt that Lloyd's must adapt to remain competitive in the modern world. The five-year plan will form a crucial part of that evolution, and its success or failure will have implications not only for the market but also for the wider insurance industry.
