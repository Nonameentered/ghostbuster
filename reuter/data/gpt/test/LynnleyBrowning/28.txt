Norilsk Nickel announced on Monday that its employees should brace themselves for cutbacks despite averting a strike last week. The company is facing financial challenges amid weak demand and plummeting prices for nickel, a main product of the company.
Norilsk Nickel was able to avoid a strike last week after it held negotiations with worker representatives. The company made concessions, including offering employees a 9% pay increase and reducing overtime work. However, company officials have warned that the company cannot afford to keep up with high wages and benefits for its workers.
The company has struggled financially in recent years due to weak demand for nickel, which makes up a significant portion of the company's revenue. In addition, the price of nickel has plummeted due to oversupply in the market. This has put pressure on the company to cut costs and make tough decisions about its workforce.
The company employs over 80,000 people, making it one of the largest employers in Russia. However, Norilsk Nickel has recently been restructuring its workforce, including cutting jobs and reducing benefits, in an effort to reduce costs.
Norilsk Nickel's CEO, Vladimir Potanin, warned employees that "the company is facing a very difficult situation and we need to take painful measures to survive." He added that "the company cannot afford to continue with the same high wages and benefits that we have in the past."
The announcement of possible cutbacks has sparked concern among employees, who fear losing their jobs or experiencing reduced benefits. Some workers expressed frustration at the company's management, saying that they felt "betrayed" after agreeing to forgo the strike.
Company officials have said that the cutbacks would include reducing salaries and benefits for some employees, as well as possibly cutting jobs. However, they have not given specifics on the number of jobs that would be cut.
The announcement of the possible cutbacks came just days after the company announced its earnings for the first half of 2021. The company reported a net income of $2.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion in the same period last year. However, the increase was mainly due to a one-time gain from the sale of a stake in a mining company.
Analysts have said that the company's financial challenges are unlikely to be resolved in the near future. They noted that the company is facing strong competition from other producers, as well as the oversupply of nickel in the market.
Norilsk Nickel has said that it will continue to work with its employees and unions to find a solution to the financial challenges. However, analysts said that the company may need to make tough decisions, including possibly selling assets or cutting back on production, to ensure its survival.
