Russia has reportedly missed out on the opportunity to capitalize on the vast oil and gas reserves in the Caspian Sea, but has now secured a series of significant deals with Iraq as part of an ambitious expansion in the Middle East Gulf region.
The news comes amid reports that Moscow failed to secure any new drilling rights in the Caspian Sea during the recent auction held by Kazakhstan. It is understood that Russian companies had been hoping to secure the exploration and development rights for at least one of ten blocks being auctioned off in the northern Caspian, but as it transpired, they were outbid by rival firms from China, Azerbaijan and Norway.
Despite missing out on the chance to tap into the Caspian's oil, and despite facing sanctions from the West over its involvement in Ukraine, Russia is nevertheless forging ahead with new deals in the Middle East. Last week it was announced that the Russian state-owned oil company, Rosneft, has signed contracts with Iraqi Kurdistan to build a number of oil pipelines that will help triple the flow of oil from the region to the Mediterranean.
The announcement of the deals was made in Baghdad by Rosneft CEO, Igor Sechin, who has been on an extended visit to Iraq in recent weeks. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Sechin said that the pipelines would stretch for over a thousand kilometers from the Kurdistan region in the north of Iraq to the coast of Syria. The investment, which is expected to total around $1 billion, will also include the construction of an oil refinery in the Kurdish city of Kirkuk, according to Mr. Sechin.
The agreements were signed with the Kurdish government in defiance of the central Iraqi government in Baghdad, which has been trying to block the export of oil from the autonomous Kurdish region. The Iraqi government claims that all oil exports must go through the state-owned oil company, SOMO, in order to maintain control over exports and revenue, but the KRG has been flouting these restrictions for some time. It is understood that the new deals will see the Kurdish oil being sold directly to Rosneft, which will then market the oil around the world.
The Russian move into Iraq comes as part of a broader push by Moscow to expand its presence in the Middle East and reduce its dependence on Western markets. It also marks a significant shift in power in the region, as Russia increasingly becomes the dominant energy player in several key countries, including Iran and Syria as well as Iraq.
For Russia, the move into Iraq is all about gaining access to new markets and resources that it hopes will help offset the impact of the sanctions that have been imposed on it by the West in recent years. Although Russia is currently facing tough economic conditions as a result of sanctions, Moscow is nevertheless pressing ahead with its plans to dominate the global energy markets, and the new deals in Iraq are just one step in that direction.
The Kremlin's ambition is to increase its share of the global energy market by up to 50% over the next few years, and it intends to do so by boosting production at home, as well as by expanding into new markets overseas. Russia sees the Middle East, with its vast oil reserves and growing energy demand, as a key target for expansion in the years ahead.
The new deals in Iraq have been met with concern from some analysts, who see Russia's growing influence in the Middle East as a potential threat to stability in the region. The fear is that Moscow's growing ties with Iran, Syria and other countries could create new tensions in the region and potentially lead to renewed conflict.
However, despite these concerns, Moscow appears determined to press ahead with its ambitious expansion plans, regardless of the risks involved. For Russia, the Middle East represents a vital new frontier, one that offers vast opportunities for growth and development in the years ahead. Whether these opportunities will translate into real gains for Moscow, however, remains to be seen.
