Moscow, Russia – Western oil companies have expressed skepticism over the effectiveness of Russia's newly appointed cabinet, which is spearheaded by reformist Mikhail Mishustin. The companies are doubtful that the new government will be able to jumpstart commercial deals that have remained stalled for years.
The Russian government has been trying to attract foreign investment for years, but these efforts have been met with limited progress. Several Western oil majors, including ExxonMobil, BP, and Total, had signed agreements several years ago to invest billions of dollars in Russia’s oil and gas sector. However, these deals were scuttled by sanctions, legal disputes, and changing market conditions.
The recent appointment of Mikhail Mishustin as the new Prime Minister raised hopes for a new beginning for Russia's economic prospects. The new Prime Minister has a reputation for being pragmatic and efficient, and he is widely seen as a technocrat with a strong track record in implementing reforms, particularly in the tax and customs sectors.
However, top executives from several Western oil companies remain wary about the new government's ability to deliver. They believe that the structural and institutional challenges that have plagued Russia's economy for years will not be resolved anytime soon, and that the new government is unlikely to achieve the sweeping reforms that Russia needs to become a more attractive investment destination.
“There is a lot of talk about how the new government will be more efficient, more friendly, and more predictable, but in reality, the underlying issues remain,” says a senior executive from a Western oil major. “Russia is still grappling with corruption, weak institutions, and a complex regulatory environment that makes it difficult to do business here.”
One major sticking point for foreign investors has been Russia's judicial system, which has been criticized for lacking independence, transparency, and predictability. Western investors have been targets of politically motivated investigations, lawsuits, and asset seizures, which have eroded trust in Russia's legal framework.
“Foreign investors have been burned in Russia before, and they won't come back unless they see credible improvements in the rule of law and the protection of property rights,” says another senior executive. ”The new government will have to address these issues if it wants to attract long-term investment in the energy sector, which is vital for Russia's economic prosperity.”
Apart from the legal challenges, Western oil companies are also concerned about the lack of progress on key energy projects in Russia. For instance, ExxonMobil's partnership with Rosneft, Russia's state-owned oil company, to explore the Arctic region was halted in 2014 due to Western sanctions, and it has remained in limbo ever since.
BP's recent attempt to form a joint venture with Rosneft to develop a massive gas field in the Arctic was stymied by a legal dispute with minority shareholders. The project was supposed to be a flagship deal for foreign investment in Russia's energy sector, but its fate remains uncertain.
“The reality is that there are many hurdles that foreign investors have to overcome in order to do business in Russia,” says a third senior executive. “If the new government wants to attract investment, it will have to address these barriers and create a level playing field for everyone.”
Despite the skepticism from Western companies, the new government has maintained that it is committed to creating a more favorable investment climate for foreign investors. Prime Minister Mishustin has emphasized the need to cut red tape, streamline regulations, and improve the transparency and predictability of the business environment.
However, it remains to be seen whether the new government can translate its rhetoric into action. The energy sector, which is critical for Russia's economic growth, is likely to be a key barometer of the government's ability to attract foreign investment and implement reforms that foster a more conducive investment climate.
