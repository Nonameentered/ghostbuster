MOSCOW - LUKoil, the Russian multinational energy corporation, has claimed that it is the world’s largest oil firm, but industry analysts beg to differ. The company’s announcement, made on Tuesday at its annual general meeting in Moscow, came as a surprise to many, considering industry rankings have consistently placed the company at a lower position.
LUKoil CEO Vagit Alekperov stated in a press conference, “We are proud to announce that LUKoil has surpassed all our competitors globally in terms of oil production. Our strong financial position and strategic investments have allowed us to take the lead in the global oil industry.”
However, experts have suggested that LUKoil’s claim is far from the truth. According to Forbes, LUKoil ranks ninth in the world in terms of crude production, behind companies such as Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, BP, and ExxonMobil. The Financial Times lists LUKoil as the seventh-largest oil company by revenue, behind Shell, ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Total, and Rosneft.
In fact, LUKoil has been lagging behind most of its competitors for the past decade, despite being one of the largest oil companies in Russia. Its production of oil and gas has remained stable at around 2 million barrels per day for the last three years, while its net income has followed a downward trend since 2012.
Industry analysts suggest that LUKoil’s announcement may be part of a larger strategy to improve its position in the global market. The company has been actively expanding its overseas operations and diversifying into other sectors such as renewable energy and petrochemicals. Moreover, its recent acquisition of a stake in Iraq’s West Qurna-2 oilfield has strengthened its position in the Middle East.
However, analysts believe that the company’s heavy investment in overseas projects has been limiting its ability to grow in its home market. Russia’s oil production has been stagnant in recent years, with the country being overtaken by the United States as the world’s largest oil producer. LUKoil’s attempt to grow its production and reserves in new regions may be a sign of its diminishing prospects in Russia.
Moreover, geopolitical risks have also had a significant impact on LUKoil. The company has been affected by Western sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea in 2014, which have restricted its access to international capital markets and technology. Its operations in Iraq have also been affected by instability in the region, with recent attacks on oil facilities leading to an 8% drop in Iraqi exports in November.
LUKoil’s announcement has also raised concerns about the company’s transparency and credibility. The company has been criticized in the past for its lack of disclosure and corporate governance practices. Its decision to declare itself the world’s largest oil company without any backing from industry rankings or statistics has been seen as an attempt to divert attention from its financial troubles and low production growth.
Analysts suggest that LUKoil needs to focus on improving its core operations and financial performance rather than making bold but unsupported claims. The company has been struggling to remain profitable in a highly competitive and volatile market, with its debt levels rising and its credit rating downgraded by Moody’s in November.
“LUKoil needs to realize that being the biggest oil company in the world is not the ultimate goal,” says Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer. “What matters is profitability, efficiency, and sustainability.”
In conclusion, LUKoil’s claim to be the world’s largest oil company has been met with skepticism by industry experts who have pointed out its lower rank in global rankings. The company’s decision to make such a claim may be part of a larger strategy to improve its position in the market, but it needs to focus on improving its core operations and financial performance before making such bold statements.
