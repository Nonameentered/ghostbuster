Russia's agriculture minister, Dmitry Patrushev, is urging farmers to improve their efficiency as a poor harvest is expected for the second year in a row due to bad weather conditions.
According to a statement by the Ministry of Agriculture, this year's harvest is estimated to top last year's poor level by only 1-2%. Furthermore, the drought and heatwaves in some regions have damaged crops, particularly in the south of Russia.
The latest forecast comes as a disappointment as the ministry had previously predicted a 5-10% increase in the total grain harvest, thanks to an increase in sown areas and favorable weather conditions. However, in recent months, the weather has shifted, and the drought has affected some regions.
In response to the poor harvest outlook, Minister Patrushev is calling for measures to improve agricultural efficiency, such as the use of modern equipment and fertilizers. "Good results can only be achieved through a combination of hard work, investment, and the use of modern technology," he said.
The minister is also urging farmers to diversify their crops to reduce their reliance on grain. This strategy aims to protect against price fluctuations and to make Russian agriculture more sustainable in the long term.
Last year, the Russian government introduced a subsidy program aimed at boosting the production of alternative crops, such as vegetables, berries, and fruit, that are in high demand both domestically and internationally. The program has been successful, with an increase of 8.3% in the sown area of these crops in the first half of 2021.
In addition, Minister Patrushev has expressed the need to increase the production of livestock and dairy products to reduce Russia's reliance on imports. Russia has been working towards self-sufficiency in food production since a ban on most Western food imports was introduced in 2014 in retaliation for Western sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea.
The poor grain harvest is expected to affect Russia's exports, as grain is one of its major exports. However, Minister Patrushev has expressed confidence in Russia's ability to meet its obligations to its foreign customers despite the expected low harvest.
Russia has been a major player in the global grain market for decades, with a share of nearly 20% of the wheat market. Its exports have been hampered by the pandemic, as shipping and transport issues have made it difficult to deliver goods to ports and markets.
However, with the opening of a rail bridge to China last year and investments in new transport routes, Russia is working to increase its agricultural exports to Asia and the Middle East, where demand for food is rapidly increasing.
In conclusion, Minister Patrushev's call for increased efficiency and diversification in agriculture is timely and essential. The effects of climate change and unexpected weather patterns will continue to affect the agriculture industry, and it is therefore essential to adopt innovative and sustainable strategies to meet the growing demand for food while protecting the environment.
Russia's ability to adapt to changing circumstances will determine its position on the global market, and its agriculture industry is a central part of its economic growth strategy. The success of these initiatives will not only ensure food security for Russia's population but also contribute to global food security.
