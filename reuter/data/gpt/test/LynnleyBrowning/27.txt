Moscow, Russia- Despite the favorable weather conditions, Russia's net grain harvest is expected to fall below official forecasts this year. According to experts, the primary reason for this decline in yield output is the severe drought that has ravaged the country's agricultural regions.
As per the latest projections by the Ministry of Agriculture, Russia's grain harvest for 2021 is likely to be 116 million tons. This forecast is approximately 3.6% higher than last year's yield but falls short of the 120 million tons that the country's farmers had hoped to produce.
However, given the recent developments, it is now estimated that Russia's total grain harvest for the year will be around 110 million tons, which is down by 5-6 million tons from the official forecast. This adjustment is significant, as it has implications for Russia's economy and the global food market.
Experts state that the Russian agriculture sector has been facing significant challenges in recent years, with weather conditions being the primary factor. The country witnessed one of its worst droughts in 2010, which resulted in a sharp drop in the grain output. The situation was so dire that the government had to stop grain exports that year to prevent a nationwide food crisis.
Now, it appears that Russia is facing a repeat of the 2010 grain crisis. The central regions of the country, where some of the most productive farmlands are situated, have seen unusually dry conditions this year. Many experts believe that this drought is the main reason for the decline of the net grain harvest.
According to Yulia Ivanova, an agricultural analyst at SovEcon, a Moscow-based consultancy firm, the drought this year has been very severe. "We are seeing less rain than last year, and temperatures are higher in the regions that grow spring wheat, which is one of the major crops. This has affected the water supply in many areas, resulting in crop losses."
The situation is not restricted to just the central regions. Southern Russia, which is known for its fertile agricultural lands, is also witnessing a decline in its crop output due to the drought.
The Russian government has taken notice of the situation and is taking steps to address it. During a recent meeting with the Governor of the Krasnodar region, Deputy Prime Minister Victoria Abramchenko pledged to provide additional support to the farmers affected by the drought.
However, despite these efforts, experts believe that the drought is severe and may result in significant losses for the farmers. This could have serious implications for Russia's economy, as agriculture is one of the country's key sectors, contributing significantly to its GDP.
Moreover, the decline in Russia's net grain harvest may also impact the global food market, as the country is the world's largest wheat exporter. A fall in the grain output would mean a decrease in the supply of wheat, which could result in an increase in global food prices.
In conclusion, the drought that has plagued Russia's agricultural regions is expected to result in a decline in the country's net grain harvest. This fall in yield output could impact Russia's economy and have global implications on the food market. However, the government has taken notice of the situation and is taking steps to address it. Nonetheless, the severity of the drought may mean that the losses incurred by the farmers will be significant.
