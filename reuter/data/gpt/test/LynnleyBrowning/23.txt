Russian gas giant Gazprom has announced major restructuring efforts that will result in significant job cuts across several departments. The announcement was made by the Chairman of Gazprom's Board of Directors, Rem Vyakhirev, during a press conference on Wednesday.
According to Vyakhirev, the restructuring plans are aimed at streamlining the company's operations and improving its efficiency. As part of these efforts, the company will be reducing its workforce by approximately 15 percent, or around 100,000 employees.
"We are making these difficult decisions to ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of Gazprom," said Vyakhirev. "We need to focus on our core operations and become more efficient in order to remain competitive in the global energy market."
The company plans to achieve these job cuts through a combination of early retirement options, natural attrition, and targeted layoffs. The restructuring will also involve merging several departments and reducing the number of management positions.
Despite the job cuts, Vyakhirev emphasized that Gazprom will remain intact as a monopoly and will continue to play a key role in Russia's energy sector.
"Gazprom is an integral part of the Russian economy, and we will continue to serve our customers and provide reliable energy supplies to the country," said Vyakhirev. "Our restructuring efforts are not aimed at breaking up the company or opening up the market to competition."
Gazprom, which is majority-owned by the Russian government, is the world's largest producer of natural gas and one of Russia's largest companies. The company has long been accused of using its monopoly status to stifle competition and maintain control over the country's energy sector.
Critics of the company have argued that its dominance has led to inefficient operations, corruption, and a lack of investment in renewable energy sources.
In recent years, Gazprom has faced growing competition from other gas producers, particularly in Europe. The company has also been under pressure from the Russian government to increase its revenue and improve its financial performance.
The company's announcement of job cuts and restructuring is seen as a response to these pressures.
"The global energy market is changing rapidly, and we need to adapt if we want to remain relevant," said Vyakhirev. "Our restructuring efforts will help us to become more agile and better positioned to compete in this new environment."
The announcement of job cuts at Gazprom has been met with mixed reactions. Some analysts have welcomed the company's efforts to improve its efficiency and reduce its workforce, while others have criticized the move as an attempt to maintain the company's monopoly status.
"The job cuts at Gazprom are a necessary step to improve the company's efficiency and help it adapt to changing market conditions," said Russian energy analyst Oleg Grigorov. "But at the same time, Gazprom needs to be careful not to abuse its monopoly position and stifle competition."
Environmental groups have also called on Gazprom to use the restructuring as an opportunity to invest in renewable energy sources and reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.
"The world is moving towards clean, renewable energy sources, and Gazprom needs to keep up with this trend," said Greenpeace Russia's climate and energy campaigner, Denis Sivkov. "The company should use this opportunity to invest in wind and solar power and reduce its carbon footprint."
Despite the criticism, Gazprom remains a key player in the global energy market and an important part of Russia's economy. The company's restructuring efforts will likely have far-reaching implications for the energy sector in Russia and beyond.
As Vyakhirev noted, "The changes we are making today are difficult, but they are necessary to ensure the long-term success of Gazprom and the Russian energy sector as a whole."
