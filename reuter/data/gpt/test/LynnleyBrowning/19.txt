Russian oil producers are battling for control of crude oil exports, leaving traders in doubt about the future of the country's energy industry. The conflict is fueled by a new export duty system that has created a rift between private oil companies and state-controlled firms.
The new export duty system, which took effect on January 1, 2022, introduces a sliding scale of duties based on the price of crude oil. The higher the price, the higher the duty, with a cap of 90% for prices above $130 per barrel. The system is designed to help stabilize domestic fuel prices and increase revenue for the government.
However, the new system has created tension between private oil companies, such as Lukoil and Rosneft, who are seeking to maintain their control over exports, and state-controlled firms, such as Gazprom Neft and Rosneftegaz, who are looking to increase their share.
Lukoil and Rosneft have been the main exporters of Russian crude oil in recent years, accounting for around 60% of all exports. They have also been the main beneficiaries of the previous export duty regime, which was a flat rate of $54 per metric ton.
The new system has hit both companies hard, with Lukoil reporting a decrease in its net profit for the first quarter of 2022 by 29% compared to the same period in 2021, while Rosneft reported a 6-fold increase in its export duties in January-March 2022.
The two companies are fighting back by seeking to expand their refining capacity and export infrastructure, as well as by lobbying the government to revise the new duty system in their favor. They argue that the new system will disadvantage Russian exports compared to those from other oil-producing countries, which have a fixed rate of export duty.
On the other hand, state-controlled firms are looking to increase their share of exports by investing in new fields and infrastructure. They argue that the new duty system will help them to finance these investments and ensure a level playing field for all companies.
The conflict between the two sides has left traders in doubt about the future of Russian crude oil exports. Traders rely on stable prices and contracts to make long-term investments in the industry, but the uncertainty created by the conflict is making it difficult to plan ahead.
Many traders are now turning to other oil-producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq, which offer more stable export conditions. This is bad news for Russia, which has been the world's largest crude oil exporter after Saudi Arabia since the early 2000s.
The uncertainty is also affecting the Russian economy, which relies heavily on oil exports for revenue. According to the Ministry of Finance, the new duty system is expected to generate an additional 1 trillion rubles ($13.6 billion) in revenue for the government in 2022, but this depends on the stability of exports.
The situation has also attracted the attention of foreign investors, who are closely monitoring the conflict. Many foreign oil companies have invested in Russian fields and infrastructure in recent years, but the uncertainty created by the conflict is making them nervous.
The conflict between private oil companies and state-controlled firms is not new in Russia. It reflects the broader struggle between the government and the private sector for control over the country's resources and economy.
However, the current conflict is particularly acute due to the importance of the oil industry for the Russian economy and the fact that it comes at a time when the country is facing economic and political challenges, including sanctions, low oil prices, and a decline in the standard of living.
The government will need to find a solution to the conflict soon if it wants to maintain Russia's position as a major player in the global energy industry. This will require a delicate balance between the interests of private oil companies and state-controlled firms, as well as the needs of traders, investors, and the economy as a whole.
The future of Russian crude oil exports depends on finding this balance and creating a stable and predictable export regime that benefits all stakeholders in the industry. If this cannot be achieved, the consequences could be dire for the country's economy and energy industry.
