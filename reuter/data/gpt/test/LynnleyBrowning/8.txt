Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of palladium and nickel, is challenging the Soviet legacy of companies supporting towns. Kola MMC, the company's subsidiary, has announced its intention to withdraw from the town of Monchegorsk, which it has supported since the Soviet era.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Russian companies have continued the tradition of supporting the towns where they operate. This includes providing housing, healthcare, and other social services to employees and their families. However, Norilsk Nickel argues that this practice is unsustainable and not in the best interests of either the company or the community.
Kola MMC plans to sell its housing stock in Monchegorsk to the local government, and use the proceeds to invest in its core business operations. The company will continue to provide some social services to its employees, but will no longer be responsible for the wider community.
Critics argue that the decision will leave residents of Monchegorsk without adequate support, and that the government does not have the funds to take on responsibility for the town. However, Norilsk Nickel maintains that it is necessary to focus on its core business to remain competitive in the global market.
The move is likely to be closely watched by other companies operating in Russia, as the legacy of Soviet-era support for towns comes under increasing scrutiny.
