Russia's oil industry just got a lot more interesting as the country's top oil producers are now battling for control of the lucrative oil export market.
For decades, Russian oil companies have been controlled by the state, with the government selling the country's crude oil to foreign buyers through its oil export monopoly, Transneft.
However, things are now changing as President Vladimir Putin and his government have been liberalizing the oil industry. This has opened the door for Russia's biggest oil companies to compete in the international market and put an end to Transneft's monopoly.
The two oil majors that have emerged as the front runners in this battle are Rosneft and Lukoil. These are the two biggest oil companies in Russia, and they are both now vying for control of this lucrative market.
Rosneft is the state-controlled giant, which was created in 1998 out of the state's sale of its oil assets. Today, it is the biggest oil company in Russia and operates in over 25 countries, with a daily production of around 4.1 million barrels per day.
However, Lukoil is not to be underestimated. This private company has grown significantly over the past few years, and is now the second-largest oil company in Russia. It operates in more than 30 countries, producing around 2 million barrels of oil per day.
So, what is at stake in this battle for control of the oil export market? The answer is simple - money.
By taking control of the market, both Rosneft and Lukoil will be able to sell their crude oil directly to foreign buyers, cutting out the middleman and boosting their profits significantly.
Transneft, on the other hand, stands to lose a significant portion of its revenue if its monopoly is ended. This could have a major impact on the government's budget, as the state-owned company is responsible for a huge portion of oil exports.
The battle for control of the oil export market is not just a financial one, however. It is also a matter of political power. Both Rosneft and Lukoil have close ties to the government, and their success or failure could have a significant impact on the balance of power in Russia.
It is no secret that Putin and his government are looking to diversify the country's economy, which has long been overly dependent on oil and gas exports. Opening up the oil industry to competition is seen as a way to achieve this goal.
However, there are concerns that this move could also lead to increased corruption and cronyism, as companies compete for the government's favor and access to lucrative contracts.
Despite these concerns, both Rosneft and Lukoil are pushing ahead with their plans to take control of the oil export market. Rosneft has already signed a deal with the Chinese government to supply them with crude oil, while Lukoil is looking to expand its presence in Europe and Asia.
It remains to be seen who will ultimately emerge victorious in this battle for control of Russia's oil export market. However, one thing is certain - the impact of this conflict will be felt not just in Russia, but around the world. With the global demand for oil and gas only expected to rise in the coming years, the stakes couldn't be higher for these two oil giants.
