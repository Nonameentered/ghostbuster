Russia is set to become a major buyer of oil from Iraq, according to officials. The move comes as part of Russia's wider strategy to increase its influence in the Middle East.
Iraq is currently the world's second-largest producer of oil after Saudi Arabia, and Russia is keen to tap into this resource. In the last few years, Russia has been building close ties with Iraq, both in terms of politics and business.
According to Iraqi officials, the two countries have already signed a number of agreements relating to energy and infrastructure, although these have yet to be publicly announced. One of the key deals is said to involve Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft, which is reportedly set to buy a stake in Iraq's West Qurna 1 oilfield, one of the country's largest.
The move to increase oil sales to Russia is seen as a way for Iraq to diversify its customer base and reduce its reliance on sales to China. Currently, around 60% of Iraq's oil exports are sold to China, with the rest shared between other Asian and European countries.
For Russia, the increased oil imports from Iraq will help to decrease its reliance on traditional oil suppliers from the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar. It will also help to offset the effects of Western sanctions on the Russian oil industry.
The key driver behind Russia's plan to increase oil imports from Iraq is the wider geopolitical strategy of the Kremlin. Russia is keen to increase its influence in the Middle East, and sees Iraq as a key ally in the region.
Iraq has traditionally been an ally of the United States, but in recent years, the country has moved closer to Russia. In 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Iraq for the first time in over a decade, where he met with then-Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. During the visit, Putin praised Iraq's efforts to fight terrorism and noted the importance of the two countries' cooperation in the energy sector.
Russia has also been investing heavily in infrastructure projects in Iraq. In 2019, Russian engineering company Stroytransgaz announced that it had won a $1.4 billion contract to build a gas pipeline in Iraq. The project is seen as a major step in increasing Russian influence in the country and the wider region.
The increased cooperation between Russia and Iraq has not gone unnoticed by the United States and its allies in the Middle East. Earlier this year, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Iraq of the dangers of becoming too dependent on Russia and China for its energy needs. The US has been keen to maintain its influence in Iraq since the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein's regime.
Despite these warnings, it appears that Iraq is keen to move closer to Russia. The country has faced significant challenges since the fall of Saddam, including ongoing sectarian violence and the rise of the Islamic State group. Russian support and investment are seen as a way of both stabilizing the country and increasing its economic potential.
For Russia, the increased cooperation with Iraq is part of a wider strategy to increase its influence in the Middle East. With traditional allies such as Syria and Iran facing significant challenges, Russia sees Iraq as a valuable partner in the region.
The increased oil imports from Iraq will also help to offset the effects of Western sanctions on the Russian oil industry. The US and EU have imposed a range of sanctions on Russian energy companies, including Rosneft, in response to Russian actions in Ukraine and other areas.
Overall, the increased cooperation between Russia and Iraq is part of a wider shift in the balance of power in the Middle East. With traditional allies such as the US and Saudi Arabia facing challenges, new players such as Russia and China are seeking to increase their influence in the region. Whether this will lead to greater stability or greater conflict remains to be seen.
