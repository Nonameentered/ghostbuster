Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of palladium and one of the top producers of nickel, is preparing to slash roughly 10,000 jobs in an effort to boost profitability. The Russian mining company, which is a major supplier to the electric vehicle industry, has been struggling with falling metal prices and a series of environmental disasters.
The job cuts will reportedly take place over the next three years and will affect around 10% of Norilsk Nickel's workforce. The company is also planning to close its smelting plant in Nickel, which has been producing harmful emissions and is seen as a major contributor to air pollution in the region.
Norilsk Nickel's CEO, Vladimir Potanin, announced the company's plans in a recent virtual meeting with investors. "We are taking tough measures to improve our financial position and regain the trust of our investors," he said. "This is a difficult decision, but it is necessary for the long-term sustainability of our business."
The job cuts are part of a broader restructuring plan that Norilsk Nickel has been implementing over the past year. The company has been selling non-core assets and investing in new projects in an effort to diversify its revenue streams and reduce its reliance on nickel and palladium.
Despite these efforts, Norilsk Nickel's profits have continued to decline. Last year, the company reported a net loss of $2.1 billion, its worst result in a decade. The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic downturn have further weighed on the company's finances.
The job cuts are likely to be met with resistance from the local population, many of whom depend on Norilsk Nickel for employment. Norilsk, the company's main production site, is located above the Arctic Circle and is home to around 180,000 people, most of whom work for the mining company.
Activists have long criticized Norilsk Nickel for its environmental practices. In June of last year, one of the company's fuel tanks collapsed, spilling 21,000 tons of diesel fuel into the nearby Ambarnaya River. The spill was one of the worst environmental disasters in the history of the Russian Arctic and drew international attention to the company's record on environmental protection.
Potanin has apologized for the company's role in the spill and promised to improve its environmental practices. However, environmentalists say that Norilsk Nickel's track record speaks for itself. "This company has a long history of polluting the environment and neglecting the health and safety of its workers," said Dmitry Lisitsyn, the head of Greenpeace Russia's Arctic program. "These job cuts are not going to solve the underlying problems."
The job cuts are also a blow to the Russian government, which holds a 34% stake in Norilsk Nickel through state-owned mining company Rostec. The government has been pushing for the company to pay more in dividends and invest in new projects in Russia.
In a statement, Rostec said that it supported Norilsk Nickel's restructuring plan but would work to ensure that the company did not abandon its social responsibilities. "We understand the need to improve the company's financial position, but we also believe that Norilsk Nickel has a duty to support the local economy and provide opportunities for its workforce," the statement said.
The job cuts are likely to be just the beginning of Norilsk Nickel's efforts to improve its financial situation. The company has also announced plans to invest $5.5 billion in new projects over the next five years, with a focus on developing new areas of business such as electric vehicles and renewable energy.
Whether these measures will be enough to restore Norilsk Nickel's fortunes remains to be seen. The company's share price has fallen by more than 30% over the past year, and many investors are skeptical about its prospects in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty and environmental concerns. However, Potanin says that he is confident that the company can weather the storm. "We have a strong team, a solid strategy, and a commitment to sustainability," he said. "We are confident that we can emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more resilient company."
