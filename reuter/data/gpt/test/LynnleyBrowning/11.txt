Russia has opened up its massive Sukhoi Log gold field, one of the largest untapped gold mines in the world, to investors. The announcement is anticipated to generate interest from major mining companies worldwide, particularly those from Russia and China. However, experts believe that the mining of the Sukhoi Log may not lead to a flooding of the gold market.
The Sukhoi Log field, located in the Irkutsk region of Siberia, has an estimated reserve of over 540 million tonnes of ore containing an average of 2.3 grams of gold per tonne. This equates to a massive amount of 40 million ounces of gold, making the Sukhoi Log one of the largest untapped gold mines in the world.
Russian state-owned company, Rostec Corporation, is spearheading the development of the Sukhoi Log gold field following its acquisition of a 51% stake in the project last year. The remaining 49% is held by Polyus, the largest gold producer in Russia.
Russian President, Vladimir Putin, personally announced the opening of the Sukhoi Log field during the Eastern Economic Forum held in Vladivostok on 3 September 2021. He stated that the project is expected to generate over 5,000 jobs and an estimated investment of around RUB 350 billion ($4.8 billion).
The announcement has sparked interest from mining companies worldwide, including major players in Russia and China, such as China National Gold and Polyus. However, experts note that the opening of the Sukhoi Log field is unlikely to flood the gold market.
"The opening of Sukhoi Log is an important development in the global gold mining industry, but it will not lead to a flood of gold in the market as it will take several years for companies to develop the mine and bring gold production to market. Furthermore, the mine is still in the exploration stage, and much still needs to be done before it can produce gold on a large scale," said analysts at Metals Focus, a London-based independent precious metals consultancy.
Additionally, the equity market has reacted favorably to this development. The opening of the Sukhoi Log field could potentially provide a substantial boost to the Russian economy, and companies with a stake in the project are anticipated to see a significant rise in their stock prices.
"Polyus, the Russian company with a 49% stake in the project, has seen its stock prices rise by over 4% since the announcement. We anticipate that other companies with a stake in the project will also see a rise in their stock prices as investors show interest in the project," said an analyst at Sberbank, Russia's largest state-owned bank.
The opening of the Sukhoi Log field is significant for Russia as the country is the world's third-largest gold producer, accounting for around 300 tonnes of gold annually. The mining of the Sukhoi Log is expected to increase Russia's gold reserves and could potentially lead to the country becoming the largest gold producer globally.
"The mining of the Sukhoi Log will significantly increase Russia's gold reserves, and this could have a significant impact on the country's economy. Russia is already a major player in the global gold mining industry, and the opening of the Sukhoi Log field could solidify the country's position as the largest gold producer globally," said an analyst at the Russian Economic Development Ministry.
In conclusion, the opening of the Sukhoi Log gold field is an exciting development in the global gold mining industry, with the potential to generate significant investment and employment opportunities. However, it is unlikely to impact the gold market significantly given the exploratory stage of the mine and the time required for its development. Nevertheless, the project could potentially propel Russia to the forefront of the global gold mining industry, making it an essential destination for investors and mining companies seeking to capitalize on this emerging opportunity.
