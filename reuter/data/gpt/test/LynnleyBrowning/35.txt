Moscow, Russia â€“ The tragic murder of Boris Nemtsov last year shocked the world. The former deputy prime minister and opposition leader was a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin's policies before he was assassinated in February 2015. However, his legacy lives on as the country's Fuel and Energy Ministry has undergone major reshuffling aimed at reshaping the output and exports of Russia's energy sector.
In the months following his death, Nemtsov's colleagues in the Russian opposition claimed that his murder was politically motivated and was linked to his criticism of the government's energy policies. Nemtsov had been collecting data on Russia's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine and was preparing to publish a report exposing its role in the war. The report was believed to contain evidence of corruption within the Russian energy sector, with Nemtsov alleging that some top officials in the industry were embezzling funds from the sector's revenue.
These allegations have led to an overhaul of the Fuel and Energy Ministry, with Putin appointing a new minister, Alexander Novak, to head the department in May 2016. The move was aimed at boosting transparency, improving efficiency and reducing the corruption that had plagued the sector for years. The decision to restructure the ministry was also seen as a way to address the declining oil prices that had hit Russia hard, causing a significant dip in the country's economic growth.
Novak, a loyal ally and former deputy finance minister, has introduced several reforms aimed at improving the fiscal health of the energy sector and rejuvenating the country's ageing infrastructure. As part of his reforms, he has set new targets for oil production, gas production and refining capacity. The government has also introduced measures to boost investment in the sector, which has been hit by a decline in foreign investment, with many companies wary of the country's unpredictable economic policies.
Furthermore, Novak has introduced measures aimed at improving the transparency of the sector, including the establishment of a new auditing and accounting system. The measures are designed to reduce the likelihood of corruption and embezzlement, which have plagued the sector for years. The creation of a new department within the ministry will be responsible for monitoring and enforcing these new standards, and the government has promised to bring those who violate the rules to justice.
The reforms to the energy sector have also been accompanied by changes in the country's export policies. Russia is the world's largest exporter of crude oil, and the government's decision to increase exports in the last year led to a drop in global oil prices. The drop put pressure on the energy sector in Russia, and there was a need for the government to shore up the sector's finances. Novak has responded to these changes by introducing new export policies aimed at stabilizing the market and ensuring that the sector can remain competitive in the long run.
One of the most significant changes he has put in place is the decision to prioritize exports to China over those to Europe. China is currently the world's largest energy consumer, and the Russian government sees the country as an important partner in the energy sector. The state-run company Rosneft has already signed several deals with Chinese companies to supply oil to the country, and the government is now focusing on expanding these exports. The government sees the move as a way to secure a new market for its energy exports and reduce its dependence on Europe's fluctuating energy market.
The reforms have been welcomed by some in the opposition, who view them as a long-overdue effort to address the energy sector's problems. Others, however, remain skeptical, and argue that the reforms alone will not be enough to address the challenges the sector faces. They believe that there is a need for greater political reforms and a reduction of corruption within the sector if Russia is to unlock the potential of the energy sector and maintain its competitive edge in the global market.
Despite the opposition to the reforms, it is clear that Novak's changes are already having a notable impact on Russia's energy sector. The country's output of oil and gas has increased significantly, with the sector's growth rate doubling in the last year. Exports to China have also increased, with Russia becoming one of the country's top energy suppliers. These changes are a testament to the government's efforts to address the challenges facing the energy sector and suggest that there may be hope for a brighter future for the industry in Russia. 
In conclusion, the death of Boris Nemtsov has brought about significant changes in Russia's energy sector, with the government introducing a series of reforms aimed at reshaping the output and exports of the industry. These reforms have been welcomed by many as a long-overdue effort to address the sector's problems, and the early signs are promising. However, it remains to be seen if the government can maintain this progress and implement further reforms to create a more transparent and competitive energy sector.
