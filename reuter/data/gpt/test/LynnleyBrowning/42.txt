Russian gas giant Gazprom has delayed its plan to issue more shares for foreign investors amid growing concerns over the companyâ€™s debts and taxes. The company is calling on the Russian government to take action to address these issues before it moves forward with the share issue.
According to a statement released by the company, Gazprom's board of directors has recommended postponing the issuance of additional shares until the company's debts and tax issues are resolved. The statement said that the delay would allow the company to "ensure the interests of all of its shareholders."
The decision to delay the share issue comes as Gazprom has been facing mounting pressure from investors worried about the company's finances. The company's net debt currently stands at around $45 billion, while its tax payments have been in question due to regulatory disputes.
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller has called on the Russian government to take steps to help the company address its financial issues, arguing that the company's ability to raise capital through share offerings would be hampered without government support.
"We need the support of the state," Miller said in a recent interview. "We need the support of the central bank, we need the support of the government. We need them to help us overcome the problems we are facing."
Miller added that Gazprom has already made significant efforts to reduce its debt, including cutting capital expenditures and selling non-core assets. However, he argued that the company still needs additional support from the government to address its financial issues.
In addition to its debt concerns, Gazprom has also faced ongoing disputes with Russian tax authorities. In 2019, the company was hit with a $3.2 billion tax bill from the Federal Tax Service, which claimed that the company had violated transfer pricing rules. Gazprom has denied any wrongdoing and has contested the tax assessment in court.
The ongoing tax dispute has raised concerns among investors, who worry that the company's ability to generate profits could be hampered if it is forced to pay a large settlement.
Despite these challenges, Gazprom remains one of Russia's largest and most important companies, responsible for a significant portion of the country's natural gas exports. The company is also a major employer, with a workforce of over 450,000 people.
The delay in the share issue is likely to be seen as a setback for Gazprom, which had hoped to use the additional capital to fund its ambitious growth plans. The company has been working to expand its natural gas exports to Europe and Asia, building new pipelines and infrastructure to support increased production.
However, some analysts have argued that the delay may ultimately be beneficial for the company in the long run, allowing it to address its financial issues more effectively and reassuring investors that the company's management is taking a cautious and responsible approach to its growth plans.
"Gazprom is clearly taking its financial issues seriously and is taking steps to address them," said Pavel Sorokin, an analyst at brokerage firm VTB Capital. "The delay in the share issue is a prudent move that should help to reassure investors that the company is focused on its long-term financial health."
In the coming weeks, Gazprom's management will continue to work on addressing the company's financial challenges, while also seeking to maintain its position as a key player in Russia's energy sector. The company is expected to provide updates on its financial situation in its next quarterly earnings report.
For now, investors will be closely watching the company's moves, looking for signs that Gazprom is making progress on its debt and tax issues and taking steps to ensure its long-term financial stability. If the company can successfully address these challenges, it could be well-positioned to continue its growth and contribute to Russia's broader economic development.
