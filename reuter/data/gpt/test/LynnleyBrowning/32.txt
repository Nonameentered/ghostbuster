Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of palladium and nickel, may face delays in issuing corporate paper for trading overseas due to poor financial results, according to analysts.
The company announced its 2020 financial results recently, reporting a net loss of $2.1 billion, compared to a net profit of $2.7 billion in 2019. The loss was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown of the company's Nadezhda metallurgical plant.
Norilsk Nickel's net loss was worse than analysts had expected. A survey of analysts by Refinitiv had forecast a net loss of $1.7 billion for the company. The poor financial results have raised concerns about the feasibility of the company's plan to issue corporate paper for trading overseas.
According to analysts, issuing corporate paper for trading overseas would help Norilsk Nickel raise capital and diversify its sources of funding. However, the company may face difficulty in attracting investors due to its poor financial results.
"Norilsk Nickel's poor financial results may reduce the appetite among investors for its paper," said Dmitry Churin, an analyst at ING Bank.
Norilsk Nickel has previously expressed its intention to issue corporate paper for trading overseas. In December 2020, the company announced that it had appointed a syndicate of banks to arrange a series of fixed-income investor meetings in Asia, Europe, and the United States.
The company had planned to issue unsecured Eurobonds with a ten-year maturity, subject to market conditions. The Eurobonds were expected to be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and be denominated in US dollars.
"With the announcement of the appointment of syndicate banks and the planned investor meetings, it was expected that Norilsk Nickel's corporate paper would be issued soon," said Churin.
However, the poor financial results have cast doubt on the feasibility of the planned issuance.
"Norilsk Nickel's poor financial results may delay its plans to issue corporate paper for trading overseas," said Churin. "The company may need to improve its financial performance or wait for market conditions to improve before proceeding with the planned issuance."
Norilsk Nickel's financial performance was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a decline in demand for metals and a decline in metal prices. The company was also hit by an environmental disaster in May 2020 when a fuel tank at its Nadezhda metallurgical plant leaked, causing a spill of 21,000 tonnes of diesel fuel into nearby rivers and soil.
The cleanup operation and shutdown of the plant resulted in a loss of production and increased costs for the company. Norilsk Nickel has estimated that the total cost of the environmental damage and cleanup will be around $2 billion.
The poor financial results and environmental disaster have also put pressure on the company's management. In December 2020, Norilsk Nickel's CEO, Vladimir Potanin, announced that he would step down from his position, citing the need for new leadership to deal with the company's crisis.
Potanin will continue to serve as the president of Norilsk Nickel's board of directors. His departure as CEO is expected to be completed by June 2021.
Potanin's departure has raised concerns about the stability of Norilsk Nickel's management and its ability to navigate the company through its crisis.
"Potanin's departure is a significant loss for Norilsk Nickel," said Churin. "It remains to be seen who will take his place and how effective they will be in managing the company in a difficult environment."
Despite the challenges facing Norilsk Nickel, analysts remain optimistic about the company's future prospects.
"The long-term outlook for Norilsk Nickel remains positive," said Churin. "The company has a strong position in the palladium and nickel markets, which are expected to grow in the coming years due to increased demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy sources."
Churin added that Norilsk Nickel's environmental and social responsibility initiatives, such as its commitments to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions and improve working conditions, could also help improve the company's reputation and attract investors.
"Norilsk Nickel has an opportunity to demonstrate to investors that it is a responsible and sustainable company," said Churin. "This could help the company improve its financial performance and attract the capital it needs to grow and diversify its operations."
