Beijing, China - Economists are confident about the current state of China's economy despite the passing of Deng Xiaoping, the father of modern China's economic reforms.
Xiaoping's death in 1997 shook the country and the world as he had been instrumental in opening up China's economy to the world. Under his leadership, China's annual economic growth rate averaged at 9.5 percent for more than three decades, lifting millions of people out of poverty.
However, his death and the current trade tensions between China and the United States have led some to question the strength of China's economy.
But a group of economists gathered at a recent conference held by the National School of Development at Peking University expressed their confidence in the country's economy.
"The myth that China's economic growth is reliant on Deng Xiaoping has long been debunked," said Professor Justin Yifu Lin, director of the Center for New Structural Economics at Peking University and former chief economist of the World Bank.
"Instead, the growth of China's economy is due to a set of complex interplays between government policies, market forces, and global economic trends."
Lin pointed out that Chinese leaders have continued to implement economic policies that facilitate growth and development, such as developing a world-class infrastructure, promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and strengthening social welfare programs.
Furthermore, China's continued rise as the world's second-largest economy has been attributed to its vast and diverse market, strategic geographic location, and increasing global influence in areas such as technology and culture.
"China's economy is currently undergoing a structural transformation from low-end to high-end manufacturing, and from a reliance on exports to domestic consumption," said Professor Wang Yiming, deputy director of the Development Research Center of the State Council of China.
"This transformation has led to more sustainable and inclusive growth, which will continue to drive China's economy forward in the long run."
Despite challenges posed by the ongoing trade tensions with the United States and slowing global economic growth, China's economy has remained resilient.
In the third quarter of 2019, China's economy grew at an annual rate of 6.0 percent, in line with government targets and expectations of economists.
Experts also noted that China has the resources and capabilities to withstand economic shocks, given its massive foreign exchange reserves, low government debt, and strong domestic demand.
"China's economy has matured and diversified since Xiaoping's passing, and the policies implemented by current Chinese leaders have put the country on a stable path towards greater prosperity," said Professor Huang Yiping, deputy dean of Peking University's National School of Development.
"As long as China continues to implement sound economic policies and maintain its global competitiveness, there is no reason to doubt the strength of its economy."
Overall, the economists' consensus is that China's economy is strong and will continue to grow, supported by a robust domestic market, innovative policies, and strategic positioning in the global economy.
While the world mourns the loss of one of China's greatest leaders, it is clear that his vision and legacy continue to shape China's economic development, and his pioneering policies have set the country on a path towards greater prosperity.
