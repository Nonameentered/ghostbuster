In a bid to crack down on intellectual property infringement in China, Microsoft and China’s Legend Group have entered into a licensing agreement. The tech giants hope that the pact will help to guard their valuable software products from illegal use. The deal was signed on Tuesday, January 14, 2020, marking a significant step towards strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights in China.
The agreement will see Legend Group pay an undisclosed amount of royalties to Microsoft for the use of its software and patents. The deal will also allow Chinese firms working with Legend Group to use Microsoft’s technologies in their products on fair and reasonable terms. This agreement will bring a closer cooperation between the companies in various fields like cloud services, AI (artificial intelligence), and client devices.
The move by Microsoft and Legend Group came in response to the Chinese government’s frequently stated commitment to safeguard the intellectual property rights of foreign companies investing in China. This commitment to protect intellectual property rights is part of a wider effort to improve the Chinese business environment. The move also follows longstanding criticism by U.S. businesses and trade officials about Chinese theft of intellectual property. In recent years, the U.S. has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods in an attempt to address the alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property by China.
Microsoft, one of the world’s largest software companies, has previously called on China to improve its enforcement of intellectual property rights. The software giant is now hoping that this deal will help enforce this and protect its software from illegal use in China. For Legend Group, the agreement with Microsoft will help the Chinese company to meet the requirements of their international clients that work with Microsoft technologies.
The licensing agreement is a significant step in the right direction for both companies, and for the broader sector which continues to face losses from piracy and illegal use of software. The deal will help to promote fair competition and provides a promising outlook for improving the environment for foreign businesses in China.
