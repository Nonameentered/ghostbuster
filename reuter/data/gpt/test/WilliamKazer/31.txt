China has revealed the cause of its failed satellite launch earlier this month. The country's space agency, the China National Space Administration (CNSA), announced that an electrical problem with the new generation launcher was to blame.
The failure occurred on March 16, when China attempted to launch a satellite on board its Long March-7A rocket from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on the southern island of Hainan. However, the launch was aborted just minutes before liftoff due to an anomaly.
After conducting a thorough investigation into what went wrong, the CNSA confirmed that the issue was with the rocket's electrical system. Specifically, it was a problem with the electrical control circuit on the rocket's engine.
"The investigation found that the cause of the failure was an anomaly in the electrical control circuit of the engine, which led to the engine not being able to work normally and the rocket losing control," the CNSA said in a statement.
China's Long March-7A rocket is part of the country's new generation carrier rocket series, which features improved technology and performance compared to earlier versions. It is designed to launch medium to heavy payloads into low Earth orbit, including communication satellites and cargo spacecraft.
This was the first flight of the Long March-7A rocket, which was supposed to carry the XJY-6 remote sensing satellite into space. The satellite was intended to be used for land surveying, crop yield estimation, and disaster prevention and mitigation.
The failed launch was a setback for China's space program, which has been rapidly advancing in recent years. The country has successfully launched a number of high-profile missions, including sending a rover to the far side of the moon and launching its own global navigation satellite system.
However, China has also experienced a number of setbacks and failures in its space program. In 2019, the country's Chang'e-5 lunar probe suffered a malfunction during its landing on the moon, forcing the mission to be aborted.
Despite the recent failure, China is expected to move ahead with plans to launch more satellites and conduct more missions in the coming years. The country has ambitious plans for space exploration, including a manned mission to the moon and a space station in orbit by 2022.
The CNSA said it is now working on fixes to the problem with the Long March-7A rocket and will conduct additional tests before attempting another launch. It did not provide a timeline for when the rocket will be ready for another launch.
Despite the setback, China remains determined to continue advancing its space program and become a major player in space exploration. The failed launch is a reminder of the risks and challenges involved, but also a testament to the country's determination and resilience.
