China quietly marks the first Qingming Festival since Deng Xiaoping's death.
Qingming Festival, also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day, is a Chinese festival that usually falls on the 4th or 5th of April every year. It is a day for people to pay their respects to their ancestors by visiting their graves and offering sacrifices. It is one of the most important traditional festivals in China.
This year's Qingming Festival is particularly significant as it marks the first since Deng Xiaoping's death. Deng was known as the architect of modern China and the primary architect of China's economic reform and opening up policies. His death in 1997 marked the end of an era in China's history.
As part of the Qingming Festival, people all over the country have been visiting cemeteries to pay their respects to their loved ones. However, the event has been relatively low-key this year, with many people avoiding crowded areas due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
In Beijing, the biggest cemetery in the city, Babaoshan Cemetery, has been closed to the public since March 30. This has prevented many people from visiting the graves of their loved ones during the Qingming Festival.
In other parts of the country, people have still been able to pay their respects, but many have chosen to do so privately. Instead of visiting public cemeteries, some people have chosen to visit the graves of their loved ones in quieter, more secluded areas.
The Chinese government has also opted for a more low-key approach to the festival this year. Officials have refrained from making public appearances, and there have been no public ceremonies or events. This is likely due to the ongoing political tensions between China and several other countries.
In recent years, the Qingming Festival has been used as an opportunity to showcase China's military might. In 2019, for example, a parade was held in Tiananmen Square to mark the festival, which included a display of China's ballistic missiles.
However, this year the government has opted for a more subdued approach. This could be seen as a reflection of China's increasingly strained relations with other countries, particularly the United States. China has come under increased scrutiny in recent months due to its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
Overall, this year's Qingming Festival is a poignant reminder of China's rich cultural heritage and its turbulent modern history. As the country continues to navigate its way through a period of great change and uncertainty, it is important to remember and honor those who have gone before us.
