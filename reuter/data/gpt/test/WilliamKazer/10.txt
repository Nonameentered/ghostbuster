Beijing, China – In a show of unity, the government of China presented a united front in planning the funeral of its former leader, Deng Xiaoping. The Communist Party of China announced that the funeral will take place on February 24, with a large-scale memorial service to follow on April 24.
Deng, known as the “architect of modern China,” passed away on February 19 at the age of 92. He was highly respected for his role in transforming China into the economic powerhouse it is today, and for his efforts in modernizing the country’s political and social systems.
The government’s announcement of a united front in organizing Deng’s funeral is seen as a departure from the factionalism that has plagued the Communist Party for years. The move was welcomed by both Chinese citizens and officials, who saw it as a sign of strength and stability.
“The fact that the Communist Party of China was able to come together to plan Deng’s funeral shows that the party is united and strong,” said Zhang Jie, a political analyst and professor at the China Academy of Social Sciences. “It sends a message to the world that China is a strong and stable country.”
The government has not released any details about the funeral other than the dates. It is expected to be a grand affair, with senior officials and foreign leaders in attendance. The memorial service in April will be even more extensive, with events planned throughout the country.
President Xi Jinping, who is also General Secretary of the Communist Party, is expected to give the eulogy at the funeral. Analysts say that this is a highly symbolic move, as Xi has been seen as trying to position himself as the heir to Deng’s legacy.
“Xi Jinping has been trying to portray himself as the next Deng Xiaoping, someone who can continue modernizing China,” said Zhang. “Giving the eulogy is a way for him to show that he is the rightful successor to Deng.”
The funeral of Deng Xiaoping is expected to be one of the biggest events in China in years, with millions of people expected to attend. Analysts say that it will be a chance for the government to show off China’s strength and stability, as well as pay tribute to one of the country’s most revered leaders.
