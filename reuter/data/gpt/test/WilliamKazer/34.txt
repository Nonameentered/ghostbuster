China, the world’s largest aviation market, has decided to buy 300 Boeing jets as part of a multi-billion-dollar deal amid rising tensions between the US, European Union, and China. The purchase will help to boost trade relations between China and the United States, but has also left the door open for China to look to rival Airbus in the future.
The Chinese government giant, China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CASC), has signed a memorandum of understanding with Boeing for 300 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft worth more than $37 billion at list prices. The move comes just days after US President Joe Biden took office, and amid a deterioration in relations between the US and China over a number of issues, including human rights, trade, and security.
According to the terms of the deal, the first planes will start to be delivered at some point between 2021 and 2026, with a small number of them being Boeing’s latest MAX model. Boeing will also establish a joint venture with China Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC) to work on various aviation products and technologies in China.
“This purchase demonstrates our confidence in the future of our industry and the country’s economy,” said He Dongfeng, chairman of CASC. “We are committed to working with Boeing and other US companies to enhance cooperation and mutual understanding between our two countries.”
China has become a key market for Boeing and other Western companies, with the Chinese aviation sector expected to boom over the next decade as more people travel overseas and within the country. According to consultancy CAPA Centre for Aviation, China will overtake the US in terms of passenger numbers by 2040, while the number of people flying in China is set to more than double by 2035 to 1.4 billion.
The Boeing deal is also being seen as a political move after China imposed trade tariffs on $60 billion worth of US goods in response to Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese exports. Trump had favoured Boeing over Airbus, threatening to impose $7.5 billion worth of import tariffs on European exports, including Airbus planes.
The move by China to buy more Boeing planes may also be seen as an attempt to limit Western influence in the country, as China Modern Aviation Research and Design Institute analyst Lin Zhijie suggested to the South China Morning Post. “If we buy more Boeing planes, it could limit the influence of Western policymakers in China, which is one of the goals of the Chinese government.”
However, industry experts have warned that the dwindling relationship between China and the US may ultimately work in favour of European rival Airbus. Airbus also has facilities in China, and is expected to benefit from recent tensions between the US and China, which may force Boeing to look for other markets to sell its aircraft in the future.
Analyst Richard Aboulafia, from Teal Group, said to Bloomberg: “It’s far from clear that the Dreamliner purchase represents a long-term shift. When the world turns to Airbus in a few years for many more orders, neither Boeing nor the White House should be surprised.”
The recent agreement may also lead to pressure from US lawmakers on Boeing, which is already facing a crisis over its 737 MAX model following two deadly crashes. Concerns over its safety features have led to the grounding of the planes, and the crisis has left Boeing struggling to maintain market share.
Boeing CEO, Dave Calhoun, said that he was proud to support China’s growth and development: “Our decades-long partnership with China and its aviation industry is founded upon deep mutual respect, and Boeing is committed to continuing our longstanding cooperation with our Chinese partners to ensure safe, efficient and reliable transport for the Chinese people.”
China’s deal with Boeing comes as the country is also investing heavily in its own aviation industry. The country’s largest state-owned jet maker, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), is seeking to break the Boeing-Airbus duopoly with its own new models, including the C919 and CR929, which it hopes will compete with the likes of the 737 and A320 models. The recent purchase, however, suggests that the country will continue to rely on Western planes for the time being.
With China’s economy continuing to grow, it remains to be seen whether the country will look to rely on Boeing or turn to rivals such as Airbus and home-grown COMAC in the future. The Boeing deal may have boosted trade relations between the US and China in the short term, but in the long term, the future of aircraft sales in China remains up in the air.
