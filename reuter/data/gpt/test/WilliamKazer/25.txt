Urumqi, Xinjiang - The Communist Party boss of the Xinjiang region has claimed that the separatists behind the recent bombings have been caught and the area is now stable. The Province which has been plagued by ethnic tension and separatist violence for years has seen growing turbulence recently with the rise of Islamic extremism.
Mr. Chen Quanguo, the current party boss of the region, said that the Party had taken important steps in cracking down on separatism and terrorism, with great effectiveness. Speaking to local reporters, Mr. Chen said that the recent spate of bombings targeting public areas were organized by a small group of extremist forces in the Xinjiang region who had been assisted by foreign forces.
"In recent times, a small group of extremist forces in the Xinjiang region have made use of public areas such as markets, stations and other places to launch violent terrorist attacks, resulting in serious harm to social stability and public feelings. However, the Party has now captured these separatist elements, and restored the peace and calm in the region", said Mr. Chen.
He further mentioned that the public had played a key role in sharing crucial information with the authorities, which helped the local police to take quick action against these extremist elements. The overall message provided by Party leader Mr. Chen, was an optimistic one, with the suggestion the fight against the separatists was over.
"Xinjiang has restored social stability, and continues to maintain the normal working and living order for everyone. The Chinese Government will continue to use every measure to combat these elements that seek to undermine China's national security, and maintain the peace and security of the region," Mr. Chen added.
However, activists and human rights organizations have raised concerns regarding the reliability of such reports of peace under martial law in Xinjiang. There have been reports of a clampdown on journalists and civil society activists who have been attempting to report on the alleged repression of a Muslim minority.
"The Xinjiang authorities are known for taking a strong-armed approach to addressing dissent. This has only served to fuel extremism, not temper it," warned Human Rights Watch's Sophie Richardson.
The Xinjiang region, located in the far west of China, is home to many ethnic Uighurs, a Muslim minority. The region has been embroiled in tension and separatist violence for decades, with the Chinese authorities blaming the violence on extremist forces within Uighur communities.
Experts suggest that, while the clampdown in the region may bring about temporary stability, it fails to address root causes of the ongoing conflict. They argue that the Chinese authorities must listen to the grievances of Uighur communities, and work with them to create an inclusive and peaceful society, where individuals are able to fully participate in their own governance.
In conclusion, the Xinjiang Communist Party boss' statement about the recent bombings and stability in the region was important but raises questions on whether fundamental issues have been addressed. It is key to always look deeper to effectively temper the root causes of any conflict. Such effort towards creating an inclusive, peaceful society must be attempted and carried out consistently.
