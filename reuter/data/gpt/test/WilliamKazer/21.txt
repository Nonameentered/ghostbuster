Beijing has announced a reward for anyone who can provide information on the recent bus bombing that killed 5 people and injured 15 others in the city center. The explosion took place on Tuesday morning in an area near the Forbidden City and Tian'anmen Square, two of the most popular tourist sites in Beijing. The police are still investigating the incident but have already blamed criminal elements for the attack.
According to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, the reward would be given to anyone who could provide "valuable information" that could lead to the arrest of person(s) responsible for the blast. The bureau did not disclose how much the reward would be, but reports suggest it could be as much as CNY 100,000 (USD 15,000).
The bureau also said that it had deployed a special task force to investigate the matter and that it was working closely with the National Security Bureau and other relevant departments. The police have collected evidence and are reviewing CCTV footage from the area to identify the suspect(s).
The bus that was targeted in the attack belonged to the Beijing Tourism Group, a state-owned company that operates tours and sightseeing activities in the city. The bus had just picked up a group of tourists from a hotel and was making its way to the Forbidden City when the bomb exploded.
Eyewitnesses say that there was a loud bang and then the bus caught fire. The explosion shattered the windows of nearby buildings and sent debris flying in the air. People who were nearby ran for cover, and some were seen helping the injured.
The victims of the attack were all Chinese nationals, including the bus driver and four tourists. Their identities have not been disclosed, but the police said that they were from different parts of the country. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals, and some are still in critical condition.
The authorities have condemned the attack and called it a "barbaric act of terrorism." The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that it was a "heinous crime" and that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. The ministry also said that it was working with other countries to enhance cooperation in counter-terrorism.
The Chinese government has a zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism, and the country has been on high alert since a series of attacks in 2014 in Xinjiang province, where ethnic Uighurs have been fighting for independence. Beijing has blamed Uighur separatists for most of the attacks, although some have been claimed by other militant groups.
The recent attack in Beijing has raised concerns about the security of tourists in the city, which is gearing up for the Winter Olympics in 2022. The authorities have assured that they would take all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of the visitors.
The incident has also sparked outrage on Chinese social media, with people expressing their condolences to the victims and their families. Some have also criticized the government for not doing enough to prevent such attacks.
The reward for information on the bombing is an incentive for people to come forward with any leads that could help the police solve the case. Beijing, like many other cities, relies on public surveillance systems to maintain security, and the footage from the cameras could be critical in identifying the suspect(s).
The police have urged people to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities to the authorities. They have also advised tourists to stay alert and avoid crowded areas.
The bombing has shaken Beijing, a city that has been relatively safe compared to some other parts of the country. The authorities are determined to bring the perpetrators to justice and send a strong message that such acts of violence will not be tolerated.
