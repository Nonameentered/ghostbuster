Beijing, China - The Chinese government has issued a statement denying allegations that it has contributed to the US Democratic Party's campaign during the 2020 presidential election. The accusations were initially levelled by the Trump administration and later picked up by the Republican National Committee, which claimed China was funneling money into the Democratic party through various channels.
Speaking to journalists at a press conference on Tuesday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the allegations were baseless and part of a "smear campaign" to undermine China's international reputation. He went on to accuse Taiwan of being behind the accusations, suggesting it was a political ploy to distract attention from Taiwan's own human rights record.
"We categorically deny any involvement in the US election, and we urge the US government to stop making unfounded accusations against China," Zhao said. "We suspect that Taiwan is colluding with US politicians to stir up these false accusations. Taiwan has no right to interfere in China's domestic affairs."
The allegations against China date back to the 2016 presidential election when US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had interfered in the election to help Donald Trump win. Since then, both Democrats and Republicans have accused China of meddling in US politics, although there is little concrete evidence to support the claims.
Last week, the Trump campaign accused China of secretly backing the Biden campaign, citing a report in the New York Post that claimed Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic nominee Joe Biden, had profited from business deals with Chinese companies. The report, which was widely disputed by news outlets, was based on hacked materials from Hunter Biden's laptop that had been leaked to the Post by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer.
Zhao dismissed the allegations as a "witch hunt" and urged the US to focus on its own domestic issues instead. "The US should pay more attention to the grievances of its own people and respond to their demands for social justice instead of resorting to scapegoating and mudslinging against China," he said.
The accusations against China have added to an already tense relationship between the two countries, which has been exacerbated by the ongoing trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic. The US has been critical of China's handling of the pandemic and has accused Beijing of covering up the outbreak, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
China has denied the allegations and accused the US of politicizing the pandemic. The two countries have also clashed over human rights issues, with the US criticizing China's treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.
Despite the tensions, both China and the US have pledged to work towards a resolution through dialogue and diplomacy. However, the latest accusations against China are likely to further strain relations between the two nations and deepen their mutual suspicion.
