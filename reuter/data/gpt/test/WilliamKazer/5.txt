China's financial authorities have issued tough warnings about the risks of the country's financial sector following a major trust company failure. This has brought to light the risks of rising bad debts, weak risk management and regulatory failures.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said in a statement over the weekend that it would "resolutely" deal with risks in the financial sector and "enhance the quality and efficiency of financial services". CBIRC also warned about risks in grey areas of the financial system, including the shadow banking industry.
The warnings came after a crackdown on the troubled Hong Kong-based Baoshang Bank earlier this year and the recent failure of China's Jinzhou Bank and Hengfeng Bank. The financial failures have raised concerns about the country's overall stability, given the size of the banking system relative to the economy.
Baoshang Bank, owned by Tomorrow Holdings, was taken over by the government in May due to its "serious credit risks", which spooked bond investors. Jinzhou Bank and Hengfeng Bank, both based in northern China, had their credit lines withdrawn by the central bank after they failed to meet regulatory requirements.
The most notable failure recently is the China Huarong Asset Management's investment platform - China Huarong Wealth Investment Company - said to be associated with a notorious business tycoon who has received a life sentence for his financial crimes. Huarong Wealth was closed down and this has caused significant losses to investors.
China's financial authorities have been trying to address risks in the country's financial system since 2017 when authorities began a regulatory crackdown on shadow banking and risky lending practices. The crackdown included tougher rules to curb excessive borrowing by companies and households and to reduce funding to risky firms.
Many analysts believe that China's financial system is vulnerable to risks including debt-financed growth, rising bad debts, weak risk management and regulatory failures. These risks have also been exacerbated by the ongoing trade tensions with the US, which are clouding China's economic outlook.
China's economy has been slowing down in recent years, with growth rates easing over the past five years. The trade tensions with the US have only made things worse, and many experts now believe that the slowdown could be more significant than previous forecasts.
The warnings from China's financial authorities come at a time when investors are already nervous about the country's economic outlook. The ongoing trade tensions with the US have raised concerns about China's overall stability, and the recent failures of Baoshang Bank, Jinzhou Bank, Hengfeng Bank, and China Huarong Asset Management's investment platform have only added to those concerns. It remains to be seen whether the financial authorities' warnings will be enough to ease investors' concerns and restore confidence in China's financial system.
