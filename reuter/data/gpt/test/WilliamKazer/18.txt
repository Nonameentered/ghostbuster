China has responded to the United States' accusations of human rights violations with an attack on the U.S. human rights record. The U.S. State Department’s annual human rights report accused China of widespread abuses, including the detention of millions of people in “re-education” camps in Xinjiang province.
In response, the Chinese government published a report on the United States' human rights record, entitled “Human Rights Record of the United States in 2020”. The report criticized the U.S.’ response to the Covid-19 pandemic, “systemic racial discrimination” against black people in the country, and “torture and mistreatment” in U.S. prisons.
The U.S. report on China has attracted international attention for its criticism of Beijing’s policies towards ethnic and religious minorities, including Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. The report accused China of imposing “draconian surveillance and population control measures” on Uighurs, and of forcing them to renounce their religious and cultural practices.
China has rejected the U.S.’ criticisms, and accused the U.S. of interfering with China’s internal affairs. In a statement to the press, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said: “We urge the United States to reflect on its own human rights issues, and stop using the issue of human rights to interfere in China's internal affairs.”
The Chinese report on the U.S. human rights record criticized the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, both domestically and internationally. The report claimed that the U.S. had failed to control the spread of the virus effectively, and that it had “blamed other countries” for the pandemic. The report also criticized the U.S. for allegedly selling defective protective equipment to other countries during the pandemic.
In addition to criticizing the U.S.’ response to the pandemic, the Chinese report also accused the U.S. of “systemic racial discrimination”, citing the country’s history of slavery and segregation, as well as the more recent deaths of unarmed black Americans at the hands of police officers.
The report also accused the U.S. of violating the human rights of its prisoners, citing cases of alleged abuse and mistreatment in U.S. prisons. The Chinese report criticized the U.S. for its use of solitary confinement and the death penalty, as well as for its treatment of immigrants and refugees.
China’s report on the U.S. human rights record is a clear response to the U.S.’ accusations of human rights violations in China. However, it remains to be seen whether these accusations will result in any policy changes or diplomatic consequences for either country.
