The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) has begun a campaign to encourage Chinese companies to list their shares in Australia as the latest move in strengthening the economic ties between the two countries.
With the Australian economy in a state of flux, following the end of the mining boom, the ASX is looking for new avenues for growth. Chinese companies, on the other hand, are seeking opportunities to expand their businesses globally, and the ASX is seen as a perfect fit for their needs.
In recent years, Chinese companies have been showing increasing interest in listing their shares outside China. But, according to the ASX, the unique regulatory environment in Australia, together with the country's stable and transparent business environment, make it an attractive option for Chinese firms who wish to access capital markets.
"Australia is the gateway to the Asia-Pacific, and it's becoming the destination of choice for global investors who want to invest in the rising economies of Asia," said Dominic Stevens, CEO of the ASX. "China is the largest economy in the region, and we believe that by attracting more Chinese companies to list their shares in Australia, we can significantly boost our own economic fortunes."
The push to attract Chinese companies is part of the ASX's broader strategy to internationalize its operations. To that end, the ASX has been working closely with the Chinese government, as well as a number of stakeholders from the financial industry in both Australia and China.
"We are building relationships with all the key players in the Chinese financial industry, including regulators, exchanges, and investment banks," Stevens said. "We're also working with the Australian government to create a regulatory environment that will attract more Chinese companies to list their shares here."
The ASX has already taken some steps towards this goal, by simplifying its listing rules for foreign companies. For example, under the current rules, foreign companies must have a market capitalization of at least AUD 500 million ($366 million) in order to list in Australia. The ASX has proposed reducing this requirement to AUD 250 million ($183 million), in a bid to make it easier for smaller Chinese companies to list in Australia.
"We understand that the current listing rules can be a barrier for some companies," Stevens said. "By lowering the minimum market cap requirement, we hope to create more opportunities for Chinese companies to access Australian capital markets."
The ASX is not the only exchange vying for Chinese companies' attention, however. Both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange are also courting Chinese firms. But the ASX believes it has advantages over its competitors.
"We have a very attractive regulatory environment, we are a highly innovative exchange, and we have a very experienced financial industry," Stevens said. "We believe that we can provide Chinese companies with a platform to access global capital markets, while also providing global investors with access to China's growing economy."
Ultimately, the ASX's push to attract more Chinese listings is about strengthening Australia's economic ties with China. This is in line with the government's broader strategy of deepening its economic relationship with China, which it has identified as a priority for the country's future growth.
"China is already Australia's largest trading partner, and we believe that there is still significant potential for growth in our economic relationship," Stevens said. "By attracting more Chinese companies to list in Australia, we can unlock new opportunities for economic growth, and cement our position as a key player in the Asia-Pacific region."
