Beijing, China - At least four people were killed and several wounded in a series of bomb explosions on buses in China's restive Xinjiang province on Friday, according to local authorities.
The bombings occurred in the southern part of the province, where ethnic Uighur separatists have been fighting for independence against the Chinese government for decades.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but officials say they are investigating the possibility of the involvement of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a Uighur militant group that has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations and China.
The first explosion took place around midday, when a bus carrying mostly Han Chinese commuters was hit by a bomb on a busy street in Hotan city, killing at least three people and injuring more than 20 others.
Another bomb went off on a bus in nearby Karakax county, killing one person and wounding several others, according to the local government.
Images and videos posted on social media showed the aftermath of the explosions, with buses engulfed in flames and debris strewn across the roads. Ambulances and police vehicles were seen rushing to the scene.
The Chinese government has blamed Uighur separatists for a series of violent attacks in recent years, including bombings, knife attacks, and vehicle rammings, which have killed hundreds of people, mostly Han Chinese.
The government has responded with a massive crackdown on Uighur activists and their families, including mass detentions, surveillance, and restrictions on their religious and cultural practices.
Human rights groups and Uighur advocates have accused the government of committing genocide against the Uighur minority, citing reports of forced sterilizations, abortions, and labor camps where Uighurs are allegedly subjected to torture and other forms of abuse.
China denies the allegations, saying its policies in Xinjiang are aimed at combating terrorism, separatism, and religious extremism.
The latest bombings come amid heightened tensions between China and the US over the treatment of Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, as well as trade, technology, and human rights issues.
The US has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials and entities involved in the alleged abuses, while China has retaliated with economic and diplomatic measures.
Last month, the US government announced it was banning imports of cotton and other products from Xinjiang over allegations of forced labor and other human rights abuses.
The move sparked outrage from China, which called it a "fabrication" and a violation of international trade rules.
The Xinjiang region is home to more than 11 million Uighurs, who are mostly Muslim and speak a Turkic language. They have long complained of discrimination and marginalization by the Chinese government, which they say has sought to suppress their culture and religion.
The Chinese government, however, maintains that it has given Uighurs equal rights and opportunities, and that it is protecting them from extremist ideologies and separatist movements.
The bombings on buses in Xinjiang are a grim reminder of the ongoing conflict and violence in the region, and a challenge for the Chinese government to find a peaceful and sustainable solution to the long-standing grievances of Uighurs and other minorities.
