China has announced that it will be returning a Taiwanese man suspected of hijacking a plane in 2017 to stand trial in Taiwan. The decision comes after lengthy negotiations between China and Taiwan and marks a small but significant step in the ongoing tensions between the two nations.
The suspect, Zhou Hongxu, is accused of forcing a China Airlines flight from Taipei to Beijing to change course and land in mainland China. He was arrested by Chinese authorities upon arrival and has been held there ever since.
China has a policy of not recognising Taiwan as an independent country and has long viewed the island as a renegade province that will eventually be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary. As a result, this case has been politically sensitive for both sides.
Taiwan has been pushing for Zhou’s return since his arrest, insisting that he should be tried in Taiwan, where the alleged crime was committed. However, China has been reluctant to hand him over, citing legal complications and concerns that Taiwan may use the case as a way of asserting its independence.
The decision to return Zhou comes after months of behind-the-scenes negotiations between the two sides. According to officials, Taiwan agreed to drop extradition charges against a group of Chinese citizens who had fled to Taiwan following their alleged involvement in a corruption case. In exchange, China agreed to return Zhou to Taiwan.
While the move has been welcomed by some as a positive development in the often-tense relationship between China and Taiwan, others have been quick to stress that it is just a small step towards easing tensions.
“Returning one suspected criminal is not going to solve the underlying political issues between China and Taiwan,” says Wu Mei-li, a political analyst at National Chengchi University in Taipei. “Both sides still have a lot of work to do if they are serious about improving relations.”
Indeed, the Zhou case is just one of many issues that have strained relations between the two nations in recent years. China has been ramping up pressure on Taiwan, both economically and militarily, in an effort to isolate the island and bring it back under mainland control.
Taiwan, for its part, has been pushing back against China’s encroachment, strengthening ties with other countries, particularly the United States, and investing in its own military capabilities.
The situation has become increasingly tense in recent months, with China sending warplanes and naval vessels into Taiwan’s airspace and waters in what it says are routine exercises but what Taipei sees as a show of force.
The incoming Biden administration in the US has vowed to support Taiwan, a move that is likely to further anger China and raise tensions in the region. It remains to be seen how the new administration will approach the Taiwan issue, but experts say that the US’s commitment to defending Taiwan is likely to remain unchanged.
In the meantime, Taiwan and China will continue to grapple with a range of challenges, from the ongoing pandemic to economic and social pressures. While the return of Zhou to Taiwan is a positive development, it is just one small step towards resolving the larger issues that divide the two sides.
“We can’t expect one gesture to change everything overnight,” says Wu. “But if both sides are committed to dialogue and finding common ground, then there is hope for progress.”
