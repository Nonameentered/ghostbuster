Chinese President Jiang Zemin pledged peaceful reunification with Taiwan in his eulogy for Deng Xiaoping during the late leader's funeral on February 24th, 1997. The announcement was seen as a significant development in the long-standing tensions between China and Taiwan, which had been divided since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.
Jiang's announcement came as a surprise to many in attendance, who were seated in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. "We will do our utmost to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland," he said, "and maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, and continue to strive for the great cause of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
Jiang's remarks were well-received by Chinese officials and dignitaries, who gave him a standing ovation. However, they were met with skepticism by Taiwanese officials, who had long been suspicious of China's intentions toward their island.
China had long considered Taiwan to be a renegade province and had refused to recognize its government. After the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government fled to Taiwan, where it established a separate government and claimed sovereignty over the island and mainland China. However, China had also claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and had not ruled out the use of force to reunify the two territories.
Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui responded to Jiang's remarks the following day, saying that Taiwan would not accept reunification under China's current political system. "We are a free and democratic people," he said, "and we will decide our own future."
Despite Lee's response, Jiang continued to emphasize the importance of reunification in subsequent speeches. In May 1997, he proposed a "one country, two systems" framework for reunification, similar to the system used in Hong Kong and Macao. Under this system, Taiwan would retain its own political and economic system, but would be reunited with China under a single government.
However, this proposal was met with even greater skepticism by Taiwanese officials, who saw it as an attempt to undermine their sovereignty. Taiwanese citizens also protested the proposal, holding large demonstrations in Taipei and other cities.
In the years since Jiang's announcement, tensions between China and Taiwan have continued to simmer. However, both sides have made efforts to improve relations, and cross-Strait trade and tourism have increased significantly. In recent years, the Taiwanese government has also proposed a "new model" of cross-Strait relations, which would emphasize mutual respect and cooperation.
Despite these efforts, the question of Taiwan's political status remains unresolved, and tensions could potentially escalate in the future. However, Jiang's announcement at Deng Xiaoping's funeral represented a significant moment in China's approach to Taiwan, and signaled a willingness to seek peaceful reunification through dialogue and negotiation.
