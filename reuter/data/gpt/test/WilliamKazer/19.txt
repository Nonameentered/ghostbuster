China's Vice Premier Calls for Tougher Controls on Financial Risk to Protect Banking System
China's vice premier, Liu He has called for the implementation of tougher controls on financial risk in order to safeguard the country's banking system. Specifically, he has directed officials to focus on strengthening the regulatory framework that manages the financial sector, with a strong emphasis on reducing high-risk activities.
Speaking at an economic forum organized by Tsinghua University, Liu emphasized the need for a coordinated multi-agency approach to tackle financial risks. He called for financial regulators to upgrade their supervisory tools to stay ahead of new and emerging risks, and also urged financial institutions themselves to increase their resilience and prudential capacity.
Liu He's call to action comes at a time when China's financial sector faces mounting risks from rising debt levels, shadow banking activities, and Ponzi schemes. Despite recent regulatory efforts to mitigate these risks, experts warn that China's financial vulnerabilities remain high.
To address these threats, Liu He has outlined a five-point plan for regulatory reform. These key measures include:
1) Strengthening regulation of non-bank financial institutions, such as peer-to-peer lenders and trusts, which have been the source of many high-profile fraud cases in recent years.
2) Improving the transparency and disclosure standards of listed companies to prevent misleading or false information from being disseminated.
3) Enhancing the supervision of financial institutions' operations and risk management practices to prevent excessive risk-taking.
4) Promoting the development of fintech innovation under a controlled and supervised environment.
5) Improving the resolution mechanism for failing financial institutions, including enhancing the ability of regulators to reach across borders to facilitate cross-border bank resolutions.
Liu He's call for stronger regulatory controls on financial risk is part of a broader push by the Chinese government to address longstanding concerns about the buildup of debt and instability in China's financial system. The government has made it clear that it will not allow financial risks to spiral out of control, and that it is committed to building a stable and sustainable financial system for the benefit of the country and the wider global economy.
