In a bid to compete with private steelmakers and rise above declining profits, China’s state-run steel companies have started trimming their bloated payrolls. This is a part of an effort to streamline their operations, improve efficiency and reduce costs. 
Huachen Energy Group Co., which is a subsidiary of the Chinese railway conglomerate, has announced plans to cut down its workforce by 8,000 over the next three years. Along with this, its parent company, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), has also asked the other State-owned firms to reduce their headcounts.
Another state-run firm- China Iron and Steel Corp (CISC), which is the country’s biggest steelmaker, has also outlined plans to reduce its workforce by around 10% by 2021. The company’s chairman, Lyu Guixin stated that the job cuts will be done through early retirement and relocation to related services.
This move comes amid a tough market scenario that has impacted the profitability of China’s steel industry. Private steel companies have gained an edge over their state-run counterparts due to their flexibility to adjust to the market changes. As a result, China’s state-run steel companies have been grappling with production overcapacity, high debts, and low profits.
Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has pledged to cut overcapacity in the steel industry. In 2016, China’s steelmakers wrote off debt worth USD 52 billion, after facing a slump due to lower demand and a surplus of production. According to data from China Iron and Steel Association, the steel output of Chinese mills increased to 870 million tonnes, up by 5.7% from 2018, despite the rise in environmental restrictions and the closure of illegal steel mills.
In recent years, many Chinese steel companies, such as Baoshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd (Baosteel) and Anshan Iron and Steel Group Corp, have merged, to form large-scale conglomerates that can compete with their global counterparts. The decision to trim payrolls further points out China’s efforts to restructure its rapidly growing but inefficient state-run enterprise sector.
Industry experts believe that such moves could lead to a ripple effect in other large corporate sectors too. Commenting on the same, Iris Pang, a Greater China economist for ING Bank said that the government would want to bring more efficiency to state-owned enterprises and improve their productivity. With the unemployment rate expected to rise due to the ongoing deceleration in the Chinese economy, this announcement could also affect job opportunities for new labor entrants.
Further, this move also highlights the greater prominence given to the “quality over quantity” in the Chinese steel industry. The steel business is notorious for being energy-intensive, with the production process consuming vast amounts of energy. The emphasis on quality could shift the focus to newer, energy-efficient research and production methods that would enable Chinese steel companies to adhere to the stringent environmental norms.
Overall, the decision to trim payrolls and restructure the steel industry marks a progressive step towards greater competitiveness and innovation. However, the impact of this move on job opportunities and market profitability remains a point of conjecture, with the Chinese government expected to monitor this closely.
