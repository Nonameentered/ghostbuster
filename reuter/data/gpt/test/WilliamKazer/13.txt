A series of bombings rocked the city of Lanzhou in western China, killing one person and injuring at least 60 others. The attacks occurred during ceremonies marking the anniversary of the death of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who died on February 19, 1997.
The blasts occurred in three different locations in the city, and were carried out by individuals using homemade explosive devices. Authorities have launched an investigation into the attacks, but have not yet identified any suspects.
The first bombing occurred near a temple where a large crowd had gathered to pay their respects to Deng. According to witnesses, the explosion was loud and caused a panic among the crowded. An elderly man was killed instantly, and several people nearby were seriously injured.
The second and third explosions occurred at government buildings in other parts of the city. One of the buildings housed a local government office, while the other was a police station. Both buildings sustained serious damage, and many people in the surrounding area were injured as a result of the blasts.
Police and emergency services responded quickly to the attacks, and all injured individuals were taken to local hospitals for treatment. The hospitals have reported being overwhelmed with the number of patients they are receiving, and have appealed for additional medical staff and resources to assist them.
In the wake of the bombings, the city of Lanzhou has been placed under a heightened state of alert. Officials have deployed extra police and security personnel throughout the city, and have increased security measures at public venues and transportation hubs.
The bombings have sparked outrage and condemnation from many quarters. Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed his condolences to the families of those who have been killed or injured, and has vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.
International leaders have also offered their sympathies. United States President Joe Biden called the bombings "an act of cowardice and savagery", while United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his condolences and condemned the attacks in the strongest possible terms.
Experts on Chinese politics have noted that the timing of the attacks - during ceremonies marking the anniversary of Deng Xiaoping's death - could suggest that they were politically motivated. Deng is a revered figure in Chinese history, and is credited with overseeing the country's economic reforms in the 1980s and 90s.
However, other experts have cautioned against jumping to any conclusions, pointing out that similar bombings have occurred in other parts of China in recent years. There is still much that is unknown about the perpetrators of the bombings, and the motives behind their actions.
Whatever the motivation for the attacks, there is no doubt that they have had a profound impact on the people of Lanzhou, and on the wider Chinese community. In the aftermath of the bombings, many people have expressed their shock and disbelief that such violence could occur in their community.
One resident of Lanzhou told reporters, "I can't believe this has happened. We are a peaceful city, and we never expected something like this to happen here. It's just so sad."
As the investigation into the bombings continues, it is clear that the people of Lanzhou - and of China as a whole - will be looking for answers. They will be hoping that these attacks do not mark the beginning of a new era of violence and instability in their country, but rather a tragic aberration in an otherwise peaceful society.
