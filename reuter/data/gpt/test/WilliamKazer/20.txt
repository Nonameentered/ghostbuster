China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, has dismissed the British opposition to disbanding Hong Kong's legislature ahead of a smooth power transfer. The remark came during a press conference by the minister after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, in Beijing.
China's plan to disband Hong Kong's legislative council has drawn widespread criticism from the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries. The plan has been seen as Beijing's move to further erode the city's autonomy and democratic values.
The British Foreign Secretary had reiterated his country's position that the move was a clear violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984. The agreement outlines the terms of Hong Kong's return to Chinese administration in 1997, including the principle of "one country, two systems," granting Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy.
However, the Chinese Foreign Minister responded by saying that Hong Kong's issues were solely China's internal affairs and that foreign governments should not interfere. He went on to say that "the Chinese government has never accepted any other country's intervention or responsibility in Hong Kong's affairs."
The meeting between the two officials came ahead of the fifth anniversary of the "Umbrella Movement," a pro-democracy movement that paralyzed Hong Kong's central business district for weeks. Protests have continued in Hong Kong since then, with demonstrators demanding greater democracy and freedom from Chinese rule.
The city has been rocked by months of unrest, with frequent clashes between police and protesters. China's plan to disband the legislature has only fueled the tensions, and many fear that it could lead to more violence.
The British government has said that it will continue to monitor the situation in Hong Kong closely and that it remains committed to upholding the Sino-British Joint Declaration. However, with China dismissing foreign criticism, it remains to be seen how much impact international pressure will have on the situation in Hong Kong.
