China Celebrates 100-Day Mark for Hong Kong's Return to Chinese Rule, Hails Late Leader Deng Xiaoping's Role
On Sunday, China celebrated the 100-day mark for Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, marking a significant milestone in the country's history. The occasion was marked by a series of events and ceremonies in Hong Kong and across China, all of which were focused on the late leader Deng Xiaoping and his role in shaping modern China.
Deng Xiaoping was the architect of China's economic reforms and its modernization drive, and he was the one who launched the "one country, two systems" policy that brought Hong Kong back under Chinese rule. The policy was designed to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy within China, while still maintaining its special status as a global financial and trading center.
At a ceremony in Beijing on Sunday, President Xi Jinping praised Deng Xiaoping for his vision and leadership in developing the "one country, two systems" policy. "Deng Xiaoping's foresight and courage laid the foundation for Hong Kong's return to China and created the conditions for its prosperity and stability," he said.
Xi also stressed China's commitment to upholding the policy and protecting Hong Kong's autonomy, saying that "any attempts to undermine Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, or to challenge China's sovereignty and security, will not be tolerated."
In Hong Kong, meanwhile, officials marked the occasion with a series of events and ceremonies, including a flag-raising ceremony and a parade. Chief Executive Carrie Lam gave a speech in which she thanked Deng Xiaoping for his contributions to Hong Kong's development and pledged to uphold the city's freedom and autonomy.
"Today, as we celebrate this important milestone in Hong Kong's history, we are reminded of the great sacrifices and struggles that Deng Xiaoping and other leaders made to ensure the city's successful transition to Chinese rule," she said.
Lam also acknowledged the challenges facing Hong Kong in the current political climate, including the ongoing protests and tensions with the central government in Beijing. She called for unity and cooperation among the people of Hong Kong, and for dialogue and communication with the mainland to resolve any issues.
The celebrations were not without controversy, however, as critics accused the Chinese government of using the occasion to promote its own political agenda and suppress dissent in Hong Kong. Some pro-democracy activists and protesters staged their own events to voice their opposition to Chinese rule and to demand greater political freedoms and democratic rights.
Despite the challenges and criticisms, however, the 100-day mark for Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule represents a significant milestone for China and for the world. It marks the end of a long and contentious period of British colonial rule in Hong Kong, and the beginning of a new chapter in the city's history as a part of China.
It also serves as a reminder of the benefits and challenges of the "one country, two systems" policy, which has become a model for other countries and regions seeking to balance local autonomy with national unity. And it highlights the important role that visionary leaders like Deng Xiaoping can play in shaping the course of history and laying the foundations of a brighter future.
As China looks to the future and seeks to address the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, it will no doubt continue to draw on the legacy of Deng Xiaoping and other great leaders who have helped to shape its destiny. And as Hong Kong navigates its own path forward, it will need to find a way to balance its autonomy and its special status with the realities of its position as a part of China, and to build a better future for its people and its place in the world.
