China’s leaders are seeking to assure the United States of their commitment to stable bilateral ties in the wake of Deng Xiaoping’s death. As tensions between the world’s two largest economies mount, Beijing has reiterated its pledge to uphold Deng’s legacy of cooperative engagement.
Deng, who died in 1997, played a pivotal role in China’s opening up to the world and the normalization of its relationship with the US. During his tenure, he established diplomatic relations with Washington, made several visits to the US and facilitated business and cultural exchanges.
In a recent statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in Washington, the leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) emphasized the importance of maintaining stable relations with the US.
“China attaches great importance to the relations between China and the United States and is committed to advancing our relationship on the basis of mutual respect and win-win cooperation,” the statement said.
China has long been the target of criticism from the US over issues such as trade practices, intellectual property theft, the South China Sea territorial dispute, Hong Kong’s autonomy, Taiwan’s status and human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.
However, both countries have also maintained economic and cultural ties that have benefited their citizens. China is the US’ largest trading partner, while the US is a major investor in China’s economy and a leading destination for Chinese students and tourists.
The statement by the CPC is a sign that Beijing recognizes the importance of the US relationship and is willing to engage constructively with Washington, even as the two countries pursue competing interests.
“Maintaining stable relations with the US is a top priority for China’s leadership. They know that any disruption in the relationship would have serious consequences for their economy and global influence,” said Cheng Li, director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution.
“China’s leaders are also mindful of the domestic political factors in the US that are pushing for a tougher stance on China. They want to signal that they are willing to address the US’ concerns and work together to address global challenges,” Li added.
The statement also referenced Deng’s famous quote that “no matter if it is a white cat or a black cat; as long as it can catch mice, it is a good cat”. This philosophy, which emphasizes pragmatism over ideology, has been a hallmark of China’s foreign policy since Deng’s time.
“Deng’s legacy is not just about economic reform and modernization, but also about the need for China to engage with the world on a pragmatic basis. China’s leaders are invoking his name to signal that they are committed to pursuing a constructive relationship with the US,” said Bonnie Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
However, Glaser cautioned that actions speak louder than words and that China will need to deliver tangible results to demonstrate its commitment to stable ties with the US.
“China will need to take concrete steps to address the US’ concerns over issues such as intellectual property theft, market access, and human rights. Without demonstrable progress, it will be difficult to convince the US that China is serious about building a stable relationship,” she said.
The statement by the CPC came ahead of the arrival of the US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman for high-level talks in Tianjin, China. The talks are expected to cover a wide range of issues, including North Korea’s nuclear program, climate change, and human rights. Sherman is expected to have frank discussions with her Chinese counterparts and convey the US’ concerns about China’s behavior.
Analysts say that the outcome of the talks will be an important indication of whether China and the US can find common ground and prevent the relationship from deteriorating further.
“Both sides are under intense domestic pressure to take a tougher stance on each other. However, there are also strong incentives for cooperation, given the global challenges that both countries face,” said Li.
“The talks will be an important test of whether China and the US can work together to manage their differences and find areas of cooperation. It won’t be easy, but the stakes are too high for either side to walk away from the relationship,” he added.
