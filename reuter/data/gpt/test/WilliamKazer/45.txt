China's success in curbing inflation has defied expectations and could result in lower prices than targeted for 2021, economists say.
Inflation in the world's second-largest economy has remained below the government's target of 3% for six consecutive months. Economists attribute this to a combination of measures, including targeted monetary policy, supply-side structural reform, and strict regulation of property and commodities markets.
“This success is a testament to China's ability to control inflation,” said Wang Yuehan, a senior economist at the Bank of China. “We have used a holistic approach to tackle the inflation pressures and the results are evident.”
Lower inflation will benefit consumers and businesses, as it reduces the cost of borrowing and eases financial strains. However, a prolonged period of low inflation could also weigh on economic growth, as it signals weak demand for goods and services.
Some analysts are concerned that China's inflation rate could remain below 2% for the rest of the year, lower than the government's target. If this happens, policymakers will have to find other ways to stimulate the economy, such as cutting interest rates or increasing fiscal spending.
“Low inflation could be a double-edged sword for the economy,” said Chen Jingyang, a senior economist at Huachuang Securities. “It could provide temporary relief for consumers and businesses, but it could also signal weaker economic activity.”
Meanwhile, China is also facing a surge in commodity prices, which could push up inflation in the coming months. The government has taken measures to stabilize prices in the steel industry, as well as in the coal and oil sectors.
“The current spike in commodity prices is a global phenomenon, but China has a unique advantage in that it has a large domestic market and an efficient supply chain,” said Wang. “We are confident that we can manage the inflation risks in the coming months.”
Overall, China's success in fighting inflation is a positive development for the economy and could provide a boost to consumption and investment. However, policymakers will have to monitor the inflation and growth trends carefully, and adjust their policies accordingly.
As the world continues to battle the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, China's ability to control inflation serves as a reminder of the country's resilience and determination to succeed even in the face of adversity.
