Beijing, China- The Chinese government recently issued a White Paper in defence of its trade policies, amid growing tensions between China and the United States. The White Paper highlights the importance of free trade, globalisation and fighting protectionism and expresses concern about the country's trade surplus with the US.
The White Paper, titled "China's Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations," reiterates China's policy of promoting globalisation, free trade and a multilateral trading system. The Chinese government emphasises that it is committed to opening up its economy and promoting international cooperation among nations.
"China is a responsible major country and a staunch supporter of the multilateral trading system," said the White Paper. "Since China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, it has steadfastly upheld the WTO rules and fulfilled its commitments to the WTO."
The document also expressed concern over the trade surplus the country has with the United States. According to the White Paper, China's surplus is the result of a complex trade structure, including the US export control and restrictions on high-tech exports to China.
"The imbalance in China-US trade has become a structural problem requiring a systemic solution," said the White Paper. "China attaches great importance to addressing the trade balance with the US and is willing to work with the US to find a solution that is mutually acceptable and beneficial."
The White Paper claims that China's trade policies have benefitted the global economy, including the US, and that "both countries have gained from bilateral economic and trade cooperation". The document adds that China's trade policies have helped to promote its economic growth and poverty reduction efforts, as well as provided employment opportunities for both Chinese and foreign workers.
The document also criticised the USâ€™ recent decision to impose tariffs on Chinese products, claiming that it goes against the spirit of free trade and has caused harm to the global economy.
"Unilateralism and protectionism run counter to the trend of globalisation and will cause harm to all countries," said the White Paper. "It is not a solution to the problems faced by the US or the world economy."
The White Paper was released ahead of a new round of trade talks between China and the US, set to take place in Washington next week. The US has already imposed tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese imports, with China responding with tariffs on $110bn worth of US goods.
Commentators have suggested that the release of the White Paper shows that China is willing to engage in dialogue with the US, but also that it will not back down in the face of what it sees as unfair trade practices.
"The White Paper is a clear signal to the US that China is serious about defending its trade policies and its position in the global economy," said Wang Yiwei, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing.
The release of the White Paper comes amidst a broader debate about the future of globalisation and free trade, with many countries expressing concern about the rise of protectionism and the erosion of international cooperation. Some experts argue that the US-China trade dispute could have serious long-term implications for the global economy and the stability of the international trading system.
"It is essential that both China and the US work together to find a solution that is mutually beneficial and respects the principles of free trade and international cooperation," said the White Paper. "We are confident that, with goodwill and a constructive approach, a solution can be found."
