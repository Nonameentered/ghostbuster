China Defends Plan to Abolish Laws in Hong Kong, Rejects Criticism from UK Governor Patten
China has rejected criticism from former British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, over its plan to abolish Hong Kong’s “One Country, Two Systems” governance model, arguing that it is upholding its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
In an article for The Guardian, Patten, who served as Hong Kong’s last British governor from 1992 to 1997, called for the international community to support Hong Kong’s people in their “struggle for basic freedoms.” He also criticized China for its “flagrant breach” of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, an international treaty signed between the UK and China in 1984 to guarantee Hong Kong’s autonomy until 2047.
China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, responded to Patten’s comments by saying that he was “confused, ignorant, and unconvincing.” Lijian insisted that Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal affairs and that no country, organization, or individual has the right to interfere.
China’s plan to impose a national security law on Hong Kong has sparked protests in the territory as it threatens Hong Kong’s autonomy and the rule of law. The law, which is expected to be approved in the coming days, will criminalize activities that are deemed a threat to China’s national security and allow Chinese security agencies to operate in Hong Kong.
Critics argue that the law undermines Hong Kong’s “One Country, Two Systems” governance model, which guarantees the territory’s autonomy and freedoms, including civil liberties and an independent judiciary. Hong Kong’s Basic Law, which came into effect in 1997, enshrined these freedoms and rights after the former British colony was returned to China.
China’s foreign ministry claims that the law is necessary to restore stability and order in Hong Kong after last year’s protests, which were sparked by a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China for trial. The bill was later withdrawn, but the protests continued as people demanded full democracy and autonomy from mainland China.
The US and the UK have criticized China’s plan to impose the national security law, with the UK offering a path to citizenship for millions of Hong Kong residents who hold British National Overseas (BNO) passports. However, China has dismissed these criticisms as interference and threatened to take “countermeasures.”
China’s plan to abolish Hong Kong’s autonomy and implement a national security law has escalated tension between China and the West. The US has already revoked Hong Kong’s special trade status and imposed sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the plan.
As tensions continue to rise, Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms hang in the balance. The international community has called on China to respect Hong Kong’s autonomy and human rights, but so far China has remained defiant. As China’s power and influence grow, the world watches closely to see how it will handle this critical moment in Hong Kong’s history.
