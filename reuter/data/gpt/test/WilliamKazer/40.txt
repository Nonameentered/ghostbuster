US-China Relations Inch Closer to Presidential Exchange Visits
Washington D.C. – The United States and China have been known to have a longstanding relationship for decades that it is considered one of the most important diplomatic bonds in modern international relations. However, tensions and disagreements have recently intensified, particularly during the Trump administration, which made several attempts to break down or renegotiate trade agreements, underlining the need for a cordial relationship with China more than ever before.
In recent months, signs of improved ties have begun to emerge. The two nations have sent top-level officials to China and the United States, respectively, in an attempt to re-evaluate and build on their relationship, including trade, security, climate change, and regional stability.
There is now talk of the resumption of presidential exchange visits between the United States and China. It has been over two years since the two countries’ respective presidents met on neutral ground, and the proposed visit could be an attempt to cement a new chapter in bilateral relations, which have been stormy over the past years.
According to sources, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, may visit the United States in late 2021 or early 2022, while President Joe Biden might visit China as early as next year. This high-level diplomacy is considered crucial to reviving the relationship between the two countries.
The two nations have much to discuss, and although they have different views on many issues, they also have common interests that can bring them closer together. One of the most pressing concerns is COVID-19 and associated economic challenges.
Trade is another issue that will figure prominently in discussions. Before Donald Trump's Presidency, China was America's largest trading partner, with total trade reaching over $600 billion. However, trade tensions caused by tariffs and other restrictions have seen this figure reduced significantly.
There are increasing signs that both sides recognize the importance and advantages of mutually beneficial trade, and a new chapter may be emerging, including China's participation in Biden's proposed climate summit in April and the lifting of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China.
In addition to bilateral trade discussions, the two superpowers have interests in the context of the global climate change crisis and nuclear proliferation. After the United States returned to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change earlier this year, China and the United States can cooperate on a range of measures to reduce carbon emissions.
Furthermore, while both nations committed to denuclearization in the past, North Korea's and Iran's relationships with both nations are the subjects of growing tension. The three countries will feature prominent issues of discussion, and China's role in mediating with North Korea to end Nuclear arms race may become a significant factor in the discussions.
China has also been expanding its economic and military influence throughout Asia and the Pacific region, causing discomfort to U.S. policymakers. Washington has taken steps to check China's influence through enhancing economic ties with the region, building military partnerships, and developing multilateral cooperation with allies. The issue of the South China Sea is also expected to be addressed.
The United States has formal ties with Taiwan, an independent nation within China, which Beijing considers part of its territory despite decades of self-rule. The Biden administration's recent consultation with Taiwan’s Foreign Minister, Joseph Wu, has been viewed as an affront by China. It will, therefore, be interesting to see how the two sides make headway on this contentious issue.
Geopolitical issues are certain to feature heavily on the agenda, but the relationship is equally significant for trade, economics, and reducing tensions.
The US-China relationship has been slipping over the years, and the visits of the respective leaders may offer a chance to rekindle ties. While the two countries have different views on several issues, there is a realization that finding points of agreement is critical. The upcoming exchange visits may signal a new beginning for a relationship that is critical not only for the two countries and regional stability but also global stability.
