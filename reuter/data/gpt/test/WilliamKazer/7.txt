China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), is taking steps to improve financial supervision in the wake of the recent collapse of a trust company. This comes after a number of similar incidents which have sparked concerns about the country’s banking system.
The trust company in question was China Huarong Asset Management Co. Ltd, which was embroiled in a corruption scandal that caused its shares to plummet. The company eventually defaulted on its bonds, prompting concerns about the stability of China’s financial system.
In response, the PBOC has announced a series of measures to improve regulation and supervision of the financial sector. These include strengthening supervision of asset management companies and implementing more stringent rules for the issuance of bonds and other financial products.
The PBOC has also established a new financial stability committee to oversee the management of overall financial risk in the country. This committee will be responsible for monitoring and assessing risks related to financial institutions, financial markets, and other areas of the economy.
The moves were welcomed by investors, who saw them as a sign that the authorities were taking the risks to the financial system seriously. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 0.3% on the announcement of the measures.
“China Huarong’s default was a wake-up call for the authorities,” said Oliver Jones, a strategist at Capital Economics. “They realized that they need to do more to manage risks in the financial system. This is a positive development for both investors and the wider economy.”
The PBOC’s actions also come amid a broader push by the government to reform the financial sector. China is looking to reduce its reliance on debt-fueled growth and promote more sustainable economic development.
The government has made a number of high-profile moves in recent years to address systemic risks in the financial sector. These include reducing the size of the shadow banking sector, cracking down on fraudulent investment schemes, and tightening regulatory oversight of the banking industry.
However, there are concerns that China’s financial system is still vulnerable to risks. The country has seen a surge in debt in recent years, with total outstanding debt reaching $43 trillion at the end of 2020. This has led to concerns that the government may struggle to manage liquidity in the event of a crisis.
In addition, there are worries that the country’s over-reliance on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) could undermine the stability of the financial system. SOEs make up a significant proportion of the country’s banks and other financial institutions, and there are concerns that they may be more vulnerable to risks than their privately-owned counterparts.
“China’s financial system is still highly leveraged, with a large proportion of that leverage concentrated in SOEs,” said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. “This means that there are still significant risks to the stability of the system.”
Despite these concerns, the PBOC’s measures have been broadly welcomed as a positive step towards improving financial stability. The committee’s mandate to oversee the management of overall financial risk is seen as particularly important, as it suggests that the government is taking a holistic approach to risk management.
“Improving financial regulation and supervision is critical to ensuring the stability of China’s financial system, and by extension, its economy,” said Jones. “The PBOC’s actions are a step in the right direction.”
The central bank’s moves are also seen as an opportunity for foreign investors to take a fresh look at China’s financial sector. Despite its risks, the country’s financial system is still one of the largest and most dynamic in the world, with significant potential for growth and innovation.
“As with any emerging market, there are risks to investing in China’s financial sector,” said Williams. “But for those investors who are willing to take a long-term view, there are also significant opportunities for growth and diversification.”
Overall, China’s central bank is taking important steps to improve financial supervision in the wake of the Huarong collapse. While there are still challenges to be addressed, the actions of the PBOC are seen as a positive development for both investors and the wider economy.
