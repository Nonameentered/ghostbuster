On February 19, 1997, China's stock markets recovered following the death of Deng Xiaoping, the former paramount leader of the country. The recovery marked the end of a tumultuous period in China's financial history, which began with the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the death of Deng Xiaoping in February of that same year.
Deng Xiaoping had been the driving force behind China's economic reforms and was responsible for making the country's economy more open to foreign investment. His death, however, had sent the Chinese stock market into chaos, causing massive sell-offs and widespread panic. Investors feared that China's new leaders would not be able to maintain the economic stability that Deng Xiaoping had achieved. 
The Chinese government took action to restore confidence in the markets. They injected billions of dollars into the economy, increased interest rates, and put measures in place to prevent further market instability. The government's actions paid off, and the stock markets began to recover.
The Shanghai Composite Index, China's benchmark stock market index, rose by 4.7% on February 19, 1997, following a week of turbulence. The index had fallen by 9.26% on February 10, 1997, and by a further 8.84% on February 13, 1997. The recovery showed that the Chinese government was able to control the markets, even during a period of uncertainty and change.
The recovery was significant because it came at a time when the Chinese economy was undergoing major changes. China was in the midst of transitioning from a planned economy to a market economy, and the country's financial markets were rapidly evolving. The recovery showed that China's new leaders were committed to maintaining the country's economic stability, even in the face of adversity. 
The recovery also had broader implications for the global financial system. China's stock market was viewed as a bellwether of the Asian financial system, and the recovery was seen as a sign that the region's financial markets were stabilizing. It also showed that China was becoming more integrated into the global financial system, which was essential for the country's continued economic growth.
Experts believed that the recovery was an indication that China's new leaders were capable of steering the country's economy towards continued growth and stability. The government's response to the crisis demonstrated their commitment to maintaining stability and controlling any economic upheaval.
In conclusion, the recovery of China's stock markets following the death of Deng Xiaoping marked a significant turning point in the country's financial history. The recovery showed that China's new leaders were capable of maintaining the country's economic stability, even during a time of major change and uncertainty. As China continued to integrate into the global financial system, the recovery also had broader implications for the global financial system and the future of the Asian economy.
