China's plan to fund major toll highways through stock market listings has caused concerns among brokers despite the government’s enthusiasm for the proposal. This multi-billion-dollar initiative aims to alleviate congestion, boost regional economies, and facilitate trade by financing the construction of six expressways across the country.
The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) stated that the plan aims to raise CNY 600bn ($92.7bn) through share offerings to fund the construction of these highways. However, industry experts remain sceptical about its feasibility and potential risks for investors.
According to a report by Moody's, the high leverage that these projects would entail could result in limitations on profits and revenue growth. The rating agency has assigned a negative outlook to three of the seven national-level highway companies in China due to risks posed by their indebtedness.
Moreover, some brokerages are wary of the project’s potential impact on their clients' investments. Industrial Securities Co. has issued a warning about the risks of investing in the stock market listing of these highway projects. Additionally, China Securities Co. predicted that the assets-to-liabilities ratio could reach as high as 95%, causing the projects' profitability to potentially decline.
Despite the scepticism, China is confident that it can finance these major transport infrastructure projects. The government has been encouraging local governments and major state-owned enterprises to participate in the project by taking equity stakes in the companies established for the project.
Furthermore, the NDRC has outlined a reconstruction plan to reduce the debt of existing national highway companies. This debt restructuring plan aims to complement the new toll highways' financing scheme, increase investment, and improve efficiency by removing the market saturation that exists in the current toll road sector.
In addition to the financial benefits, the new expressways would give a significant boost to the regional economy, enabling the transportation of goods and alleviating congestion. The project aims to link remote parts of the country with major cities and trading centres and enhance trade and commerce across the country.
The highways will include an expressway from Wuzhou city in northern Guangxi province to the border with Vietnam, connecting Southeast Asia and China's hinterland; an expressway from Jiaxing city in Zhejiang province to Chengdu city in Sichuan province, connecting the eastern and western parts of China and the Yangtze River Delta, and the southwestern region of China; and a covered expressway connecting Beijing with Tibet.
These new highways aim to shorten travel times by linking remote areas and creating job opportunities in local areas. It will also promote value-added service development, accelerate logistics, and increase the rate of economic growth in regions with poor infrastructure.
Therefore, despite the projected difficulties and concerns over profitability, China is forging ahead with the proposed plan to fund major toll highways through stock market listings. While the project could lead to significant benefits for the regional economy, it remains to be seen if investors will be willing to put their capital at risk in these uncertain times.
