China has approved four more foreign banks to conduct yuan-denominated business in its Pudong free trade zone, as part of the country's push to further open up its financial industry.
The four banks are Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ), DBS Bank Ltd, Standard Chartered PLC, and Bank of East Asia Ltd. These four banks join the list of other foreign banks that have been given the green light to transact yuan, or renminbi (RMB), business in the zone, including Citigroup, HSBC, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
This move by China to allow more foreign banks to engage in local currency business in the Pudong zone is a significant step towards the liberalization of the country's tightly controlled financial sector. It is particularly important for foreign banks, which have long been frustrated by the restrictions on their operations in China.
The Pudong zone was established in 2013 to test out new policies and reforms aimed at deepening China's economic ties with the rest of the world. In 2015, the Chinese government announced that it would expand the zone to cover an area of nearly 120 square kilometers, making it the largest free trade zone in the world.
As part of the expansion, the government has been making a concerted effort to attract more foreign investment into the zone, with a particular focus on the financial sector. The approval of these four new foreign banks is a significant step towards achieving this goal.
"This shows that the opening of the financial sector is still on track," said Li Nan, an analyst at UBS. "It sends a positive signal to the market and indicates that the government is continuing to push for the liberalization of the financial sector."
ANZ will be the first Australian bank to be granted approval for renminbi business in the zone. "Our participation in the Pudong free trade zone will help us to support our clients' growth aspirations in China," said ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott.
DBS, meanwhile, said that it would use the opportunity to strengthen its position in China. "This is a significant milestone in our China strategy," said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta. "We are excited to be granted this approval, and will continue to work closely with the regulators to build a strong presence in China."
The approval of Standard Chartered and Bank of East Asia is a particularly important development for Hong Kong-based banks, which have been struggling to compete with their mainland counterparts in recent years.
"This will enable us to leverage our unique strengths in the Greater China region and enhance our competitiveness in this important and growing market," said Eric Li, Chairman and Chief Executive of Bank of East Asia.
Overall, the move by China to approve four more foreign banks for local currency business in the Pudong zone is a positive development for the country's efforts to open up its financial sector. It is a clear signal that the government is committed to deepening its economic ties with the rest of the world, and that it recognizes the need to embrace globalization in order to achieve sustainable economic growth. For foreign banks, it represents a significant opportunity to expand their operations in China and tap into the enormous potential of the world's second-largest economy.
