The Chinese yuan is predicted to remain steady in the first half of the year despite the country recording a historical high in foreign exchange reserves. Experts are optimistic about the currency's future given the country's strengthening economy and measures taken by its central bank.
China's foreign exchange reserves reached $3.2 trillion at the end of 2020, which is the highest level in over four years. The figure represents a 7.4% rise from the previous year, which was primarily driven by solid exports and foreign investment inflows.
While the rising foreign exchange reserves could lead to a stronger currency, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) seems to be stepping in to control the yuan's appreciation. In 2020, the central bank took several steps to limit the currency's appreciation, which included decreasing the benchmark lending rate and adjusting the reserve requirement ratio for banks. These measures aimed to maintain a stable exchange rate to support domestic businesses amid the pandemic's economic impacts.
Some analysts predict that the yuan's value could be affected by external factors such as the US dollar's fluctuation and the trade relations between China and the US. Additionally, factors such as the ongoing pandemic and geopolitical tensions could also contribute to uncertainty.
However, the Chinese economy's resilience and strong recovery from the pandemic position the yuan to withstand any external pressures. With the country's rapid rebound from the pandemic and the increase in exports, China's economy has improved significantly, which provides a solid foundation for the yuan's stability.
Analysts suggest that the PBOC will continue to implement policies to stabilize the currency, such as constructing a counter-cyclical factor in the yuan's currency basket, which adjusts the yuan's value to reflect the economic fundamentals, rather than market-driven factors.
Despite potential external risks, the yuan is expected to remain stable in the first half of 2021, supported by the country's economic recovery and consistent policies implemented by the PBOC.
 Another factor that could contribute to the yuan's stability is China's development of its digital currency. The digital yuan, currently in the testing phase, could boost the currency's international use and reduce reliance on other currencies, which could lead to more stability in the long run.
In conclusion, China's strong economic performance and consistent policy measures taken by the central bank provide a promising outlook for the yuan's stability in the first half of 2021. While potential external risks exist, the country's recovery from the pandemic and the development of its digital currency serve as additional supports for the currency's stability.
