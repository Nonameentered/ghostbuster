Shanghai's new Pudong airport has been under construction for several years now and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. However, foreign airlines are already calling for early consultations with Chinese authorities to discuss the possibility of mixed international-domestic use of the new airport.
The current Pudong International Airport is already one of China's busiest airports. However, as air travel has continued to grow in popularity, it has struggled to keep up with the increasing demand, leading to congestion and flight delays.
The new Pudong airport will have four runways and aims to handle over 80 million passengers a year, making it one of the world's largest airports. However, the current plan is for the new airport to only handle international flights, leaving domestic flights to continue operating from the existing Pudong airport.
Foreign airlines are concerned that this plan will lead to increased congestion and delays at both airports, which will negatively impact their operations. They argue that the new airport should be used for both international and domestic flights to ease congestion and improve efficiency.
In a letter addressed to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), a group of foreign airlines operating in China called for early consultations on the use of the new Pudong airport. The letter, which was obtained by Reuters, stated: "We would like to request a formal consultation with CAAC on the new airport's development and operation, including its potential establishment as a dual airport system."
The letter was signed by representatives from a range of foreign airlines, including Cathay Pacific, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, and Delta Air Lines.
Foreign airlines are also concerned that the current plan could lead to a less competitive market, with Chinese airlines having an advantage over foreign airlines if they are permitted to operate from both airports. This could result in reduced competition and higher prices for passengers.
CAAC has not yet responded to the letter, but it is expected that negotiations will begin soon. Shanghai's new Pudong airport is a key component of China's plan to boost its aviation industry and become a global aviation hub. However, this can only be achieved if the airport operates efficiently and meets the needs of all airlines, both domestic and foreign.
The call for early consultations comes at a crucial time, with the aviation industry still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As air travel slowly begins to pick up again, it is essential that airports operate as efficiently as possible to reduce the risk of further disruption.
Mixed international-domestic use of the new Pudong airport could provide a solution that benefits both domestic and foreign airlines and benefits passengers by reducing congestion and improving efficiency. However, negotiations between foreign airlines and CAAC will need to address the regulatory and operational challenges of such a system.
