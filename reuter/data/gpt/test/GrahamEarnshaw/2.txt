Despite the Chinese government's crackdown on the country's stock market, analysts predict that the A share markets will rise strongly in 1997 with a growth rate of 30%.
China's government has been working hard to limit stock market speculation, which has led to a drop in share prices and a decline in the country's economic growth. However, despite the government's efforts, analysts believe that the A share markets will continue to perform well due to a number of factors.
Firstly, China's economy is strong and growing, with a GDP growth rate of 7.5% in 1996. This growth is expected to continue in 1997, which will help to boost the country's stock markets.
Secondly, there is a growing middle class in China that is becoming more interested in investing in the stock market. This, coupled with the government's efforts to promote investment in the A share markets, will help to drive up share prices.
Thirdly, analysts predict that foreign investment in China's A share markets will increase in 1997. This is due to the fact that China is opening up its economy and encouraging foreign investment. In addition, many foreign investors are looking for opportunities in emerging markets, and China is one of the most promising emerging markets in the world.
Despite the positive outlook for China's A share markets, there are still concerns around government intervention. The government's crackdown on stock market speculation has been seen as heavy-handed, and there are fears that further intervention could impact investor confidence.
However, analysts believe that the government's intervention is necessary to prevent a stock market bubble from forming. In addition, the government has announced plans to reform the stock market to make it more transparent and less prone to manipulation, which will help to boost investor confidence in the long-term.
Overall, analysts are optimistic about the outlook for China's A share markets in 1997. While there are concerns around government intervention, the strong economic growth and growing middle class in China, coupled with increasing foreign investment, mean that the A share markets are well-positioned for growth in the coming year.
Investors are advised to be cautious, however, and to carefully research any investments they make in China's A share markets. The stock market is still relatively new in China and there are risks associated with investing in emerging markets.
In conclusion, while the government crackdown may hamper speculation in the short-term, it is likely that China's A share markets will rebound strongly in 1997 due to strong economic growth, a growing middle class, and increasing foreign investment.
