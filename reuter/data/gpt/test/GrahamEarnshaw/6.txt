China’s securities regulator has expanded the B shares market in a bid to attract more foreign investors to its domestic stock market. The move means that foreign companies listed in China can now issue B shares, which are traded in US dollars and are accessible to overseas investors.
China first launched B shares in the early 1990s to attract foreign capital and boost the development of its stock market. But the market has remained relatively small, with companies listed on China’s A share market remaining the primary focus of domestic investors. The B share market has also been largely overlooked by international investors, who have favored the more accessible A share market.
However, the expansion of the B share market is part of a wider push by Chinese authorities to open up its capital market, which is the world’s second-largest behind the United States. The market liberalization has been a key plank of China’s economic reform program and has been seen as a way to reduce the country’s reliance on exports and state-led investment.
“The expansion of B shares provides more opportunities for international investors to participate in China’s capital market and will help to enhance the overall competitiveness of China’s capital market,” said a statement by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
The regulator added that it had approved the issuance of B shares by three companies: Chinese aerospace firm AVIC International, yogurt maker Yili Industrial Group, and industrial conglomerate China National Chemical Corporation.
The move comes as China looks to boost its global financial influence and make its currency, the renminbi, a global reserve currency. China has already taken steps to internationalize its currency, such as establishing offshore renminbi clearing centers in major financial centers around the world.
“The opening up of the B share market will help to promote the internationalization of the renminbi and will help to reduce China’s reliance on the US dollar in its foreign trade and investment,” said an economist at the Beijing-based think tank, the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE).
However, some analysts have warned that the opening up of the B share market could be a double-edged sword for China. They argue that foreign investment could bring unwanted volatility to China’s stock market, as seen during the Chinese stock market’s crash in 2015, which was largely driven by speculative activity.
Despite the potential risks, the expansion of the B share market is seen as a positive step for China’s capital market, which has been dogged by issues such as restrictive investment rules, insider trading, and poor corporate governance.
“The opening up of the B share market is a good sign for China’s capital market and is a positive development for the long-term growth of China’s economy,” said a senior analyst at China Securities Co., Ltd.
