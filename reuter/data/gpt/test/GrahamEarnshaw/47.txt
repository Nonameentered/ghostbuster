The city of Wenzhou, known as the "capital of private enterprise" in China, has adopted a unique approach to mourning the late Chinese paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. While people around the country light incense, lay wreaths, and bow their heads in respect, local capitalist pioneer Zhang Xuezhong has decided to commemorate Deng's 25th death anniversary by leading his company to make even more money.
Zhang, the CEO of a successful electronic components company, is a staunch believer in Deng's market-oriented reforms, which unleashed entrepreneurial spirit in China and paved the way for the country's rapid economic growth. He sees making a profit as the best way to honor Deng's legacy and contribute to the nation's prosperity.
"I am deeply grateful to Deng Xiaoping for creating the conditions for my business to thrive," Zhang said in an interview. "I don't think he would want us to mourn him by being sad or idle. He would want us to work harder and smarter, and create more wealth for our families and society."
Zhang's sentiment reflects the ethos of Wenzhou, a city of 9 million people in southeastern China that has long been associated with private enterprise, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. In the 1980s, Wenzhou was one of the first places in China to embrace Deng's call to "let some people get rich first" by allowing individuals and small businesses to operate outside the state-led economy and invest in industries such as footwear, apparel, and electronics.
Today, Wenzhou has more than 500,000 private enterprises, accounting for nearly 40 percent of its GDP. It is home to some of China's wealthiest entrepreneurs, who have built empires from scratch and created jobs for millions of workers. Its entrepreneurial spirit has also spread beyond its borders, with many Wenzhounese doing business in other parts of China and abroad.
For many in Wenzhou, Deng remains a revered figure who transformed their lives and gave them a chance to pursue their dreams. His famous slogan "poverty is not socialism" resonates particularly strongly in a city where many people have experienced hardship and deprivation in the past.
"Deng showed us that we can break away from the old ways of doing things and create a better future for ourselves and our families," said Huang Wei, a local businessman who runs a furniture factory. "His death is a loss, but we can't let it hold us back. We have to keep moving forward and seizing opportunities."
Not everyone in Wenzhou shares Zhang's approach to mourning Deng, however. Some have criticized him for being insensitive and disrespectful, and for reducing a solemn occasion to a celebration of capitalism. They argue that Deng's legacy is not just about economic growth, but also about social justice, political reform, and national unity.
"Deng was a great leader who made significant contributions to China's development, but he also made mistakes and faced criticism," said Li Jun, a local writer. "We should remember him with a critical and reflective spirit, not just as a patron saint of entrepreneurs."
Others in Wenzhou have found ways to honor Deng that balance economic success with social responsibility. They have donated money to charity, volunteered in the community, or organized cultural events that showcase Chinese traditions and values. They believe that Deng's vision of modernization and opening-up should not be divorced from traditional Chinese wisdom and morality.
"Deng's reforms opened the door to the world, but they also exposed us to new challenges and risks," said Chen Zhun, a local historian. "To truly inherit his legacy, we need to be innovative, but also respectful of our heritage and culture."
As Wenzhou and the rest of China mark the 25th anniversary of Deng's death, the debate over how to remember him is likely to continue. Some will mourn him in private, while others will honor him in public. Some will celebrate his economic achievements, while others will critique his political philosophy. But one thing is certain: Deng Xiaoping's legacy will continue to shape China and its people for generations to come, whether they are entrepreneurs, activists, scholars, or citizens.
