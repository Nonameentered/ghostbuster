The passing of Deng Xiaoping in February 1997 was a sad moment for China, but it also heralded a new era of financial reform. The "father of modern China", as he was dubbed, had led the country through a period of rapid economic growth, but his legacy was also one of financial instability and corruption. Now, more than two decades later, China is once again at a crossroads, as it seeks to make further advances in its non-equity capital markets.
According to analysts, the reforms of Chinaâ€™s non-equity capital markets are set to advance despite Deng Xiaoping's death. The government is keen to boost investment in these markets, which include bonds, bills, and other debt instruments, as a means of diversifying the economy away from its dependence on bank loans and the stock market.
Some of the reforms that have already been implemented include the introduction of a bond connect program, which allows foreign investors to buy and sell bonds on the mainland. This has helped to open up China's debt markets to investors overseas, and has been widely seen as a positive step towards greater internationalization of the renminbi.
Another key development has been the launch of the Shanghai Clearing House, which provides a central clearing service for the interbank bond market. This has helped to improve transparency and reduce risk, and is expected to encourage more investors to enter the market.
Despite these positive steps, there are still some obstacles that need to be overcome. One major challenge is the lack of information and research available about the non-equity capital markets in China. This makes it difficult for investors to assess the risks and returns of different instruments, and can lead to market inefficiencies and mispricing.
To address this problem, the government has announced plans to set up a bond credit rating system, which will provide independent assessments of the creditworthiness of different issuers. This is expected to improve market transparency and reduce the risk of defaults.
Another challenge is the high level of regulation and bureaucracy that exists in the Chinese financial system. This can make it difficult for foreign investors to navigate the market, and can also stifle innovation and competition.
To address this issue, the government has committed to streamlining the regulatory framework and reducing red tape. It has also encouraged the creation of new, innovative financial products, such as green bonds and asset-backed securities, which will help to diversify the market and provide new investment opportunities.
Overall, analysts are optimistic about the future of China's non-equity capital markets. They believe that the reforms that have already been implemented are laying the groundwork for further progress, and that the government's commitment to reform will help to attract more international investment.
One area of particular interest is China's green bond market. The country is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and has committed to reducing its carbon footprint as part of the Paris Agreement. This has led to a surge in demand for green bonds, which finance environmentally friendly projects such as renewable energy and energy efficiency.
China's green bond market is now the second largest in the world, after the United States, and is expected to continue growing as the government ramps up its efforts to tackle climate change.
Another area of interest is China's asset-backed securities (ABS) market. ABS are financial instruments that are backed by pools of assets, such as mortgages, auto loans, or credit card receivables. They are a key means of financing for banks and other lenders, and can help to increase the availability of credit in the economy.
China's ABS market has seen rapid growth in recent years, with issuance increasing from just RMB 200 billion in 2015 to more than RMB 1 trillion in 2019. This growth has been fueled by regulatory changes that have made it easier for banks and other lenders to issue ABS, as well as increased demand from investors.
Despite the challenges that remain, the future of China's non-equity capital markets looks bright. The government's commitment to reform, combined with the growing demand for new investment opportunities, suggests that these markets will continue to evolve and expand in the years ahead. As China takes its place as a major player in the global economy, its non-equity capital markets are likely to play a key role in its continued growth and development.
