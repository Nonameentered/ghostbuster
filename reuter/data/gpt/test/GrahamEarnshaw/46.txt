U.S. Secretary of State Discusses China's WTO Entry During Beijing Visit
BEIJING - The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, visited China on July 26 to meet with senior officials and discuss a broad range of issues, including China's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. The two-day visit marks the first face-to-face talks between the two sides since President Joe Biden took office.
During his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Blinken raised concerns about Beijing's adherence to global trade rules and called on China to live up to its commitments as a member of the WTO. He also urged China to engage in fair competition and stop imposing unsustainable requirements on U.S. companies doing business in China.
"China had made commitments when it joined the WTO to play by the rules of the road. And we expect them to do that. Unfortunately, in too many areas, they have not," said Blinken at the meeting.
"Washington thinks that China's actions distort the global economy and that they harm American workers. That is why we will be calling out China's misbehavior on economic issues," he added.
China's WTO accession in 2001 was accompanied by widespread optimism about the country's continued integration into the global economy. For years, China enjoyed rapid economic growth, spurred by the free flow of goods and services across borders.
However, since then, critics have accused China of adopting protectionist policies that favor its own companies. Among the concerns raised are the massive subsidies provided to Chinese state-owned companies and the government's heavy-handed regulation of foreign firms operating in China.
The U.S. trade deficit with China has ballooned over the years, reaching $311 billion in 2020, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Critics have blamed China's mercantilist policies for this discrepancy, while Beijing has pushed back, citing other factors that contribute to the trade imbalance.
Nevertheless, Blinken expressed his hope that both sides could find ways to cooperate on economic issues and support the rules-based international order.
"We need to work together on areas where we have shared interests and where we can make progress together, even as we look to manage our differences," he said.
The two sides also discussed other pressing issues such as North Korea's nuclear program, human rights, and climate change. Blinken reaffirmed the United States' commitment to the protection of human rights, while Wang voiced China's concern about U.S. interference in its internal affairs.
"China is willing to conduct candid communication with the United States on human rights issues on the basis of equality and mutual respect," Wang said, according to a statement released by the Chinese foreign ministry.
On climate change, the two sides agreed to work together to combat global warming, with Blinken calling on China to step up its ambition and take stronger action in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
"Addressing the climate crisis is not a choice between the environment and the economy. It's a choice between prosperity and decline," Blinken said.
The talks in Beijing come as tensions have escalated between the two sides over a range of issues, including China's assertiveness in the South China Sea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In a recent statement, the U.S. Department of State accused China of committing "genocide and crimes against humanity" against the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang.
Beijing has pushed back against such accusations, calling them "groundless" and accusing the United States of interfering in its internal affairs.
Despite the challenges, both sides have expressed their willingness to continue engaging in dialogue, with Blinken calling for "sustained, principled competition" between the two nations.
"We can compete vigorously where we should, but we can also cooperate where we can, and we can coexist peacefully where we must," Blinken said.
The talks in Beijing marked a positive step in the relationship between the United States and China. Although substantial differences remain, both sides demonstrated a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue and work together on issues of common concern. However, much work remains to be done to build mutual trust and cooperation in the years ahead.
