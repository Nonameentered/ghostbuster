Beijing â€“ The stock markets in China have rebounded as the negative impact of the death of the country's former leader, Deng Xiaoping, has started to fade. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 1.6 percent on Monday, while the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 2.2 percent, signaling a resurgence in investor confidence.
Deng Xiaoping, who opened China's economy to the world in the 1980s, died on February 19, 1997. His death sent shockwaves through China's political hierarchy, as well as the global financial markets, which registered significant losses.
However, over the years, China has emerged as a global economic powerhouse, and its stock markets have grown in size and maturity. Investors are more confident in China's economy than they were two decades ago, and the negative impact of Deng Xiaoping's death has faded into the background.
The resurgence in the stock markets is also due to positive economic news, including the reopening of businesses in China after being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had caused major disruption to the country's economy. China's manufacturing sector has also rebounded, posting a higher-than-expected growth rate of 4.4 percent in August.
On Monday, shares of technology and healthcare companies posted strong gains, with some stocks recording gains of over 6 percent. Analysts attribute this to investors' growing interest in companies that can survive the pandemic.
China has also announced significant reforms to its financial sector, including measures to make it easier for foreign investors to access its stock and bond markets. This move is expected to attract more foreign funds into the country's financial markets.
The government has also reassured investors that it will continue its efforts to stabilize the economy, invest in infrastructure, and promote innovation, which are seen as key drivers of economic growth.
While the positive news has generated optimism among investors, there are still risks to China's economy. The country is still grappling with the fallout from the pandemic, as well as trade tensions with the United States, which have weighed on its industrial sector.
Moreover, the Chinese government's recent crackdown on internet and technology companies has raised concerns among investors about the country's regulatory environment. Some analysts fear that the regulatory drive could hurt innovation and discourage foreign investment.
Despite the risks, China's economic growth prospects remain strong, and its stock markets are likely to continue their upward trajectory in the coming months. The rebound in the stock markets signals a vote of confidence in China's economy, as well as its ability to weather the challenges ahead.
