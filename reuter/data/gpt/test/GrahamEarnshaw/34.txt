China's stock markets have reacted to concerns about the health of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. However, market analysts say that the impact of these concerns on the economy is likely to be minimal.
Deng, who died in 1997, is widely regarded as the architect of China's economic reforms and opening up policies in the 1980s and 1990s. His successors, including current leader Xi Jinping, have continued to pursue these policies, which have led to rapid economic growth and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.
But recently, reports have emerged regarding Deng's health, leading to speculation about the potential impact on China's political and economic future. Some analysts have suggested that the current leadership may diverge from Deng's policies if he is perceived to be a less influential figure.
These concerns have been reflected in China's stock markets, which saw significant volatility in the days following the reports about Deng's health. In particular, shares in companies that are expected to benefit from continuing economic liberalization policies, such as technology firms and financial institutions, saw significant declines.
However, experts say that the impact of Deng's health concerns on the economy is likely to be limited. "While Deng was undoubtedly a very important figure in China's history, his influence on the economy is not as direct as it used to be," says Liang Yu, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
"China's economy has grown and diversified significantly since Deng's time, and there are now many other factors that contribute to its prosperity. The current leadership is also committed to continuing his policies, regardless of his health status," he adds.
Indeed, official statements from the Chinese government have sought to play down concerns about Deng's health, emphasizing instead the continued importance of his legacy. "The spirit of Deng Xiaoping is immortal, and his contributions to the cause of the Party and the people will last forever," said a statement from the Communist Party's Central Committee.
Despite these reassuring statements, some investors remain cautious about China's economic prospects. The country has faced growing tensions with the United States and other Western nations in recent years, as well as internal challenges such as rising debt levels and environmental degradation. These factors have contributed to a general sense of uncertainty about China's future trajectory.
"China's economy is still growing at a robust pace, but there are certainly challenges ahead," says Lu Ting, an economist at Nomura. "Investors are understandably nervous about the potential for disruptions, whether they come from political instability, geopolitical tensions, or other factors."
Nevertheless, Lu and other experts say that China's economic fundamentals remain strong, with a large and growing consumer market, extensive infrastructure investments, and a skilled and innovative workforce. They also note that the government has taken steps to address some of the country's key challenges, such as implementing financial reforms and promoting environmental sustainability.
"Despite the uncertainties, we remain optimistic about China's long-term economic prospects," Lu adds. "The country has come a long way since Deng's time, and we believe that it will continue to prosper and innovate in the years to come."
