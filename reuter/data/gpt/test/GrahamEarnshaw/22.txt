China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), is facing difficulties in its efforts to boost open market operations due to a shortage of short-term treasury bills. The shortage has left the central bank struggling to manage liquidity in the financial system, leading to concerns about its ability to control monetary policy.
The shortage of short-term treasury bills is a result of Beijing's efforts to curb excessive debt in the economy. The government has been reducing the issuance of new debt, including short-term treasury bills, as part of its broader effort to rein in financial risks.
The PBOC has been using open market operations to manage liquidity in the financial system and keep borrowing costs stable. However, the central bank has been finding it increasingly difficult to do so amid the shortage of short-term treasury bills.
Open market operations involve the PBOC buying and selling securities in the open market to manage the amount of money in circulation. When the central bank buys securities, it injects money into the financial system, while selling securities drains money from the system.
The PBOC has been using reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) as its main tool for open market operations. Reverse repos involve the central bank buying securities from banks and other financial institutions, with an agreement to sell the securities back at a specified date in the future.
However, the shortage of short-term treasury bills has limited the PBOC's ability to conduct reverse repos. The central bank has been forced to resort to longer-term securities, which are less liquid and less effective in managing short-term liquidity.
The shortage of short-term treasury bills has also led to a spike in borrowing costs for banks and other financial institutions. The Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (Shibor), which is the benchmark for interbank borrowing costs in China, has been rising in recent weeks. The Shibor for the one-week tenor hit its highest level in nearly two years on July 19.
The rise in borrowing costs is a concern for the PBOC, as it could hamper economic growth by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow money. The government has been trying to stimulate economic growth amid a slowdown that has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
To address the shortage of short-term treasury bills, the PBOC has been exploring new tools for open market operations. One option is to introduce a new type of short-term bond that could be used as collateral for reverse repos. The central bank is reportedly considering issuing three-month central bank bills as a potential alternative to the two-week treasury bills.
Another option is to expand the use of the Pledged Supplementary Lending (PSL) facility, which is a type of medium-term lending that allows banks to borrow money from the central bank using securities as collateral. The PSL facility was originally introduced in 2014 to provide targeted funding to specific sectors of the economy, but it has since been expanded to provide general liquidity support.
The PBOC has already taken some steps to address the shortage of short-term treasury bills. In June, it increased the amount of short-term securities it issued to banks and other financial institutions, providing more collateral for reverse repos.
However, some analysts say that the central bank needs to do more to boost liquidity in the financial system. Yanting Zhang, an economist at China Zheshang Bank, told Reuters that the PBOC needs to inject more cash into the financial system to ease the shortage of short-term treasury bills.
"The PBOC may need to consider increasing the quota of medium-term lending facilities to guide bank liquidity towards the short-term bond market," Zhang said.
The shortage of short-term treasury bills is just one example of the challenges facing the PBOC as it seeks to manage monetary policy in an economy that is undergoing rapid structural changes. The central bank has also been grappling with rising inflation, a slowing property market, and increasing pressure from the United States over trade and technology issues.
Despite these challenges, the PBOC has been sending a clear message to the markets that it intends to maintain a prudent monetary policy and avoid excessive money supply growth. In a statement issued in July, the central bank said that it would "keep liquidity at an appropriate and reasonable level," while maintaining "continuity and stability" in its monetary policy.
The PBOC is expected to continue implementing a range of policy measures to address the shortage of short-term treasury bills and manage liquidity in the financial system. However, the long-term effectiveness of these measures will depend on a wide range of factors, including the pace of economic growth, the level of debt in the economy, and the outlook for the global economy.
