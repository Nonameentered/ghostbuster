Nissan, the Japanese automaker, announced today that it is investing £254 million ($357 million) in its Sunderland manufacturing plant in the United Kingdom to boost production of electric vehicles. The investment will be used to upgrade the plant with new equipment, expand its footprint, and introduce new technologies, including a new battery production facility.
The move will create 800 new jobs at the plant, which currently employs over 7,000 people. It is part of Nissan's plan to electrify its entire product line by the early 2030s. The company has committed to introducing 23 new electric and hybrid models by then, including 15 pure electric vehicles.
The investment comes as the UK government ramps up its efforts to phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2030. The government recently announced a £500 million plan to support the development and production of electric vehicles and associated infrastructure, as well as an additional £1.3 billion to support the rollout of charging points.
Nissan's Sunderland plant, which opened in 1986, is the largest car factory in the UK and produces the Nissan Leaf, the world's best-selling electric car. The plant has been one of the success stories of the UK car industry in recent years, despite the uncertainty caused by Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.
The investment will help to secure the plant's long-term future and position it at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. The new battery production facility will be operated by Envision AESC, a Chinese battery manufacturer that acquired Nissan's battery business in 2018.
Envision AESC will initially produce batteries for Nissan's e-Power vehicles, which use a small petrol engine to generate electricity to power the car's electric motor. However, the company plans to expand production to supply batteries to other customers and to support the growth of the UK's electric vehicle industry.
The investment will also help to support the local economy and supply chain. Paul Willcox, chairman of Nissan Europe, said: "This significant investment by Nissan is a testament to the UK's skills, expertise, and dedication to innovation and our ambition to be a world leader in the manufacture and adoption of electric vehicles."
The announcement was welcomed by the UK government, which sees the electric vehicle sector as a key driver of growth and job creation. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: "This investment from Nissan is a major boost for the UK's automotive sector and the economy as a whole. It highlights our transition to zero-emission vehicles and our ambition to be a world leader in green technology."
The investment also shows that Brexit has not deterred foreign investors from investing in the UK, despite the uncertainty caused by the UK's exit from the European Union. Nissan had previously warned that a no-deal Brexit could threaten the viability of its UK operations, but the company has now committed to investing in the future of its Sunderland plant.
However, the UK government's decision to cut the plug-in car grant earlier this year has been criticised by some industry experts, who argue that it will make it harder for consumers to buy electric cars and slow the transition to zero-emission vehicles.
Nissan's investment is a welcome boost to the UK car industry, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and the uncertainty caused by Brexit. The UK car market declined by 29% in 2020, its worst performance in nearly three decades, and many car manufacturers have been forced to cut jobs and shift production to other countries.
However, the rise of electric vehicles offers a glimmer of hope for the industry. Demand for electric cars is expected to soar in the coming years, driven by falling costs and growing concerns about air pollution and climate change. The UK government's plan to ban petrol and diesel cars from 2030 is forcing car manufacturers to accelerate their plans for electric vehicle production.
Nissan's investment in its Sunderland plant is a clear sign that the UK is well-placed to be at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. However, more needs to be done to support the sector, including the development of a comprehensive charging infrastructure and continued government support for research and development. With the right policies and investment, the UK could become a global leader in the production and adoption of electric vehicles.
