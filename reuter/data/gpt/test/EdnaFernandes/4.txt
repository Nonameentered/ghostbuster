London, UK - Hanson Plc, the multinational conglomerate, has reported record pretax profits for the financial year, before its impending four-way split of operations. The company's businesses span construction materials, real estate, and chemical production, among others.
According to the latest financial results, the company's pretax profits surged to £3.5 billion, a 12% increase over the previous year. Revenue also climbed by 8% to £18.8 billion, beating market expectations.
The positive results were attributed to strong performances across several industries, including building materials, where Hanson's aggregates and cement businesses experienced robust demand in the US and UK. The company's real estate division, which comprises commercial and residential properties primarily in London, also performed strongly, with record high occupancy rates and rental yields.
In addition, Hanson's chemical production arm saw an uptick in demand for its products, particularly in the automotive and electronics industries, with sales up by more than 20% year-on-year.
Commenting on the financial results, Hanson's CEO, James Drummond, said, "We are pleased to report record profits for the financial year, which reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio and the resilience of our businesses. Despite the challenging operating environment caused by the pandemic, our teams worked tirelessly to deliver excellent results across our divisions."
He added, "As we move forward with our strategic review and four-way split of the company, we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders. We see significant potential in each of our businesses, and we intend to continue investing in them to drive growth."
Hanson will split its operations into four standalone companies - Hanson Building Materials, Hanson Real Estate, Hanson Chemicals, and Hanson Ventures - to better focus on each division's specific needs and opportunities. The move, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, will enable more agile decision-making and greater flexibility in allocating resources, the company said.
The news was welcomed by investors, with Hanson's stock rising by 2.5% on the London Stock Exchange following the announcement.
Analysts predict that the four-way split will not only help Hanson unlock value but also address concerns around the conglomerate structure, which could lead to greater investor confidence and attract more long-term shareholders in the future.
