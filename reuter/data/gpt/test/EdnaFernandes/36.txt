British multinational defence, security, and aerospace giant General Electric Company (GEC) has announced a major overhaul of its corporate structure as it looks to transition away from legacy management practices. The move marks a significant shift for the company, which has long been associated with conservative business practices.
Under the new structure, the company will streamline its operations and create four new divisions: cybersecurity and information systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, and aerospace. Each of these divisions will be led by a dedicated executive.
The restructuring comes in response to a changing global security landscape, which has put increasing emphasis on cyber threats as well as more traditional forms of conflict. GEC has acknowledged that it needs to adapt to these changes in order to remain competitive and relevant in the industry.
"Our new structure will enable us to be more agile and responsive to the evolving needs of our customers," said GEC CEO John Donovan. "By focusing on these four key areas, we will be better equipped to deliver the cutting-edge technologies and capabilities that our customers demand."
The move has been widely welcomed by industry experts, who see it as a positive step towards modernizing GEC's management style and staying ahead of the curve in the rapidly changing defence sector.
"The fact that GEC is willing to make such a bold move shows that they are serious about staying competitive in an increasingly challenging market," said Jane Smith, a defence analyst at industry research firm Frost & Sullivan. "By focusing on these key areas, they can develop expertise and capabilities that will give them a distinct advantage over their competitors."
In addition to the new divisions, the company is also creating a new role for a chief technology officer (CTO) to oversee the development of new technologies and spearhead innovation within the company. This move is also seen as a key part of GEC's broader strategy to embrace new technologies and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing industry.
Overall, the restructuring is being seen as a positive step for GEC, which has long been criticized for its conservative business practices and slow pace of innovation. By embracing new technologies and modernizing its management style, the company is positioning itself as a leader in the rapidly changing defence sector.
