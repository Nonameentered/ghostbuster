General Electric Co Plc (GE) has suffered a setback in its financial performance due to the restructuring charge the company had to deal with in the second quarter of 2021. The company has reported a decrease in its profits, which was heavily impacted by restructuring work across several business units.
The multinational company based in Boston, Massachusetts, announced that its restructuring charges totaled $582 million, primarily focused on its troubled aviation business, which has been heavily hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the restructuring charges, the company's net losses increased to $1.2 billion from the same period in 2020, compared to a profit of $531 million a year ago.
GE's CEO, Larry Culp, said that the restructuring charge is part of the company's long-term plan to reduce its debt, which currently stands at approximately $90 billion. The company plans to pay off $30 billion of its debt by the end of 2021, primarily through the sale of its jet leasing unit and through divestitures of non-core assets.
In a statement, Culp said, "We continue to execute on our priorities, taking steps to strengthen our balance sheet and position our businesses for a more normalized environment. Our teams delivered solid results in the quarter, with free cash flow, earnings and margin all ahead of expectations."
On the positive side, GE's overall revenue increased by 9% to $18.3 billion, which the company attributed to the growth in its power business, renewable energy, and healthcare divisions. The company's power division saw a 15% boost in revenue, while its renewable energy division saw an 8% increase, and its healthcare division saw a 10% increase in revenue.
GE's Aviation division remains a weak spot for the company, with a 28% drop in revenue compared to 2020 due to the ongoing pandemic's impact on the travel industry. The unit's revenue is also expected to be weak throughout 2021 due to continued declines in demand for commercial air travel.
Despite the challenges, GE remains optimistic about the future and is confident that its restructuring efforts will put the company on a stronger financial footing moving forward. The company has put significant efforts into deleveraging since 2018, focusing on debt reduction and divestitures rather than growth. As a result, GE has seen improvements in free cash flow and margin, which has helped pressure down its cost of borrowing.
GE's stock price has been trading relatively flat over the past year, although the stock has posted gains of over 17% in the past three months. Despite the financial difficulties faced by the company during the second quarter, investors have shown confidence in GE's long-term plans. The company's restructuring efforts are expected to provide a foundation for growth in the future, positioning GE for continued success amid uncertain economic times.
