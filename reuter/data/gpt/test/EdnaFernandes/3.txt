Racal Electronics, a leading UK defence electronics firm, has announced a joint venture with US-based defence contractor General Dynamics in a bid to save up to £100m on the Bowman defence contract.
The Bowman contract is a £1.2bn programme to provide secure digital communications for the British Army. Racal Electronics has been a key supplier for the Bowman project since its inception. The joint venture will see General Dynamics provide specialist expertise in the programme's software and hardware, while Racal Electronics will continue to provide its expertise in communications systems.
The joint venture will seek to streamline the Bowman project while maintaining the highest standards of security. Racal Electronics will retain its lead role in the programme, with General Dynamics playing a supportive role in the areas of software and hardware. The partnership aims to maximise efficiencies in the notoriously complex Bowman programme.
Racal Electronics CEO, Simon Richardson, said: "This joint venture represents a significant investment in the future of the Bowman programme. With General Dynamics on board, we are confident that we can further enhance the programme's capabilities, while also achieving significant cost savings."
The Bowman programme has been beset by delays and cost overruns since its inception, but Richardson believes that the joint venture will help to turn things around. "We are committed to delivering the Bowman programme to the highest standards, and we believe that this partnership with General Dynamics will help us to do just that. By working together, we can streamline processes and maximise efficiencies, ultimately delivering cost savings that will benefit the UK taxpayer."
The joint venture is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be finalised in the coming months. If approved, it could transform the Bowman project and pave the way for future cost savings on similar programmes.
