The latest round of open skies talks between the United States and United Kingdom ended without a full agreement, much to the disappointment of many within the aviation industry. Discussions centered around allowing airlines greater access to one another's markets, but negotiations ultimately fell apart amid disputes over cabotage rights and ownership rules.
As a result of the talks, it now appears as though British Airways and American Airlines' transatlantic joint venture may face blockage from the Department of Transportation. This has sparked concern amongst the two carriers, who have long argued that their partnership is essential to their ability to compete on routes between the U.S and UK.
The point of contention centers around the Department of Transportation's interpretation of the term 'competition' within the context of the Open Skies agreement. Supporters of the joint venture argue that competition exists at a global level, with a number of other airlines, such as Delta and Virgin Atlantic, also operating flights between the two regions. However, the Department of Transportation has maintained that competition must be assessed at a local level, with a focus on specific routes and individual carriers.
This has led to concerns that the partnership could be seen as anti-competitive, with criticism centering around the fact that British Airways and American Airlines account for a significant proportion of transatlantic traffic. This has led to questions around what the future may hold for the two airlines, and whether they will be able to continue to maintain their dominance of the lucrative transatlantic market.
In addition to these challenges, the talks also revealed a number of other key issues that need to be addressed as part of any future agreement. One of the most significant of these concerns cabotage rights, which refer to the ability of foreign airlines to operate domestic flights within a country. The U.S. has long been resistant to granting these rights to foreign carriers, which has been a sticking point in previous rounds of talks.
Overall, the lack of a full agreement between the U.S. and UK has come as a disappointment to many, as it means that airlines will not be able to enjoy the full benefits of open skies in the near future. While some progress was made in terms of discussions, it is clear that there are a number of complex issues that need to be resolved before a comprehensive agreement can be reached, including the future of the BA and AA alliance. For now, it looks as though the transatlantic aviation market will continue to be marked by uncertainty and change.
