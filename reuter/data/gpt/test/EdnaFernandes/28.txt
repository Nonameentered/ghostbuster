Ford has announced plans to cut 1,300 jobs at its plant in Bridgend, South Wales. The changes, which are part of a global restructuring plan, will see the company reduce its workforce by around a third.
The cuts come as part of a wider plan by Ford to cut costs and boost profitability, with the company targeting $25.5 billion in cost savings by 2022. However, the move has been met with anger by the unions, who have threatened to strike if the cuts go ahead.
Ford has faced a number of challenges in recent years, including increasing competition from Asian manufacturers and changing consumer preferences. In the UK, the company has been hit particularly hard by the Brexit vote, which has caused uncertainty over the future of the country's automotive industry.
The Bridgend plant, which produces engines for a number of Ford vehicles, including the Fiesta and the Focus, has been in operation since the 1970s. However, the company has been scaling back production at the site in recent years, as it shifts its focus towards electric and hybrid vehicles.
The cuts will predominantly affect hourly-paid staff, with around 700 agency workers losing their jobs, and a further 600 permanent staff also set to be let go. The changes will be implemented over the next two years, with the majority of job losses set to take place in 2020.
Speaking about the cuts, Ford's Europe, Middle East and Africa president, Stuart Rowley, said that the company was "committed to working with partners, unions and stakeholders in the Bridgend area to mitigate the impact of this decision on our employees, their families and the communities in which they live".
However, the GMB union, which represents many of the affected workers, has accused Ford of "betraying" its workforce. The union has called for an urgent meeting with the company to discuss the cuts, and has warned that strike action could be on the cards if a resolution is not reached.
"We're absolutely devastated by this news," said GMB regional organiser Jeff Beck. "It's a complete betrayal of the workforce in Bridgend. The impact of these job losses will be devastating for the local community."
The Unite union has also voiced concerns about the cuts, and has called on the UK government to provide support for the automotive industry. "Ford's decision to cut its workforce by a third is devastating news for its workers and their families," said Unite general secretary Len McCluskey.
"The loss of jobs at the Bridgend plant will have a detrimental impact on the local economy and the wider community. The government needs to urgently intervene to provide support for the automotive industry and ensure that the UK remains a competitive place for investment and growth."
The UK government has responded to the cuts by saying that it is "disappointed" by the news, and that it will work with Ford and the unions to support affected workers. "This is clearly very difficult news for those affected by these job losses, and our priority is to support them, their families and the community during this difficult period," said a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
The announcement by Ford comes just weeks after competitor Jaguar Land Rover announced plans to cut 4,500 jobs in the UK. The move prompted fears about the future of the UK's car industry, which employs more than 800,000 people across the country.
However, the industry has been quick to downplay these concerns, pointing out that the UK is still the fourth-largest car manufacturing country in the world, with over 1.5 million cars produced in 2018.
Despite this, concerns about Brexit continue to weigh on the industry, as companies face the prospect of tariffs and other trade barriers if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The ongoing uncertainty has caused many firms to put investment plans on hold, and has prompted some to consider moving production out of the UK altogether.
For now, however, all eyes will be on Ford as it moves ahead with its plans to restructure its global operations. With the unions threatening strike action, and the government under pressure to support affected workers, the future of the car industry in the UK remains uncertain.
