Racal Electronics has issued a profit warning due to last-minute delays in foreign government defence orders, much to the surprise of industry analysts. The company, which specializes in the development and production of electronics for the defence sector, saw a drop of 10% in its shares following the announcement.
The company's CEO, Mark Ormond, cited the impact of coronavirus-related disruptions on overseas operations, logistical issues, and unforeseen bureaucratic complications as the key reasons for the delay.
"In the current challenging environment, it is proving more difficult than usual to undertake the necessary negotiations and secure approvals for the delivery of our defence equipment to foreign governments," Ormond said.
He also expressed optimism about future revenue growth, citing the continued demand for defence equipment around the world, but conceded that the current outlook for Racal Electronics was "cautiously optimistic."
Market analysts expressed disappointment at the news, with several highlighting the importance of Racal Electronics' defence contracts for the UK economy. However, some also noted that this was not an isolated issue for the sector, and that delays in government procurement were common across the industry.
