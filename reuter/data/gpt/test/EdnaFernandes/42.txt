The Go-Ahead Group and VIA-GTI, a subsidiary of the French transport group Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), have been selected to take over the Thameslink rail franchise from 2022.
The joint venture secured the coveted contract, which is expected to create approximately 1,000 jobs, following a competitive bidding process that began in 2020. The Thameslink franchise, which carries an annual passenger traffic of 80 million between Bedford and Brighton, is currently operated by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR).
The Go-Ahead Group, which has been operating rail services since 1986 and is headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, will own 65% of the new franchise. VIA-GTI, which is part of the international group CDPQ Infra, responsible for managing infrastructure projects including the new Réseau express métropolitain (REM) in Montreal, will hold the remaining 35%.
The companies said that the Thameslink franchise will be one of the most modern rail operations in the worl, including a £1.6bn ($2bn) fleet of Siemens-built trains that will replace older ones. Passengers can expect new services, with more frequent and faster trains being rolled out, as well as enhanced accessibility, better station facilities and a “major focus on innovation and sustainability”.
The Department for Transport said the new operators met “rigorous financial, technical and operational criteria”, and will build on the Government’s commitment to create more frequent, reliable and efficient services.
