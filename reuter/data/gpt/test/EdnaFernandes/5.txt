Hanson Plc, a leading building materials and infrastructure company, has reported strong financial results for the year-ended 2021, posting a record profit despite a shares price underperformance.
According to its latest financial report, Hanson reported an increase in revenue from £1.80 billion in 2020 to £1.85 billion in 2021, representing a growth rate of 2.77%. The company's operating profit year-on-year also increased from £392.2 million to £412.4 million, up 5.14%. Hanson's profit before tax saw a considerable rise, from £351.5 million in 2020 to £394.2 million in 2021, up 12.13%.
Despite the robust financial performance, investors were not thrilled, given that the company's shares underperformed against the stock market in 2021. Hanson's shares only increased by 6.1% in the past year, lagging behind the FTSE 100's 8.8% gain. However, the company remains optimistic about its performance, and the outlook going forward, suggests that Hanson's share price could rebound significantly.
Simon Willis, the CEO of Hanson, recounts, "Despite the challenging operating environment, we continued to perform exceptionally well. We delivered record profit in a year where the market was jittery and uncertain, thanks to a robust business model, a strong balance sheet, and an excellent management team. We remain confident that we can drive sustainable growth in the future."
One of the contributing factors to Hanson's solid performance was its pragmatic approach to cost control. Hanson has implemented a cost-saving program enabling the company to save £111 million in 2021. This successful cost-saving initiative, along with productivity gains, has helped optimise the business and significantly impacted the operating profit.
Another area that boosted the company's financials was the strategic expansion of its operations. The company recently acquired Polyframe, a well-established fabricator and distributor of PVCu windows and doors, which generated revenue of £100 million in 2021 and is expected to drive strong growth potential.
Hanson's CEO said the Polyframe acquisition aligned with the company's strategy to broaden its footprint in the building materials sector, adding that they were strongly positioned to capitalise on the high-growth PVCu windows and doors market.
The company also ramped up its sustainability efforts, increasing its use of renewable resources, and investing in low-carbon technologies to reduce its carbon footprint. Hanson has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 50% through 2030 and is looking to eliminate single-use plastics across its business.
In summary, the financial results from Hanson were impressive given the challenging economic environment faced by the business. The company's focus on cost control, strategic expansion, and a dedication to sustainability has positioned them optimally for future growth. Despite the disappointing share price performance, the company's outlook remains positive, and they believe they could deliver sustainable growth in the long term.
