Wickes Plc, the UK-based home improvement and DIY retailer, has warned that it could fall into receivership unless its investors back its proposed financial restructuring plan.
The company, which has been struggling with declining sales and mounting debts, is seeking to raise fresh capital through a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. The plan aims to reduce the company's debt burden and improve its liquidity position.
In a statement released on Monday, the company said that it needs the support of its shareholders to implement the plan. "We urgently need to raise new capital to address our liquidity issues and to put the company on a sustainable footing for the future," said Wickes CEO, John Carter.
"We are asking our shareholders to support us in this critical time so that we can continue to serve our customers and safeguard jobs and suppliers."
Wickes, which employs around 11,000 people across its network of stores and distribution centers, has been struggling to compete with online rivals such as Amazon and other retailers that offer a broader range of products.
According to its latest financial results, for the year ended 31 December 2020, the company reported a pre-tax loss of £17.7m ($24.3m), compared with a profit of £16.6m in the previous year. The company's revenue also declined by 6.7% to £1.12bn, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Wickes has already secured the backing of its largest shareholder, Travis Perkins, which has agreed to take up its full entitlement in the proposed rights issue. However, the company still needs the support of its other shareholders to raise the full amount of capital required.
Some analysts have expressed skepticism about Wickes' chances of successfully raising the necessary funds, given the challenging retail environment and the company's weak financial position.
"Even with the proposed capital raising, Wickes will still have a very high level of debt, and it remains to be seen whether investors will be willing to put more money into a struggling business with a tough path to recovery," said Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics.
Should Wickes fail to secure the support of its investors, it could be forced to consider other options, including a sale of the business or entering into administration.
The company's share price fell by more than 5% on the news of the proposed financial restructuring. However, some investors have expressed optimism that the plan could help to turn the company's fortunes around.
"We believe that Wickes has a strong brand and a loyal customer base, and that with the right strategy and capital structure, it can return to growth and profitability," said one shareholder, who asked not to be named.
