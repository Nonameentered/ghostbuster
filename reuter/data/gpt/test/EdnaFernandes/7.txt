The British government has warned that the recently-formed transatlantic alliance between British Airways and American Airlines could be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, citing concerns over competition in the aviation industry.
The two airlines, which are part of the Oneworld airline alliance, announced their partnership in August 2019, allowing them to coordinate their flights and prices on routes between the US and Europe. The deal was approved by the US Department of Transportation in June 2020, but the UK government has yet to give its approval.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has now indicated that the government may refer the alliance to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is responsible for ensuring that mergers and acquisitions do not harm competition in the UK. Speaking to the Financial Times, Shapps expressed concern that the deal could lead to higher fares and reduced choice for passengers.
"Competition is important, and we want to make sure that it is not squeezed out of the market by deals such as this," he said. "We will carefully consider whether this alliance serves the best interests of consumers and the aviation industry as a whole."
The warning comes amid growing scrutiny of the aviation industry's consolidation, with some regulators and consumer groups arguing that mergers and alliances are leading to higher prices and reduced competition. Critics of the British Airways-American Airlines alliance have pointed out that the two airlines already dominate the lucrative transatlantic market, and that the deal could give them even greater market power.
However, supporters of the alliance argue that it will benefit consumers by allowing the airlines to offer better connections and more frequent flights. They also point out that the aviation industry is facing unprecedented challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and that the alliance will help the airlines to survive and recover.
British Airways and American Airlines have responded to the government's warning by insisting that the alliance will not harm competition, and that it is in the best interests of passengers and the aviation industry. In a joint statement, the two airlines said that the partnership would "benefit customers by providing easier access to a broader range of cities, more convenient connections, and competitive fares".
The statement also highlighted the challenges facing the aviation industry, saying that the partnership would "help ensure that our airlines survive and thrive in the years ahead, and that we can continue to contribute to the economies and communities we serve".
However, critics of the alliance remain unconvinced. The consumer group Which? has called on the government to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, arguing that it could lead to higher fares and reduced choice for passengers.
"Consumers will understandably be concerned that this alliance between two powerful players could lead to higher prices and less choice, particularly at a time when the aviation industry is under such pressure," said Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel. "It is vital that the government takes a careful look at this deal to ensure that it does not harm competition or the interests of passengers."
The outcome of the government's review of the alliance remains uncertain, but the warning has highlighted the growing concerns over consolidation in the aviation industry. With airlines facing unprecedented challenges in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, regulators will need to strike a delicate balance between competition and cooperation in the years ahead.
