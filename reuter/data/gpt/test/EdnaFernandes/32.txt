Ford's Job Cuts Dent Northern England's Inward Investment Record
Ford has announced that it will cut 370 jobs at its Bridgend engine plant in South Wales by 2021, causing a further dent in Northern England's inward investment record.
The Bridgend plant currently employs 1,700 staff and produces petrol engines for Ford vehicles, but the company has cited a decline in demand for these engines as the reason for the job cuts.
The news comes just weeks after Japanese car maker Honda announced that it will close its factory in Swindon next year, putting 3,500 jobs at risk. Combined, these job losses are a major blow to the UK's automotive industry and have raised concerns about the country's ability to attract investment in the future.
Northern England has been particularly hard hit by these job losses, with the region having been working hard to attract inward investment in recent years. The UK government's Northern Powerhouse initiative aims to create an economic powerhouse in the North of England by improving transport links, fostering innovation, and encouraging investment in the region.
However, with the automotive industry such a crucial part of the Northern economy, these job cuts are likely to have a significant impact on Northern England's inward investment record. Car makers such as Nissan and BMW have invested heavily in the region in recent years, but concerns are growing that they may look elsewhere if the UK's ability to supply skilled labour becomes compromised.
The problem has been exacerbated by uncertainty over Brexit, with car makers warning that they will not be able to operate in the UK if a no-deal Brexit causes supply chain disruption. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has warned that a no-deal Brexit would cause tariffs, border delays, and regulatory barriers, making it impossible for car makers to operate in the UK.
The UK government has pledged to support the car industry through Brexit, but many fear that the damage has already been done. The automotive industry is a major part of the UK economy, employing over 800,000 people and generating around Â£77bn a year. With job losses at Bridgend and Swindon, and the threat of no-deal Brexit looming, the future looks uncertain for the industry.
The job cuts at Bridgend will be phased over the next 18 months, with the plant set to close in autumn 2020. However, Ford has said that it will create some new roles at its plant in Dagenham, East London, which currently employs around 2,000 people.
The announcement has been met with disappointment by local politicians and union leaders, who have expressed concern about the impact on the wider economy in Wales. They have called on the UK government to do more to support the automotive industry, arguing that it is crucial to the prosperity of many parts of the country.
This news follows the recent announcement that a Japanese car manufacturer, Honda, will be closing its factory in Swindon next year resulting in the loss of 3,500 jobs. Some experts have speculated that this could be just the beginning of a wider trend of automotive companies relocating outside the UK due to mounting uncertainty around Brexit.
Politicians on both sides of the Brexit debate have been quick to respond to the news. The Welsh government has called for urgent talks with Ford and unions to try and find ways to mitigate the impact of the job losses. Meanwhile, Brexit-supporting MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has accused Honda of using Brexit as an excuse to move production to Japan.
The future of the UK's automotive industry remains deeply uncertain as Brexit looms and new trade deals are negotiated. With job losses at Bridgend and Swindon and the possibility of further cuts to come, many are calling on the government to take urgent action to support the industry and protect jobs and investment in Northern England and beyond.
