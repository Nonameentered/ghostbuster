British engineering company LucasVarity is reportedly in active negotiations for the sale of several non-core units in a bid to focus on its core businesses. The company's management has stated that it intends to divest its non-core assets in order to streamline its operations and improve efficiency.
According to sources, the sale could include several units related to aerospace and automotive businesses, as well as its consumer products division. The company has declined to comment on specific units being targeted in the sale.
LucasVarity, which was formed through the merger of Lucas Industries and Varity Corporation in 1996, has struggled in recent years due to declining demand for traditional automotive products and increasing competition in its aerospace and defence divisions. The company has been actively seeking ways to restructure and improve its operations in order to remain competitive.
The negotiations for the sale of non-core units come as part of a broader strategy to improve the company's financial performance. LucasVarity has already implemented cost-cutting measures and increased efficiency in its manufacturing facilities to reduce overhead costs.
Analysts expect the sale of non-core units to provide a much-needed boost to the company's balance sheet and allow it to focus on its core businesses. The sale is expected to be completed within the next few months.
