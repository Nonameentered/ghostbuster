British Steel Shares Hit 12-Month Low After Profit Downgrades Due to Strong Pound Against the Mark
British Steel shares have hit a 12-month low following profit downgrades due to the strong pound against the mark. The company announced on Thursday that its pre-tax profit for the year had fallen from £77 million to £46 million, with CEO Michael Bradshaw pointing to “currency headwinds” as the main culprit.
Bradshaw cited the strength of the pound against the mark, which he said had led to a “significant reduction” in the amount of money the company was able to make on exports. He also noted that rising raw materials costs and a decline in steel prices had contributed to the drop in profits.
The news sent shares in British Steel tumbling, with the stock closing down over 8% on Thursday. The company’s shares are now trading at their lowest level in a year, and analysts say that the situation is unlikely to improve in the short term.
The weak performance of British Steel comes as the wider steel industry is facing a number of challenges. The sector has been hit hard by a global oversupply of steel, particularly from China, which has led to falling prices and reduced demand in many markets.
In addition, trade tensions between the US and other countries are also contributing to the uncertainty in the steel market. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on steel imports from a number of countries, including the European Union, which has led to retaliatory measures and further disruption for the industry.
Despite the challenges facing the sector, Bradshaw remained upbeat about the future of British Steel. He highlighted the company’s recent investments in new equipment and technology, as well as its commitment to reducing costs and improving efficiency.
“We remain committed to delivering a sustainable future for British Steel,” Bradshaw said. “We are investing in our operations and our people to ensure we are well-positioned to compete in a challenging market.”
However, analysts were less optimistic about the company’s prospects, with many questioning whether British Steel would be able to overcome the current headwinds and return to growth.
“British Steel is facing some serious challenges at the moment, and it’s not clear how quickly they will be able to turn things around,” said analyst John Smith. “The strong pound is certainly a major issue, but there are also broader problems in the steel industry that are likely to persist for some time.”
For investors, the decline in British Steel’s share price is likely to be a cause for concern. The company has long been a favourite among income investors, thanks to its substantial dividend payouts.
However, with profits falling and the share price in decline, it remains to be seen whether British Steel will be able to maintain its dividend payments in the coming year.
The steel industry is facing a challenging period, with uncertainty over trade, falling prices and rising costs all contributing to the current headwinds. For British Steel, the challenges are even greater, with currency headwinds adding to the mix.
With the company’s shares trading at a 12-month low, investors will be watching closely to see whether British Steel can weather the current storm and return to growth in the coming months.
