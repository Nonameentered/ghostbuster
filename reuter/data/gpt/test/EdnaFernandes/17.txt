Double-decker bus at forefront of environmental breakthrough with oil recycler
A double-decker bus in London is leading the way in green innovation by trialling an oil recycler that could save thousands of litres of engine oil annually.
The oil recycler, developed by Green-O-Tech, extracts and cleans oil from engines to such a high standard it can be re-used. It’s estimated the device could save up to 6,000 litres of new oil each year, helping to reduce carbon emissions and conserve resources.
The bus, operated by Go-Ahead London, will be tested on a variety of routes over the next few months to establish how the technology performs.
“This is a huge moment for us and the industry. We’re always looking for new ways to lower our impact on the environment, so we’re excited to see how the recycler performs in a live environment,” says Richard Harrington, Engineering Director at Go-Ahead.
If successful, the oil recycler could be used across Go-Ahead London’s entire fleet and beyond, significantly reducing the amount of oil required to power the city's buses.
“By reducing oil consumption, we’re not only helping to reduce remaining oil reserves, we’re also minimising transportation’s overall carbon footprint which is a significant contributor to global warming,” adds Harrington.
The oil recycler utilises a four-step process to transform waste oil into usable fuel: extraction, pre-treatment, filtration, and recovery. The result is a regenerated, high-quality base oil that can be added to fresh engine oil or used on its own.
Green-O-Tech says its process uses only 20% of the energy required to produce new oil, making it significantly more sustainable and eco-friendly than traditional methods. Currently, used oil is either burned, sold to wastewater management companies, or discarded as waste.
The device, which is the first of its kind in the UK, could also provide a financial benefit for bus operators. Recycled oil costs up to 30% less than new oil, and the oil recycler pays for itself in less than two years, according to Green-O-Tech.
"We are delighted to have the opportunity to test the oil recycler on one of London's iconic double-decker buses,” says Rowan Byrne, CEO at Green-O-Tech. “We are confident that it will perform well, both in terms of mechanics and also in reducing the environmental impact of Go-Ahead London's fleet."
The UK's transportation industry currently relies heavily on oil, with the sector accounting for 36% of energy-related CO2 emissions and 21% of overall UK greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2019 report by the Department for Transport.
Green-O-Tech is hoping its technology will help to reduce the environmental impact of the industry and contribute to the UK's overall carbon reduction targets. The company believes its innovation could be applied to a range of sectors to reduce the environmental impact of oil consumption.
“Oil is a scarce resource, and it’s vital we’re minimising the amount we use and maximising its potential. This is a great example of how thinking outside the box and embracing new technology can have a real-world impact,” says Byrne.
Green-O-Tech is also developing a range of other green innovations, including a plastic recycler, which can convert virtually all types of plastic waste into oil, its main focus is on circular economy solutions.
Go-Ahead London operates a fleet of around 2,300 buses, and the company is committed to reducing its environmental impact. In 2020, the operator began using a 10% renewable biodiesel blend in its bus fuel, which it said would save around 21,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.
The oil recycler test comes as the UK government reaffirms its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050. It has recently announced a number of measures to make transport more sustainable and environmentally friendly, including investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the removal of polluting vehicles in certain city centres.
If the trial of the oil recycler proves successful, it could be rolled out to bus operators across the UK, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping to conserve vital resources.
