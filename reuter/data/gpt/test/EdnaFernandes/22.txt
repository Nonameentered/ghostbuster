Tomkins Plc, the UK based engineering company, has announced a significant increase in its half-year profits for 2021, which has led the company to rule out a share buy-back in favour of exploring potential acquisition opportunities.
The company's half-year 2021 results, released on Wednesday, revealed a pre-tax profit of £173m ($237m), compared to £57m ($78m) in the same period last year. The rise in profits was driven by a strong performance in the company's automotive division, which saw margins rise to 7.4% from 3.3%.
Tomkins, which supplies engineered products such as belts, hoses, and bearings to the automotive, industrial and aerospace sectors, said that its overall revenue had also outperformed, increasing by 24.2% to £1.77bn ($2.42bn), up from £1.42bn ($1.94bn) last year.
In a statement, Tomkins CEO, Andy Reynolds Smith said, "We are really pleased with the strong trading performance we've delivered in H1 2021, which is a testament to the resilience of our business and the hard work of our people. Our products and services, which support key growth sectors of the global economy, continue to be in high demand, and we're confident of the group's prospects for the rest of the year."
The company also revealed that it had no plans to proceed with a share buy-back - a tool often used by companies to return cash to shareholders - and would instead focus its attention on exploring potential acquisition opportunities.
"We believe that we have strong organic growth opportunities in our existing businesses, and we will remain selective in considering any acquisitions. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions that will enhance our capabilities across key sectors," said Reynolds Smith.
Tomkins has a strong acquisition track record, having purchased engineering companies such as Flexitech and Fine Tubes in recent years. The company has indicated that it will be targeting high-growth areas, such as electrification in the automotive sector and aerospace, which it believes will contribute to the company's growth ambitions.
The announcement of Tomkins' results have been welcomed by shareholders, with the company's stock rising 3.7% following the release of the half-year figures.
Tomkins' strong financial performance has also been seen as a positive sign for the wider engineering sector, which has been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. The company's focus on high-growth areas, such as electrification, also reflects the wider trend of companies to shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly technology.
Analysts have suggested that Tomkins' continued investment in research and development, which stood at £47m ($64m) for the half-year, will be key to maintaining its competitive position in key growth areas.
In a research note, investment bank Jefferies said that the shift towards electrification in the automotive sector represented a significant opportunity for Tomkins. "Tomkins has secular tailwinds from electrification in the automotive sector (on which 30% of revenues are exposed) and is making an increasing contribution to green hydrogen opportunities."
Overall, the announcement of Tomkins Plc's sharp rise in half-year profits and its focus on potential acquisitions has been seen as a positive sign for the company's future growth prospects. With a strong balance sheet and a track record of successful acquisitions, Tomkins is well-positioned to continue to benefit from the ongoing shift towards more sustainable technology.
