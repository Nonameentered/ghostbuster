In a move indicative of a shift in the automotive industry, Ford Motor Company announced it will cut 1,300 jobs from its Halewood plant in Liverpool, England. The move comes as the company makes changes to its operations to focus on electric and autonomous vehicles.
Ford's Halewood plant produces the Range Rover Evoque and the Land Rover Discovery Sport, two popular SUV models. The job cuts, expected to take place over the next few months, will affect both agency and permanent staff, with negotiations currently ongoing with trade unions.
The company has said that the reduction in staff is necessary to improve the plant's efficiency and competitiveness. Despite the job cuts, Ford has vowed to continue investing in the Halewood plant, with a new vehicle concept in the works that will be announced in due course.
As part of its plan to shift towards electrified and autonomous vehicles, Ford recently announced it will stop manufacturing passenger vehicles in Brazil this year and end production at three plants in Russia. The company plans to launch its first electric vehicle in Europe in 2021, and expects 40% of its global vehicle sales to be electric by 2030.
In a statement, Ford Europe's president Stuart Rowley said: "We are taking decisive action to transform the Ford business in Europe. We will focus on our core strength, which is commercial vehicles, led by the Ford Transit, and on electric and autonomous vehicles. We are now in consultation with our unions, regarding reducing the workforce at our Halewood plant to ensure it is the right size for the volumes of business in the future."
The news of the job cuts has been met with criticism from trade unions, with Unite the Union's national officer for the automotive industry, Des Quinn, calling the decision "brutal" and "a devastating blow" to the workers at Halewood. Quinn called on Ford to provide assurances that there will be no compulsory redundancies, and said the union will "leave no stone unturned in campaigning for government support to prevent these proposed job losses."
Liverpool's mayor, Joe Anderson, has also expressed disappointment at the news, saying: "It's a devastating blow for the workers at Halewood and a stunning blow to the wider Liverpool City Region economy, which has already been hit hard by the pandemic."
The job cuts at Halewood come as the automotive industry faces a number of challenges, including shrinking demand in key markets and the need to transition to electrification and autonomous technology. The industry also faces the threat of Brexit, with the UK's departure from the EU set to cause major disruption to supply chains and regulatory frameworks.
Ford is not the only automaker to have announced job cuts recently. In January, Jaguar Land Rover announced it will cut 2,000 jobs globally as part of a restructuring plan, while Nissan said it will cut 12,500 jobs worldwide.
Despite these challenges, the shift towards electric and autonomous vehicles is seen as a major opportunity for the automotive industry. The global electric vehicle market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.1% from 2019 to 2025, according to a report from Grand View Research, while the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach $556.67 billion by 2026.
Ford's decision to cut jobs at its Halewood plant is a reminder of the challenges facing the automotive industry as it seeks to adapt to a rapidly changing market. However, it is also a sign of the opportunities that lie ahead, as automakers invest in new technologies and explore new concepts and business models.
As the industry continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see more companies make similar moves in the coming years, as they seek to stay competitive and meet the demands of consumers and regulators alike. For the workers at Halewood and other plants affected by job cuts, the road ahead may be difficult, but for the industry as a whole, the shift towards a new era of mobility presents an exciting opportunity for growth and innovation.
