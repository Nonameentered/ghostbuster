The British housing market has bounced back after being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent restrictions imposed on the economy. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the average house price in the UK rose by 8.6% in the year to March 2021, the highest annual growth rate since 2014.
The surge in house prices has been attributed to a variety of factors, including pent-up demand from the lockdown, low-interest rates, and the government's stamp duty holiday, which has been extended until the end of June. The stamp duty holiday allows homebuyers in England and Northern Ireland to save up to £15,000 on their purchase, making it more affordable to move.
However, while the housing market is booming, the same cannot be said for the building material industry. Companies that manufacture materials such as bricks, timber, and plasterboard have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted supply chains and caused shortages in the market.
One of the biggest players in the building material industry, Travis Perkins, reported a loss of £7.7m in the first half of 2020. Despite an uptick in demand for construction materials in the second half of the year, the company's revenue for the full year was down by 10.6% compared to 2019.
Other building material giants, such as Jewson and Buildbase, have also struggled in the wake of the pandemic. Both companies reported a decline in sales in 2020, with Jewson's revenue dropping by 6.4% and Buildbase's revenue falling by 10.3%.
The difficulties faced by these companies have been compounded by the ongoing supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The closure of factories and disruption to shipping and logistics has made it difficult for companies to get the materials they need to meet demand.
Despite these challenges, there are signs that the building material industry is starting to recover. The Construction Products Association (CPA) forecast that construction output in the UK will increase by 14% in 2021, with continued growth expected in 2022 and 2023.
In response to the challenges faced by the industry, the government has introduced a range of measures to support construction and building material companies. The £10bn Green Homes Grant, launched in 2020, provides funding for homeowners to undertake energy-efficient home improvements, boosting demand for construction materials and creating jobs in the industry.
In addition, the government has announced plans to introduce a new Building Safety Bill, which will reform the building safety regulatory system and strengthen accountability in the construction industry. This should help to restore confidence in the sector and attract investment to support growth and innovation.
Despite the challenges faced by the building material industry, the growth in the housing market represents an opportunity for companies that can adapt to changing market conditions and meet demand. With interest rates remaining low and the stamp duty holiday extended, there is still strong demand for properties, particularly in regions outside of London where prices have been more stable.
Companies that can improve their supply chain and adopt new technologies to improve efficiency and reduce costs are likely to be well-positioned to capture market share. The growth in the construction industry also presents an opportunity for companies that can provide sustainable and eco-friendly building materials, as consumers become more conscious of their environmental impact.
In conclusion, while the British housing market has bounced back from the pandemic, the building material industry has faced significant challenges. Companies that can adapt to changing market conditions and improve their supply chains are likely to be best positioned to take advantage of the opportunities created by growth in the sector. With government support and increased demand for sustainable building materials, the future of the industry looks promising despite the short-term struggles it has faced.
