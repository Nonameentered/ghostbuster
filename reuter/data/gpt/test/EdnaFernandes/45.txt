Crucial talks between the United Kingdom and the United States about the future of the open skies pact have been delayed due to the sudden illness of one of the senior negotiators from the UK.
The open skies agreement was first signed between the UK and the US in 2008, allowing airlines from both countries to operate flights between any destination in the other country without any restrictions. It was a great boon for airlines on both sides of the Atlantic, leading to increased competition and lower fares. However, the future of the agreement has been thrown into doubt after the UK's exit from the European Union, as the EU had previously negotiated the open skies agreement on behalf of its member states.
Negotiators from the UK and the US were set to meet this week in London to discuss the future of the agreement, but the meeting has now been postponed due to the illness of one of the UK's chief negotiators. The exact nature of the illness has not been disclosed, but sources close to the negotiator say that it is a serious condition that will require several weeks of rest and recovery.
The delay has sparked concerns among airlines on both sides of the Atlantic, as the outcome of the talks will have a major impact on their operations. Several major airlines, including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have been lobbying the UK government to secure a new open skies agreement with the US to ensure that they can continue to operate their transatlantic flights.
It is understood that the UK's negotiating team will now be led by another senior official, who is familiar with the issues at hand but may not have the same level of expertise in negotiating complex aviation agreements. The delay is also expected to give the US negotiators an advantage in the talks, as they will have more time to prepare their position and to lobby their own government for concessions.
The open skies agreement has been a key part of the aviation landscape for over a decade, but its future has been cast into doubt by Brexit and the new political landscape in both the UK and the US. The UK government has been keen to reassure airlines that a new agreement can be reached, but negotiations have been complicated by the fact that the UK is no longer part of the EU.
The US government has also been pushing for changes to the open skies agreement, seeking to ensure that US airlines have a level playing field when competing with their UK counterparts. However, it is believed that the US negotiators may be willing to compromise on some of their demands in order to secure a new agreement that benefits both sides.
The delay in the talks is a setback for the UK aviation industry, which has been struggling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Airlines have been forced to ground their planes and lay off staff due to the sharp drop in demand for air travel, and a failure to reach a new open skies agreement could compound their problems.
Despite the delay, both sides are said to be committed to reaching a new agreement that maintains the benefits of the open skies pact while addressing the concerns of both countries. However, the illness of one of the UK's negotiators has thrown a spanner in the works, and the talks are now likely to take longer than anticipated.
A spokesperson for the UK government said that they remained committed to securing a new open skies agreement with the US. "We are disappointed that the talks have been delayed, but we are confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both the UK and the US," the spokesperson said. "We wish our colleague a speedy recovery and look forward to resuming negotiations as soon as possible."
