The Ford Motor Co's Halewood plant, located in Merseyside, England, is facing a possible closure due to the decline in demand for its models.
The plant, which currently employs 4,000 workers and produces the Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Discovery Sport vehicles, has been struggling in recent years due to the increasing trend towards electric and hybrid vehicles, coupled with the economic uncertainties brought about by Brexit.
Sources within the company have indicated that there could be as many as 1,500 jobs at risk if the plant is forced to shut down, with workers in both production and administrative roles potentially affected. The closure of the facility would also have a significant impact on the local economy, with the local council warning that it could lead to a loss of around £110m ($135m) in terms of GDP.
Despite being one of the most efficient of Ford's global plants, the company has been under increasing pressure to review its operations in response to the changes in consumer demand and uncertainty around the UK's future trading relationships.
In a statement issued by the company, a spokesperson said: "We are always looking at ways to improve our operations and efficiency. As a result, we have been reviewing our operations in a number of markets and will continue to do so as part of our ongoing strategy to create a sustainably profitable business."
The spokesperson added that no final decisions had been made regarding the future of the Halewood plant, but that the company remained committed to "working with our employees, trade unions, and local stakeholders to explore all options to improve the competitiveness of the plant."
The prospect of job losses or plant closure has been met with concern by trade unions, who have already been in talks with the company about the possibility of redundancies.
Unite, the UK's largest trade union, has called on the government to help secure the future of the plant and its workers. Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool City Region, has also joined calls for action, saying: "I urge Ford to use this period of uncertainty to work with us to repurpose the site for future technologies that will safeguard jobs and prosperity."
The potential closure of the Halewood plant comes at a time of wider uncertainty for the UK car industry, which has seen a decline in sales of diesel models and a shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles, as well as Brexit-related challenges around supply chains, tariffs, and trade agreements.
Industry experts have warned that the UK car industry could face up to a £40bn ($49bn) hit if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The fate of the Halewood plant and its workers will therefore be seen as an important test case for the industry and its ability to adapt to the challenges ahead.
