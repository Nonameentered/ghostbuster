Airport operator BAA has reported steady profits for the third quarter of the year, despite a weak response from the market. The company, which operates several major airports in the United Kingdom, saw overall revenues rise by 2.4% to £2.6bn ($3.4bn).
BAA's results come amid a tough period for the aviation industry, which has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Air travel has plummeted in recent months as countries have imposed strict travel restrictions to curb the spread of the virus.
Despite this challenging backdrop, BAA has managed to maintain stable financial performance. The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose by 1.4% to £1bn ($1.3bn) in the third quarter.
"We are pleased to report another set of robust results in these difficult times," said BAA CEO John Holland-Kaye. "Our airports have seen a gradual increase in passenger numbers over the summer months, and we expect this trend to continue into the winter season."
BAA's Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport in the UK, saw a 4.5% increase in passenger traffic in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter. Gatwick Airport, the second-busiest airport in the UK, saw a 10.6% increase in passenger traffic over the same period.
However, the overall number of passengers traveling through BAA's airports remains significantly lower than in previous years. In the third quarter, BAA's airports handled a total of 10.6 million passengers – a decline of 82% compared to the same period in 2019.
The company's retail business has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, with sales in airport shops and restaurants falling sharply. BAA's retail revenues fell by 47% in the third quarter, compared to the same period last year.
Despite the challenges facing the aviation industry, BAA remains optimistic about its future prospects. The company recently secured a £1.9bn ($2.5bn) loan from private investors to fund an expansion of Heathrow Airport.
"We are confident that demand for air travel will return in the long term," said Holland-Kaye. "We are investing in our infrastructure to ensure that we can meet the needs of passengers and airlines in the years to come."
BAA's results have been welcomed by industry analysts, who say that the company's financial resilience shows that it is well-positioned to weather the current crisis. They predict that BAA's fortunes will improve as the aviation industry gradually recovers in the coming months and years.
