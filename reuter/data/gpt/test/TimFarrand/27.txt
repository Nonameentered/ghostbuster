Global consumer goods giant, Unilever, is set to announce a 10% increase in profits for the third quarter of 2021, despite facing currency woes and restructuring charges that have impacted its performance this year.
The Anglo-Dutch company, which owns well-known brands such as Dove, Lipton and Magnum, will reveal its financial results on Thursday, with analysts forecasting that Unilever's underlying sales growth may have slowed down due to a sluggish economic recovery in some parts of the world, including Asia and Europe.
However, investors and stakeholders are expected to welcome the news that the company’s net profit has still improved, hitting 1.9 billion euros during the third quarter alone, up from 1.72 billion euros in the same period last year.
Unilever’s Chief Financial Officer, Graeme Pitkethly, acknowledged the difficult economic and market conditions the company has faced this year, stating that "the global environment remains challenging and unpredictable, but we are focusing on what we can control to build a more resilient and competitive business."
One of the biggest challenges that Unilever has had to contend with this year has been currency fluctuations. With the company generating a majority of its sales in countries outside of Europe and the UK, it has been significantly impacted by the weakened US dollar, Mexican peso and Indian rupee.
Despite this, Unilever has been able to offset some of the currency challenges by increasing prices on some of its products and launching a series of cost-cutting measures over the past few months. For example, the company has aimed to trim its overhead costs, including reducing travel expenses, re-negotiating contracts with suppliers and reinvesting in advertising to promote its most popular brands.
Another significant factor that has impacted Unilever’s financial performance this year has been the cost of restructuring charges. The company has been undergoing a strategic review of its business segments, which has resulted in some job losses and the closure of certain factories and production facilities.
Pitkethly stated that “we are working to simplify our organisation and reduce complexity, which is never a straightforward process, but one that we believe will make us better placed to serve our consumers and customers in the long run.”
Despite the short-term pain caused by these restructuring charges, some analysts and investors believe that the company's strategic review will ultimately help Unilever to become more competitive in the long-term, especially as it looks to further expand its presence in emerging markets.
Unilever has already made significant investments to boost its e-commerce capabilities and expand into new categories, such as plant-based foods and sustainable cleaning products. The company has also shown a strong commitment to sustainability, including pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by 2039 and increasing its spending on sustainable packaging.
The success of these initiatives can be reflected in the fact that in September, Unilever was crowned the top-ranking company on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. The index recognizes companies that are leading in environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance – an area that Unilever has been championing for many years.
Despite the global economic uncertainty and market turbulence caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Unilever appears to be maintaining a steady course, albeit with some short-term ups and downs.
As Pitkethly noted, "we are focused on driving consistent, profitable growth and improving our operating margin. We remain confident in our long-term strategy and our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders, consumers and customers."
Investors and analysts will likely be watching closely to see if Unilever can continue to deliver consistent growth in an increasingly challenging and unpredictable global market. For now, however, the company's strong financial performance is providing a beacon of hope for others in the consumer goods sector.
