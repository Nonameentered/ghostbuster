Whitbread Plc, the UK-based hospitality company, is expected to raise Â£100 million from the sale of its underperforming retail sites, said the company's CEO Alison Brittain. The move is part of the company's ongoing efforts to focus on its core hospitality businesses and streamline its operations.
Whitbread's retail sites, which include pub and restaurant chains such as Brewers Fayre, Table Table, and Beefeater, have struggled in recent years due to tough competition from other food and drink outlets and changing consumer trends. As a result, the company has been looking to sell off some of the sites to raise cash and invest in its more profitable hospitality businesses, which include Premier Inn and Costa Coffee.
"We are committed to focusing on our core businesses and ensuring they are in a strong position for the future," said Brittain. "The retail sites have been underperforming for some time, and we believe that selling them will allow us to concentrate on our strengths and invest in our growth."
The sale of the retail sites is expected to generate significant interest from investors, as many are keen to snap up well-established brands with a strong customer base. Whitbread's brands are recognized across the UK and have a loyal following among both locals and tourists.
The sale is also expected to have a positive impact on Whitbread's finances, as the company is currently facing tough trading conditions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company reported a 76% drop in profit for the first six months of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.
Despite the challenges, however, Whitbread remains confident in its long-term prospects. "We have a strong balance sheet and a clear strategy for growth," said Brittain. "We believe that by focusing on our core businesses and investing in our people and our brands, we can continue to deliver value for our shareholders and our customers."
