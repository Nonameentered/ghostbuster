Global consumer goods company Unilever has announced a 15% rise in pre-tax profits for the first quarter of 2019, with $8 billion in sales revenue. This robust performance is thanks in part to a surge in demand for Unilever’s range of personal care products in developing markets, as well as cost-cutting measures. The UK-based company, which owns household brands including Dove, Lipton, and Ben & Jerry’s, has also revealed that it will sell its speciality chemicals businesses for €3 billion ($3.3 billion) to focus on its consumer goods portfolio.
Unilever’s speciality chemicals businesses, which include brands such as CrossChem, Bunge, and Tricon, were responsible for €2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) in revenue and €383 million ($416 million) in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) in 2018. However, the company believes that it can achieve greater value and growth by concentrating on consumer goods, where it sees more opportunities for innovation and expansion.
The sale of the speciality chemicals businesses is expected to be completed by the end of 2019, subject to regulatory approval. Unilever has already received interest from a number of potential buyers, including private equity firms and chemical manufacturers. The proceeds from the sale will be used to pay down debt, invest in core brands, and return cash to shareholders.
Unilever CEO Paul Polman said, “The sale of our speciality chemicals businesses marks a further step in reshaping our portfolio to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value. We believe that our future lies in serving the fast-changing needs of consumers, and we have a clear strategy to build our consumer goods portfolio through innovation, marketing, and expansion into new markets.”
Unilever has been exploring strategic options for its speciality chemicals businesses for some time, as part of an ongoing review of its operations. The company has faced pressure from investors to boost profitability and streamline its operations, and has responded with a series of cost-saving measures, including a shift towards more digital marketing and reduced packaging waste.
Unilever’s sale of the speciality chemicals businesses is the latest in a series of divestitures by consumer goods companies looking to focus on their core brands. Last year, Nestle sold its US confectionery business to Ferrero for $2.8 billion, while Procter & Gamble sold its beauty brands to Coty for $12.5 billion. Other companies, such as Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup, have also been restructuring in order to reduce costs and improve profitability.
Unilever’s decision to sell its speciality chemicals businesses has been welcomed by analysts, who believe that it will allow the company to focus on its more profitable and sustainable consumer goods businesses. However, some have criticised Unilever’s lack of transparency over its plans for future acquisitions, with some investors concerned that the company may miss out on opportunities to expand into new markets.
Unilever’s shares rose 2% in early trading following the announcement of its Q1 2019 results and plans to sell its speciality chemicals businesses. The company’s shares have risen by over 20% so far this year, outperforming the broader FTSE 100 index. With a market capitalisation of over $160 billion, Unilever is one of the world’s largest consumer goods companies, employing over 160,000 people in over 190 countries.
