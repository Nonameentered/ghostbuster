LASMO Plc, a leading British oil and gas exploration company, announced on Friday a near-doubling of profits in 1996, raising expectations for a strong year ahead as a result of optimistic prospects for oil prices and production.
The company's pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31, 1996, came in at $175.7 million, up from $92.3 million the previous year. During this period, LASMO's oil and gas production increased by 34% to around 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
The company's strong performance was attributed to higher oil and gas prices, which helped to offset lower production from some of its assets in the North Sea, where aging fields are starting to face challenges as the oil fields are dwindling.
The company's balance sheet remains strong, with cash balances of $153 million, which will enable it to invest in high-quality growth assets in a disciplined manner.
"We are pleased to report a strong performance in 1996, with production growth, increased reserves and strong financials. We are optimistic about the company's prospects for 1997 and beyond. The oil prices remain robust, and we are well placed to benefit from the rising oil prices," said LASMO Plc Chair, Sam Laidlaw, while commenting on the results.
LASMO has been in the exploration and production industry for over 30 years, primarily in the North Sea, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region. The company's main focus is on identifying and developing oil and gas prospects, generating strong shareholder value.
The company has an active exploration campaign planned for 1997, with a focus on the North Sea and the Asia-Pacific region, where it has had significant success in recent years. LASMO aims to secure new reserves and boost production in these regions to drive future growth.
The company is also focusing on developing joint ventures with other oil and gas companies and seeking opportunities to acquire low-cost, high-value assets to complement its existing portfolio.
Overall, the results of LASMO Plc demonstrate that it has a strong and resilient business model, which allows it to benefit from rising oil prices while staying competitive in a challenging environment. The company is well-positioned to deliver shareholder value in the future, and investors will be closely watching its progress in the coming months.
