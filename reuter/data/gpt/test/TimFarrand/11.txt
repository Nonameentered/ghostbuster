Whitbread Plc, the multinational hotel and hospitality company, has announced that David Thomas will be taking over as CEO designate from current CEO Peter Jarvis next summer.
Thomas, who is currently the Chief Financial Officer of Whitbread, has been with the company since 2016. He has played a key role in the growth and development of the company and has been instrumental in driving the financial performance of the business.
According to the company’s Chairman, Adam Crozier, David Thomas has all the right qualities and experience to take on the role of CEO. He has a deep understanding of the business and the sector as a whole, and has a proven track record of delivering results.
Announcing the appointment, Crozier said, “I am delighted to announce that David will be taking on the role of CEO designate at Whitbread. He has been an integral part of the team that has delivered strong financial performance for the business over the last few years, and I am confident that he will lead the company to further success in the future.”
Thomas himself expressed his excitement at taking on the new role, stating, “I am honoured and excited to be taking on the role of CEO at Whitbread. We have a fantastic business with some truly great brands, and I am looking forward to continuing our growth and development in the coming years.”
Thomas will be taking over from Peter Jarvis, who has been with Whitbread for over 20 years. During his time at the company, Jarvis has overseen significant growth and expansion, including the acquisition of Costa Coffee in 1995.
Under Jarvis’ leadership, Whitbread has become one of the UK’s leading hotel and hospitality companies, with a portfolio of brands that includes Premier Inn, Beefeater, and Brewers Fayre.
The announcement of Thomas’ appointment follows a period of uncertainty for the company, with reports earlier this year suggesting that Whitbread was considering a sale of its Costa Coffee business.
However, the company has now confirmed that it will be retaining Costa Coffee, and that it sees significant opportunities for growth in the business.
Thomas will take over as CEO of Whitbread designate on 6th July 2020.
