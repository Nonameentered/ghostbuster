Grand Metropolitan, the British multinational hotel and leisure company, has announced that it will sell its European food business to focus on its major brands. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
The company's food business, which includes brands such as Buitoni, Findus, and Old El Paso, generated annual sales of Â£1.6 billion in 2020. However, Grand Metropolitan has decided to sell the business to concentrate on its other brands, which include the luxury hotel chain, The Savoy, and the restaurant and pub group, Mitchells & Butlers.
In a statement, Grand Metropolitan's CEO, Simon Sherwood, said, "We have taken the decision to sell our European food business to focus on our core brands and businesses, which we believe offer greater potential for growth and profitability."
The decision to sell the food business comes after a strategic review of the company's operations, which began earlier this year. The review was prompted by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has severely disrupted the hospitality industry.
Grand Metropolitan's food business has been particularly affected by the pandemic, with sales falling by 15% in the first half of 2020. The company has also faced increased competition from online retailers and discounters, which have eaten into its market share.
The sale is expected to generate significant proceeds for Grand Metropolitan, which plans to use the funds to invest in its existing brands and businesses. The company also plans to pay down debt and return capital to shareholders.
The decision to sell the food business has been welcomed by investors, who have been calling for the company to focus on its core brands. The share price of Grand Metropolitan rose by 4% following the announcement.
However, the sale is likely to have a significant impact on the company's employees. Grand Metropolitan's food business employs over 12,000 people across Europe, and it is unclear how many jobs will be affected by the sale.
In its statement, Grand Metropolitan said that it is committed to working with employees and their representatives to minimize the impact of the sale on their jobs and livelihoods. The company has also said that it will provide support and assistance to those affected by the sale.
Overall, Grand Metropolitan's decision to sell its European food business represents a significant shift in strategy for the company. With the sale set to be completed by the end of the year, the company will be able to focus on its core brands and businesses, with the hope of achieving greater growth and profitability in the future.
