United Biscuits, the multinational British food processing company, is expecting its margins to increase in Europe over the next few years, according to the Managing Director, Jeff van der Eems.
Van der Eems stated that the company had seen significant growth in Europe, particularly in Germany, the UK, and Italy. He attributes this growth to the company's investment in new technologies, such as the automation of production lines, and its shift towards newer products that cater to evolving consumer tastes.
“We’ve been investing heavily in technology and innovation, and it’s paying dividends,” said van der Eems. “We’re seeing growth across all of our brands, and we expect this trend to continue in the coming years.”
The Managing Director cited the company’s recent acquisition of Delacre, a Belgian biscuit manufacturer, as a significant factor in their projected growth. He stated that they expect the acquisition to expand their market reach and increase their foothold in continental Europe.
“Overall, we’re very optimistic about our growth prospects in Europe,” said van der Eems. “Our investments in technology and innovation, combined with our recent acquisition of Delacre, position us to take advantage of the exciting opportunities in the European market.”
However, van der Eems acknowledged that the company faces challenges, such as rising commodity costs and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. He stated that United Biscuits is taking steps to address these challenges, such as exploring alternative ingredients and reducing waste.
Despite these challenges, van der Eems believes that United Biscuits is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in Europe. He stated that the company’s focus on innovation, technology, and sustainability will continue to drive growth and increase margins in the coming years.
