Bass, the UK-based multinational hospitality company, has announced the sale of 47 of its Holiday Inn hotels in the US for $640 million.
The hotels were sold to WBHE LLC, an affiliate of Winston Hotels Inc, a real estate investment trust specializing in hotels. The deal includes the rights to operate the hotels under the Holiday Inn brand for the next 99 years.
Bass will retain a 10% stake in one of the hotels, the Holiday Inn Bristol City Centre, located in the heart of Bristol, UK. The hotel will continue to be operated by Bass under the Holiday Inn brand.
The sale of the hotels is part of Bass's strategy to focus on higher-margin businesses such as its Premier Inn brand in the UK and InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) in the US.
"We are pleased to have completed the sale of these hotels to Winston Hotels, who we believe will be excellent stewards of the Holiday Inn brand," said Bass CEO, Peter Drucker. "This transaction reinforces our commitment to creating value for our shareholders by focusing on our core operations and reallocating capital to higher-margin businesses."
Bass acquired the Holiday Inn brand in 1990 and has since then become the world's largest hotel chain, with over 3,000 hotels in more than 100 countries.
The sale of the 47 hotels is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $222 million for Bass. The company said it will use the proceeds from the sale to pay down debt and invest in its higher-margin businesses.
"We are seeing strong demand for our Premier Inn brand in the UK and the IHG brand in the US," said Drucker. "We believe these businesses offer significant growth potential, and we are committed to investing in their future."
Bass's Premier Inn brand is a budget hotel chain that operates over 800 hotels in the UK, Ireland, and Germany. The chain has become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks in part to its focus on offering affordable prices, quality service, and comfortable rooms.
IHG, which Bass has an ownership stake in, is a global hotel company that operates over 6,000 hotels under names such as InterContinental, Crowne Plaza, and Holiday Inn. The company has a strong presence in the US, where it operates over 4,000 hotels.
The sale of the 47 Holiday Inn hotels is part of a broader trend in the hotel industry, which has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many hotel chains have been forced to close their doors or reduce their operations, leading to a significant drop in revenue and a drop in share prices.
However, some analysts believe that the worst is now over for the hotel industry, and that there are signs of recovery on the horizon. The rollout of vaccines around the world has boosted consumer confidence, and the easing of lockdown measures in many countries has led to an uptick in travel.
Bass's decision to sell the 47 hotels and focus on its higher-margin businesses is indicative of this trend, as other hotel chains are also realigning their operations to adapt to the new post-COVID landscape.
In conclusion, the sale of 47 Holiday Inn hotels for $640 million is a significant move by Bass as it continues to focus on its higher-margin businesses. The sale is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $222 million and will allow the company to pay down debt and invest in its future. With the hotel industry showing signs of recovery, Bass's decision to realign its operations is likely to pay off in the long run.
