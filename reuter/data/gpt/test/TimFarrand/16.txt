Cadbury-Schweppes, the London-based confectionery and beverage company, announced today strong first-half results and a positive outlook for full-year performance, driven by growth in emerging markets and successful product innovation.
The company reported revenue of £5.4 billion in the six months ended June 30, up 4.2% from the same period last year. Profit before tax and exceptional items increased 14.3% to £552 million, while earnings per share rose 16.1% to 29.9p.
"I am pleased with our first-half results, which reflect our focus on driving growth in our core brands and markets, while also investing in new products and capabilities," said Cadbury-Schweppes CEO John Brock. "We have made good progress towards our goal of becoming the world's leading confectionery and beverage company, and we remain optimistic about our outlook for the full year."
The company's performance was driven by strong growth in emerging markets such as Asia, the Middle East and Africa, which reported double-digit revenue growth. Cadbury-Schweppes' sales in India, for example, increased by 10% in the first half of the year, driven by increased distribution and successful launches of new products such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Silk and Bournvita biscuits.
In addition, the company's core brands, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Schweppes, continued to perform well, with revenue growth of 4.5% and 3.6% respectively. The company's innovations also contributed to its strong performance, with new products such as Cadbury Darkmilk, a new range of chocolates with a higher cocoa content, driving growth in developed markets such as Europe and North America.
"We are seeing strong demand for our core brands and innovative new products, which is driving growth across our markets," said Brock. "In addition, our focus on operational efficiency and cost control has allowed us to invest in our products and capabilities, while also delivering attractive returns to our shareholders."
Looking ahead, Cadbury-Schweppes said it expects to achieve continued revenue and profit growth in the second half of the year, driven by a combination of continued growth in emerging markets, expansion of its core brands, and successful innovations in its product portfolio.
"We are confident in our outlook for the full year, as we continue to execute on our growth strategy and strengthen our position as a leading global confectionery and beverage company," said Brock. "We remain committed to growing our business in a sustainable and responsible manner, while also delivering long-term value to our shareholders."
The positive results from Cadbury-Schweppes come at a time of increasing competition in the global confectionery and beverage industry, as consumers demand healthier and more sustainable products. In response, the company has invested in new product innovations and sustainability initiatives, including reducing its carbon footprint and promoting sustainable cocoa farming through its Cocoa Life program.
"We recognize the importance of addressing the evolving needs and preferences of our consumers, as well as the challenges facing our planet," said Brock. "We are committed to driving positive change through our products and operations, while also delivering strong financial results and value to our shareholders."
The company's strong performance also comes amidst ongoing negotiations with potential buyers for its North American beverage business. Cadbury-Schweppes announced earlier this year that it plans to spin off its North American beverage business, which includes brands such as Dr Pepper and 7UP, as a separate publicly traded company or sell it to a strategic buyer.
"While we are focused on driving growth across our business, we are also moving ahead with our plans to separate or sell our North American beverage business," said Brock. "We believe this will allow us to further simplify and focus our company, while also unlocking additional value for our shareholders."
Overall, Cadbury-Schweppes' strong first-half results and positive outlook for full-year performance demonstrate the company's continued ability to deliver on its growth strategy and position itself as a leader in the global confectionery and beverage industry. As the company continues to invest in its core brands, emerging markets and innovative new products, it appears well-positioned to drive sustainable growth and value creation over the long-term.
