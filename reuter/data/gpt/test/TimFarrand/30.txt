Unilever, the global consumer goods giant, has reported a 15% rise in profits in the first quarter of 2017. The company’s performance was driven by strong sales in emerging markets and a focus on high-margin products. Unilever plans to further boost its profitability by selling off its speciality chemicals units, which could net the company up to €6 billion.
Unilever is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of consumer goods, with popular brands such as Knorr, Dove, and Ben & Jerry’s. Its growth in emerging markets, such as China and India, has helped to offset sluggish sales in Europe and North America. The company reported underlying sales growth of 2.9% in the first quarter, which exceeded analysts’ expectations.
Unilever CEO Paul Polman said in a statement: “The first quarter demonstrates another good performance, with turnover up mainly driven by volume. All categories and geographies contributed to this growth. Our focus on premiumisation and investing in our brands continues to drive growth and strengthen our competitive position.”
Polman also announced that Unilever intends to divest its speciality chemicals business, which includes products used in detergents and other industrial applications. The move is part of the company’s strategy to focus on consumer goods and increase profitability. Polman said that Unilever’s speciality chemicals business has “limited synergies” with its wider portfolio, and that the company believes the business would have better growth prospects under new ownership.
Unilever estimates that the speciality chemicals business could be worth up to €6 billion ($6.4 billion), and that a sale could take place by the end of 2017. The company plans to use the proceeds from the sale to fund acquisitions and buybacks, as well as to increase dividends to shareholders.
The decision to sell off its speciality chemicals business could be seen as a strategic one, as Unilever looks to refocus on its core competencies. The company has been working to streamline its business in recent years, selling off underperforming brands and reducing costs in order to improve profitability.
In addition to the speciality chemicals divestment, Unilever has also announced plans to combine its food and refreshments businesses into a single unit, in order to improve efficiency and drive growth. The move is part of the company’s ongoing efforts to simplify its business and improve its competitiveness.
Unilever’s strong performance and strategic moves have been met with praise from analysts. Andrew Wood, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said: “Underlying volume growth of nearly 4% is a strong result. This is a good set of numbers, showing they are delivering on their promises. The divestment of the speciality chemicals business is a sensible move, and it’s good to see the continuation of buybacks.”
Despite the positive results, Unilever faces challenges from the wider economic environment. The Brexit vote could lead to higher costs and uncertainty in the UK, where Unilever has significant operations. The company has also faced pressure from activist investors, who have called for more aggressive cost-cutting and a focus on short-term profitability.
Unilever’s response to these challenges has been to maintain a long-term perspective and focus on sustainability. The company has set ambitious targets for reducing its environmental impact and improving the wellbeing of its employees and consumers. It has also committed to sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably by 2020.
“We remain committed to delivering superior long-term financial and social performance,” Polman said. “We are confident that we have the right strategy and the right mindset to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.”
In the context of a rapidly changing global economy and consumer market, Unilever’s strategic moves will be closely watched by investors and industry observers alike. The company’s focus on sustainability and long-term profitability could prove to be a model for other consumer goods companies looking to stay ahead in an increasingly competitive market.
