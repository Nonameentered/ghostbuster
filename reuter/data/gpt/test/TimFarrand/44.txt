London, UK - Hillsdown Holdings, the British food conglomerate, announced on Thursday that it has reported a 10.5% increase in profit for the year 1996, despite the BSE scare.
The company, which owns several popular food brands such as Wall's sausages and Chivers jams, recorded a pre-tax profit of £155.1 million in 1996, up from £140.2 million in the previous year.
The profit increase for the company comes in contrast to the widespread public panic resulting from the BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) crisis that had rocked the UK’s beef industry, causing a significant slump in sales across the sector.
Commenting on the results, a spokesperson for Hillsdown Holdings said that the company was "extremely pleased with the performance," explaining that the profit growth was driven by a strong performance in the company's key brands and cost management measures.
The spokesperson added that despite the BSE scare, Hillsdown Holdings had continued to invest in its products, resulting in increased sales and market share gains.
"We have been able to increase our sales volumes, despite the difficult market conditions, by continuing to invest in our brands and by offering a quality product range that consumers can trust," said the spokesperson.
Several analysts praised the company's performance, saying that it was a testament to the company's resilient business model.
"Hillsdown has done well to weather the BSE crisis and come out with solid profit growth," said one analyst.
"Their investment in their brands and products has paid off, and I expect that they will continue to perform well in the coming years."
Hillsdown Holdings is expected to continue investing in its brands and products, as well as seeking new opportunities for growth, both in the UK and internationally. The company is currently listed on the London Stock Exchange and has a market capitalization of £2.5 billion.
