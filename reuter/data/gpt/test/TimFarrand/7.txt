Bass's $659 Million Sale of 47 Holiday Inn Hotels Paves the Way for Global Franchise Business
Bass, one of the leading hospitality companies in the United Kingdom, has sold 47 Holiday Inn hotels in an impressive deal worth $659 million. This sale by Bass comes as they make strategic moves to focus on their higher-end brands and expand their global franchise business. Bass has been focusing on developments in their newer hotel brands, such as Holiday Inn Express and Staybridge Suites, with a plan to expand these brands globally. The sale of these 47 Holiday Inn hotels will provide the company with the required capital to pursue these plans.
The 47 hotels are located in Germany and the Netherlands, and they have been sold to a consortium led by the insurance company Allianz. The purchase price is said to be around $659 million, with Bass to pay back $107.5 million to Allianz once the hotels become fully operational again. The buyers will lease the properties to InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) for 20 years, with an option to extend for another 10 years. IHG will retain the Holiday Inn brand for these hotels, and they will continue to operate the hotels under long-term management contracts.
The sale of these 47 Holiday Inn hotels is a significant move for Bass, as it enables them to focus on their high-end brands and expand their global franchise business. The company has been investing heavily in new hotels and renovating existing ones, with a focus on their higher-end brands. This sale frees up significant capital for the company, which they can now use to invest in these newer brands.
"The sale of these 47 Holiday Inn hotels is part of our strategic plan to focus on our higher-end brands, and expand our global franchise business," said Phil Miles, CEO of Bass. "This deal will allow us to invest in new developments and refurbishments of existing properties, as well as pursue other strategic initiatives that support our growth."
The deal is also a significant move for Allianz, the leading buyer in the consortium. This acquisition marks the first time that Allianz has invested in the European hotel market. The insurance company is best known for its investments in the real estate sector, and this deal highlights their continuing interest in the European real estate market.
"We are confident that the addition of these high-quality hotels to our portfolio will generate significant long-term returns for our clients," said Philippe Vilain, Head of Real Estate Transactions for Allianz. "We continue to see opportunities for investments that offer attractive returns in the European real estate market, and this acquisition is a testament to our commitment to this sector."
The sale is likely to have a positive impact on the European hotel market, as it is one of the largest transactions in the sector this year. The deal highlights the appetite for hotel investments in Europe, with many investors looking to expand their portfolios in the region.
In conclusion, Bass's sale of these 47 Holiday Inn hotels is a significant move that paves the way for the company's strategic plan to focus on its higher-end brands and expand its global franchise business.
