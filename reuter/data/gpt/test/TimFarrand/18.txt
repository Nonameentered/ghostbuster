French luxury goods company LVMH has recently sold a third of its shares in drinks company Diageo, owners of the Guinness brand. However, Guinness has reassured investors that its joint ventures with LVMH remain secure.
LVMH, which is the world's largest luxury goods company, announced the sale of its Diageo shares in their third quarter report. The report stated that "the Group has reduced its stake in Diageo by approximately one third" and that the sale was carried out in order to "focus on its own portfolio". 
This news may have been alarming to some Guinness investors, as LVMH has been a major shareholder in Diageo for over a decade. However, in response to this development, Guinness has issued a statement reassuring its investors that "this does not affect the partnership between Guinness and LVMH, and the joint ventures between the two companies will remain unaffected." 
Indeed, the partnership between Guinness and LVMH has been a fruitful one. In 2018, the two companies opened a new brewery in Maryland, USA, where they produce Guinness Blonde American Lager. This joint venture allowed the companies to bring a new product to the market while also expanding their brand presence in the US. 
Guinness has also been working closely with LVMH to develop new products and expand into new markets. In 2019, Guinness launched a limited-edition range of beers in collaboration with luxury department store Selfridges, further showcasing their commitment to innovation and collaboration. 
In response to LVMH's recent sale of shares, Guinness has indicated that it remains focused on its growth strategy, stating that "we continue to focus on our global growth strategy, and look forward to the many exciting opportunities ahead." 
Guinness is one of the world's most iconic and recognizable beer brands, with a rich history spanning over two centuries. The brand has continued to innovate and evolve, keeping up with the changing tastes of consumers while also staying true to its heritage. 
The company is also committed to sustainability, with initiatives such as the Guinness Sustainable Agriculture Project, which aims to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Africa while also promoting sustainable farming practices. 
The partnership with LVMH allows Guinness to leverage the resources and expertise of a major luxury goods company, while also bringing its own unique brand identity and values to the table. 
While LVMH's sale of Diageo shares may be seen as a loss for the drinks company, Guinness remains optimistic about its future prospects. The company has a strong track record of growth and innovation, and its joint ventures with LVMH have been successful in the past. 
Overall, it seems that both Guinness and LVMH are well-positioned to continue their partnership and to thrive in the competitive drinks market. Investors and consumers alike can look forward to exciting new products and initiatives from this dynamic and innovative collaboration.
