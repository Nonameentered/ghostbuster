British Confectionery Sales Hit Record High of £4.9bn in 2020, with the Average Brit Eating 13kg of Sweets per Year.
The British love affair with sweets continues, as new data reveals that last year the UK's confectionery industry reached a record high, with sales topping £4.9bn.
Although the year posed plenty of challenges for the industry, including the pandemic, Brexit and health concerns, the sweet-toothed British public still managed to buy more candy than ever before, with the industry experiencing an increase in sales of 13%.
This comes as no surprise, as recent statistics indicate that the average Brit consumes 13kg of sweets per year, the equivalent of 3,238 sugar cubes.
Despite health warnings and a growing push towards healthier lifestyles, the demand for confectionery still remains high, with many Brits indulging in their favorite treats on a daily basis.
Interestingly, sales of chocolate and other sweets saw a significant spike during the pandemic, with people opting for comfort food during lockdowns.
According to market research firm Kantar, sales of sugary confectionery increased by 9.3% in the 52 weeks to 27 December 2020, with chocolate sales alone rising by 11.2%.
It seems that the pandemic's impact on the industry has not only been positive, as the government rolls out its anti-obesity campaign, aimed at reducing the UK's sugar intake.
In response to the campaign, many confectionery companies have increased their investments in healthier snacks and reduced sugar alternatives, in an effort to keep up with changing consumer preferences.
However, the industry warns that this may lead to job losses, as it may be difficult for small businesses to transition to alternative products, and may become prohibitively expensive for consumers.
Despite the challenges, the confectionery industry remains one of the most popular and profitable sectors in the UK, with exports reaching £970m in 2020, due to the high demand for British sweets abroad.
This is partly due to the UK's reputation for producing high-quality sweets, such as Haribo, Cadbury and Nestle, which are loved and recognized by consumers worldwide.
The industry is also a major contributor to the UK economy, providing thousands of jobs and supporting many small businesses across the country.
However, industry experts agree that there is still room for improvement when it comes to sugar consumption in the UK, and that alternative healthier snack options, such as fruit and nuts, should be promoted alongside traditional confectionery.
“We recognize our responsibility to help tackle obesity and are taking action to reduce sugar in our products whilst ensuring they still taste great. Our ambition is to help our customers lead healthier lives,” said a Nestle spokesperson.
Although the confectionery industry may need to adjust to changing consumer preferences in the coming years, there is no denying that the love for sweets in the UK is a long way from fading, and as long as there is demand, there will always be supply.
As the nation continues to grapple with the impacts of the pandemic, it seems that Brits will be reaching for their favorite treats more than ever before, in an effort to find some sweet comfort in challenging times.
