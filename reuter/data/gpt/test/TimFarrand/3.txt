Heineken, Britain's biggest cider maker, has released a statement playing down the impact of alcopops on its business.
The statement was made in response to recent reports that the popularity of alcopops, particularly among young people, was threatening the sales of traditional alcoholic beverages such as beer and cider.
According to Heineken's statement, the company has not seen any significant decline in sales of its cider products due to the rise in popularity of alcopops. The statement also acknowledged that the growth of the alcopops market had been driven primarily by the increasing use of social media to promote these drinks to younger audiences.
Heineken attributed its resilience to the popularity of cider, which is seen as a more traditional and authentic alcoholic beverage. The statement claimed that the cider market was continuing to grow, with new cider brands and flavors being introduced to appeal to a wider audience.
The company also emphasized its commitment to responsible drinking and acknowledged the potential risks associated with the consumption of alcopops. Heineken stated that it would continue to promote its products in a responsible manner, targeting its advertising and marketing efforts towards adult audiences.
The statement has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts, with some arguing that Heineken's confidence may be misplaced. They point to the success of alcopop brands such as WKD and Smirnoff Ice, which have become popular among younger drinkers in recent years.
Others, however, have praised Heineken's commitment to responsible drinking and its focus on the traditional cider market. They suggest that the company's strength lies in its ability to stick to its core values and target a specific consumer base, rather than trying to compete with the fast-paced trends of the alcopops market.
Overall, it remains to be seen whether Heineken's confidence in the face of the alcopops challenge will be justified. However, the company's commitment to responsible drinking and focus on traditional cider products could help it to maintain its position as Britain's biggest cider maker for years to come.
