B.A.T Industries, the global tobacco company, has reported a five percent rise in its profits, despite incurring an exceptional insurance charge. The company’s net profit for the year ending December 31, 2020, stood at $8.6 billion, up from $8.2 billion in the previous year. The figures have been welcomed by investors, who had been anticipating a decline in the company’s fortunes due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
B.A.T Industries CEO, Jack Bowles, attributed the company’s resilience to its diversified product portfolio and agile business model. “We have continued to innovate and transform our business to meet the evolving needs of our customers and consumers around the world,” he said. “We have also been proactive in managing our cost base and streamlining our operations.”
The exceptional insurance charge, which amounted to $900 million in 2020, was incurred in relation to a legal settlement with the Canadian government. The settlement, which was announced in June 2020, resolved a longstanding dispute over the recovery of healthcare costs associated with smoking-related illnesses. B.A.T Industries agreed to pay $2.2 billion over the next 25 years to cover these costs, in addition to the $900 million charge.
Despite this setback, the company’s underlying business remained strong, with revenues of $26.7 billion, a 2.5 percent increase from the previous year. The company’s cigarette volumes were also up by 0.3 percent, driven by market share gains in several key markets, including Russia, Pakistan, and Nigeria. The company’s non-combustible product portfolio, which includes vaping and heated tobacco products, continued to grow, with revenues up by 20 percent year-on-year.
“We are seeing strong demand for our non-combustible products, particularly in markets where consumers are looking for alternatives to traditional cigarettes,” Bowles said. “We are committed to transitioning our business towards these products, which we believe will be an important part of the future of the tobacco industry.”
B.A.T Industries’ results have been welcomed by investors, with the company’s share price rising by 3.5 percent following the announcement. The company also announced a dividend of 215.6 cents per share, an increase of 2.6 percent from the previous year.
The company’s strong performance comes at a time of significant change in the tobacco industry, with increasing regulation and public health concerns about the negative effects of smoking. B.A.T Industries has been at the forefront of efforts to develop and promote alternatives to traditional cigarettes, including e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products.
The company’s focus on innovation and sustainability has also been recognized by external stakeholders. B.A.T Industries was recently included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 19th consecutive year, and was named as one of the world’s most sustainable companies by Corporate Knights.
“Sustainability is at the heart of our business, and we are committed to making a positive impact in the communities where we operate,” Bowles said. “We are constantly looking for ways to reduce our environmental footprint and support sustainable agriculture practices.”
Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, B.A.T Industries remains optimistic about its future prospects. The company’s diversified portfolio, strong brands, and focus on sustainable innovation are seen as key strengths in a rapidly changing industry.
“As we look to the future, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead,” Bowles said. “We will continue to drive growth and innovation, while remaining true to our commitments to sustainability and responsibility.”
