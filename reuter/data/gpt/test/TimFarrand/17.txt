Cadbury-Schweppes is aiming to become one of the top three confectionery companies in the world by the year 2000. The company has set this ambitious target as part of its overall strategy to increase sales and profitability.
To achieve this goal, Cadbury-Schweppes is focusing on a number of key areas. Firstly, the company plans to expand its product range to include more popular and innovative products. It is also investing heavily in marketing and advertising campaigns, to raise awareness about its brand and products.
In addition, Cadbury-Schweppes is looking to expand its distribution network, to reach a wider audience. The company has already established a strong presence in many countries around the world, including the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand.
Cadbury-Schweppes is also focused on improving the quality of its products, to satisfy the increasingly discerning tastes of consumers. The company has introduced a number of new products in recent years, including a range of low-calorie and sugar-free options.
The company's ambitious goal has been welcomed by analysts, who believe that Cadbury-Schweppes has the potential to become a major player in the global confectionery market. However, some experts have warned that achieving the top three ranking will not be easy, given the intense competition in the sector.
Cadbury-Schweppes is facing tough competition from other leading confectionery companies, such as Mars, Nestle and Hershey. These companies have long established brands and significant market share, which could make it difficult for Cadbury-Schweppes to achieve its goal.
Nevertheless, Cadbury-Schweppes is confident that it can succeed, thanks to its strong brand and innovative products. The company has a long history in the confectionery industry, dating back to the early 19th century.
Cadbury-Schweppes is also well-known for its commitment to corporate social responsibility. The company has established a range of sustainability initiatives, aimed at reducing its environmental impact and improving the welfare of farmers who supply its cocoa.
Overall, Cadbury-Schweppes' aim to become one of the top three confectionery companies in the world by 2000 is a bold and ambitious target. The company will need to continue to innovate and invest in its brand and product range, to remain competitive in an increasingly crowded market.
With its strong reputation and commitment to sustainability, however, Cadbury-Schweppes is well positioned to achieve its goal. By focusing on quality, innovation and customer satisfaction, the company can build a loyal following and establish itself as a major player in the global confectionery market.
