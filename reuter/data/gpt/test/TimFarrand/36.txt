LASMO CEO has predicted that Brent crude oil prices will average at $19 per barrel for the year, despite short-term price weakness caused by the ongoing coronavirus crisis. The oil market has seen unprecedented demand destruction in recent months due to lockdowns and travel restrictions. However, the CEO believes that a gradual return of demand in the second half of the year will support a recovery in oil prices. The price of Brent crude oil has already rebounded significantly from its lows in April, but remains far below its pre-crisis levels.
