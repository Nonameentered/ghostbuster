British Cider Maker Matthew Clark Unveils Plan to Combat Alcopops and Price Wars
British cider giant Matthew Clark has revealed plans to combat the rise of alcopops and price wars in the beverage industry.
The company, which produces popular brands including Strongbow and Bulmers, has announced a new marketing strategy aimed at repositioning cider as a premium beverage, rather than a cheap alternative to beer and alcopops.
This move comes in response to the rising popularity of alcopops – pre-mixed alcoholic drinks with fruity flavours – and price wars in the alcohol industry, which have pushed cider prices down and threatened to erode the quality and reputation of the product.
According to Matthew Clark's Managing Director, Julian Momen, the company's new strategy will focus on promoting cider as a sophisticated and natural drink, made from locally sourced fruits and traditional brewing methods.
"Our goal is to reframe cider as a premium drink, rather than a cheap, mass-market alternative to beer and alcopops," he said. "We want consumers to appreciate the quality and authenticity of cider, and recognise it as a versatile, refreshing, and sophisticated drink that can be enjoyed in a range of settings."
To achieve this, Matthew Clark will invest heavily in marketing campaigns that highlight the provenance and quality of its cider brands, as well as their versatility and suitability for different occasions and tastes.
The company plans to work closely with retailers and hospitality venues to create bespoke cider menus and tasting experiences, and to host events and promotions that showcase the diversity and complexity of cider as a beverage.
"We know that many consumers are looking for high-quality, authentic drinks that reflect their personal values and lifestyle," Momen said. "By positioning cider as a natural, local, and artisanal drink, we hope to tap into this trend and offer a premium alternative to mass-produced and synthetic alcopops."
The move comes as the wider alcohol industry continues to grapple with a range of challenges, including rising consumer demand for healthier and more sustainable products, tighter regulations on alcohol marketing and sales, and shifting social attitudes towards drinking.
In response, many producers are turning to innovative marketing strategies and product designs to stand out from the crowd and capture new customers.
Matthew Clark's focus on repositioning cider as a premium beverage echoes similar moves by other sector players, such as Heineken, which recently launched a range of premium cider brands under its Strongbow label.
However, the success of these campaigns will ultimately depend on changing consumer perceptions and behaviours, as well as adapting to broader shifts in the drinks market, such as the rise of non-alcoholic and low-alcohol beers and spirits.
Nevertheless, Momen is confident that Matthew Clark's new strategy will resonate with consumers and help to sustain the cider industry for years to come.
"We believe that cider has a unique and exciting story to tell, and we're committed to sharing that story with as many people as possible," he said. "Whether you're enjoying a cider in a pub garden, at a festival, or at home with friends, we want our drinks to be the epitome of quality, taste, and style."
