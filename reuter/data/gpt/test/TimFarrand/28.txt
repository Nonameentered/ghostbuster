Dalgety Plc, a leading agribusiness company, reported an 8.5% decline in profits due to falling sales of beef and animal feeds, adversely impacted by the outbreak of mad-cow disease. The company announced that its pre-tax profits had dropped from £56.3 million last year to £51.5 million this year.
Dalgety produces animal feeds, fertilizers, and seeds, and also deals in meat and grain processing. The company is a major supplier of animal feeds and beef to farmers in the UK, and therefore has been severely impacted by the outbreak of BSE, also known as mad-cow disease.
The outbreak of BSE has led to plummeting beef sales as consumers have become increasingly wary of consuming beef products. The government's decision to ban beef exports has also had a significant impact on the company's revenues. As farmers have reduced their herds due to a drop in demand, Dalgety's sales of animal feed have also reduced.
Commenting on the results, the company's chief executive, John Brown, said, "We are facing a challenging market due to the outbreak of BSE, which has affected both our beef and animal feed businesses. However, we have taken a number of steps to address these challenges, including reducing costs, improving operational efficiency, and investing in new products."
The company has responded to the crisis by expanding its range of animal feeds for other livestock, such as pigs and poultry, which has generated some growth. However, this growth has been outweighed by the significant drop in beef sales.
Brown also highlighted the company's investments in new products, such as genetically modified seeds that offer better yields and pest resistance. "We are constantly innovating and investing in new technology to stay ahead of the curve," he said.
Despite the challenging market conditions, Brown expressed confidence in the company's ability to weather the storm. "We have a strong balance sheet and a solid track record of navigating through tough times. Our focus is on delivering value to our shareholders in the long term," he said.
Looking ahead, Brown said that the company would continue to look for opportunities to diversify its product range and expand into new markets. "We are exploring new avenues for growth, such as organic farming and sustainable agriculture. We believe that these areas offer significant potential for the future," he said.
In summary, the outbreak of BSE has dealt a severe blow to Dalgety Plc's profits, but the company remains optimistic about its future. The company's response to the crisis has been proactive and innovative, and its focus on long-term value creation is likely to serve it well in the coming years.
