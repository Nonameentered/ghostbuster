Global consumer goods conglomerate Unilever announced on Wednesday that it plans to sell-off its specialty chemicals divisions, raising billions in the process.
The move comes as part of Unilever's stated goal of streamlining its business operations and focusing more closely on its core consumer products, which include popular brands such as Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry's ice cream.
In a statement, Unilever CEO Paul Polman said that the decision to sell the specialty chemicals units was part of a wider strategic shift that had been in the works for several years.
"We have been reviewing our business portfolio for some time now, and we believe that the time is right to divest our specialty chemicals divisions," Mr Polman said.
"By doing so, we can free up resources and invest more heavily in our core consumer businesses, which is where we see the most growth potential in the coming years."
The specialty chemicals units in question are responsible for producing a range of products that are used in the manufacturing and processing of a variety of industrial goods, including toiletries, food and beverages, and cleaning products.
Unilever expects to raise around â‚¬6 billion ($7.4bn) from the sale of the divisions, with funds earmarked for a variety of purposes, including paying down debt, boosting shareholder returns, and investing in research and development of new consumer products.
The news was welcomed by many financial analysts, who had been predicting such a move from Unilever for some time.
"Unilever has been trading at a discount to its peer group for some time, largely due to concerns about its diversified business portfolio and its exposure to slower-growing markets," said James Edwards, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
"By shifting its focus to those parts of the business that are most likely to generate growth in the years ahead, Unilever can better position itself for success in the long run."
Unilever's decision to sell the specialty chemicals units also comes at a time of increasing pressure on the company from shareholders, who have been pushing for greater transparency and accountability.
Earlier this year, the company faced a high-profile campaign from hedge fund Elliot Advisors, which called for the company to relocate its headquarters to the Netherlands and simplify its corporate structure.
While Unilever initially resisted these calls, the company eventually relented in March, announcing that it would be moving its headquarters to Rotterdam and adopting a simplified single-entity structure.
The company's decision to sell the specialty chemicals units is seen by many as further evidence of this trend towards simplification and streamlining.
"Unilever has always been known for its diverse range of products and operations, but it appears that the company is now recognizing that this diversification can be a hindrance rather than a help," said Andrew Baker, an analyst at Liberum.
"By focusing on its core consumer businesses, Unilever can better position itself for success in a fast-changing business landscape."
Unilever has not yet announced a timeline for the sale of the specialty chemicals divisions, but the company says that it will work closely with potential buyers to ensure a smooth transition.
Despite the announcement, Unilever shares were down 1.55% in early trading on Wednesday, although the stock has largely recovered since then.
