Peter Jarvis, the outgoing CEO of Whitbread, has praised his successor, Alison Brittain, as an "inspired retailer" who is well-equipped to lead the company to new heights. Brittain, who is set to take over from Jarvis in December, is currently the CEO of Lloyds Banking Group's retail businesses. Speaking to reporters, Jarvis said he had been impressed by Brittain's "commercial acumen" and her "passion for great customer service." He went on to describe her as "a clear and decisive leader" who would be able to steer Whitbread through the challenges ahead.
Whitbread, which owns brands including Premier Inn and Costa Coffee, has been expanding rapidly in recent years, but faces tough competition from rivals such as Starbucks and Hilton. Brittain, who has spent 25 years in the retail and banking sectors, has a track record of successfully growing businesses and improving customer experiences. Analysts are predicting that she will bring fresh energy and ideas to Whitbread's management team when she takes the reins later this year.
