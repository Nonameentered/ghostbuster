London, UK - Business analysts are predicting that Unilever is unlikely to bid for French food corporation Danone, due to a clash in strategy and regulatory hurdles.
Danone has been the center of takeover speculation in recent months, with a number of large food companies expressing interest in acquiring the firm. Unilever was one of the names thrown into the mix, with speculation rife that the company could be preparing a bid.
However, according to industry experts, Unilever is unlikely to make an offer due to differences in strategy and regulatory hurdles. Unilever is primarily focused on personal care and home care products, whereas Danone's primary focus is food and beverage products.
"Unilever's strategy is very different from that of Danone," said Vicky Sternberg, an analyst at investment bank Morgan Stanley. "It is highly unlikely that the company would want to divert resources away from its core focus on personal and home care products to acquire a food and beverage business."
In addition to differences in strategy, regulatory hurdles are also likely to make a bid for Danone difficult. The French government has indicated that it would not welcome a foreign takeover of one of the country's largest food companies, a stance that could make any potential acquisition of Danone by Unilever or any other foreign suitor difficult.
"France has a long history of protecting its national champions from foreign takeovers," said Sternberg. "It is highly likely that the French government would use its regulatory leverage to make it difficult for Unilever to acquire Danone."
Danone itself has also been taking steps to make itself a less attractive target for potential bidders. In May, the company announced a major restructuring plan aimed at increasing profitability and improving the company's share price. The plan involves cutting costs, streamlining operations, and selling off underperforming businesses.
"Danone is clearly taking steps to improve its financial performance and make itself less attractive to potential bidders," said Sternberg. "This makes it even less likely that Unilever, or any other company, will make a bid for Danone."
Despite the challenges facing potential bidders, Danone's share price has continued to rise in recent weeks as investors speculate about the possibility of a takeover. Some analysts believe that the company could be a target for private equity firms or other financial investors, who may be less concerned about regulatory hurdles and strategic differences.
"Danone remains an attractive target for private equity firms or financial investors who may be willing to take a longer-term view on the company's prospects," said Richard Kramer, an analyst at research firm Arete.
However, Kramer also pointed out that even private equity firms would face regulatory hurdles in a potential bid for Danone.
"Even private equity firms would need to be mindful of regulatory hurdles in a potential bid for Danone," said Kramer. "It is unlikely that the French government would be any more welcoming to a private equity takeover of the company than it would be to a foreign acquisition."
Overall, analysts seem to be in agreement that Unilever is unlikely to make a bid for Danone, due to both strategic differences and regulatory hurdles. While private equity or financial investors may still be interested in the company, any potential bidder is likely to face significant challenges in acquiring Danone.
