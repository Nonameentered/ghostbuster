Stakis Plc, a leading hotel and casino operator, has reported a surge in casino visitors and a rise in hotel room rates, showing a strong recovery in the hospitality industry. The company, which operates several hotels and casinos in the UK, has seen a significant increase in visitor numbers since the easing of COVID-19 restrictions earlier this year.
According to Stakis Plc's latest financial report, the company's casino revenue increased by 25% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven by a surge in visitor numbers, as people are seeking out a fun and safe entertainment experience after months of lockdown.
The company's hotels have also seen a rise in bookings and room rates. The average room rate increased by 15% in the second quarter of 2021, compared to the previous year, as demand for leisure and business travel continues to recover.
David Smith, CEO of Stakis Plc, said that the strong performance of the company's casinos and hotels was a result of the hard work and dedication of its employees. “We are pleased to see that our visitors are returning to our casinos and hotels, and we are committed to providing them with a safe and enjoyable experience,” he said.
The positive performance of Stakis Plc's casinos and hotels is a good sign for the UK tourism industry, which has suffered greatly due to the pandemic. With the relaxation of restrictions and the acceleration of the vaccination program, many people are planning their next holidays and weekends away. Stakis Plc's portfolio of hotels and casinos is well positioned to attract these visitors and provide them with a memorable and fun experience.
Stakis Plc has also implemented strict health and safety measures to ensure the safety of its employees and visitors. These measures include increased cleaning and sanitation, social distancing, and the use of face masks in certain areas. The company has also adopted contactless payment systems and implemented online check-in and contactless room service to reduce the risk of transmission.
With the ongoing recovery of the tourism industry, Stakis Plc is optimistic about its future prospects. The company continues to invest in its properties to improve guest experience and attract more visitors. “We are confident that we can deliver sustainable growth and value for our shareholders,” said David Smith.
Overall, the surge in casino visitors and rise in hotel room rates reported by Stakis Plc is a positive sign for the UK tourism industry. With the implementation of strict health and safety measures, people can enjoy a safe and enjoyable leisure and travel experience. The recovery of the hospitality industry is vital for the UK's economic growth, and Stakis Plc's performance is a good indication that the sector is moving in the right direction.
