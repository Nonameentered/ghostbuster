Cider maker Matthew Clark has bounced back after a tough year of losses. Despite experiencing a 9.5% dip in revenue, the company has recently regained its footing. This recovery is attributed to the new cider range, which was launched last year, and the company's focus on customer service. Also, the introduction of innovative packaging allowed the company to adapt to the changing market. Sales are increasing, and Matthew Clark is looking forward to a strong year. "We still have much to accomplish, but the renewed growth is exciting for us and customers alike," commented the company's CEO.
