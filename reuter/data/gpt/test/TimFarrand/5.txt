Greenalls Plc, one of the leading hospitality and leisure companies in the UK, has reported that it has seen a surge in Christmas bookings and an increase in consumer confidence in the wake of the news of a Covid-19 vaccine.
The London-based company, which owns a portfolio of hotels, restaurants, and bars across the UK, said it is optimistic about the future, buoyed by the news that vaccines will be rolled out across the country in the coming weeks.
Greenalls Plc, which operates under the name of its flagship brand De Vere, said it has seen a surge in demand for its hotels and restaurants during the festive period, with bookings increasing by more than 50% in the past few weeks.
The company's CEO, Richard Balfour-Lynn, said he was pleased with the strong performance during the challenging times of the pandemic, adding that it reflects the hard work and dedication of the staff.
"We are delighted to see such strong demand for our hotels and restaurants during what has been an extremely challenging year," Balfour-Lynn said. "We are constantly striving to deliver exceptional experiences for our guests,  and this demonstrates that our efforts are paying off."
According to the company, it has also seen a notable increase in consumer confidence, with many people feeling more comfortable about traveling and visiting public places, thanks to the news of the vaccine.
The hospitality industry has been one of the hardest-hit sectors since the outbreak of the pandemic, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat as a result of lockdown measures and social distancing guidelines.
However, the announcement of effective vaccines has brought a glimmer of hope, with many people now feeling more optimistic about the future and confident about spending money on leisure activities.
Balfour-Lynn said that the company will be working hard to ensure that its hotels and restaurants are operating safely and in line with government guidelines, to give guests peace of mind.
"Our priority is always the safety and wellbeing of our guests and staff, and we will continue to ensure that all of our establishments are operating in a Covid-secure manner," he said.
Greenalls Plc has a diverse portfolio of brands, including De Vere, Country Bars & Inns, and Village Hotel Club. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, the company has continued to expand its offerings, opening new hotels and restaurants in various locations across the UK.
While Covid-19 will continue to impact consumer behavior and the hospitality industry, Greenalls Plc remains optimistic that the rollout of the vaccine will help to stimulate growth in the sector.
As the UK prepares to enter a new phase in the fight against the pandemic, with the rollout of mass vaccination programs, there is a growing sense of hope and optimism in the hospitality industry for a brighter future.
Greenalls Plc is one of the companies leading the way in this regard, and its strong performance during the festive period is a clear indication that there is still an appetite for quality hospitality experiences, even in difficult times.
