Reckitt and Colman Plc (RB) are expected to report a 15% increase in full-year profits, thanks to their Lysol and Finish products acquisition. The company, which operates across various consumer health and hygiene sectors, announced that it had acquired Lysol and Finish from L&F Products last year.
RB's management is pleased with the progress of the integration of these acquisitions, which have contributed to the company's overall growth. Management cited strong demand from consumers who are more concerned about cleanliness in the wake of the pandemic. With their health and hygiene focused products, RB is confident it will see continued growth both through a surge in demand and through more acquisitions to further broaden their product offerings.
RB has a long history of acquisitions, starting with their merger with Colman's Mustard back in 1995. The company's acquisition strategy has continued over the years, with notable purchases including Schiff Nutrition International, maker of Airborne immune supplements, in 2013 and Mead Johnson Nutrition Corp making baby food, in 2017.
The Lysol and Finish acquisition is followed by the recent announcement that RB has agreed to acquire Biofreeze Pain Relief and TheraPearl Pain Relief from Performance Health, which operates in healthcare, self-care, and professional market segments for a total estimated $750m.
The strong performance of the company's Hygiene Home division that includes Lysol and Finish made up for the weaker-than-expected sales of its health business in Europe. 
RB, the makers of Nurofen, Strepsils and Gaviscon, reported in October that third-quarter sales had been influenced by a “difficult external environment”.
The company, which has its headquarters in Slough, UK, will announce its full-year results on 10 February.
Investors seem to be responding favorably as RB's stock price has been on the rise in anticipation of these announcements. The stock has gained over 25% in the past year after declining in value in 2019.  
RB's long-term growth strategy appears to be sustainable, driven by their focus on health, hygiene and wellness. With a significant increase in demand for such products due to the pandemic, RB is well positioned to capitalize on this trend, and it is expected that the company will continue to seek acquisitions in relevant markets and segments.
