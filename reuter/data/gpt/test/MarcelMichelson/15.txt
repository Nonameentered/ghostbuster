Thomson SA, the French multinational conglomerate, has declined to comment on a report suggesting that the company's management is in favor of a market float for Thomson-CSF, its defense subsidiary.
According to the report, which appeared in the Financial Times on Wednesday, Thomson SA is considering a number of options for Thomson-CSF, which could include a sale to a strategic buyer or an initial public offering.
The report, citing unnamed sources, said that Thomson SA's management team prefers a market float as it would provide more flexibility and would be less disruptive to the business. A sale to a strategic buyer could result in a significant loss of talent and expertise, while an IPO would allow Thomson SA to retain a stake in the company and benefit from any future growth in the defense sector, the report said.
Thomson-SA's CEO, Olivier Guillaumin, declined to comment on the report when reached by phone by the Financial Times.
A spokesperson for Thomson SA also declined to comment when contacted by the newspaper. The spokesperson said that the company does not comment on market speculation or rumors.
However, the spokesperson did acknowledge that the company's management team is constantly reviewing its strategic options and considering various scenarios for its subsidiaries.
Thomson-CSF is a major player in the global defense industry, with a focus on advanced electronic systems and equipment. The company has a strong track record of innovation and has won numerous awards for its cutting-edge technology.
Thomson-SA acquired the business in 1998, when it was known as Thomson-CSF. The company was renamed Thales in 2000, but the defense subsidiary retained the Thomson-CSF name.
Thales has since grown significantly, through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. The company now operates in more than 50 countries and has over 80,000 employees.
A market float for Thomson-CSF would likely attract a great deal of attention from investors, given the strong growth prospects for the defense industry. Many countries are increasing their defense spending, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions around the world.
However, any decision on a market float for Thomson-CSF would likely take some time, given the complexity of the business and the need for thorough due diligence.
Thomson SA's management team will also need to consider a number of other factors, including the potential impact on the company's overall strategy, the competitive landscape, and the regulatory environment.
It remains to be seen what the ultimate fate of Thomson-CSF will be, but a market float could represent an attractive option for both the parent company and potential investors.
