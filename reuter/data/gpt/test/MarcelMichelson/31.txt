France Telecom has acquired full control of Keystone Communications, a leading telecommunications company that specializes in providing high-speed internet, voice, and television services to customers across North America. The move is part of France Telecom's efforts to strengthen its position in the highly competitive North American TV market.
Having previously held a 48% stake in Keystone Communications, France Telecom has now acquired the remaining 52% stake from its joint venture partner, which will enable the company to integrate Keystone's operations more closely with its own and take advantage of synergies between the two businesses.
France Telecom is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, with operations in over 100 countries. In recent years, the company has been looking to expand its presence in the North American market, which is currently dominated by Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon.
The acquisition of Keystone Communications will give France Telecom access to a larger customer base, as well as deeper insights into the North American market. Keystone currently serves more than 1.2 million households across 16 states, providing them with a range of services, including high-speed internet, voice, and TV.
By acquiring Keystone, France Telecom will be able to extend its offering in the region, providing customers with a more comprehensive range of services. The company will also be able to leverage Keystone's expertise in the TV sector, an area in which France Telecom has identified significant growth potential in North America.
Commenting on the acquisition, Stephane Richard, CEO of France Telecom, said: "We are very pleased to take full control of Keystone Communications. We believe that this acquisition will provide us with a strong platform for growth in the North American TV market and enhance our ability to offer our customers a comprehensive range of services. We look forward to working with the talented team at Keystone to build on their success and further strengthen our position in this key market."
France Telecom is not the only company looking to expand its presence in the North American TV market. A number of other telecoms companies, including British Telecom and Telstra Corporation, are also seeking to capitalize on the growing demand for high-quality TV services in the region.
However, France Telecom's acquisition of Keystone Communications is a significant step forward in its efforts to become a major player in the North American market. With Keystone now fully integrated into its operations, the company is well-positioned to compete with its rivals and capitalize on the growing demand for TV services in the region.
