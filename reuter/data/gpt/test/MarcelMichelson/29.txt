France's new telecommunications regulator, Arcep, has ordered France Telecom to revisit its proposal for pricing infrastructure use as part of ongoing efforts to ensure a more competitive and equitable telecommunications market in the country.
Under the current system, France Telecom, which owns the country's telecom network infrastructure, charges a substantial amount to its competitors for access to its network. This has long been a contentious issue, with many arguing that the pricing structure creates a barrier to entry for smaller players and stifles competition in the market.
In response to these concerns, France Telecom submitted a proposal earlier this year which outlined a new pricing system. Under the proposal, competitors would pay a fixed rate based on the amount of bandwidth they use, rather than the current pricing structure which charges a per-user fee.
However, Arcep has raised concerns about the proposed pricing structure, arguing that it could still lead to excessive fees that would prevent smaller players from being able to compete. In a statement, the regulator said that France Telecom's proposal "ignores the very real risk that new entrants, particularly small and medium-sized operators, would face prohibitive prices and become unable to offer competitive services".
As a result, Arcep has ordered France Telecom to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new proposal that takes into account the concerns raised by the regulator. Arcep has said that it is committed to working with France Telecom to find a solution which promotes competition in the market while also ensuring that France Telecom is able to maintain and improve its infrastructure.
The move has been welcomed by industry experts, who say that it is an important step towards creating a more level playing field in the telecommunications market in France.
Speaking to Reuters, Sebastien Soriano, the head of Arcep, said that the regulator was determined to promote competition in the market, but also recognized the importance of ensuring that France Telecom is able to invest in its infrastructure.
"We want a fair and competitive market that encourages investment and innovation, and we are determined to work with France Telecom and other players in the market to achieve this goal," he said.
France Telecom has said that it will work with Arcep to come up with a new pricing proposal that takes into account the regulator's concerns. In a statement, the company said that it was committed to promoting competition and innovation in the market.
"We appreciate the concerns raised by Arcep and are committed to working with the regulator to ensure that our pricing structure promotes competition in the market while also allowing us to invest in and improve our infrastructure," the statement said.
The move comes as part of wider efforts by the French government to promote competition and innovation in the telecommunications market. In recent years, the government has introduced a number of measures aimed at breaking up the dominance of France Telecom and promoting the growth of smaller players in the market. With the latest move by Arcep, it seems that these efforts are continuing to bear fruit.
