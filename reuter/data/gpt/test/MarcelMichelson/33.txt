Geneva-based SGS-Thomson Microelectronics SA, a global provider of semiconductor solutions, announced its 1996 earnings on Wednesday, reporting a 19% rise from 1995. However, the company warned of a weak first quarter in 1997 due to declining sales.
SGS-Thomson's net income for the full year in 1996 was US$461m, up from US$387m in 1995, and its earnings per share increased to US$1.17 from 97 cents in 1995. This was a result of strong sales of products such as chips for modems and MP3 players, which helped the company offset weakness in its automotive and telecommunications sectors.
The company's overall revenue in 1996 rose by 14% to US$6.3bn, up from US$5.53bn in 1995. However, the company's revenue growth was due in part to acquisitions, including the acquisition of Motorola's semiconductor division. Excluding these acquisitions, SGS-Thomson's revenue growth was only 3.9% in 1996 compared to 1995.
Despite the strong financial performance in 1996, the company's outlook for the first quarter of 1997 is bleak. SGS-Thomson's chairman, Pasquale Pistorio, attributed the weak outlook to declining sales in its automotive and telecommunications businesses. He stated that the company is seeing fewer orders from these sectors due to "the general economic slowdown and the adverse impact of the strong Swiss franc".
SGS-Thomson's automotive business, which makes up about one-third of the company's sales, has been hit hard by economic problems in Europe, where auto sales have been declining. The company's telecommunications business has also been hurt by slowdowns in the global economy. Pistorio noted that these market challenges will force SGS-Thomson to cut costs, including reducing investment in its plants and decreasing the number of employees.
"Despite the difficulties that we are encountering, we have confidence in our group's ability to deal with these downturns," Pistorio said in a statement.
SGS-Thomson's warning about its first-quarter 1997 earnings follows similar announcements by other technology companies. Last month, IBM Corp., the world's largest computer maker, announced weak earnings for the fourth quarter of 1996 and warned of a slow first quarter of 1997. Sun Microsystems Inc., a leading provider of computer servers, also announced weak earnings and warned of a slowdown in the first quarter of 1997.
SGS-Thomson has been working to reduce its business dependence on any one region or market sector. The company has been expanding its presence in emerging markets such as Asia, where it opened a manufacturing plant in China in 1996. The company has also been working to develop new chip technologies, including chips for DVD players and digital cameras.
SGS-Thomson's stock has been performing well in recent months, in part due to the strong earnings in 1996. The stock has risen nearly 50% in value from its 52-week low of US$20.75 in August 1996 to approximately US$30.00 in recent trading.
Despite the current challenges facing the company, SGS-Thomson's long-term prospects appear bright. The company's strong financial performance in 1996 and focus on developing new technologies and expanding into emerging markets should help it weather the current economic slowdown and position it for future growth.
