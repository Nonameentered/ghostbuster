Paris, France - The French state has approved a financial boost of $2.09 billion aid injection for the ailing electronics company Thomson SA, hoping to rescue the once-promising company's struggling fortunes. However, labor unions associated with the company have demanded the total cancellation of the privatization sale.
Thomson SA has been facing financial difficulties for several years now, even as the company struggles to keep up with technological advancements and increasing competition in the global electronics market. However, the crisis deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a severe decline in revenue and cutting employees' salaries and benefits.
On Monday, the French government announced its plans to inject $2.09 billion into Thomson SA to save the struggling company, including $646 million in equity and $1.44 billion in state-guaranteed loans.
The government's decision comes eight years after the French state sold 70% of the company to the international investment fund, the US-based Vector Capital. The sale was a part of an effort to revive the troubled French economy.
However, labor unions linked to Thomson SA have criticized the government decision, saying the aid is only a partial solution to the company's woes. They demand a complete cancellation of the privatization sale and a more significant investment by the state to restructure the company's operations and boost employment.
"In the mid-term, political commitment is needed to build a real plan around Thomson SA, to re-invest, to relocate and preserve its jobs and activities," said a joint statement issued by the CFDT, CFE-CGC, FO, and CGT unions.
The unions also called for the government to increase its initial investment to $3.7 billion, cancel all the interest payments generated on the Vector Capital sale, and limit the fund's financial gain from its Thomson SA investment.
Thomson SA was once a renowned French electronics company, famous for its TV and stereo systems. It was established in 1879 and later diversified into everything from access control to audiovisual systems. In the early 2000s, however, the company began facing a flurry of negative headwinds, from increased competition from Asian manufacturers to the rise of LCD and digital entertainment.
Despite the government's aid, The company's future remains uncertain. The electronics market is constantly evolving, and it remains to be seen if Thomson SA can keep up and maintain its place in the highly competitive field. While the company's workers are somewhat relieved with the government aid, they are still anxious about the future.
"We have to find ways to make sure this never happens again," said André André Bouchardy, one of the union representatives after the government announcement. "We have to make sure we stay relevant, we keep up, and we keep delivering products that people want, now and tomorrow."
The French government's decision to aid a struggling company amidst a pandemic has sparked a national debate, with some calling it a valuable investment for France's economy and others arguing it is a waste of taxpayer's money. However, only time will tell if the bailout will prove to be a game-changer for Thomson SA or just a financial band-aid for another ailing French business.
