Baku, Azerbaijan - French oil group Elf Aquitaine has inked a landmark deal with Azerbaijan, in a move to further enhance its foothold in the Caspian Sea region. Elf Aquitaine is set to acquire a 20% stake in the Absheron gas field in Azerbaijan under the agreement, which was signed on Tuesday. The deal marks the first time a French company has gained access to the energy resources in the country.
Elf Aquitaine's 20% stake in the Absheron project will give the company access to a total of around 1.5 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. The gas field is located in the Caspian Sea, near the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) fields that are currently being operated by BP. Elf Aquitaine has been seeking to expand its presence in the region, and this deal is expected to provide the company with a significant boost.
The Absheron gas field is estimated to be capable of producing up to 5.2 billion cubic meters of gas per year. This will help to meet the rapidly growing demand for natural gas in Europe, which is expected to continue to rise in the coming years. Elf Aquitaine's acquisition of a stake in the field will also help to diversify the company's portfolio, which is currently heavily weighted towards oil.
The deal was signed in Baku by Elf Aquitaine CEO Frederic Pouchard and SOCAR VP for Investments and Relations with Italy Umid Yusifov. Speaking after the signing, Pouchard said: "We are very pleased to have reached this agreement with Azerbaijan. This is an important milestone for Elf Aquitaine in our efforts to expand our presence in the Caspian Sea region. We are committed to working closely with our partners in Azerbaijan to develop the Absheron gas field and ensure its success."
Yusifov added: "We are delighted to welcome Elf Aquitaine to the Absheron project. This partnership will bring significant technical and financial expertise to the table. We believe that this deal will help to further enhance the cooperation between Azerbaijan and France in the energy sector."
The Absheron gas field is being developed by Azerbaijan's state-owned oil company, SOCAR, which currently holds a 80% stake in the project. Other companies involved in the project include Total, which holds a 10% stake, and Gazprom, which holds a 10% stake. Total and Gazprom are both major players in the European gas market, and their involvement in the Absheron project highlights the importance of the Caspian Sea region as a potential source of natural gas for Europe.
Elf Aquitaine is currently one of the largest oil and gas exploration companies in the world, with operations in more than 70 countries. The company has been pushing to expand its presence in the Caspian Sea region in recent years, as it seeks to tap into the potential of the region's vast energy resources. The company also holds a 20% stake in the Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan, which is currently under development.
The Caspian Sea region has emerged as a key source of natural gas for Europe in recent years, with countries such as Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan all looking to export their gas to Europe via pipelines. The region is also home to major oil reserves, which have attracted significant investment from international oil companies. The latest deal between Elf Aquitaine and Azerbaijan is expected to further bolster the company's position in the region, and help to secure Europe's energy future for years to come.
