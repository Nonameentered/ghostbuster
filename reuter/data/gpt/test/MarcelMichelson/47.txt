Alcatel Alsthom, the French engineering and technology company, has entered discussions with Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation to jointly bid for a stake in the defense electronics firm, Thomson-CSF. The deal is expected to be worth billions, with Thomson-CSF boasting annual profits in the hundreds of millions.
The move comes as a surprise to some analysts, as Alcatel Alsthom had previously downplayed rumors of interest in the defense industry. However, this new partnership seems to indicate a strategic shift for the company.
Thomson-CSF has key contracts with the French government, including supplying radar systems for the military, making it an attractive acquisition target for companies looking to expand their defense portfolios. With the French government increasing their defense budget in recent years, the demand for sophisticated defense technologies is expected to rise, making Thomson-CSF a potentially lucrative investment.
Aerospatiale and Dassault, both established players in the defense and aerospace industries, could bring a wealth of expertise to the table in their partnership with Alcatel Alsthom. The trio may be best positioned to secure the stake in Thomson-CSF against rival bidders.
Thomson-CSF has been embroiled in a legal battle with the French government over the alleged bribery of foreign officials. Earlier this year, the firm agreed to pay a €90 million fine to settle the case and avoid prosecution. However, the scandal has called into question the company’s ethics and could impact the valuation of any potential sale.
Despite this, the partnership between Alcatel Alsthom, Aerospatiale, and Dassault clearly sees the potential for growth in the defense industry. Alcatel Alsthom’s CEO, Serge Tchuruk, commented on the company’s ambitions, stating that “we are looking to diversify our portfolio and expand our foothold in sectors with high growth potential.”
The move comes at a time when the French government is pushing for greater consolidation in the country’s defense industry. The government has encouraged mergers and acquisitions between defense firms in order to create stronger domestic champions capable of taking on larger international competitors.
The partnership between Alcatel Alsthom, Aerospatiale, and Dassault could be seen as an indicator of this trend. All three companies have a long history in the French defense industry and could be well positioned to compete in this new landscape.
The deal is likely to be closely watched by industry observers and investors alike, as it could set a precedent for further consolidation in the French defense sector. It remains to be seen whether Alcatel Alsthom and its partners will be successful in securing a stake in Thomson-CSF, but regardless of the outcome, the move marks a significant shift in the company’s strategic priorities.
