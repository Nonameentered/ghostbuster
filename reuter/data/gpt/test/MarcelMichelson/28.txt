French Minister Announces Capital Injection for Thomson Multimedia and Sale of Thomson-CSF
The French Minister of Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, has announced a capital injection for Thomson Multimedia and the sale of Thomson-CSF in an effort to boost the country's technology industry and reduce government debt.
Thomson Multimedia, a global leader in the production of audio and video equipment, will receive a capital injection of €500 million ($570 million) from the French government and private investors. This injection is aimed at funding the company's research and development activities and keeping it competitive against major players in the industry such as Sony and Panasonic.
"Thomson Multimedia is a proud French company with a rich history of innovation and excellence," said Le Maire. "We believe that by investing in its future, we are securing not only the company's long-term success but also the future of France's technology industry."
Thomson Multimedia has struggled in recent years to keep pace with the rapidly changing technology landscape. The company's revenue has declined from over €5 billion in 2006 to under €1 billion in 2018, and it has undergone several reorganizations and restructuring efforts in an attempt to stay competitive.
The capital injection from the government is expected to support Thomson Multimedia's efforts to diversify its product offerings and expand into emerging markets such as China and India.
In addition to the capital injection for Thomson Multimedia, the French government has also announced the sale of Thomson-CSF, a defense and security electronics company, to a group of private investors for €2.2 billion ($2.5 billion).
Thomson-CSF, which was founded in 1893 as the Telegraphie Sans Fil (Wireless Telegraphy) company, has a long history of supplying defense and security equipment to the French government and international customers. The company's products include radar systems, communication systems, and electronic warfare technology.
The sale of Thomson-CSF is part of the French government's broader efforts to reduce its debt and focus its spending on core areas such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The government has estimated that the sale will reduce its debt by approximately €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion).
The sale of Thomson-CSF has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts. Some have raised concerns that the sale of a defense technology company to private investors could put national security at risk, while others have praised the move as a prudent financial decision.
"The sale of Thomson-CSF is a necessary step in the French government's efforts to reduce its debt," said Le Maire. "We have every confidence that the company will continue to thrive under private ownership, and that our national security will not be compromised."
The sale of Thomson-CSF is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval.
Overall, the announcements regarding Thomson Multimedia and Thomson-CSF reflect the French government's commitment to supporting its domestic businesses and maintaining a strong technological infrastructure. As Le Maire noted, "France has a long and proud history of innovation and excellence in technology, and we are dedicated to ensuring that it continues well into the future."
