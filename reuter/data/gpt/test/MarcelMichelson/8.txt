Shareholders of Thomson SA, a French media group, have approved a $2.12 billion state injection as the French government reviews its privatisation plans for the company. The capital injection is meant to support Thomson's ambitious five-year business plan which aims to transform the company into a more diversified technology firm.
The move comes as the Macron government is preparing to sell its 49% stake in the company. The government had previously announced its intention to privatise the company in late 2020 in a bid to raise funds to cope with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The size of the government's stake in the company has attracted a lot of interest from potential buyers, including several private equity firms, media groups, and tech companies. Thomson SA's subsidiary, Technicolor, has also been tipped as a possible target for acquisition.
Thomson's management team has welcomed the state injection, saying it will provide much-needed financial support for the company's transformation plans. "The capital injection will allow us to accelerate our R&D efforts and invest in new growth areas such as smart home devices, immersive media, and next-generation broadcasting technologies," said CEO Richard Halimi.
The company's business plan aims to increase its revenues and profitability by focusing on three core areas: smart home and IoT devices, media services, and advanced display technologies. The company's management team believes that these areas offer significant growth potential and will help the company to improve its financial performance in the long run.
Thomson's shareholders seemed to agree with this assessment, with 89% of them approving the state injection in a vote held earlier this month. The vote was seen as a positive sign for the company's management team, who have been trying to convince investors of the merits of their transformation plan.
The French government's privatisation plans for Thomson have been the subject of much debate in recent months. Critics argue that the government should not be selling off its stake in a company that has significant strategic value for France. They also point to the fact that the government has already invested heavily in the company, making it one of the largest shareholders.
However, the government has defended its decision to proceed with the privatisation, arguing that it is necessary to raise funds for the economic recovery effort. The government has also said that it will ensure that any buyer of Thomson SA respects the company's strategic importance and its employees.
The sale of Thomson SA is expected to attract multiple bidders, with some analysts saying that the company could fetch as much as $4-5 billion. However, the final sale price will depend on a variety of factors, including the state of the global economy and the level of interest from potential buyers.
In conclusion, the approval of the state injection by Thomson's shareholders is a positive sign for the company's management team as they work to transform the company into a more diversified technology firm. While the French government's privatisation plans for the company have been the subject of much debate, it seems that the sale will proceed as planned, with multiple bidders expected to compete for the stake. The final outcome of the sale remains uncertain, but Thomson's management team will be hoping that the injection of capital will help to improve the company's financial performance and attract potential buyers.
