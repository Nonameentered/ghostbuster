The planned sale of French electronics group Thomson SA has halted after a major policy U-turn by the French government, which has angered investors and put the future of the company in doubt.
Thomson SA had been in talks to be sold to a Chinese consortium led by state-owned company China Electronics Corporation (CEC). The deal was expected to be worth around €2 billion ($2.4 billion) and would have seen the Chinese group take control of the struggling electronics company.
However, the French government, which has a 24% stake in the company, has now blocked the sale, citing concerns over national security and intellectual property. The move has been seen as a surprise given that the government had previously given its blessing to the deal.
The decision has infuriated investors and led to a sharp drop in Thomson SA's share price, which fell by more than 20% on the news. The Chinese consortium is said to be considering legal action over the reversal of the deal.
Thomson SA, which was founded in 1893 and is best known for its work in the television industry, has been in financial trouble for years. The company has struggled to compete in a rapidly-changing electronics market and has been forced to cut jobs and sell off assets in order to stay afloat.
The Chinese consortium saw the acquisition as an opportunity to tap into Thomson SA’s expertise in the television industry and expand its presence in the European market. The deal was also seen as a sign of China's growing economic influence in Europe.
However, the French government has now raised concerns that the deal could give the Chinese consortium access to key technology and intellectual property that could be used for military purposes. It is thought that the government's decision was influenced by a report from French intelligence agencies that highlighted the risks of Chinese investment in key sectors.
The move has raised questions about the French government's commitment to open investment policies and its willingness to protect national interests. Some have accused the government of bowing to pressure from the United States, which has been increasingly critical of China's growing economic influence.
The decision has also raised concerns about the future of Thomson SA and its employees. The company has already been through a number of restructurings and job cuts, and there are fears the reversal of the sale could lead to further job losses.
The French government has said it is committed to finding a new buyer for Thomson SA and ensuring the company's future. However, potential buyers are likely to be wary of the company's financial troubles and the government's sudden change of policy.
The decision is also likely to have wider implications for foreign investment in France and Europe. Some have warned that the move could damage France's reputation as an open and welcoming place for foreign investment, and deter other companies from considering mergers or acquisitions in the country.
The controversy over the sale of Thomson SA comes at a time of increasing concern over Chinese investment in Europe and the United States. A number of countries have expressed fears that Chinese companies are using investment as a way to gain access to key technologies and strategic assets.
The United States has been particularly vocal on the issue, with President Trump taking a tough stance on Chinese investment in the country. The US has also been urging its European allies to adopt a more cautious approach to Chinese investment.
The controversy over the sale of Thomson SA highlights the difficult balancing act that governments must perform when it comes to foreign investment. On the one hand, they want to attract investment and create jobs, while on the other hand they must protect national interests and prevent sensitive technologies from falling into the wrong hands.
The French government's decision to block the sale of Thomson SA may have been motivated by concerns over national security and intellectual property, but it has also raised questions about the government's openness to foreign investment and its willingness to play by the rules of the global economy. The future of Thomson SA and its employees now hangs in the balance, and the controversy is likely to have wider implications for foreign investment in Europe and beyond.
