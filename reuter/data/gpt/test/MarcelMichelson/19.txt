PARIS, France - AOL France is gearing up to expand its user base and reach 100,000 subscribers by the end of the year. The move comes as part of the company's expansion plans aimed at capturing a greater share of the French internet market.
As of today, AOL France has around 30,000 subscribers according to a company spokesperson. To reach 100,000 subscribers, the company will need to triple its user base in less than a year. The move is ambitious, but AOL France is confident it can achieve its targets by providing a range of new features and services to its users.
The company said that it will focus on delivering an even better experience to its users and will be adding new content, including news, entertainment, and sports. "We want to provide more value to our users by offering them exclusive content and services that match their interests," said Pierre Louette, Senior Vice President of AOL Europe.
The company will also expand its ecommerce activities and will offer more online shopping options to its users. This move comes amid a growing trend in France towards ecommerce and online shopping, which is expected to continue growing in the coming years.
To achieve its targets, AOL France has launched a major marketing campaign aimed at raising awareness of its services and promoting its brand. The campaign will consist of TV, print, and online ads, as well as PR and events.
AOL France will also focus on strengthening its relationships with its existing users by introducing new loyalty programs and rewards. "We want our users to feel that they are part of a community that values their loyalty and rewards them for it," said Louette. "We will be introducing new loyalty programs and rewards that will make our users feel appreciated and valued."
The company's expansion plans come as the French internet market continues to grow and become more competitive. According to a recent report by Arcep, the French telecom regulator, there were around 34 million internet users in France at the end of 2016, representing a penetration rate of 81%.
This figure is expected to continue growing in the coming years as more people come online and the availability of high-speed internet improves. However, this growth also means that competition for users is expected to increase, with many companies vying for a share of the French internet market.
Despite this, AOL France remains confident that it can differentiate itself from its competitors by providing a unique and compelling user experience. "We believe that our brand and our commitment to providing the best possible experience to our users will help us stand out in the French internet market," said Louette.
AOL France is also expected to benefit from the company's international reach and expertise, which will help it develop new features and services that are tailored to the needs of French users. "We have a strong global network and an experienced team of developers and designers who are dedicated to creating products and services that respond to the needs of our local markets," Louette added.
In conclusion, AOL France's ambitious expansion plans demonstrate the company's commitment to capturing a greater share of the French internet market and providing its users with a range of new features and services. With a major marketing campaign, new loyalty programs and rewards, and a focus on delivering exclusive content, AOL France is well positioned to achieve its targets and become a leading player in the French internet market.
