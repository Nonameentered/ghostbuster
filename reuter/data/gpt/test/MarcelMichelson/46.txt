Paris, France - Generale des Eaux is in talks to extend its power in the media industry through a potential deal with Havas, according to sources familiar with the matter.
The deal would involve Generale des Eaux acquiring a stake in Havas, one of the largest advertising and marketing firms in the world. This would give Generale des Eaux a significant presence in the media industry and enable the company to expand its offerings to clients.
Havas has a strong global presence, with operations in more than 100 countries. The company offers a wide range of services, including traditional advertising, digital marketing, and media buying. Havas also owns several subsidiaries, including Arnold Worldwide, Euro RSCG Worldwide, and Havas Media.
Generale des Eaux, meanwhile, is a multinational conglomerate with interests in a range of industries, including water distribution, waste management, and transportation. The company also has a significant presence in the telecommunications industry, with subsidiaries such as SFR and Maroc Telecom.
If the deal goes ahead, it would be a major coup for Generale des Eaux and could help the company to expand its reach even further. It would also position the company as a major player in the media industry, which is undergoing significant changes as a result of digital disruption.
The media industry has been under pressure in recent years as traditional advertising models are disrupted by the rise of digital platforms such as Facebook and Google.

The company has been ramping up its presence in the media industry in recent years, with the acquisition of French newspaper Le Monde and a stake in the French television channel Canal+.
The potential deal with Havas is part of a broader strategy to expand the company's media footprint globally. The company is also said to be looking at potential acquisitions in other parts of the world, including the United States and Asia.
The negotiations between Generale des Eaux and Havas are said to be at an advanced stage, although no formal announcement has been made. The deal would need to be approved by regulators and would be subject to due diligence and other conditions.
If the deal goes ahead, it would be a significant move for both Generale des Eaux and Havas and would reshape the media industry landscape.
