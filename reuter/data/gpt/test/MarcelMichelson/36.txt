Lagardere Groupe Expects Multimedia Profit in 1998 Despite Current Losses
Paris, France - Despite a difficult year for Lagardere Groupe, the company is optimistic about its prospects for 1998. The company, which operates in the publishing, multimedia, and aviation industries, has faced losses in its publishing division, but hopes to offset these losses with strong growth in its multimedia sector.
In 1997, Lagardere Groupe reported a net loss of 510 million francs ($85.4 million), largely due to struggles in its publishing division. The company has incurred significant costs related to investments in its book publishing operations, particularly in its French language publishing arm.
However, the company's management team is still bullish on the prospects for its multimedia business. Lagardere has invested heavily in media properties like Hachette Filipacchi Medias, which operates several popular magazines like Elle and Car & Driver. Additionally, the company owns a stake in Canal+, a popular French television channel.
Lagardere's multimedia operations have shown signs of strong growth in recent years, fueled by the increasing popularity of digital media. Online platforms, such as Hachette's website, have attracted a growing number of visitors. In the first nine months of 1997, Hachette's US websites had 8.4 million unique visits, up 50% from the previous year.
Similarly, Canal+ has enjoyed strong subscriber growth in recent years. In 1997, the company added 475,000 new subscribers, bringing its total subscriber count to 5.4 million. Canal+ has also invested in digital offerings, launching a new service that allows subscribers to watch movies on-demand.
Despite these promising developments, some analysts remain cautious about Lagardere's prospects. The company faces intense competition in both the publishing and multimedia sectors, particularly from digital-native companies like Amazon and Netflix.
However, Lagardere's management team believes that the company's diversified portfolio positions it well for long-term success. In addition to its publishing and multimedia operations, the company also operates in the aviation industry through its ownership of a 7.5% stake in Airbus.
Going forward, the company plans to continue investing in its businesses to drive growth. Lagardere's CEO, Arnaud Lagardere, stated in the company's 1997 annual report, "We have the ambition to make our group one of the leaders in each of its businesses, to invent the models of tomorrow, to create value and to be recognized as a responsible industrial partner."
As the company looks ahead to 1998, it remains difficult to predict whether Lagardere will be able to achieve its goal of profitability. However, the company's leadership seems determined to continue investing in its businesses and pursue growth opportunities, even in the face of adversity. Only time will tell whether Lagardere can turn its current losses into multimedia profits.
