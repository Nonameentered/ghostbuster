London-based IT services company Logica Plc has announced that it has acquired France-based Axime Ingenierie SA for a sum of 161 million francs (approximately $15 million USD). With this acquisition, Logica plans to continue its expansion throughout Europe.
Axime Ingenierie SA is a technology consulting and engineering company with clients in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. The acquisition is aimed at strengthening Logica’s position in the European market as it continues to grow its operations across this region.
Logica’s CEO, Mark Fairbairn, said that this acquisition is part of the company’s strategy to expand its geographical presence and capability. He further added, “Axime Ingenierie has built a very strong reputation for delivering quality IT services to its clients. This acquisition will allow us to offer more expertise to our customers and enable us to expand our capabilities in the rapidly growing IT services market.”
The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The deal will see all 700 Axime Ingenierie staff transfer to Logica, and they will continue to work out of their existing offices in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Logica will continue to operate under its own brand name.
Logica has a long history of acquisitions. Over the years, it has acquired several IT services companies to expand its geographical reach, as well as to enhance its service offerings. Its most recent acquisition was Spain-based AESA, which it acquired in 2019.
This acquisition comes at a time when the IT services market in Europe is experiencing significant growth. According to a recent report by Gartner, the European IT services market is expected to grow by 4.4% in 2021, reaching a total value of $344 billion USD. Logica’s acquisition of Axime Ingenierie is seen as a move to tap into this growing market.
Logica Plc was founded in 1969 and is one of the pioneers in the IT services industry. Today, it has over 50,000 employees worldwide and operates in more than 40 countries. Its services include IT consulting, software development, and IT outsourcing, among others.
With this acquisition, Logica Plc is setting itself up for continued growth in Europe and beyond. The company is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing IT services market, and its expertise in the industry is expected to further strengthen its position in this market.
