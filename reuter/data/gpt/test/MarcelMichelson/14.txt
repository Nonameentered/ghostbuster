French oil companies Total and Elf Aquitaine have signed contracts to purchase Iraqi crude oil under the United Nations (UN) oil-for-food program. These contracts mark a significant milestone in the rehabilitation of Iraq's economy after years of dictatorship, war, and economic sanctions.
The UN oil-for-food program was established in 1995 to allow Iraq to sell oil under the supervision of the UN and use the proceeds to buy food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies. The program was a response to the international community's concern about the impact of economic sanctions on the Iraqi people, who were suffering from malnutrition and inadequate medical care. Under the program, Iraq was permitted to sell up to $5.26 billion in oil every six months.
In the past, French companies had a significant presence in the Iraqi oil sector, and Elf Aquitaine had a 15 percent stake in the Kirkuk oilfield before the first Gulf War in 1991. After the war, French companies were forced to withdraw from Iraq because of UN sanctions and political tensions between France and the United States.
However, after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003, French companies began to explore the possibility of returning to Iraq and participating in the reconstruction of the country's oil industry. In 2008, Total signed an agreement with the Iraqi government to develop the Halfaya oilfield in the southern part of the country.
The contracts signed by Total and Elf Aquitaine under the UN oil-for-food program will allow the companies to purchase Iraqi crude oil for a total value of $1.2 billion. The oil will be sold at market prices, and the revenues will be deposited in a UN escrow account. The proceeds will be used to finance humanitarian relief efforts in Iraq.
The contracts are significant for several reasons. First, they demonstrate the renewed interest of French companies in the Iraqi oil sector after years of being shut out of the market. Second, they show the potential of the UN oil-for-food program to support economic reconstruction in Iraq. Finally, they provide a much-needed source of revenue for the Iraqi government, which is struggling to finance its reconstruction efforts after decades of war and sanctions.
The signing of these contracts is also likely to be welcomed by the international community, which has been pushing for greater international participation in the reconstruction of Iraq. France, in particular, has been criticized for its lack of support for the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its perceived reluctance to contribute to the reconstruction effort. The contracts with Total and Elf Aquitaine are a sign that France is now willing to play a greater role in the reconstruction of Iraq.
In a statement, Total CEO Patrick Pouyann√© said, "We are delighted to have signed this agreement to purchase Iraqi crude oil under the UN oil-for-food program. This is an important step in the rehabilitation of Iraq's economy, and we are proud to be a part of it. We look forward to working with the Iraqi government and the UN to support the reconstruction of Iraq."
Elf Aquitaine CEO Philippe Joubert added, "We are very pleased to have the opportunity to purchase Iraqi crude oil under the UN oil-for-food program. This is a significant milestone in our efforts to return to the Iraqi market and participate in the country's economic reconstruction. We are committed to working with the Iraqi government and the UN to support the people of Iraq."
The contracts signed by Total and Elf Aquitaine are a positive step for Iraq's economy and for international efforts to support the country's reconstruction. They demonstrate the potential of the UN oil-for-food program to support economic development in Iraq, and they show that French companies are willing to play a greater role in the country's future. As the Iraqi government continues its efforts to rebuild the country, partnerships like these will be essential in the years ahead.
