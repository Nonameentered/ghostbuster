The French Parliamentary Commission has approved the merger of GEC Alsthom and Framatome, but with certain conditions. The highly anticipated merger will create a European power giant capable of competing with China and the United States.
The commission imposed several conditions on the merger, including a cap on job losses and a requirement that the merged company prioritize French suppliers. The commission also required that the new company maintain a presence in areas where both GEC Alsthom and Framatome have operations.
The merger has been in the works for months, as the two companies sought to create a stronger presence in Europe's power sector. GEC Alsthom specializes in power grids and transportation, while Framatome is a leader in nuclear energy. The merger would allow the two companies to leverage their respective strengths to create a powerhouse in the energy sector.
The two companies have said that the merger is necessary to compete with larger global players such as China and the United States. The European energy sector has struggled in recent years, as cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources have eaten into the profits of traditional energy companies. The merger would allow the new company to use economies of scale to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
The parliamentary commission's approval was seen as a major milestone in the merger process. The commission's conditions were largely expected, as the French government has been closely monitoring the merger to ensure that it benefits the country's economy and workers.
The companies have said that they will work with the commission to meet its conditions and proceed with the merger. The two companies will now seek final approval from the European Union, which is expected to take several months.
The merger has been controversial in France, with some workers fearing job losses and others concerned that the new company will not be able to compete globally. However, supporters of the merger argue that it is necessary to create a strong European player to compete with China and the United States.
The French government has said that it supports the merger, but has also emphasized the importance of protecting French jobs and suppliers. The government has said that it will closely monitor the new company to ensure that it benefits the French economy and workers.
The GEC Alsthom-Framatome merger is expected to be the largest merger in the European energy sector in years. It comes at a time when the sector is under pressure to reduce costs and increase efficiency in order to compete with renewable energy sources.
The new company will be based in France and will have a market capitalization of around â‚¬50 billion. It will have operations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, and will employ around 110,000 people.
Overall, the French Parliamentary Commission's approval of the GEC Alsthom-Framatome merger was seen as a positive development for the European energy sector. The merger is expected to create a strong European player that is capable of competing with China and the United States, and could help to revitalize the struggling European energy sector.
