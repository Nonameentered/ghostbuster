Paris, France – Generale des Eaux, the French multinational utility company, is in talks to extend its power in the media world with a potential deal to acquire Canal Plus, the leading French premium cable television channel. According to sources, Generale des Eaux is in discussions with the global advertising and communications giant Havas to explore a joint bid for the struggling broadcaster.
The potential acquisition of Canal Plus represents a significant move for Generale des Eaux, which has already established itself as a major player in the utilities and infrastructure sectors. The company, which is part of the larger Veolia Environnement group, has been looking to diversify its interests and expand into other areas. The media industry, with its high growth potential and potential for significant returns on investment, appears to be an attractive proposition for the firm.
Canal Plus, which was once a broadcasting powerhouse in France, has fallen on hard times in recent years. The company has struggled to compete with the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other streaming services that have disrupted the traditional television landscape. As a result, Canal Plus has been losing subscribers and struggling to sustain its profitability.
If Generale des Eaux and Havas are able to acquire Canal Plus, they would have a significant stake in one of France's most prominent media properties. The deal would also give the two firms access to Canal Plus's valuable content library and its existing distribution partnerships with other French television providers. In addition, the acquisition would give Generale des Eaux and Havas a foothold in the highly lucrative global media industry, with opportunities to expand their reach into other markets.
For Havas, the potential deal with Generale des Eaux offers an opportunity to expand its existing advertising and communications business. The firm, which is headquartered in Paris, has a strong presence in Europe and operates in over 100 countries worldwide. With the acquisition of Canal Plus, Havas would be able to leverage the broadcaster's existing relationships with advertisers and generate additional revenue streams. The deal would also give Havas access to Canal Plus's content library, which could be used for its advertising and communications campaigns.
The potential acquisition of Canal Plus is still in the early stages, and there are many details to be worked out before a deal can be finalized. However, sources close to the talks say that the parties are optimistic about the prospects for a successful transaction.
In addition to the potential acquisition of Canal Plus, Generale des Eaux has been involved in several other significant moves in the media industry in recent years. In 2019, the company acquired the French broadcasting group Lagardère, which gave it control over several radio and television stations in France. The move was seen as a strategic play by Generale des Eaux to expand its presence in the media industry and to diversify its portfolio.
Generale des Eaux has also been making significant investments in the renewable energy sector in recent years. The company has been building wind and solar power plants across Europe, with a focus on sustainable energy sources. The move is seen as part of the company's larger strategy to reduce its carbon footprint and to position itself as a leader in the transition to renewable energy.
Overall, the potential acquisition of Canal Plus represents a significant opportunity for Generale des Eaux and Havas to expand their reach in the media industry. If the deal goes ahead, it will be closely watched by the industry as a major move in the ongoing consolidation of the global media market.
