Gaz de France, the French gas company, has announced plans to invest billions of Euro in upgrading its infrastructure to meet growing demand. The investment will include building new pipelines, storage facilities, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.
According to a company press release, Gaz de France expects the demand for gas to increase as the country shifts towards cleaner energy sources. The French government has set a target to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030, and gas is seen as a key part of achieving this goal.
To meet this demand, Gaz de France plans to invest â‚¬10 billion ($11 billion) by 2030 in upgrading its infrastructure. This includes the construction of new pipelines to transport gas to different regions of the country, including areas that are currently not connected to the gas grid.
The company also plans to build new storage facilities to ensure a reliable supply of gas to customers, especially during peak demand periods. This will involve expanding existing storage facilities and building new ones in areas with high demand.
In addition, Gaz de France will invest in LNG terminals, which will allow it to import gas from other countries. This will increase the company's supply of gas and reduce reliance on domestic sources.
Gaz de France has already begun work on several infrastructure projects, including the construction of a new pipeline between France and Spain. The pipeline, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2021, will transport gas from Spain to France and will increase the supply of gas to the south of France.
The company has also invested in new LNG terminals, including one in Dunkirk, which began operations in 2017. The terminal has a capacity of 13 billion cubic meters of gas per year, making it one of the largest in Europe.
The investment in infrastructure upgrades is expected to create thousands of jobs in the construction and engineering sectors. It will also benefit local communities by providing a reliable supply of gas, which will help to reduce energy costs.
Gaz de France's investment comes at a time when the global gas market is experiencing significant growth. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), demand for gas is expected to increase by 1.6% per year until 2024.
This growth is being driven by several factors, including the shift towards cleaner energy sources and the declining cost of gas compared to other fossil fuels. Gas is also seen as an important part of the transition to renewable energy, as it can be used as a backup source of energy when wind and solar power are not generating enough electricity.
Gaz de France's investment in infrastructure upgrades is part of a broader trend among gas companies to increase investment in new infrastructure. According to a report by the IEA, global investment in gas infrastructure is expected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2040.
The report also highlights the need for increased investment in infrastructure to ensure a secure and reliable supply of gas. This includes investment in pipelines, storage facilities, and LNG terminals, as well as measures to improve the efficiency of existing infrastructure.
In conclusion, Gaz de France's investment in infrastructure upgrades is a significant step towards meeting growing demand for gas in France. The investment will create jobs, benefit local communities, and ensure a reliable supply of gas to customers. The move also reflects a broader trend among gas companies to increase investment in new infrastructure, in order to meet the challenges of a changing energy landscape.
