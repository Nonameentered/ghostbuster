Alcatel Alsthom, the French multinational company specializing in telecommunications equipment and transportation, has been in talks to merge with Aerospatiale and Dassault for a joint bid for Thomson-CSF, the defense electronics giant.
The idea of a potential merger between the three companies has been circulating for some time, but recent news suggests that negotiations are now underway, and a deal may be imminent. According to sources close to the situation, the deal could be worth up to €10 billion ($11.9 billion).
If the merger does go ahead, it would create a French defense and technology giant, with a diverse range of capabilities. Alcatel Alsthom, best known for its telecommunications equipment, would bring expertise in information systems and network technologies to the table. Aerospatiale, a leading aerospace company, would offer advanced defense systems and technologies, while Dassault, which is primarily a manufacturer of military and civil aviation equipment, would bring advanced engineering and manufacturing expertise.
The three companies have experience working together; in fact, Alcatel Alsthom and Aerospatiale previously joined forces to create Alcatel Space, a satellite manufacturer, while Dassault has long been a partner of both companies in the aerospace industry.
Thomson-CSF, which is currently owned by the French state, is an attractive target for the proposed joint bid. With revenues of over €5 billion ($5.9 billion) in 2020, the company specializes in defense electronics, including radar, navigation, and communications systems, as well as cybersecurity technologies.
The French government has been seeking to privatize Thomson-CSF since 2018, and the company has been a target of interest for a number of European and American firms. By joining forces in a joint bid, Alcatel Alsthom, Aerospatiale, and Dassault hope to create a stronger bid than any of their competitors.
While representatives of Alcatel Alsthom, Aerospatiale, and Dassault declined to comment on the rumored merger talks, analysts believe that it could be a beneficial move for all three companies, as well as for the French defense industry as a whole.
“Combining the expertise and capabilities of these three companies would create a strong French defense and technology giant, able to compete on a global level,” said one industry analyst. “It would also help to keep French technological know-how within France, which has been a concern for the government.”
Other analysts have noted, however, that a potential merger could face regulatory hurdles, as it would create a large player in both the defense and aerospace industries. There could also be concerns about the potential loss of jobs or relocation of key operations, particularly if there is overlap between the three companies.
Still, the idea of a French defense and technology giant is an appealing one to many in France, particularly given recent geopolitical tensions and the growing importance of cybersecurity. With a joint bid for Thomson-CSF, Alcatel Alsthom, Aerospatiale, and Dassault could be poised to make a significant impact on the global defense and technology industries.
