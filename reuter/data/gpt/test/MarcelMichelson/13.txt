French telecommunications giant, France Telecom, has announced a significant reduction in call tariffs in anticipation of the liberalization of the European telecommunications market and its impending flotation in 1997. France Telecom's move is expected to generate price competition among major companies in the industry.
The French company has announced new plans to offer lower call tariffs to customers in France and throughout Europe, reflecting its determination to increase its share of the telecommunications market. The move is part of France Telecom's strategy to establish itself as a major player in the rapidly changing telecommunications environment in Europe.
The new tariffs would apply to residential and business customers and would see prices for local calls slashed by up to 30%. The company intends to introduce a new range of services aimed at businesses, including a reduction in call charges to other European countries, with initial tariffs starting at just 50 centimes per minute. This reduction could lead to savings of up to 20% on existing EU tariffs.
France Telecom has said that the tariff reductions follow an extensive review of the company's pricing policies, as part of its preparations for the forthcoming liberalisation of the European telecommunications market. The company has been preparing for the expected competition by reorganising its operations, increasing efficiency and introducing new services.
A spokesperson for France Telecom said, "We have developed a range of products and services that our customers will find attractive and competitive. This includes reduced call charges and improved services such as call waiting and conference calling. We are confident that these measures will enable us to provide our customers with the best value and service possible."
The reduction in prices for calls to other European countries is a clear indication that France Telecom plans to target new markets and increase its customer base, particularly in areas such as the UK and Germany. Analysts predict that this move could encourage other telecommunications companies to follow suit.
The announcement of these reductions appears to have been well received by both the markets and customers. In France, shares in France Telecom rose by 2% on the back of the news, while in the UK, BT was trading down on fears of increased competition from France Telecom. Customers have praised the reductions with many saying that they will make it easier and more cost-effective for them to use the services of France Telecom.
Critics, however, are concerned that the reduction in call tariffs could result in a decrease in the quality of service offered by France Telecom. The company has said that it maintains its commitment to providing the highest quality services to its customers.
As the much-anticipated liberalisation of the European market approaches, the fierce competition among telecommunications companies is set to intensify. France Telecom's move to reduce call charges is a clear sign of its determination to be a major player in the new and rapidly changing environment. With new products and services on offer and a revamped pricing structure, the company is preparing to take on the competition and increase its market share.
