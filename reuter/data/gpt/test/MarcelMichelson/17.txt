Rhone-Poulenc, a French chemical company, and Merck, an American healthcare company, have announced a merger of their animal health activities. With the merger, the two companies will create a world leader in the animal health sector with a presence in more than 100 countries and a combined revenue of over $5 billion.
The new company will be called Merial Limited and will be headquartered in Lyon, France, where Rhone-Poulenc's animal health activities are based. Merial will be owned 50-50 by Rhone-Poulenc and Merck, and will focus on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of animal health products.
The merger is expected to be completed by the end of this month, subject to regulatory approval. The new company will have a broad portfolio of animal health products, including vaccines, antiparasitics, antibiotics, and other pharmaceuticals.
"The merger of our animal health activities is a strategic move that will allow us to combine our strengths and create a world leader in the animal health sector," said Jacques Ruffi√©, Chairman and CEO of Rhone-Poulenc. "Merial will benefit from our complementary expertise in research and development, manufacturing, and distribution, as well as from our presence in different geographic regions."
"Merial will be a global leader in animal health with a strong portfolio of products and services, a talented team, and a solid financial position," said Raymond V. Gilmartin, Chairman, President, and CEO of Merck. "This merger will enable us to deliver more value to our customers and shareholders, and to advance our vision of improving the health and wellbeing of animals worldwide."
The animal health sector is a rapidly growing market, driven by increasing demand for meat and dairy products, and by the need to prevent and treat animal diseases. Merial will focus on providing innovative solutions to improve animal health, productivity, and welfare, and to reduce the impact of animal diseases on human health and the environment.
The merger of Rhone-Poulenc and Merck's animal health activities is the latest in a series of consolidation moves in the animal health sector. Last year, Pfizer and Zoetis, two of the largest animal health companies, split into two separate entities. Also, Bayer acquired Merck's consumer care business, including its animal health products.
Merial will face strong competition from other major players in the animal health sector, such as Zoetis, Elanco, and Boehringer Ingelheim. However, Merial's broad portfolio of products, its global presence, and its focus on innovation and sustainability are expected to give it a competitive edge.
The merger of Rhone-Poulenc and Merck's animal health activities is expected to result in significant synergies, especially in the areas of research and development, manufacturing, and distribution. The companies plan to invest in new technologies and capabilities to drive growth in the animal health sector.
Merial will also benefit from Rhone-Poulenc and Merck's expertise in other areas of their businesses, such as crop protection, human health, and biotechnology. This will enable Merial to leverage new opportunities for innovation and collaboration.
The merger of Rhone-Poulenc and Merck's animal health activities is a landmark event in the animal health sector and is expected to have a significant impact on the industry. Merial's focus on innovation, sustainability, and customer service, combined with its global reach and financial strength, are expected to make it a leading player in the animal health sector for years to come.
