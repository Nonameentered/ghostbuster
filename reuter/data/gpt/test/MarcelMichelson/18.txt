Global pharmaceutical giants Merck & Co. Inc. and Rhone-Poulenc S.A. recently announced that they will merge their animal health businesses to become the world's leading company in the animal health sector. The merger will create a company with an estimated value of over $20 billion.
According to the agreement, Merck's animal health unit, known as MSD Animal Health outside the United States and Canada, will join forces with Rhone-Poulenc's animal health unit, known as Merial. The combined entity will operate under the name of "NewCo" and will have a comprehensive portfolio of animal health products and services that include vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and digital technologies. 
The NewCo's product offerings will cover livestock, pets, and a variety of other species. The merger will combine the strengths of both companies and enable them to pool resources, expertise, and industry knowledge to provide more comprehensive solutions to their customers' animal health needs.
The deal is expected to create significant operational synergies by reducing overhead costs and streamlining operations. The companies estimate annual savings of approximately $1.6 billion in three years after the merger is completed.
Merck and Rhone-Poulenc have a longstanding history of collaboration in the animal health industry. In 1994, they formed a joint venture that created Merial. Merck later bought out Rhone-Poulenc's shares in the venture in 2009. Following the merger, Rhone-Poulenc's parent company, Sanofi, will hold a 60% stake in the newly formed entity, while Merck will own the remaining 40%.
The market response to the news was positive, reflecting investor confidence in the merger. Both Merck and Rhone-Poulenc saw their shares rise following the announcement. The increased market capitalization will provide NewCo with greater financial stability and flexibility to support future investments and growth opportunities.
In a joint statement, the CEOs of Merck and Rhone-Poulenc expressed their enthusiasm about the merger and the prospects for their new venture. Kenneth Frazier, Chairman and CEO of Merck said, "Our animal health business has been an important part of our company for more than a century, and we are proud of the progress we have made in advancing animal health and welfare. We are excited to partner with Sanofi to create a world-class animal health company that will deliver results for our customers, while bolstering our long-term growth prospects."
Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, said, "The creation of the new world leader in animal health is a landmark transaction for the industry. It brings together two complementary businesses into a uniquely positioned entity, leveraging our world-class R&D capabilities, with an enhanced position in the global market and a stronger financial profile to benefit our customers, employees, and shareholders."
The merger is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be completed by mid-2020. The announcement marks a significant development in the animal health industry, as a new global leader emerges to set new standards for animal health and welfare.
