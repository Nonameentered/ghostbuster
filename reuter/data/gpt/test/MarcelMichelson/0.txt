The French government has recently called off the controversial sale of Thomson SA, a leading defense electronics company, to the Lagardere Group. However, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear that the privatization of the company will still be completed.
The proposed sale of Thomson SA, which specializes in producing military radars, night-vision goggles, and other surveillance technologies, sparked widespread outrage from labor unions and opposition politicians. The French government owns a 62% stake in the company and had planned to sell its shares to the Lagardere Group, which already owns an aerospace and defense subsidiary.
The deal was initially expected to be concluded by the end of 2020, but it was delayed due to concerns over national security and employment. Critics argued that the sale would weaken France's security capacity, as Thomson SA is considered to be one of the most strategic assets of the country's defense industry.
The French Defense Minister, Florence Parly, stated that Thomson SA played "a vital role in the protection of our sovereignty and our independence." As a result, the government decided to cancel the sale to the Lagardere Group.
However, the government is still committed to privatizing the company, and President Macron has announced that other potential bidders will be invited to participate in the sale. "We will pursue the process of privatization, but with a wider scope," Macron said during a visit to the Thomson SA headquarters in VÃ©lizy-Villacoublay.
Macron also reiterated that the government's priority was to ensure that "the strategic interests of our country are preserved and respecting the social interests of employees." He added that the privatization process would take place in a transparent and competitive manner, to ensure that the best possible outcome for France is achieved.
The decision to call off the sale has been welcomed by labor unions, who have been campaigning against the privatization of the company for months. The General Confederation of Labor (CGT) called the decision a "victory for our mobilization against the sale of our job-producing company to an investor group."
The French government's decision to cancel the sale underscored its commitment to safeguarding the country's strategic assets and interests. At the same time, it showed its willingness to consider alternatives to privatization that could satisfy both economic and security concerns.
The Thomson SA case highlights the challenges that governments face when it comes to balancing economic considerations with national security and strategic interests. While privatization can provide much-needed capital and expertise for companies, it can also lead to the loss of key assets and capabilities critical to defense and national security. In this case, the French government's decision to cancel the sale demonstrates a clear recognition of the importance of maintaining control over key strategic assets, even at the cost of foregoing the proposed deal.
