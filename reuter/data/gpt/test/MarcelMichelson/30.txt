France Telecom, one of the largest telecommunications companies in Europe, has been ordered to review its proposal for infrastructure prices by a new regulator. The move comes amid concerns that the telecom giant is overcharging its competitors for access to its network.
The French telecom regulator, known as ARCEP, has said that it will not accept France Telecom's current proposal for infrastructure prices. ARCEP claims that the company's proposed prices are too high and would limit competition in the market. As a result, ARCEP has ordered France Telecom to review its proposal and come up with new prices within a month.
This move represents a significant challenge to France Telecom, which has historically dominated the French telecom market. The company, which operates under the brand name Orange, has faced increasing competition in recent years from smaller operators such as Free and Bouygues Telecom.
At the heart of the dispute is France Telecom's pricing for access to its network infrastructure. The company charges its competitors a fee for access to its network, which allows them to offer their own internet and phone services to customers. However, competitors such as Free and Bouygues Telecom have argued that France Telecom's prices are too high and that they cannot compete effectively as a result.
ARCEP's decision to order France Telecom to review its prices is a significant win for these smaller operators. It signals that the regulator is committed to promoting competition in the market and preventing dominant players from abusing their position.
In a statement, ARCEP said that France Telecom's proposed infrastructure prices "do not permit new entrants to develop their networks profitably and offer competitive services to end-users. Therefore, they do not respect the objectives of the competitive framework of the French electronic communications code."
France Telecom has not yet responded to ARCEP's decision. However, the company is likely to resist any attempt to reduce its infrastructure prices. France Telecom has argued that its prices are fair and reflect the cost of maintaining its network infrastructure.
The company has also pointed out that it has invested heavily in building its network, which now covers more than 98% of the French population. France Telecom claims that its investment in infrastructure has allowed it to offer high-quality services to its customers and that it should be allowed to charge a fair price for access to its network.
However, ARCEP has rejected these arguments, saying that France Telecom's pricing is still far above the cost of providing access to its network. The regulator has also argued that France Telecom's dominant position in the market means that it has an obligation to ensure that competitors are able to offer competitive services.
The decision by ARCEP to order France Telecom to review its infrastructure prices is just the latest development in a long-running battle over competition in the French telecom market. In recent years, smaller operators such as Free and Bouygues Telecom have successfully challenged France Telecom's dominance by offering cheap and innovative services to customers.
The rise of these smaller operators has put pressure on France Telecom to respond. In 2011, the company launched a major cost-cutting program, which included the shedding of thousands of jobs. It also attempted to buy rival operator Bouygues Telecom in 2016, but the deal was blocked by the French government on competition grounds.
The latest move by ARCEP is likely to put further pressure on France Telecom to change its business model. It could also lead to a further shake-up of the French telecom market, with smaller operators gaining a greater share of customers as a result.
In conclusion, the decision by ARCEP to order France Telecom to review its infrastructure prices is a significant development in the battle for competition in the French telecom market. It represents a victory for smaller operators who have long complained about France Telecom's dominance. The move also highlights the importance of effective regulation in promoting competition and preventing abuse of market power by dominant players.
