NatWest Markets senior management unaware of interest rate options pricing problem until days before losses made public
NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), suffered a loss of £193m due to a pricing problem in its interest rate options portfolios in the first quarter of 2019. NatWest Markets senior management was reportedly unaware of the problem until days before the losses were made public.
The pricing problem was apparently caused by a lack of data input validation checks and a lack of control in the pricing of options. As a result, the market risk profile of the options portfolios was significantly misstated.
According to reports, NatWest Markets had been aware of these problems for months, but senior management was only informed of the issue shortly before the losses were made public. This raises questions over how the bank is being run and whether or not it has adequate risk management systems in place.
The interest rate options portfolios in question were reportedly valued at around £80bn, making them a significant part of the bank's business. The losses are said to have been caused by the bank's poor pricing of these options.
NatWest Markets said in a statement that it had taken steps to address the issue and that the losses were "an isolated incident." However, the statement has done little to alleviate concerns over the bank's ability to manage its risks.
The bank's chief executive, Alison Rose, said in a statement that the bank was "disappointed" by the losses and that it was "very focused on understanding and addressing the root causes." She added that the bank was continuing to work with regulators to ensure that it had "robust risk management systems in place."
The pricing problem at NatWest Markets raises concerns about the wider banking sector, and whether or not it is adequately managing risks. The sector has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, amid concerns that banks are taking too much risk and engaging in risky practices.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK's financial watchdog, has expressed its concerns over the sector's risk management practices and has been pushing banks to improve their risk management systems.
The FCA has also been clear that it expects banks to be transparent about any problems they encounter and that it will take action if it feels that banks are not adequately managing their risks.
Given the significant losses that NatWest Markets has incurred, it is likely that the FCA will investigate the matter further and may take action if it feels that the bank has not adequately managed its risks.
The issue also raises questions over the level of oversight that RBS is providing to its investment banking arm. RBS has been under intense pressure in recent years, following a string of scandals and financial losses, and it is likely that its oversight of NatWest Markets will come under scrutiny as a result of this latest incident.
In conclusion, the pricing problem at NatWest Markets has highlighted the need for the banking sector to improve its risk management systems. It has also raised questions over the level of oversight that RBS is providing to its investment banking arm and whether or not the sector is adequately managing its risks. The FCA is likely to investigate the matter further, and it is important that banks are transparent about any problems they encounter and take steps to improve their risk management systems.
