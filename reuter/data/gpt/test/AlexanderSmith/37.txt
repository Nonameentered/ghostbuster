Schroders Plc, one of the largest investment management companies in the world, is aiming to improve returns from its merchant banking business. The company has been investing heavily in its merchant banking arm, which focuses on investing in private companies and providing financial advice to entrepreneurs.
The move comes at a time when the company is facing increased competition from other asset managers and private equity firms. With interest rates still at historic lows, many institutional investors are looking for alternative investments that can generate higher returns. Schroders is hoping to tap into this demand with its merchant banking business.
The company has made a number of significant investments in recent years, including a $1.2bn investment in US-based private equity firm Carlyle Group in 2018. Schroders has also invested in French private equity firm Tikehau and UK asset manager River and Mercantile.
Schroders is looking to expand its merchant banking business further, and has appointed Chris King as CEO of the unit. King was previously the CEO of Merchant Banking at another large financial institution, and brings with him significant experience in the sector.
The company is also looking to attract more high net worth individuals as clients for its merchant banking business. It has recently launched a new platform aimed at these investors, which will allow them to invest in private companies alongside Schroders.
Speaking about the company's plans, CEO Peter Harrison said: "Schroders has a long history in merchant banking, and we believe there is significant potential for growth in this area. We are investing heavily in our team and our technology to ensure we can provide our clients with the best possible service and generate strong returns."
The move into merchant banking is part of Schroders' wider strategy to diversify its business and generate higher returns for its investors. The company has been investing heavily in its private assets division, which includes real estate, infrastructure, and private equity investments.
In 2020, the company acquired a majority stake in real estate investment manager Pamfleet Group, which has a significant presence in Asia. Schroders is also looking to expand its presence in the US real estate market, and recently hired a team of executives to help with this effort.
The company has also been investing in its technology and digital capabilities. It recently launched a new digital platform for its wealth management business, which will allow clients to access their accounts and investments online.
Schroders has been performing well in recent years, despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The company reported a 15% increase in profits in 2020, and its assets under management increased by 11% to Â£658.4bn.
The company's shares have also performed well on the stock market, with a year-to-date increase of 12.5%. Analysts are optimistic about the company's prospects, with many citing its strong position in the asset management industry and its focus on growth and diversification.
In conclusion, Schroders Plc is aiming to improve returns from its merchant banking business, as part of its wider strategy to diversify its business and generate higher returns for investors. With significant investments in private equity firms, new technology platforms, and expanded real estate capabilities, the company is well-positioned for growth in the years ahead. Analysts are optimistic about its prospects, and believe that Schroders will continue to be a major player in the asset management industry for years to come.
