Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, has frozen the personal assets of one of its fund managers following suspicion of irregularities in several of the company's funds.
The fund manager, who has not been named, is currently under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for various allegations relating to the performance of funds under their management.
The irregularities were first discovered by the company's internal compliance team during a routine audit. Upon further investigation, they discovered significant discrepancies in the valuation of certain assets within several funds, which appeared to have been artificially inflated to improve performance figures.
The company subsequently reported its findings to the FCA and began an internal investigation into the matter. During this process, they froze the personal assets of the fund manager, including their bank accounts and any personal investments they had made.
Deutsche Bank has stressed that, while the investigation is ongoing, they have no evidence that any clients have been affected by the suspected irregularities.
In a statement, the bank said: "Suspicious activity has been identified across several funds managed by the individual under investigation, and we are cooperating fully with regulators to provide information to assist their investigation."
The FCA has declined to comment on the investigation, but it is likely that the bank will face significant regulatory scrutiny over the coming months.
This is not the first time that Deutsche Bank has faced controversy over its asset management arm. In 2018, it was fined Â£163 million by the FCA over its role in the manipulation of benchmark interest rates in the years leading up to the financial crisis.
The bank has also faced criticism over its handling of the recent pandemic, with analysts suggesting that its decision to cut its dividend during the crisis may have contributed to a decline in investor confidence.
The latest investigation is likely to further damage the bank's reputation, particularly if evidence emerges that clients have been affected by the alleged irregularities.
Investors in the funds affected by the investigation are likely to be concerned about the potential impact on their investments. It is unclear at this stage how long the investigation will take, or whether any funds will need to be closed or wound up as a result of the alleged irregularities.
Deutsche Bank has said that it is committed to cooperating fully with the FCA investigation and taking all necessary steps to ensure that its asset management arm operates to the highest standards of compliance and transparency.
However, the current investigation raises broader questions about the regulatory framework that governs asset management firms in the UK. The FCA has faced criticism in recent years for failing to crack down on malpractice and misconduct within the sector, particularly in light of the Woodford scandal, which saw one of the UK's most high-profile funds collapse in 2019.
Some analysts have argued that the FCA needs to take a more proactive approach to ensuring that asset managers are held accountable for their actions, rather than simply relying on them to self-regulate.
The Morgan Grenfell investigation is likely to fuel calls for greater scrutiny of the sector and for tougher regulatory measures to be put in place to protect investors.
For the moment, however, investors in Morgan Grenfell funds will be watching the investigation closely, and considering their options as the investigation unfolds. The freeze on the personal assets of the fund manager is a significant step and reflects the gravity of the situation, but it remains to be seen what other measures Deutsche Bank will take to address the issues identified by its internal compliance team and the FCA.
