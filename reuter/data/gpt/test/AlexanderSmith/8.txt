German and Dutch banks are eyeing the British fund management business as they look to expand their operations in the UK. However, with Brexit and new regulations complicating the market, their options may be limited.
The UK's fund management industry is a major part of its financial sector, managing around Â£9 trillion ($11.5 trillion) in assets. This has drawn the attention of German and Dutch banks, who have been seeking to grow their presence in the UK, particularly in the wake of Brexit.
German lenders Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, and Dutch bank ING, have all expressed interest in acquiring British fund management businesses. These banks are looking to capitalize on the UK's liberal regulations, which have made it one of the most attractive locations for fund managers in the world.
However, with Brexit looming, these banks are faced with new challenges. With the UK set to leave the EU in just a few months, it is unclear what the future of the country's financial sector will look like. This has made it difficult for foreign banks to assess the risks of investing in the UK.
Moreover, the UK government has signaled its intention to tighten regulations in the financial sector, which will make it harder for foreign banks to operate in the country. This has created uncertainty in the market, and made it more difficult for banks to assess the value of the businesses they are looking to acquire.
Despite these challenges, German and Dutch banks remain optimistic about their prospects in the UK. Deutsche Bank, for instance, has been looking at the possibility of acquiring UK asset management firm Jupiter Asset Management, which could give it a foothold in the British market. Commerzbank is also said to be considering expanding its operations in the UK.
Despite this interest, however, there are limited options available for foreign banks looking to acquire British fund management businesses. This is because many of the larger UK-based firms are already owned by foreign companies, such as Aberdeen Standard Life and Janus Henderson.
This means that the banks that are left to acquire are often the smaller, less established ones, which may carry more risk for foreign investors. Moreover, these companies are often not as well known, making due diligence more difficult, and potentially regulatory issues more complex.
This has led some analysts to question the feasibility of foreign banks acquiring UK fund management businesses. "The sector is already so concentrated among a handful of dominant players that there are few targets left for investors to go after," notes one expert. "Moreover, the regulatory hurdles associated with investing in the financial sector are likely to become increasingly burdensome in the coming years."
Despite these concerns, however, some foreign banks remain undeterred. ING, for example, has recently acquired a majority stake in Frankfurt-based asset manager NNIP, and may be looking to expand its presence in the UK as well.
Overall, the outlook for foreign banks looking to acquire British fund management businesses is mixed. While there are certainly opportunities to be had, these are likely to be limited, and may be complicated by Brexit and new regulations. The sector is already highly concentrated, making it harder for investors to find attractive targets, and the regulatory landscape is set to become more challenging in the coming years. Nonetheless, for banks that are able to navigate these obstacles, the rewards could be significant.
