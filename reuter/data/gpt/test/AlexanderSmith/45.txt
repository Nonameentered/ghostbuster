David Atkins, CEO of retail property company Hammerson, has predicted a promising future for the British market for the next two years. Atkins emphasised that the British market has seen a boost due to the Brexit transition deal which instills greater confidence in the market and preserves stability in the business environment.
Atkins looked positive about the company's future prospects and believes they have a secure footing to combat the pressures placed on the retail sector post COVID-19. Hammerson has taken measures to restructure their portfolio, which has included the sale of many U.K. sectors such as retail parks. These measures are expected to boost profits and this, combined with an optimistic outlook of the industry over the next two years, should bode well for the future of the organisation.
Atkins said the situation is far from ideal, but they have learned a lot from the pandemic and taking those lessons they have a good plan in place. He warns that the post-pandemic period will lead to changes in the way people shop, with stores emphasising on creating more customer experience-driven acquisitions.
Speaking about the vaccine rollout, Atkins said that significant progress has been made to vaccinate people, and stores in the UK are due to reopen on April 12th, which is expected to boost consumer spending. With a sense of cautious optimism, Mr. Atkins expressed confidence about the future, stressing the importance of retaining a positive outlook and resilience as an organisation to tackle the challenges ahead and deliver strong growth.
