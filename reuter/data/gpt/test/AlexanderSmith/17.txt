A former aide of the late businessman Asil Nadir, who was the founder of the now-defunct UK-based company Polly Peck, is awaiting the judgement of his appeal against his conviction for money laundering.
Mehmet Hassan, who was also a director of Polly Peck, was sentenced to five years in jail in 2019 for the offence. He was found guilty of laundering £2.5m ($3.4m) through his personal bank accounts between August and October 1990.
The Court of Appeal in London heard the arguments of Hassan's lawyers and the prosecution on Friday, November 19. The three-judge panel is expected to deliver its verdict in the coming weeks.
Hassan, who is now 56 years old, has maintained his innocence since his arrest in 2013. He told the court during his trial that he had no knowledge of the money's source and that he had been deceived by Nadir, who had fled the UK in 1993 while facing charges of theft and false accounting.
The prosecution argued that Hassan was a "trusted lieutenant" of Nadir and had actively participated in laundering the money, which was part of the proceeds from the collapse of Polly Peck in 1990. The company, which was an international conglomerate with interests in electronics, fruit-growing and hotels, went bankrupt with debts of around £1.3bn ($1.8bn).
Nadir was eventually extradited to the UK from Northern Cyprus in 2010 and was found guilty of ten charges of theft and false accounting in 2012. He was sentenced to ten years in jail but was released in 2016, after serving less than half of his term.
Hassan's appeal is based on the argument that the judge who presided over his trial had made a mistake in allowing evidence from the prosecution that was inadmissible. His lawyers also claim that the judge had failed to properly direct the jury on the issue of his knowledge or suspicion of the money's criminal origin.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is representing the prosecution in the case, has argued that the judge had not made any errors and that Hassan's conviction was based on "overwhelming evidence".
The case has attracted media attention in Turkey, where Hassan is a citizen, as well as in the UK. Some observers have linked the case to wider concerns about the fairness of the justice system in the UK, especially in cases involving people from ethnic minority backgrounds.
Hassan's lawyers have also argued that he was unfairly targeted by the authorities because of his ethnicity and his association with Nadir, who was also a Turkish Cypriot. They have pointed to the fact that other Polly Peck executives and directors, who were predominantly white, were not charged with money laundering.
The outcome of Hassan's appeal will be closely watched by legal experts and businesspeople alike, as it could have implications for future cases involving allegations of fraud and money laundering. It is also likely to have an impact on the reputation of the UK's justice system, which has been under scrutiny in recent years for a range of issues, including delays in trials and the treatment of minority defendants.
