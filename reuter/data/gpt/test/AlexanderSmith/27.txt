Close Brothers Group (CBG) has witnessed a significant rise in its earnings, thanks to the unprecedented success of its corporate finance business. In its recent trading update for Q3 2021, the British merchant banking group announced that the division has exceeded its expectations and aided the company in achieving stellar results despite the ongoing pandemic.
CBG's corporate financial division delivered excellent performance for the quarter, with total income rising by 27% and an increase of 29% in its operating profit. The bank attributed these results to successful restructuring of the division and the growth in its advisory and equity structuring offerings. While market challenges posed by the pandemic have undoubtedly played a role, it is clear that the company's business strategy and offerings have proven accessible and relevant to clients.
The strength of CBG's corporate finance business is an excellent achievement, given the current challenging climate. Businesses have struggled to maintain revenue growth and cope with unprecedented challenges, such as the lockdown measures that have forced firms to close their doors and disrupt the economy. Yet, CBG's ability to deliver strong results in the sector shows the potential for growth and opportunity to be found amidst setback.
In addition to strong results in corporate finance, CBG's other divisions have also shown movement in a positive direction. Its lending division has seen increased demand for asset finance and strengthened its net loan book by 2%, contributing to a 19% growth in the operating profit. Similarly, the wealth management division reported growth in assets under management via both acquisition and organic growth, which contributed to a 12% rise in total income.
Statistically, CBG posted adjusted operating profits of £133.4m for Q3 2021, up by 8% YoY from £127.9m earned during the same period in 2020. The demonstration of improvement during this period proves the company's ability to weather the prevailing storm brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The CBG's CEO, Adrian Sainsbury, is confident that the bank's success will continue, thanks to the resilience it has shown in adapting to the current market situation. He suggests that the following quarters will build upon the significant achievements of Q3 2021 due to the strength and flexibility of the organisation.
"We will continue to concentrate our efforts on delivering exceptional service to our clients across all our businesses," he said. "We will maintain a cautious approach and continue to monitor the environment for any changes in customer behaviour and payment patterns.”
Sainsbury is firm in his resolution that the bank will continue collaborating to ensure the provision of the full range of transactional services that clients require. Collaboration has been pivotal to CGB’s success, and the bank recognises that this is further strengthened by its continued commitment to nurturing relationships with clients.
Finally, the bank reported that its balance sheet remains strong, which has allowed it to expand the lending book. CBG's total customer deposits increased by 16% in Q3 2021 YoY, while its loan book increased by 35%. Additionally, the bank's CET1 ratio increased to 14.4%, demonstrating good quality capital and finances.
The CBG's financial results for Q3 2021 speak to the strength of the organisation’s business model, which has proven resilient in the face of adverse circumstances. The bank's ability to overcome obstacles and deliver a strong market performance aligns with its reputation as one of the UK's most trusted merchant banks. Moreover, it demonstrates the vast potential for success that lies in diversifying service offerings and seeking new opportunities in challenging times.
