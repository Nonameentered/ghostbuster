U.S. and European firms have joined hands to develop the world's first system for Internet money transactions that uses smart cards and a GSM network. The product, dubbed SmartMoney, was unveiled at a press conference in Berlin yesterday.
SmartMoney is a secure and easy-to-use solution for sending and receiving money online, without the need for a traditional bank account. The system uses a smart card, similar to a credit card, which is embedded with a microprocessor that stores the user's financial information and allows them to authorize and make transactions.
The card is linked to the user's mobile phone number, which is used as a unique identifier to authenticate transactions. Using the phone's SMS service, users can send and receive money to and from other SmartMoney users, as well as make online purchases at participating merchants.
SmartMoney has been in development for several years, and has already undergone extensive testing with pilot programs in select cities across the U.S. and Europe. The system is now ready for wider deployment, and will be rolled out in stages over the coming months.
"We believe that SmartMoney has the potential to revolutionize the way people make transactions online," said Maria Ramos, CEO of SmartMoney Inc. "By eliminating the need for traditional banking, we are opening up financial services to a whole new group of people who previously had limited access."
SmartMoney is targeted primarily at younger consumers, who are more likely to be comfortable with digital payments and less likely to have a traditional bank account. However, the system is also expected to appeal to anyone who wants a faster, more convenient and more secure way to make online transactions.
The product has already garnered attention from major investors, with several prominent venture capital firms backing the development of the system. The founders of SmartMoney hope that it will eventually become a global solution for online transactions, and are already in talks with interested partners around the world.
"We believe that SmartMoney is just the beginning of a new era of digital finance, where individuals can take control of their own financial lives and participate fully in the digital economy," said Ramos. "We are excited to bring this platform to the world, and see what amazing things people will do with it."
