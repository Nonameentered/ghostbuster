Nick Leeson, the former Barings bank trader who was responsible for the largest financial scandal in history, has been banned from the financial sector for three years. Leeson had refused to comply with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules, which were put in place after his actions caused the collapse of Barings bank in 1995.
The FCA, which regulates financial services firms and markets in the UK, said that Leeson had failed to disclose that he was providing investment advice on social media, contravening the FCA’s rules on promotion. In taking the decision to ban Leeson, the FCA said that he had “not recognised or understood the importance of compliance functions and the need for effective controls to ensure compliance with the rules.”
The FCA also criticised Leeson for failing to appreciate the gravity of his actions in causing the collapse of Barings bank. In 1995, Leeson ran up losses of £827m through unauthorised trades, which wiped out Barings, one of Britain’s oldest merchant banks. The collapse resulted in the loss of around 1,100 jobs and an international scandal.
Since his release from prison in Singapore in 1999, Leeson has given talks to business organisations and has been involved in a number of business ventures. He has also written several books about his experiences, including “Rogue Trader”, which was turned into a Hollywood film.
Leeson has criticised the FCA’s decision to ban him, arguing that he is being unfairly targeted by the regulatory body and that the rules are too restrictive. He has also claimed that his ban would prevent him from doing business in Singapore, where he currently lives. In a statement, Leeson said, “I do not believe I am bound by the FCA’s rules, and I will continue to offer investment advice and provide other financial services to clients outside the UK.”
Leeson’s ban comes at a time when the FCA is stepping up its enforcement activity and cracking down on individuals and organisations that breach its rules. In the past year, the FCA has issued a number of high-profile fines and bans, including a £3.4m fine on Defaqto for misleading customers, and a ban and £100,000 fine on former London Capital and Finance boss, Simon Hume-Kendall.
The FCA has also launched investigations into a number of companies over potential breaches of anti-money laundering rules, including HSBC and Standard Chartered. The regulator is also reviewing the way it supervises firms, following criticism that it has been too lenient in the past.
In a statement, the FCA said that it would not tolerate individuals who fail to comply with its rules, and that it was committed to ensuring that the financial sector operates with integrity. “The FCA will take action against individuals and firms who fail to meet our standards, and we will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that consumers are protected,” said Mark Steward, FCA Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight.
The ban on Nick Leeson serves as a reminder that the financial sector is subject to strict regulatory controls, and that individuals who violate these rules can face harsh consequences. It also highlights the importance of effective compliance and control measures in financial firms, which can help to prevent rogue trading and other unethical behaviours.
