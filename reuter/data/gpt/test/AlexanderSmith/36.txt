NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, has announced that it will take firm action over an $80.2 million loss on its interest rate options business. The loss was discovered during a routine audit and has been attributed to a combination of poor risk management and unexpected market volatility.
This announcement comes as a blow to NatWest Markets, which had been on a strong growth trajectory over the last year. The division had posted a profit of $570 million in 2020, up from $381 million the previous year, thanks to strong performance in its fixed-income and currency businesses.
The $80.2 million loss relates specifically to NatWest's interest rate options trading desk, which is responsible for buying and selling derivatives that give holders the right to buy or sell an underlying security at a fixed price. These options are used by banks and other financial institutions to manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
According to NatWest Markets, the loss was caused by a combination of poor risk management and unexpected changes in interest rate volatility. Following the discovery of the loss, the bank has launched an internal investigation into why these issues were not identified earlier.
NatWest Markets has also taken steps to address the problem, including:
- Making changes to the management structure of the interest rate options desk, including appointing a new head of trading and strengthening its risk management function.
- Implementing new controls and procedures to better manage the risks associated with interest rate options trading.
- Reviewing the entire business to ensure that there are no other instances of poor risk management or loss-making activities.
In a statement, NatWest Markets CEO Chris Marks said:
"We are deeply disappointed by this loss, and we are taking it very seriously. The factors that contributed to this loss should have been identified and managed more effectively. We are conducting a thorough review of our entire business to ensure that this does not happen again."
Marks also confirmed that the bank is fully cooperating with regulators, including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is expected to launch its own investigation in due course.
The news of the loss has caused some concern among stakeholders in the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, which is 62% owned by the UK government. The government has been looking to sell its stake in the bank, and any negative news could affect the sale price.
However, analysts have been quick to point out that the loss is relatively small in the context of NatWest Markets' overall business. The division generated revenues of $4.4 billion in 2020, and the $80.2 million loss represents just 1.8% of that total.
In addition, NatWest Markets has a strong track record of addressing problems quickly and effectively. In 2018, the bank was fined $4.9 billion by the US Department of Justice over its role in the subprime mortgage crisis, but it was able to bounce back and return to profitability within two years.
Overall, the news of NatWest Markets' $80.2 million loss is certainly unwelcome, but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the bank as a whole. The division has taken swift action to address the problem, and investors will be watching closely to see how the bank continues to perform in the coming months.
