Woolwich members have voted overwhelmingly in favor of converting to a publicly listed bank, enabling them to receive share windfall benefits. The historic decision was made at a virtual AGM held on Tuesday. The move comes after Woolwich's board of directors recommended the shift to boost the company's financial prospects and provide members with enhanced opportunities for return on investment.
Woolwich, which was established in 1847 as an independent local building society, has grown into a widely recognized and esteemed brand in the UK financial sector, with branches throughout the country. The company currently has around 2.8 million customers and assets worth over £70 billion. However, the institution has been struggling in recent years to keep up with the changing banking landscape, particularly with the rise of online banking and FinTech startups.
The conversion to a publicly listed bank will allow Woolwich to access external capital and modernize its operations, enabling it to compete more effectively with new, more agile players in the banking industry. Additionally, the conversion will provide Woolwich members with an opportunity to cash in on their investments in the institution and benefit from any future growth.
Under the terms of the conversion, Woolwich will issue new shares to members worth £200 million, which will be distributed based on the value of each member's account. For example, a member with £10,000 in savings will receive approximately £5,700 worth of shares. Members will also be allowed to purchase additional shares in the company at a discounted rate.
The conversion will mean that Woolwich will no longer operate as a building society and will instead function as a fully-fledged bank. The change will also lead to some alterations in operational procedures, with members being asked to change their accounts to deposit accounts and sign new agreements with the bank.
Woolwich Chairman, Emily Parker, expressed delight at the overwhelmingly positive result of the vote, saying, "I am thrilled that our members have made this historic decision. This represents a new era for Woolwich, as we seek to position ourselves for the future and enhance the financial wellbeing of our members. We are keen to enter the public markets with strength, and we are excited by the prospects for growth and innovation."
The move by Woolwich to convert to a publicly listed bank is the latest example of a long-running trend that has seen small building societies forced to evolve or die out altogether. As competition in the UK banking sector has increased, and technology has made it easier for new players to enter the market, small building societies have found it increasingly difficult to keep up.
Some have merged with larger banks or other building societies, while others have diversified their business models to stay afloat. However, Woolwich's decision to convert to a publicly listed company is unique in the UK banking sector, making it a significant event in the financial world.
It remains to be seen how Woolwich will fare once it has completed its transformation into a publicly listed bank. However, the institution's decision to take on the challenges of the modern banking industry head-on, and to pivot towards becoming a more dynamic player, is a positive step for the institution and its members alike. Only time will tell how successful Woolwich's transition proves to be, but for now, it looks like the institution is set for a promising future.
