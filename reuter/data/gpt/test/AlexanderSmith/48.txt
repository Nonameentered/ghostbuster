Triodos Bank, the Dutch sustainable bank that launched in the UK in 2015, has more than doubled in size in just one year, generating steady growth while maintaining its socially and environmentally-friendly lending approach.
According to the bank’s 2016 annual report, profits soared from £1.5m in 2015 to £3.2m last year, which was the bank’s first full year servicing the UK market. Triodos now has 34,000 customers in the UK, up from the 33,000 it had reported in January of this year.
Bevis Watts, Managing Director of Triodos Bank UK, said in a statement: “Last year’s results are proof that the momentum behind sustainable banking is growing in the UK, as more and more people and organisations want to bank with a financial institution that is transparent, ethical and puts their money to positive use.”
The bank is known for lending to social and environmental projects, rather than to fossil fuel industries, for example. This makes it stand out from mainstream banks, which have come under fire in recent years for their investments and loans in sectors that harm people and the planet.
Triodos has granted over £700m in loans to sectors including food and farming, renewable energy, culture, social housing and sustainable businesses since its inception in the UK. Its customers include Shakespeare’s Globe, River Cottage, low-carbon energy supplier Good Energy and the Ethical Property Company.
In addition, the bank has launched a new crowdfunding platform this year, enabling people to invest directly in a range of positive projects, from renewable energy to organic farms. 
On its website, the bank states that its mission is “to make money work for positive social, environmental and cultural change” and, as such, it is transparent about the projects it invests in. This means its customers know where their money is going and what impact it is having.
Triodos Bank was ranked as the most sustainable bank in the world by the Global Sustainability Benchmark in 2017, and was also given the UK’s first banking licence in 2016 after being assessed and approved by the Financial Conduct Authority.
The bank’s success in the UK is part of a wider move towards ethical and sustainable banking in Europe. Last year, Sweden’s Handelsbanken became the first mainstream bank to offer a savings account that did not invest in fossil fuels. This was part of a wider trend as Handelsbanken joined other banks, such as ABN Amro and Crédit Agricole, which have recently committed to ending fossil fuel financing.
Triodos Bank’s growth is impressive and shows that more and more people are looking for alternatives to traditional banks. A survey by YouGov in 2016 revealed that 39% of UK adults would consider moving their money to an ethical bank or building society if they knew of one.
Watts added: “We believe that our positive approach to banking offers a real choice for people who want to make sure that every penny they entrust to their bank is being used to create a better world, while achieving a fair and reasonable financial return.”
Triodos Bank’s success in the UK is a positive sign that ethical and sustainable banking can be profitable, and that people are willing to support it. With mainstream banks starting to follow suit, the future looks bright for sustainable finance.
