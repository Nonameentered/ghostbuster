Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, one of the premier asset management firms in Europe, is facing a major fallout after refusing to reinstate Nicola Horlick as a fund manager. Horlick, who has over 30 years of experience in the finance industry, was fired from her role as CEO of Bramdean Asset Management in 2015. She subsequently filed a lawsuit against her former employer, alleging wrongful dismissal and demanding £10m ($13m) in damages.
The legal battle between Horlick and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, which acquired Bramdean in 2009, has been ongoing for several years. In September 2020, a London judge ruled in Horlick's favour, stating that she had been unfairly dismissed and awarding her £20,000 ($26,000) in compensation. The judge also ordered Deutsche Morgan Grenfell to reinstate Horlick to her former position as a fund manager.
However, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell has refused to comply with the court's ruling, citing "operational reasons". The firm has stated that Horlick's skills and experience are no longer relevant to its current business model, which is focused on passive investments and index funds. The decision has sparked outrage among Horlick's supporters, who say that it sends a dangerous message to women in the finance industry.
Horlick, who is often referred to as the "City Superwoman" for her ability to juggle a successful career with motherhood, has been a prominent figure in the finance industry for decades. She began her career as a trainee at SG Warburg in the 1980s, before moving to Morgan Grenfell, where she became one of the youngest directors in the firm's history. In 1997, she founded her own asset management firm, SG Asset Management, which she sold to Societe Generale in 1998 for £294m ($385m).
After a brief hiatus to care for her daughter, Horlick returned to the finance industry in 2004, founding Bramdean Asset Management. The firm, which focused on alternative investments such as private equity and hedge funds, attracted significant attention from investors and the media. However, in 2008, the global financial crisis hit, and Bramdean's performance suffered. The firm was eventually acquired by Deutsche Bank in 2009.
After her dismissal from Bramdean, Horlick filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, claiming that she had been fired unfairly and that the firm had discriminated against her on the basis of her gender and age. She alleged that her dismissal was part of a wider pattern of discrimination at the firm, which had a "macho culture" and was dominated by male executives.
Throughout the legal battle, Horlick has been an outspoken critic of the finance industry's treatment of women. In a 2019 interview, she stated that the industry was "institutionally sexist" and that women were often held back by outdated attitudes and stereotypes. She called for greater transparency and accountability in the hiring and promotion processes, and for firms to take concrete steps to address gender imbalance and discrimination.
The refusal to reinstate Horlick has been met with widespread condemnation from industry insiders and gender equality advocates. Many have criticized Deutsche Morgan Grenfell for failing to live up to its stated commitment to diversity and inclusion. The firm has come under particular scrutiny for its lack of women in senior management positions. In 2019, only 24% of the firm's senior managers were women, compared to an industry average of 31%.
The fallout from the decision is likely to be significant. Horlick's supporters have called for a boycott of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's funds and services, and have urged other investors to do the same. The firm's reputation has also been damaged, with many questioning its commitment to ethical and responsible business practices.
The case has highlighted the wider issue of gender inequality in the finance industry, which continues to be dominated by men at every level of the hierarchy. Despite some progress in recent years, women remain significantly underrepresented in senior roles, and are often subject to discrimination and harassment. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated these issues, with women disproportionately affected by job losses and economic insecurity.
The refusal to reinstate Horlick may be a setback for gender equality in the finance industry, but it has also galvanized activists and advocates to push for change. Horlick herself has pledged to continue fighting for greater transparency and inclusion in the industry, and has called on other women to do the same. As she stated in a recent interview, "We need to keep pushing for change, and not let setbacks like this deter us. The battle for gender equality is far from over."
