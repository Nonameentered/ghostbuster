The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has ramped up its investigation into Morgan Grenfell investment funds, focusing on the firm’s connections with Luxembourg-based companies. The SFO is looking into potential financial misconduct, including money laundering, fraud and bribery, during the 1990s and early 2000s.
Morgan Grenfell, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, was a major player in the UK investment industry in the 1990s, managing more than £10 billion in assets. However, the company suffered a major scandal in 1996 when it emerged that the company’s high-profile fund manager – Peter Young – had made unauthorised investments in unlisted securities.
The scandal led to a major investigation by regulatory bodies including the Financial Services Authority (FSA), and Morgan Grenfell was heavily fined. However, subsequent investigations have suggested that the problems at the company may have been more widespread than initially thought.
The SFO’s investigation is now looking into the company’s connections with Luxembourg-based companies, and whether these relationships were used to facilitate financial misconduct. A spokesperson for the SFO said: “We have been investigating allegations of serious financial misconduct relating to the Morgan Grenfell funds for some time, and we can confirm that we have now expanded the scope of our investigation to include the company’s connections with Luxembourg-based entities.”
The spokesperson added that the investigation was ongoing, and that there could be no guarantees of any eventual outcomes. “We are determined to get to the bottom of these allegations, and we are following all possible leads. However, it is too early to say what may come of this investigation.”
Morgan Grenfell is not the only company to have been hit by allegations of financial misconduct relating to Luxembourg. In recent years, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has become a major hub for tax-efficient financial products, including investment funds. While much of this activity has been legal, there have been concerns raised about the ease with which companies can set up complex structures to minimise their tax liabilities.
Last year, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) published a report based on leaked documents from a major offshore law firm, which detailed how hundreds of global companies had used Luxembourg to channel billions of dollars in profits from one country to another. The report claimed that many of these companies had structured their arrangements in such a way that their activities were not illegal in the strictest sense, but were ethically questionable.
Commenting on the SFO investigation, Paul Austin, a partner at law firm Eversheds Sutherland, said: “It is clear that the regulator is continuing to target high-profile financial misconduct cases, and it is also clear that the perceived lax regulation in Luxembourg is a major concern. It will be interesting to see what comes of this investigation, but it is clear that companies need to be very careful when setting up structures that could be perceived as being opaque.”
For its part, Deutsche Bank has said that it is fully cooperating with the SFO investigation, and that it takes such allegations very seriously. A statement from the bank read: “We are committed to cooperating with all regulatory and law enforcement authorities in relation to the Morgan Grenfell funds, and we will take appropriate action where necessary.”
The allegations relating to Morgan Grenfell are just the latest in a string of scandals to have rocked the UK investment industry in recent years. In 2019, the SFO brought charges against Barclays Bank in relation to its 2008 fundraising activities, alleging that the bank had made illegal payments to Qatar to secure funding during the financial crisis.
Meanwhile, the investigation into collapsed construction giant Carillion has also exposed alleged financial misconduct on a major scale. The company, which went into liquidation in 2018, had been a major player in the UK outsourcing industry, but was found to have been using dodgy accounting practices to conceal mounting debt.
As the SFO’s investigation into Morgan Grenfell continues, it is clear that financial misconduct remains a major concern for both regulators and investors alike. With the continued growth of tax-efficient financial products, there will no doubt be further investigations into the use of offshore jurisdictions like Luxembourg to facilitate such practices. Companies need to ensure that they are transparent and upfront about their activities if they are to avoid the risk of regulatory action in the future.
