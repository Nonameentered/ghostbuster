Hambro Countrywide, the UK's leading estate agency and property services provider, is gearing up for further growth, driven by the ongoing recovery in the housing market.
The company, which is part of the Countrywide plc group, has already experienced a notable uptick in demand for its services, as buyers and sellers return to the market following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.
According to Hambro Countrywide's latest market report, the average UK house price rose by 6.5% in the year to January 2021, compared to a rise of just 1.3% in the previous 12 months. The report notes that this growth has been driven by a range of factors, including low interest rates, strong demand, and the government's stamp duty holiday.
As a result, Hambro Countrywide has seen a surge in instructions from customers looking to sell their homes or buy a new property. The company has also expanded its mortgage and conveyancing services, reflecting the broader trend towards more integrated property services.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Hambro Countrywide CEO, David Cox, said that the company was well positioned for further growth, despite competition from a range of digital platforms and other estate agency firms.
"We're seeing huge interest in the market at the moment, and we're expecting that to continue for some time", he said. "We're very confident in the value of our service, and we think that our customers appreciate the personal touch and the expertise that we can offer".
Cox added that Hambro Countrywide had invested heavily in technology and data analytics in recent years, in order to improve its customer service and operate more efficiently.
"We've got a huge amount of data at our fingertips, which allows us to provide really detailed insights into the market and help our customers make informed decisions", he said. "We're also using AI and machine learning to improve our marketing and customer engagement, which is critical in a highly competitive market like this".
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and wider economic uncertainty, Cox is bullish about the future of the housing market, with Hambro Countrywide forecasting continued growth in prices and transaction volumes over the coming months.
"Obviously there are still some unknowns, particularly around the impact of Brexit and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but overall we're very optimistic about the outlook for the market", he said.
He added that Hambro Countrywide was committed to supporting the government's agenda to build more homes and increase housing supply, by promoting sustainable development and working with developers to identify new opportunities.
"We're very conscious of our role in the housing ecosystem, and we want to be part of the solution to the housing crisis in the UK", he said. "We're working closely with developers and local authorities to identify sites for new developments and ensure that they meet the needs of local communities".
Overall, Hambro Countrywide's plans for growth are reflective of the wider trend towards integrated property services in the UK, as consumers seek more convenience and clarity when buying or selling a property.
With a strong brand reputation and a commitment to innovation, the company looks set to thrive in an increasingly competitive marketplace, and continue to help customers navigate the challenges and opportunities of the housing market.
