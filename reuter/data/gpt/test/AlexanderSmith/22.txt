The UK's Labour party has unveiled plans to reform rather than revolutionize the country's financial services industry, pledging to create a "stable and sustainable banking system" after years of regulatory turmoil.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the proposals on Wednesday, promising to introduce a major program of regulatory reform that would curb the excesses of the banking sector without stifling innovation and growth.
"We need a system that encourages enterprise and innovation, but not one that encourages recklessness and systemic risk," he said in a statement. "Our proposals will provide the stability and security that the banking industry needs, whilst promoting greater competition and diversity."
The proposals include the creation of a new, independent regulatory body to oversee the banking industry, along with measures to strengthen the powers of existing regulators such as the FCA, PRA, and BoE.
Under the plans, the new regulator would have the power to impose fines and sanctions on banks that breach its rules, and would be tasked with promoting competition and diversity within the sector.
The party also pledged to crack down on excessive executive pay and bonuses, as part of its wider efforts to tackle income inequality and promote fairer pay structures across the economy.
"We can't have a situation where a few individuals at the top of a bank are earning ten times or twenty times what the rest of their staff are earning," McDonnell said. "We need to create a more just and equitable system, where pay is tied to performance and people are rewarded for their hard work and dedication."
The proposals were warmly received by trade unions and business groups, with many praising the party for its focus on regulatory reform rather than radical change.
"The financial services sector is a vital part of our economy, and we need to ensure that it is well-regulated and sustainable for the long-term," said Frances O'Grady, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress. "Labour's plans strike the right balance between promoting competition and innovation, and protecting consumers and the wider public interest."
The Confederation of British Industry also welcomed the proposals, saying that they recognized the importance of the financial services industry to the wider economy and the need for regulatory reform to promote stability and competition.
"Labour's proposals rightly focus on strengthening the regulatory framework and holding banks accountable for their actions," said Josh Hardie, Deputy Director-General of the CBI. "We need a strong and stable financial system that works for everyone, and this is a positive step towards achieving that goal."
The party's proposals come at a time of increasing concern about the fragility of the UK's banking sector, with many experts warning that it remains vulnerable to another financial crisis.
Last year, the Bank of England warned that banks were at risk of "a material event" due to a lack of resilience and effective risk management, and urged them to take steps to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their risk controls.
Labour's proposals are likely to increase pressure on the government to take similar action, and may fuel calls for a more radical overhaul of the banking system.
However, McDonnell insisted that his party's proposals represented a sensible and pragmatic approach to reforming the industry, and dismissed suggestions that they were insufficiently radical.
"We don't need to tear up the system and start again," he said. "We need to build on the strengths of our existing regulatory framework and make it more effective and responsive to the needs of the economy and the public interest."
"We are committed to achieving a fairer and more sustainable financial system, and we believe that our proposals represent the best possible way of achieving that objective," he added. "We will be working closely with stakeholders and experts to ensure that our proposals are practical, effective and deliver meaningful change for our economy and our society."
