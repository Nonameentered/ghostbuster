The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has announced that it will be launching an investigation into prominent investment management firm Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) over alleged irregularities in its business practices.
MGAM, which is a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, has come under intense scrutiny in recent years after several high-profile cases of misconduct came to light. The SFO's investigation is expected to focus on the ways in which the firm has marketed and sold its investment products to individual clients, as well as its internal practices and controls.
According to sources close to the SFO, the investigation is likely to be lengthy and complex, and could involve a wide range of individuals within the company, as well as external parties such as financial advisers and other intermediaries.
The allegations against MGAM stem from a series of scandals that have emerged in recent years surrounding the sale of investment products to individual clients. Many of these products were marketed as low-risk or diversified, but in reality were highly concentrated in risky or illiquid assets such as property holdings or high-yield bonds.
Some investors have alleged that they were not given an accurate understanding of the risks associated with these products, and that they were misled or poorly advised by their brokers or financial advisers.
In response to the allegations, MGAM has stated that it takes its regulatory responsibilities very seriously, and that it has put in place a number of measures to enhance its systems and controls in this area.
However, the SFO's investigation is likely to raise further questions about the company's practices and business model, and could lead to further regulatory action or legal action against individual employees or the company as a whole.
In the meantime, investors who have been affected by the alleged irregularities are being advised to seek legal advice and to consider their options for recourse.
The SFO is in the process of appointing a team of lawyers and investigators to lead the investigation, and is expected to work closely with other regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies both in the UK and abroad.
Commenting on the announcement, SFO director Lisa Osofsky said: "Our investigation into Morgan Grenfell Asset Management is an important step in our ongoing efforts to tackle financial misconduct and hold individuals and companies accountable for their actions.
We will be working diligently and relentlessly to get to the bottom of these allegations and to bring those responsible to justice."
