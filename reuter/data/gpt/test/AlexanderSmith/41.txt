NatWest Markets CEO admits unacceptable 77 million stg loss from mispricing since 1994
The chief executive officer of NatWest Markets, Chris Marks, has admitted that the bank has suffered a £77 million loss due to mispricing since 1994. In an interview with the Financial Times, Marks acknowledged that the losses were "unacceptable" and apologized to customers and shareholders for the bank's failure.
The mispricing occurred in the bank's debt capital markets business, where NatWest Markets mispriced a range of products, including bonds and derivatives, over a period of 26 years. The bank discovered the issue in 2019 and reported it to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
According to Marks, the issue was caused by a "structural problem" in the bank's systems and controls that allowed incorrect pricing to go unnoticed for years. He explained that the bank relied on manual processes that made it difficult to detect errors, and that some of these processes were not properly documented or understood.
Marks emphasized that the bank has taken steps to address the problem, including investing in new technology and improving its control framework. He also said that the bank has conducted a thorough review of its debt capital markets business and has identified all of the mispriced products.
NatWest Markets plans to compensate the affected customers and has set aside £204 million to cover the costs. The bank has also agreed to pay a fine of £14.5 million to the FCA for breaching market abuse rules.
The revelation of the mispricing has raised questions about the bank's oversight and governance. The FCA has launched an investigation into NatWest Markets and its parent company, NatWest Group, to determine whether there were wider issues with the bank's control framework.
In a statement, the FCA said that it was "disappointed" that NatWest Markets had failed to properly oversee its debt capital markets business. The regulator emphasized that banks have a responsibility to ensure that their systems and controls are robust and effective.
The revelation of the mispricing has also damaged the bank's reputation. NatWest Group has faced criticism from customers and investors who have accused the bank of putting profits ahead of customers. The bank has responded by pledging to improve its culture and focus more on ethical conduct.
Marks acknowledged that the mispricing issue was a "serious blow" to the bank's reputation but said that the bank was committed to rebuilding trust with customers and stakeholders. He emphasized that the bank had taken the issue seriously and had made significant changes to prevent similar problems in the future.
NatWest Group has been under pressure in recent years to improve its performance and profitability. The bank has been undergoing a restructuring program that has involved cutting costs and refocusing on core businesses.
Marks said that the bank's focus on profitability had not been the cause of the mispricing issue. He emphasized that the bank was committed to making sure that its systems and controls were effective and transparent.
The mispricing issue at NatWest Markets highlights the importance of effective oversight and governance in financial institutions. Banks have a responsibility to ensure that their systems and controls are robust and effective and that they prioritize the interests of customers and stakeholders. The issue also underscores the need for regulators to be vigilant in monitoring banks' activities and ensuring that they adhere to regulatory standards.
As NatWest Markets works to rebuild its reputation and relationship with customers and stakeholders, it will need to demonstrate a commitment to transparency and ethical conduct. The bank will need to prioritize the interests of its customers and ensure that it has strong systems and processes in place to prevent similar issues in the future. It will also need to work closely with regulators to ensure that it meets regulatory standards and rebuilds trust in the industry as a whole.
