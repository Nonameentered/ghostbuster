Premier Farnell, a British electronic component distributor, has criticized Barclays’ investment banking arm, Barclays BZW, over a profits warning that has hit the parent company's stock. Barclays has faced similar criticism in the past, with many investors raising concerns over the performance of its investment banking division. This latest outburst by Premier Farnell is likely to put further pressure on the bank.
The Manchester-based firm has blamed Barclays for its sluggish performance in recent months. In a statement released on Monday, Premier Farnell said that it had been "adversely affected" by the profits warning issued by Barclays BZW. The warning, which came as a surprise to many investors, has led to a 2% fall in the bank's share price.
Premier Farnell's statement went on to say that Barclays BZW had "not done enough" to address the concerns of its clients, and that this had resulted in a loss of trust. The company added that it would be "reconsidering" its relationship with the bank.
This is not the first time that Barclays has faced criticism over the performance of its investment banking arm. Last year, the bank's management was forced to defend its decision to retain the division, despite pressure from some shareholders to sell it off.
Barclays BZW has also faced criticism for its role in the Libor scandal, in which the bank was fined £290m by regulators for manipulating benchmark interest rates.
Premier Farnell's criticism comes as Barclays is due to report its full-year results later this week. The bank is expected to announce a significant drop in profits, due in part to the performance of its investment banking division.
The bank's CEO, Jes Staley, has been trying to turn around the fortunes of Barclays BZW by focusing on more profitable areas of the business, such as mergers and acquisitions, and cutting back on less profitable activities.
However, this strategy has yet to bear fruit, and the bank's share price has continued to underperform its peers. Many investors are now calling for more drastic action, such as a complete overhaul or even a sale of the investment banking division.
Premier Farnell's criticism is likely to add to the pressure on Jes Staley and his team, as they prepare to present their results to shareholders. The bank has already warned that it will be cutting its dividend by more than half, in order to free up capital for investment in the business.
Investors will be looking closely at the performance of Barclays BZW, and whether the bank can demonstrate that it is making progress towards its goal of becoming a leading player in the investment banking world.
For now, however, the bank's critics are unlikely to be appeased. Premier Farnell's statement is just the latest in a long line of criticisms, and it seems likely that more will follow if the bank's results do not meet expectations.
