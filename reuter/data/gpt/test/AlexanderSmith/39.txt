NatWest Bank announced on Monday that its losses from derivative trading in 2020 were almost double its previous estimate. The revelation came as part of the bank's annual report, and it has raised concerns over the accuracy of banks' financial reporting.
According to the report, NatWest Bank lost £351m ($485m) on derivative trades last year, up from the £185m ($256m) previously reported in its interim results. The bank said the increase was due to the "recognition of additional fair value adjustments."
NatWest's derivative losses were largely down to a portfolio of complex interest rate swap trades, which were designed to protect the bank against rising interest rates. However, when interest rates fell dramatically in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trades resulted in significant losses.
The increase in losses is a major embarrassment for NatWest, which was one of the UK's top-performing banks just a few years ago. The bank has been hit hard by the pandemic, and its share price has plummeted by over 50% since the start of 2020.
NatWest's announcement also follows a similar admission by Goldman Sachs earlier this month, which revealed that its fourth-quarter profits had been hit by derivative losses. The bank's CFO said that the losses were "completely unexpected" and were a result of "unprecedented market conditions."
The news has raised concerns over the accuracy of banks' financial reporting, and some experts believe that more banks could announce losses from derivative trades in the coming months. There are also fears that banks may have systemic issues with their risk management and internal controls.
NatWest's CEO, Alison Rose, has moved to reassure investors that the bank is taking steps to improve its risk management and controls. She said in a statement: "We are committed to ensuring that our risk management practices are robust, and that our controls are effective. We have already taken steps to improve our risk management framework, and we will continue to review and enhance our controls."
However, some analysts remain unconvinced. Jason Napier, an analyst at UBS, said in a note to clients that the increase in NatWest's derivative losses "creates further doubt over the banking sector's ability to manage risk effectively."
The news has also sparked renewed debate over the role of derivatives in the banking sector. Derivatives are complex financial instruments that allow banks to hedge against risks such as interest rate movements and currency fluctuations. However, they are also highly risky and can result in significant losses if not managed properly.
Some experts have called for tighter regulation of the derivatives market, while others argue that banks need to improve their risk management processes and controls. Either way, it is clear that the recent admissions by NatWest and Goldman Sachs have once again highlighted the risks associated with derivatives trading.
In conclusion, NatWest Bank's admission that its derivative losses in 2020 were almost double its previous estimate has raised concerns over the accuracy of banks' financial reporting. The increase in losses is a major embarrassment for the bank, and highlights the risks associated with derivatives trading. It remains to be seen whether other banks will announce losses from derivatives trades in the coming months, but the recent revelations have once again sparked debate over the role of derivatives in the banking sector.
