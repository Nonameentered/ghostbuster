British firm Frasin Limited has offered a solution to prevent financial firms from facing operational risks, inspired by the recent crisis of Media Group Asia Pacific (MGAM).
MGAM, the largest media conglomerate in the Asia Pacific region, faced a major operational risk when their internal systems were hacked and their data was stolen. The incident not only jeopardized their reputation but also led to financial losses worth millions of dollars. Such operational risks can be disastrous for any financial firm and can lead to a ripple effect across the entire industry.
Frasin Limited, a software firm based in London, has developed a solution to prevent such operational risks from occurring in financial firms. The company aims to help financial firms streamline their internal processes and ensure the security of their system, thereby minimizing the risk of operational failures.
"Our software is designed to provide a comprehensive solution to operational risks faced by financial firms," said Jason Bingham, the chief executive officer of Frasin Limited. "We are inspired by the situation at MGAM and believe that our software can prevent such incidents from occurring in the future."
The software, known as Frasin Risk Management System, is an advanced platform that allows financial firms to manage operational risks, compliance issues, and internal controls. The system is equipped with sophisticated algorithms that can detect potential risks and alert the concerned authorities in real-time.
The software is designed to be user-friendly and customizable, allowing financial firms to tailor it to their specific needs. The platform is scalable and can be used by financial firms of all sizes, from small startups to multinational corporations.
"We have developed this software keeping in mind the needs of financial firms operating in an increasingly complex environment," said Bingham. "Our software is not only cost-effective but also easy to use, which ensures that financial firms can focus on their core business while leaving the operational risks to us."
The Frasin Risk Management System uses a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to detect potential risks and provide real-time alerts. The system monitors internal processes, third-party vendors, and other external factors that can impact the business operations of financial firms.
The benefits of using the Frasin Risk Management System are manifold. The platform enables financial firms to manage their compliance requirements efficiently, reducing the risk of penalties and legal action. The software also helps firms to minimize the cost of operational failures, thereby improving their bottom line.
"Our software is not only beneficial for financial firms but also for their clients," said Bingham. "By ensuring the security of their data, financial firms can enhance the trust of their clients and build long-term relationships."
The Frasin Risk Management System has already garnered interest from financial firms across Europe and Asia. The company is currently in talks with several firms to roll out the platform in the near future.
"We are excited by the interest generated in our software and believe that it can make a significant difference for financial firms operating in a complex environment," said Bingham. "Our software is a game-changer, and we look forward to partnering with financial firms to improve their operational risk management."
