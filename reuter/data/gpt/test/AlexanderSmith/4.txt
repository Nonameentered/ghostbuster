Nicola Horlick, one of the most prominent figures in the investment world, has resigned from her role as the chief executive officer (CEO) of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management amid legal action surrounding her involvement in an investment scandal.
Horlick, who was nicknamed "Superwoman" for her seemingly superhuman ability to juggle a demanding career with a large family, was a trailblazer in the male-dominated investment industry. She made her name managing investments at companies such as Morgan Grenfell and Société Générale before setting up her own firm, Bramdean Asset Management, in 2005.
However, her reputation has been tarnished in recent years by her involvement in the collapse of the film finance firm, Invincible Pictures. The firm, which was set up by Horlick's husband, Tim, was accused of defrauding investors out of £16 million by falsely claiming that an Abu Dhabi-based group had invested in the company.
In 2017, Horlick was hit with a legal claim brought by investors who had lost money in Invincible Pictures. The claimants alleged that Horlick had breached her duties as a director by failing to properly oversee the company's operations. Horlick denied any wrongdoing and said she was "confident that the allegations will be shown to be entirely without foundation".
However, her position at Morgan Grenfell became increasingly untenable as the legal action dragged on. The company announced on Monday that Horlick had resigned with immediate effect "to focus on her legal case and to avoid any distraction for Morgan Grenfell and its clients".
In a statement, Horlick said: "It is with great sadness that I have decided to resign from my role at Morgan Grenfell. I have always put the interests of my clients first, and I am confident that the investment philosophy and rigorous risk management processes that I have put in place will continue to serve the firm well."
Horlick's departure is a blow to Morgan Grenfell, which was formed in 1936 and manages around £17 billion on behalf of clients. The company praised Horlick for her "significant contribution" over the past three years, during which time she had led a successful turnaround of the business.
However, the legal action against Horlick is likely to continue for some time, and it remains to be seen whether her reputation will ever fully recover from the Invincible Pictures scandal.
