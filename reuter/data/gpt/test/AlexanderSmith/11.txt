The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has announced that it is expanding its investigation into the activities of Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds. The investigation is focused on the activities of the company's investment funds during the period 1990 to 1996.
The SFO has been investigating allegations of fraud and misleading conduct involving the Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds for some time. It is now expanding its investigation overseas, with a view to gathering more evidence and exploring new leads.
Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds was a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank during the period under investigation. The SFO is investigating allegations that the company's investment funds were used to manipulate the market and that investors were misled about the true value of their investments.
The SFO has been gathering evidence from a range of sources, including interviews with former employees of Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds, and reviewing documents and emails.
In a statement, the SFO said that it had "identified new leads and potential evidence" and that it was "expanding its investigation overseas" to gather more information.
The SFO has not specified which countries it is expanding its investigation to, and it is not clear how long the investigation will take.
The investigation has already led to charges being brought against three former employees of Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds. Peter Young, who was a fund manager at the company, was charged with 13 counts of false accounting in 2003. He later pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to four years in prison.
Two other former employees of the company, Stefan Allesch-Taylor and Howard Leigh, were also charged with false accounting in 2004. The charges were later dropped.
The investigation has also led to a number of civil suits being filed against Deutsche Bank. In 2005, the bank settled a lawsuit brought by the trustees of the pension fund of the Bank of New York for $350m.
In 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $220m to settle a lawsuit brought by investors who had invested in the Morgan Grenfell European Property Fund. The investors claimed that they had been misled about the true value of the fund.
The SFO's investigation into Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds is one of a number of high-profile investigations into financial fraud and misconduct in the UK.
In recent years, the SFO has investigated a number of major companies, including Serco, G4S, Tesco and Rolls-Royce.
The investigation into Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds is particularly significant as it is one of the longest-running investigations in the SFO's history. It has been ongoing for over 20 years.
The SFO has been criticised in the past for the length of its investigations, with some commentators suggesting that it takes too long to bring cases to trial.
However, the SFO has defended the length of its investigations, arguing that complex financial crime cases often require a significant amount of time and resources to investigate properly.
The SFO's Director, Lisa Osofsky, has recently announced a number of reforms to the way the organisation investigates financial crime. These include a focus on engaging with victims and witnesses, and using data analytics to identify potential cases earlier.
Ms Osofsky has also said that the SFO will be looking to collaborate more closely with other law enforcement agencies, both in the UK and overseas.
The SFO's investigation into Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds is likely to be seen as a test case for how effective these reforms will be in speeding up the investigation and prosecution of financial crime.
In conclusion, the Serious Fraud Office is expanding its investigation into Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds overseas. The investigation has been ongoing for over 20 years and is one of the longest-running investigations in the SFO's history.
