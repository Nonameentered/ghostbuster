TrizecHahn Corp, a leading North American commercial real estate company, announced on Monday that it has formed an alliance with a German businessman to expand its reach into the European market.
The new partnership will combine TrizecHahn's expertise in real estate investment and management with the German businessman's extensive network and local knowledge of the European property market.
TrizecHahn's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Gartland, said that the alliance will allow the company to take advantage of the many attractive investment opportunities that exist in Europe. "We see Europe as a very promising market, and we are excited to be partnering with someone who has a deep understanding of the business landscape there," he said. "We believe that this collaboration will benefit both our company and our investors."
While TrizecHahn is best known for its North American properties, it has been gradually expanding its global footprint in recent years. In 2019, the company acquired a prominent commercial property in Seoul, South Korea. It also has a presence in several other countries, including Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.
The German businessman, whose name has not been disclosed, will serve as TrizecHahn's local partner in Europe and will help identify potential investments for the company. He has extensive experience in the property sector, having worked for several prominent European real estate firms over the course of his career.
The partnership is in line with TrizecHahn's strategy to create value for its investors by acquiring high-quality properties in strategic locations and managing them effectively. The company has a proven track record of success in this area, having generated strong returns for its investors over the years.
The announcement of the new alliance was met with enthusiasm by investors, with TrizecHahn's share price rising by 3% on Monday. The company's management team expressed confidence that the partnership will help fuel future growth.
"We are committed to creating long-term value for our investors," said Gartland. "This new alliance is an important step in that direction, and we look forward to working closely with our new partner to achieve our shared goals."
The partnership is expected to officially launch later this month, with TrizecHahn and the German businessman working together to identify potential acquisition targets and begin the due diligence process.
Overall, the alliance represents an exciting opportunity for TrizecHahn to expand its footprint in Europe and create value for its investors.
