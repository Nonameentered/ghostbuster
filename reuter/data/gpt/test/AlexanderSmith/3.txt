Nicola Horlick, also known as "Superwoman" in the finance industry, has resigned from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and plans to take legal action for constructive dismissal.
Horlick had been managing the Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's $1.2 billion European Growth Trust since its launch in 1997. She had also been responsible for the management of four other funds. She was popular among investors due to her impressive track record in the finance industry.
In her resignation letter, Horlick alleged that she suffered "constant undermining and bullying" from her male colleagues. She claimed that the company's management did not support her and that senior executives had subjected her to discriminatory behavior. According to Horlick, she was also excluded from important decision-making processes.
Horlick's resignation comes as a shock to the finance industry. She had been with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell for only two years when she was appointed as the head of the company's UK investment division in 1997. Her appointment had made her the highest-paid woman in the finance industry at the time.
Since then, Horlick had become a role model for women in the finance industry. She had been featured in various articles and interviews, where she shared her experiences and perspectives on the industry. She had also written two books, "Can You Have It All?" and "A Woman's Work".
Horlick's resignation has sparked discussions about the lack of diversity in the finance industry. According to a recent study by Mercer, women make up only 25% of senior roles in finance globally. The same study also found that women in finance earn on average 20% less than their male colleagues.
Horlick's legal action has also brought attention to the issue of constructive dismissal. Constructive dismissal is a legal term used to describe a situation where an employee resigns from their job due to the employer's conduct, which has made the employee's continued employment impossible or intolerable. The employee can then claim wrongful dismissal and seek compensation for loss of earnings.
In cases of constructive dismissal, the employee must prove that the employer's conduct was a fundamental breach of their employment contract. This can be a difficult task, as the employee must provide evidence of the employer's actions. Horlick's case will depend on the evidence she can provide to support her allegations.
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell has issued a statement denying Horlick's allegations. The company stated that it had conducted a thorough investigation into the matter and had found no evidence to support Horlick's claims. The statement also expressed the company's regret at Horlick's decision to resign.
The finance industry has a long way to go in terms of diversity and inclusion. The lack of representation of women and other marginalized groups can lead to discriminatory behavior and toxic work environments. Companies need to take proactive measures to address these issues and create a more inclusive workplace culture.
Horlick's resignation is a wake-up call for the finance industry. It highlights the need for companies to take allegations of discrimination and harassment seriously and to provide a safe and inclusive workplace for all employees. The industry needs more role models like Horlick, who can inspire and encourage diversity and inclusion in the finance industry.
Horlick's legal action will be closely watched by the finance industry. It will be interesting to see how the case pans out and what implications it will have for other cases of constructive dismissal in the future. For now, the finance industry needs to do better in terms of diversity and inclusion, and the experiences of women like Horlick should serve as a reminder of the work that still needs to be done.
