In a move that is set to shake up the European investment banking market, Morgan Stanley announced today that it is to merge with Dean Witter Discover in a deal worth an estimated $10 billion. The merger, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, will create a stronger competitor for the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in the region.
The deal comes at a time of intense competition in the European investment banking market, with firms fighting for a share of the lucrative business in areas such as mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings, and debt financing. Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter Discover, two of the biggest players in the market, have decided to join forces in an attempt to take on the competition and cement their position as one of the leading investment banks in Europe.
The new entity, which will be called Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover, will have a combined workforce of over 22,000 employees worldwide, with a particular focus on Europe. The company will offer a comprehensive range of investment banking services, including equity and debt financing, mergers and acquisitions, and asset management.
The merger is expected to bring a number of benefits to both companies, including increased scale and a wider range of expertise. Morgan Stanley, which has traditionally been strong in areas such as mergers and acquisitions and equity underwriting, will gain access to Dean Witter Discover's expertise in areas such as asset management and retail brokerage. Meanwhile, Dean Witter Discover, a leading player in retail brokerage, will gain access to Morgan Stanley's extensive network of institutional clients.
The merger is expected to have a significant impact on the European investment banking market, with analysts predicting that the new entity will become one of the leading players in the region. The move is also expected to trigger a wave of consolidation in the market, with other firms looking to join forces in order to keep up with the increasingly competitive landscape.
The announcement of the merger has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts, with some describing it as a bold move that will help to drive growth in the market, while others have raised concerns about the potential impact on jobs and competition in the industry.
Speaking about the merger, Morgan Stanley Chairman and CEO, John J. Mack, said: "We are excited to be joining forces with Dean Witter Discover to create a stronger, more competitive investment bank in Europe. This is a significant step forward for our firm and our clients, and we are confident that this combination will create significant value for shareholders and employees."
Dean Witter Discover Chairman and CEO, Philip J. Purcell, added: "This is an exciting opportunity for our firm to become part of one of the leading investment banks in the world. As a combined entity, we will have the scale and expertise to compete effectively in the global markets, while continuing to deliver the highest levels of service to our clients."
The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval and approval from both companies' shareholders. Once completed, the new entity will have a strong foothold in Europe, as well as a significant presence in the United States and Asia.
