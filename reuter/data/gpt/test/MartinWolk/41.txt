Microsoft stock soared to a record high on Wednesday after the tech giant reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, defying the economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The company's shares jumped by over 5% to $214 in after-hours trading, following the release of Microsoft's third quarter results. The Redmond-based company reported a staggering 85% year-on-year increase in its earnings, driven by robust demand for cloud services amid a surge in remote work and learning.
Microsoft's net income for the quarter ending March 31 was $15.5 billion, up from $8.3 billion in the same period last year. The company's revenue rose by 19% to $41.7 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $41.1 billion.
The impressive earnings were driven by the company's cloud division, which recorded a revenue of $15.1 billion, a 23% increase from the same period last year. The division includes Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn.
The pandemic has accelerated the shift towards digital technologies, with more companies and individuals relying on cloud services for remote work and learning. Microsoft's cloud services have been in high demand as a result, with the company reporting a 49% surge in its Azure business.
"Our results reflect the accelerating demand for our cloud offerings driven by remote work and learning scenarios, as well as the ongoing digital transformation of organizations across industries," said Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO.
The company's productivity and business processes division, which includes Office 365, recorded a revenue of $13.6 billion, up by 15% year-on-year. Microsoft Teams, which has become a popular collaboration tool for remote workers, added over 95 million users during the quarter.
"Growth in Teams, driven by work-from-home and learn-from-home scenarios, was again exceptional," said Amy Hood, Microsoft's CFO.
Microsoft's personal computing division, which includes Windows, Surface, and Xbox, also recorded growth, with a revenue of $13 billion, up by 19% compared to the same period last year. The company reported strong demand for its Surface devices, with revenue up by 12%.
The earnings report was a positive surprise for investors, who had expected the pandemic-induced economic downturn to negatively impact Microsoft's revenues. The company's stock has now risen by over 18% this year, compared to a decline of 0.2% in the S&P 500 index.
Analysts have praised Microsoft for its strong results, noting that the company's cloud services division has become a key driver of growth.
"Microsoft's cloud business is firing on all cylinders," said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities. "The company continues to be the gold standard in the cloud and remains in an enviable position of strength heading into the rest of 2021."
Despite the impressive results, Microsoft warned that the ongoing pandemic could impact its future earnings, citing "uncertainty related to COVID-19" as a risk factor.
"We expect the positive trends that have driven our growth to continue, but we also recognize that the world is still in the midst of a pandemic," said Hood. "We remain focused on the long-term and on driving value for all our stakeholders."
