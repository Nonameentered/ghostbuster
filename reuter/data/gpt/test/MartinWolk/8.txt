Egghead Inc. Closes 77 Stores in Restructuring Effort
Egghead Inc., an American computer software and hardware retailer, has announced the closure of 77 of its stores. The move is a part of the company's restructuring efforts to fortify its business in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company will continue to operate with 84 stores as part of its post-COVID strategy.
Egghead Inc. has been in business for more than 50 years and has witnessed various financial and operational changes over the last decade. The recent pandemic and its impact on the economy and consumer sentiment have influenced the company's decision to restructure its operations.
As a result, Egghead Inc.'s recent move to close down 77 underperforming stores will see a reduction of its workforce and balance sheet size. The company's management has emphasized that this move will enable Egghead Inc. to focus on its renovated plan to improve its consumer experience across its remaining stores.
The company plans to broaden its online presence and refocus its efforts on smaller stores with a rewarding consumer experience. These new-styled stores will have a broader product assortment, dedicated in-store technical support, and a customized approach based on the individual's preferences.
"Egghead Inc. has been facing significant headwinds from COVID-19 and the resulting economic downturn," said Kevin Hulse, Egghead Inc.'s CEO. "Though difficult, the decision to close underperforming stores is part of Egghead's broader strategy to better position the company for success in the years ahead."
The restructuring efforts will inevitably affect Egghead Inc.'s financial performance. Still, the company's management position the move as a long-term strategy to revamp the organization's profitability and competitiveness, said Hulse.
Additionally, the company plans to expand its product categories to smart home and consumer electronics, including personal computers and gaming devices, in line with consumer expectations.
"We believe that our new-styled stores, online presence, and broadening of our product assortment will better position Egghead Inc. in the current environment," concluded Hulse.
Egghead Inc.'s recent move has its pros and cons. On the one hand, the company will be able to decrease its expenses, including rent, salaries, and utilities. On the other hand, the company will lose a considerable number of customers who would have been served in the 77 closed stores.
The company is optimistic that its move will ultimately lead to an improvement in its balance sheet and competitive position while providing more value for the consumers. However, some analysts have cast doubts over the execution of the strategy.
The advisory firm, Morgan Stanley, notes that the closure of 77 stores has the potential to cost Egghead Inc. roughly 20% of its sales run rate, leading to a decrease in its top-line revenue.
Referring to the company's announcement on its plans to create smaller-sized-stores, Morgan Stanley stated, "While expanding product categories could help regain lost revenue and provide incremental value to consumers, it is not a guarantee that consumers will prioritize Egghead Inc. over its competitors."
The advisory firm further added that the short-term costs of executing the strategy may outstrip the gains, leading to more losses for the company. Though identifying the underperforming stores to be closed is beneficial, executing the larger organizational shift may require a longer duration than anticipated or face unexpected headwinds, such as in-store regulation amid the ongoing pandemic.
Egghead Inc. plans to begin its restructuring by shutting down its 77 stores and reassessing its new-styled stores' initial results. The company and other similar enterprises face major obstacles and uncertainties in the coming months. It remains to be seen whether Egghead Inc.'s restructuring efforts will indeed lead to increased profitability and success in the marketplace.
