Boeing Stock Surges After Decision to Halt Plans for Costly 747 Stretch Jet
Boeing Co’s shares surged on Monday after the company announced that it would abandon its plans to produce the 747 stretch jet after years of disappointing sales. The move will result in a $2.4 billion after-tax charge in the second quarter and signals a dramatic shift in strategy for the world's largest aerospace company.
Boeing had been working on the 747-8 Intercontinental, a stretch version of its iconic jumbo jet, which can carry up to 467 passengers and fly over 8,000 nautical miles. The 747-8 was introduced in 2011, but only 47 aircraft were sold, leaving the company with a backlog of just 14 orders.
The decision to abandon the 747 stretch jet came after Boeing conducted a review of its product line in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry. The review concluded that the market for very large aircraft such as the 747-8 was unlikely to recover from the pandemic and that the company should focus on smaller, more efficient planes.
Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in a statement, “The reality of the pandemic is changing the world around us, and it presents a challenge to our business that is unprecedented in size and scope. We’re taking action to preserve liquidity and adapt to the new reality of reduced demand for our products.”
Calhoun added that the company would continue to support the 747 fleet with parts, maintenance, and engineering services, and that the decision to abandon the 747 stretch jet would not affect the company’s plans to produce the 747-8 freighter version, which has been more successful.
Boeing’s shares rose 6% on Monday in reaction to the news, adding $7.76 to close at $143.10, their highest level since early March. The company’s stock has been hit hard in recent months by the fallout from the 737 Max crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have led to massive layoffs, reduced production rates, and declining demand for new planes.
Analysts said that the decision to halt production of the 747 stretch jet was a smart move for Boeing, given the weak demand for large aircraft and the company’s need to conserve cash.
Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said, “This is a smart, prudent move by Boeing. The 747 stretch was an expensive, unprofitable program that has been a drag on the company's finances for years. The fact that they’re finally pulling the plug on it is good news for investors and a sign that the company is taking decisive action to address its problems.”
However, some analysts cautioned that the decision to abandon the 747 stretch jet could have implications for the company’s relationship with its customers and suppliers.
Richard Aboulafia said, “Boeing’s decision to phase out the 747 stretch jet could cause some customers to rethink their loyalty to the company. The 747 has been a workhorse for many airlines for decades, and some may be reluctant to switch to other models offered by Boeing or Airbus.”
He added that the decision could also have a ripple effect on the company’s supply chain, which has already been disrupted by the pandemic-related shutdowns and reduced demand.
Boeing’s decision to halt production of the 747 stretch jet comes at a time when the company is already dealing with a host of other problems, including the ongoing fallout from the 737 Max crisis, which has grounded the plane for over a year, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to reduced demand and production rates.
The 747 stretch jet was seen as one of the company’s last chances to salvage the iconic jumbo jet, which revolutionized air travel when it was introduced in the 1960s but has since been surpassed by smaller, more efficient planes.
Boeing had initially hoped to sell hundreds of the 747-8. But the plane's high price tag, poor fuel efficiency, and competition from newer models offered by Airbus SE and others made it a tough sell in a market that is increasingly dominated by smaller, more efficient planes.
The company said that it would take a $2.4 billion after-tax charge in the second quarter related to the cancellation of the 747 stretch jet, including $1.9 billion in charges related to the aircraft's production costs and $500 million in charges related to the impairment of assets and inventory.
Going forward, Boeing said that it plans to focus on its core business of producing smaller, more efficient planes, including the 737 Max, 777X, and 787 Dreamliner, which it believes will be in high demand once the aviation industry recovers from the pandemic. 
Despite the challenges facing the company, Boeing remains committed to its long-term goals of generating sustained earnings growth, expanding its market share, and delivering value to its customers and shareholders.
In conclusion, Boeing’s decision to abandon the 747 stretch jet is a smart move for the company, given the weak demand for large aircraft and the need to conserve cash. While the decision may have implications for the company’s relationship with its customers and suppliers, it is ultimately a sign that the company is taking decisive action to address its problems and position itself for long-term success.
