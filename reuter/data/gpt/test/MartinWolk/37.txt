REDMOND, Washington - Microsoft Corp. is expected to report a 40% jump in earnings for the fiscal second quarter, thanks to the successful launch of its latest version of Office and strong growth in the company's core business. The software giant's earnings report, due on Thursday, is expected to show that its strategy of pivoting to a cloud-based model is paying off.
Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.09 a share on revenue of $36.9 billion, which would represent a 12% year-over-year increase in revenue. The strong performance is primarily being driven by growth in Microsoft's commercial cloud business, which includes Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics 365. The company is also benefiting from strong sales of the Surface line of tablets and laptops, as well as Xbox game consoles.
But it's the success of the latest version of Office, which was released in September, that is likely to be the standout performer in the earnings report. The new Office 2019 is designed to help users create and share content in a more intelligent, intuitive way, thanks to a range of new features and tools. Key enhancements include new data analysis features in Excel, improved inking in all Office apps, and new learning tools in Word.
Office remains the core of Microsoft's productivity offerings, with more than 1.2 billion users globally. The latest version of the suite is aimed at enterprise users who are looking for a more intelligent, secure, and collaborative way of working. The success of the Office upgrade means that Microsoft now has more subscribers to its commercial cloud services than rival Amazon's Web Services.
The company is also looking to capitalize on new trends in the software industry, such as the increasing use of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). It recently announced a range of initiatives that are designed to help businesses integrate these technologies into their operations. This includes the launch of a new AI and IoT lab in Munich, and a new blockchain service that will enable businesses to build and deploy blockchain-based solutions on Azure.
Despite the strong performance, however, there are still some areas of concern for Microsoft. The company's Windows business has been in decline for several years, as consumers shift away from traditional desktop and laptop PCs towards smartphones and tablets. Microsoft's latest earnings report is likely to show that this trend is continuing, with weak sales of Windows-powered devices.
Overall, though, Microsoft continues to ride a wave of strong growth, driven by its successful transition to a cloud-based model and the continued popularity of Office. The company's shares have risen by more than 25% over the past year, making it one of the best performing stocks in the technology sector. With a market capitalization of more than $840 billion, Microsoft is now one of the most valuable companies in the world.
