Weyerhaeuser Co., one of the world's largest timber companies, has reported a sharp decline in its earnings for the fourth quarter of 1996, as it faced great pressure from the pulp and paper price struggles. The company cited ongoing supply and demand imbalances, weak demand and low prices as primary drivers of its disappointing financial performance.
Weyerhaeuser announced that its earnings were $92 million or $0.51 per share, compared to $309 million or $1.70 per share for the same period the previous year. The company's revenue for the quarter was $3.23 billion, down from $3.44 billion the previous year. Industry analysts had previously estimated earnings of $0.63 per share on revenue of $3.44 billion, indicating that the results had come in below expectations.
"We faced significant challenges in the fourth quarter, with weak demand for pulp and paper products and pricing pressures across all of our businesses," said Steven R. Rogel, Weyerhaeuser's chairman, president and CEO. "Despite these headwinds, we remained committed to managing our operations efficiently, while also investing in our long-term growth. We will continue to focus on improving our cost structure and driving growth in our businesses in the coming quarters."
The company's pulp and paper business reported a loss of $16 million for the quarter, compared to earnings of $137 million for the same period the previous year. Weyerhaeuser attributed the decline to lower prices for pulp and paper products and higher production costs, including maintenance and downtime costs.
Weyerhaeuser's timberlands business posted earnings of $58 million for the quarter, compared to $79 million for the same period the previous year. The company said it had sold fewer acres of timberlands and timber volumes were lower than expected. The real estate business also reported lower earnings of $13 million, compared to $28 million in the fourth quarter of 1995.
Despite the challenging market conditions, Weyerhaeuser said it would continue to invest in its businesses to drive long-term growth. The company said it planned to spend $1.2 billion on capital investments in 1997, with a focus on expanding its pulp and paper operations and enhancing its timberlands management.
Additionally, Weyerhaeuser said it would continue to look for acquisition opportunities in the timber and forest products industries. In December 1996, the company had announced that it was acquiring Willamette Industries Inc., a leading producer of forest products, for $55.50 per share, or approximately $6 billion in cash and debt. The deal was expected to close in the second quarter of 1997.
Industry analysts remained cautious about Weyerhaeuser's prospects in the short term, given the ongoing challenges in the pulp and paper markets.
"We see a difficult environment for Weyerhaeuser and the rest of the paper and forest products sector for the next few quarters," said Bob O'Brien, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "Paper prices remain soft, and there continues to be an oversupply of pulp and paper products globally. However, we believe in Weyerhaeuser's long-term prospects, given its strong market position and focus on operational efficiency."
Weyerhaeuser, headquartered in Federal Way, Washington, is a Fortune 500 company and one of the world's largest private owners of timberlands, with over 13 million acres of commercial forestland in the United States and Canada. The company produces a wide range of forest products, including pulp and paper, lumber, and panels. Weyerhaeuser also has real estate and energy businesses, and employs approximately 30,000 people worldwide.
