Chicago-based aviation giant Boeing announced on Tuesday that it will be entering the airline maintenance business in a strategic diversification move. The company said that this new initiative will result in creating a separate global aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services unit that will provide maintenance services to airlines and other companies that operate fleets of planes.
In a statement, Boeing said that this new venture will help the company to become a more diversified aerospace company by offering additional services beyond just manufacturing airplanes. The move will help the company offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a severe decline in air travel, which in turn has decreased demand for new airplanes.
“The creation of a dedicated global services unit will enable us to provide greater value to our customers, and we believe this will be an important growth driver for our company over the long term,” said Boeing CEO David Calhoun.
In its announcement, Boeing said that the new unit will leverage its existing supply chain expertise, digital technologies, and global reach to offer its services to customers in the commercial and government sectors.
The new business unit will be led by lifelong Boeing employee and current Senior Vice President Stan Deal, who will assume his new role immediately. “We believe that this new venture will help us build on our current strengths and expertise in the aerospace industry while also providing a unique value proposition to our customers,” said Deal.
Boeing’s move into the MRO services market comes at a time when its airline customers are struggling to survive in the midst of a downturn in the global air travel industry. The MRO services market is estimated to be worth over $80 billion and is projected to grow steadily over the next several years, driven by the need for maintenance and repair services for aging aircraft.
According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global MRO services market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% from 2020 to 2027, reaching a value of $116.9 billion by the end of the forecast period.
Boeing has been under significant financial pressure due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry. The company has had to cut thousands of jobs and recently announced that it will be reducing its production of new planes in response to a drop in demand.
Despite these challenges, the company remains committed to investing in research and development activities, including its ongoing efforts to develop clean energy technologies for the aviation industry.
The announcement of the new MRO services unit is seen as evidence of the company’s continued commitment to innovation and diversification in the face of a challenging business environment.
