The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), the union representing Boeing engineers, has filed an unfair labour practices charge against the aircraft manufacturer. The charge is in relation to the merger of Boeing's training unit and a joint venture with a Brazilian company.
According to SPEEA, Boeing did not give the union proper notification or opportunity to bargain before merging its training unit with Embraer's training and services business. The union is accusing Boeing of violating the National Labor Relations Act by failing to negotiate with the union over the terms and conditions of employment of the affected engineers.
The merger, which was completed in November 2020, saw the creation of Boeing Embraer-Defense's Global Services & Support unit. The joint venture offers military aircraft services and products, including training and logistics.
However, SPEEA alleges that the merger has resulted in Boeing transferring work away from unionized employees to non-unionized workers. SPEEA is concerned that this move will result in job losses for unionized Boeing engineers.
In a statement, SPEEA Executive Director Ray Goforth said, "Boeing's decision to merge its training unit with Embraer's will harm our members' job security, working conditions, and wages. This decision shows clear disrespect for our collective bargaining agreement and ignores our legal right to negotiate working conditions."
Boeing has not yet released a statement in response to the charge but has previously stated that the merger is a necessary step to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
The union's filing of the unfair labour practices charge is just the latest in a string of disputes between Boeing and its employees. In recent years, the company has been accused of union-busting and unfair labour practices.
This latest dispute could lead to a lengthy legal battle between the union and Boeing, putting further strain on the already tumultuous relationship between the two parties. The outcome of the dispute could have far-reaching implications for Boeing and the wider aerospace industry.
