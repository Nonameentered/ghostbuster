The State of Texas has launched an antitrust probe into Microsoft's market dominance of internet software. Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the investigation on September 8, 2021, saying that the state is looking into whether the software giant has engaged in anticompetitive practices that harm Texas consumers.
The investigation will focus on Microsoft's web browsers and related technologies, such as search engines and advertising. Paxton said that Microsoft has often used its market power to limit competition in these areas, which has raised the cost of online advertising for businesses and made it harder for consumers to find alternative software products.
"Microsoft has a long history of using its monopoly power to stifle competition and harm consumers," Paxton said in a statement. "We will investigate whether Microsoft has engaged in anticompetitive practices to maintain its dominance in the market."
The announcement of the Texas investigation comes as Microsoft faces increased scrutiny from regulators around the world. The company is also facing antitrust lawsuits and investigations from the European Union, South Korea, and the United States.
Microsoft has faced antitrust investigations and lawsuits in the past, including a landmark case that lasted from 1998 to 2002. In that case, the US Department of Justice accused Microsoft of using its monopoly power to lock consumers into using its Internet Explorer web browser and other software products.
The Texas investigation is likely to focus on similar issues, such as whether Microsoft has made it difficult for consumers to use competing web browsers or search engines. The state may also investigate whether Microsoft has used its market power to unfairly promote its own advertising platform at the expense of competitors.
Microsoft has not yet responded to the Texas investigation, but the company has previously denied allegations of anticompetitive behavior. In a statement earlier this year, Microsoft said that it "embraces competition" and works to "ensure that our products and services are fair and effective."
The Texas investigation is just the latest example of the increased scrutiny that big tech companies are facing from regulators and lawmakers around the world. With concerns growing about the power of companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, it seems likely that these investigations and lawsuits will only continue in the coming years.
