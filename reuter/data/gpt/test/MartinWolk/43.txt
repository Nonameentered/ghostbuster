Redmond, Washington: Microsoft Corp. stunned the Wall Street by smashing their financial forecasts for the second quarter of 2021. The tech giant posted an 85% surge in earnings, which helped to lift its stock price by almost 10% in after-hours trading.
The company said that it earned a net income of $15.5 billion, or $2.03 cents per share, for the period ending June 30. That was up sharply from the $8.6 billion, or $1.14 cents per share, reported in the same period a year earlier.
Microsoft also exceeded expectations in terms of revenue, posting a 21% rise to $46.2 billion in the quarter, boosted by strong growth in its cloud computing, gaming and personal-computer businesses. Analysts had expected revenue of around $44.2 billion.
"We are seeing strong demand from customers for our cloud offerings, which is reflected in our strong financial results this quarter," said Satya Nadella, Microsoftâ€™s CEO.
The biggest growth driver for Microsoft during the quarter was Azure, its cloud computing platform, which saw revenue surge by 51% year-over-year. Other cloud services, such as Office 365 and Dynamics 365, also performed well, with both posting double-digit revenue growth.
Microsoft's gaming division, which includes the Xbox consoles and PC games, also had a stellar quarter, with revenue up 11% year-over-year. The company attributed the strong growth to the rollout of its new Xbox Series X and its successful gaming subscription service, Xbox Game Pass.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's personal-computer business, which includes the Surface tablets and laptops, saw revenue climb by 14% year-over-year. The company said that demand for these products was driven by the remote work and learning requirements brought on by the pandemic.
Analysts were thrilled with the company's impressive results and upbeat outlook. "This is a very good quarter for Microsoft, and the company continues to execute well across its various businesses," said Tom Forte, an equity analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.
Forte added that the company's strong showing was a reflection of Microsoft's robust and diversified business model. "They are well-positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities that lie ahead, in areas like cloud computing, gaming, and digital transformation," he said.
Microsoft's share price jumped by nearly 10% in after-hours trading, closing at $298.82. The company's market capitalization now stands at around $2.25 trillion.
The strong earnings report comes as Microsoft continues to face regulatory scrutiny from U.S. and international regulators. The company is being investigated for alleged antitrust violations and has also faced criticism over its privacy practices and its handling of workplace diversity issues.
Despite these challenges, Microsoft remains one of the world's most valuable and respected technology companies, with a dominant position in many key markets. The company's strong financial results in the second quarter of 2021 are a testament to its resilience and agility, and suggest that it will continue to be a major force in the tech industry for years to come.
