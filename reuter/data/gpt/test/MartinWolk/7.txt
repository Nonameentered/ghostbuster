Boeing, the leading aircraft manufacturer, has announced the formation of a new entrepreneurial organization called Boeing HorizonX, which will focus on the development of innovative technologies and pursue joint ventures and acquisitions in the commercial airplanes sector.
The new organization will be led by Steve Nordlund, a veteran Boeing executive with extensive experience in innovation and business development.
Boeing HorizonX is an integral part of Boeing's overall strategy to stay at the forefront of the aviation industry by investing in the development of new technologies and partnerships with innovative companies.
"We are committed to remaining the innovation leader in the aerospace industry," said Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg. "Creating Boeing HorizonX allows us to accelerate our progress in several areas, including advanced materials, manufacturing techniques, and data analytics."
Boeing HorizonX will focus on three main areas:
• Incubation of new ideas through internal and external collaboration
• Development of new products and services using Boeing's extensive expertise and resources
• Investment in companies that are developing disruptive technologies of strategic importance to Boeing.
In establishing Boeing HorizonX, the company has already made its first acquisition in the commercial airplane sector. It has acquired a California-based start-up called AirMap, which produces software that helps unmanned aircraft avoid obstacles and operate safely.
"AirMap is a leader in airspace management technology, and this acquisition will allow us to bring their expertise and capabilities into our broader aerospace ecosystem," said Greg Hyslop, Boeing's chief technology officer.
Boeing HorizonX expects to make additional investments and acquisitions in the coming months as it continues to pursue innovative ideas and strategic partnerships.
"This is an exciting time for Boeing and the aerospace industry as a whole," said Nordlund. "We are proud to be leading the charge in creating new pathways for innovation and growth."
The announcement of Boeing HorizonX comes at a time when the aviation industry is experiencing significant disruption and innovation, with the rise of autonomous aircraft, electric propulsion, and other new technologies.
Boeing, with its long-standing history of innovation and leadership in the aerospace industry, is well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities and shape the future of air travel.
"As we look to the future, we see immense potential for new technologies and partnerships that can enhance the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of air travel," said Muilenburg. "Boeing HorizonX is a key part of our strategy to remain at the forefront of this exciting industry."
