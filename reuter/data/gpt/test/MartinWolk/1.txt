Boeing Shares Soar After Decision to Cancel Costly 747 Stretch Jet Plans
Boeing shares soared Tuesday after the aviation giant announced it would be cancelling plans for a costly stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet, in favor of focusing on other aircraft, including the 777X and the 737 MAX. The decision comes after years of lackluster sales for the 747, with many airlines opting for smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft.
Boeing CEO David Calhoun said in a statement, "...weâ€™re making the tough but necessary decision to end production of the 747. While difficult, this is the right thing to do for our company and customers."
The decision was welcomed by investors, with shares in Boeing rising by as much as 6% in early trading, although the company's shares were down about 7% midday as the market took in mixed economic news.
The 747 was first launched in 1969 and was dubbed the "Queen of the Skies". It quickly became popular among airlines for its size and capacity, but demand has waned in recent years as airlines increasingly seek out more fuel-efficient options. The decision to cancel plans for the stretch version of the jet comes after Boeing had already cut production of the 747 to just one per month, down from six.
While the decision to cancel the 747 stretch jet plans was not entirely surprising, it does mark the end of an era for Boeing. The company will now focus on its more popular 777X and 737 MAX models, both of which have seen strong demand in recent years.
The 777X is a long-range, twin-engine plane that can seat up to 426 passengers, and is set to be one of the largest and most efficient aircraft in its class. It is due to enter service later this year, with orders already placed from airlines including Emirates and Qatar Airways.
Meanwhile, the 737 MAX is the latest version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle plane, with more than 5,000 orders placed to date. The plane was grounded in March 2019 following two fatal crashes, and only recently returned to service after a lengthy recertification process.
The cancellation of the 747 stretch jet plans is likely to have cost Boeing billions of dollars in development and production costs, but the company said it expects to recoup some of that through cost savings and other efficiencies.
The decision has also raised questions about the future of Boeing's iconic Seattle-area plant, which has been the main production site for the 747 for decades. The plant currently employs around 3,000 workers, and while the company has no plans to close the plant, it is likely to be restructured in the coming years.
The news of the cancellation came just weeks after Boeing reported another quarterly loss, further highlighting the challenges the company faces in the wake of the 737 MAX crisis. The company has been struggling to regain the trust of customers and regulators ever since the two crashes, which saw a total of 346 people killed. Boeing has since spent billions of dollars on safety upgrades, compensation payouts to victims' families, and other expenses.
Despite the challenges, Calhoun said he remains optimistic about Boeing's future. "The strength of our multi-year strategy, which includes a portfolio of greener and more efficient airplanes, is evident now more than ever," he said.
However, many analysts remain cautious about the company's prospects, particularly in light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which has caused a sharp downturn in air travel and forced many airlines to cancel or delay orders for new planes.
In the short-term, Boeing's decision to cancel plans for the 747 stretch jet may provide a much-needed boost for the company's bottom line. But in the long-term, the aviation industry will continue to face significant challenges, particularly around environmental concerns and sustainability. As such, Boeing will need to continue innovating and investing in new technologies if it is to remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry.
