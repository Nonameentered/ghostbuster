REDMOND, Washington: Microsoft Corporation's Expedia Internet Travel Service has piled up over $1 million in travel tickets sold in a week, the tech giant announced on Tuesday.
The travel industry has been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic, but with restrictions easing up, people are wandering again. The Microsoft travel division has seen an uptick in bookings and sales.
The company has been offering hotels, flights, cruises and activities for more than 25 years, and it has now come out on top with $1.2 million sold in one week. The travel service has been advertising the wide selection of travel options available, including destinations that were previously inaccessible, like Cuba.
President of Expedia Brand, John Morrey, said, "Last week was our most successful week of travel bookings in Expedia's history, with over $1 billion in gross bookings volume sold."
The travel service offers numerous deals so that travelers can utilize the best offer for their journey. Expedia has also been offering refunds and flexible itinerary changes amid the ongoing pandemic.
Expedia made a record $12.1 billion last year and has climbed to be the world's largest online travel agency (OTA) after the acquisition of Orbitz Worldwide.
People are keen to travel, and the pandemic has created an opportunity for the company to expand its market. Many have been stuck at home for over a year, making way for a surge in travel bookings.
Most purchased flight tickets have been domestic while vacation packages have seen an uptick too.
Though Expedia has not released the number of sales of its vacation packages, it said that customers from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom are the biggest buyers.
In January, Microsoft's Bing search engine launched a new feature showing flight data and trending destinations as people search for travel information. Bing users can check flight prices and see what it's like to travel to specific places depending on the COVID-19 restriction levels, helping them make more informed decisions.
As vaccination distribution accelerates, travel providers like Expedia are likely to see improvements in bookings. Microsoft's travel service is enjoying the surge in travel and creating new opportunities for itself.
