Media giant Walt Disney has agreed to acquire a one-third stake in Starwave Corp., a technology and content provider for media companies. The deal that is reportedly worth $200 million will see Disney acquiring the stake from Starwave’s current owner and founder, Paul Allen.
This comes as part of Disney’s strategy to expand its reach and diversify its offerings beyond its traditional areas of expertise. With the 33 percent stake in the Seattle-based Starwave, Disney will have the option to buy out the remaining shares in the company.
Starwave, which was founded in 1993 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, provides technology and content solutions to media entities such as ABCNews.com, the NBA, and ESPN.com. They are also known for creating the ESPN mobile app, which has become wildly popular.
Disney CEO Bob Chapek has indicated that the deal will not affect Starwave’s current employees and that they can expect “little, if any, change” in terms of their day-to-day operations. He stressed that the company’s focus is on acquiring Starwave’s technology and expertise, rather than making any sweeping changes.
“We’re excited about the talent, the capabilities, and the technology that they bring to the table, and the partnership is going to help us continue to build out our portfolio of products,” Chapek said in an online statement.
Starwave’s CEO, Patrick Naughton, shares Chapek's optimism and thinks that the partnership will benefit both companies. “We think we can help them build better products, and we think they can expose us to really large audiences through their various distribution channels,” Naughton said.
The acquisition underscores the importance of technology in the media landscape. As content consumption shifts towards digital platforms, media companies are looking to embrace technology to stay relevant and grow their audiences. Disney, which has been investing heavily in its streaming businesses, expects to leverage their partnership with Starwave to enhance its digital offerings.
“We believe that this investment in Starwave will help us expand our presence in the ever-evolving digital media landscape and help us tell our stories to an even wider audience,” Chapek said.
This latest acquisition is part of a larger push by Disney to grow its media empire. In 2019, they acquired 21st Century Fox for $71 billion, giving them control of properties such as The Simpsons, Avatar, and X-Men. Since then, Disney has continued to make strategic acquisitions to drive its growth.
The deal is set to close by the end of September, subject to regulatory approval. The full financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
