Microsoft Posts 85% Jump in Profits in Q3, Beating Analysts' Expectations
Microsoft Corp. posted an 85% jump in net income for the third quarter, beating analysts' expectations as the company's thriving cloud-computing business continued to drive growth.
The software giant reported a net income of $15.5 billion for the quarter, up from $8.4 billion during the same period last year. Revenue increased 19% to $41.7 billion, beating Wall Street's forecast of $41.03 billion.
The earnings beat was driven largely by the company's cloud business, which includes the Azure computing platform and the Office 365 productivity suite. Revenue in the intelligent cloud division, which includes Azure, rose 23% to $15.1 billion. Azure's revenue grew 50%, while server products and cloud services revenue increased 26%.
"The results were driven by another quarter of strong execution by the Microsoft team, as businesses of all sizes continued to rely on our technology to remain agile and resilient during the pandemic," said Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, in a statement.
The results show that Microsoft is benefiting from the accelerated shift to remote work and cloud computing during the Covid-19 pandemic. As more businesses and individuals rely on remote technology to stay connected, Microsoft's cloud services have become increasingly popular.
Despite the pandemic, Microsoft has been able to maintain its growth, thanks in part to the strong demand for its cloud services. In the third quarter, the company's commercial cloud revenue increased 33% to $17.7 billion.
Microsoft's personal computing division, which includes Windows, Surface, and gaming, also saw a boost. Revenue in the division rose 19% to $13 billion, driven by strong demand for Windows and Surface products and an increase in Xbox content and services revenue.
"We are innovating across the Microsoft Cloud to help our customers and partners advance their digital transformation journeys and pivoting our solutions to support the new reality of remote everything," said Amy Hood, Microsoft's CFO, in a statement.
The strong results come as Microsoft continues to invest heavily in its cloud business. Last year, the company announced plans to become carbon negative by 2030, and it has pledged to invest $1 billion in a new climate fund to reduce the company's carbon footprint.
In addition to its cloud business, Microsoft is also investing in new technologies and services. The company recently acquired Nuance Communications, a provider of artificial intelligence and speech recognition software, for $19.7 billion.
Despite the strong earnings, Microsoft's stock was down slightly in after-hours trading, as investors showed concerns about the company's future growth potential, particularly as the pandemic comes to an end.
"Microsoft's results were impressive, but future growth potential may be limited," said Dan Romanoff, an analyst at Morningstar, in a research note. "The company is facing tough competition from Amazon in the cloud business, and the pandemic-driven growth may not be sustainable as businesses return to normal operations."
However, many analysts remain optimistic about Microsoft's long-term prospects. The company's cloud business, in particular, is expected to continue to thrive as more businesses move their operations online.
"Microsoft's strong earnings show that the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for remote technology and cloud computing," said Michael Lippert, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, in a note to clients. "While future growth may not be as spectacular as the past year, we remain bullish on Microsoft's long-term prospects."
