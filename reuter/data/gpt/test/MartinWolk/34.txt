In a major announcement made by leading tech giants, Microsoft, Intel, and Compaq have proposed new standards for a next-gen Personal Computer-compatible (PC) television. These new standards are aimed at making personal computing and multimedia experience on TVs more seamless for the consumers. 
The three companies say that the new generation of PC-compatible televisions will be able to connect to computers, servers, and other devices and enable users to access a variety of computer applications and websites while sitting in front of their TV. This would eliminate the need for separate monitors for desktops and laptops, by providing users with an all-in-one multimedia entertainment center.
"Consumers today are using many different types of devices to access multimedia content or complete tasks like streaming games, browsing the web, or streaming movies. We believe that our initiative will provide a new standard for the convergence of these multiple devices into an all-in-one, easy-to-use multimedia center, the PC-compatible television," said a spokesperson for Compaq.
According to the proposal, Microsoft will provide the software platform for the new device, while Intel will equally contribute its chip technology, and Compaq its manufacturing expertise. The three companies believe that their combined expertise and technology will lead to a killer product that will change the way consumers experience multimedia content.
Some of the features that are expected to be included in the new PC-compatible televisions include the ability to connect to Wi-Fi or mobile networks, allowing users to stream their favorite content online. It will also come equipped with state-of-the-art audio and video technologies, making it possible to watch 4K movies and enjoy high-quality sound at the same time.
In addition, the new televisions will be equipped with a variety of USB and HDMI ports, making it easy to connect to multiple devices simultaneously. The proposal also highlighted that the TV will allow two-way communication between the set and other devices, allowing users to play games, send text messages, or even access their social media accounts without ever having to turn on their computer.
If successful, the new generation of PC-compatible televisions could revolutionize the entertainment and computing industry, as consumers look for greater convenience and ease of use. Microsoft, Intel, and Compaq are optimistic that the market is ready for such a product, and are confident of its success.
However, the new standards will need to overcome a few challenges, including the need to design a single unified platform that allows compatibility with different hardware and software configurations.
Overall, the introduction of PC-compatible televisions is set to be a game-changer for the tech industry. The optimized personal computing experience will now be available to wider audiences, with the possibility of having functionality over several devices. Microsoft, Intel, and Compaq will have their hopes on achieving greater success than their previous collaborations.
