Electronic Arts (EA) – the renowned American video game company – has announced its decision to concentrate on PC and CD-ROM platforms despite the immense success of Nintendo's cartridge-based machines, according to one of its top executives.
The announcement comes at a time when the gaming industry has been witnessing a massive shift towards console gaming, with many game developers shifting their focus to consoles, particularly the latest PlayStation and Xbox models. However, Electronic Arts, with its recent declaration, has broken the trend.
A key reason behind this decision is the lower cost of producing games for PC and CD-ROM platforms compared to consoles, which require exclusive high-tech hardware components to run. EA's games depend more on quality than visuals, and thus, do not require expensive hardware to run. Therefore, a PC or CD-ROM user can play games with ease on an array of devices, including laptops, desktops, and personal computers.
When asked about the strategy behind the decision, one of the top executives at EA stated that the company had analyzed the market trends and realized that there was still a significant demand for computer-based gaming.
"We recognize the success of Nintendo's cartridge-based machines, but we believe that there are still users who prefer games on the PC and CD-ROM platforms. In fact, we have seen an increase in demand for PC games in recent years due to the emphasis on ease of use and accessibility," said the executive.
Moreover, the cost of producing games is significantly lower when it comes to CD-ROMs and PC platforms, which can be critical for companies operating on smaller budgets. The decision to focus on this market will allow EA to expedite its game development process, better manage its resources, and offer competitive prices to consumers.
Furthermore, with the advent of mobile gaming, EA plans to tap into the market by developing mobile applications for Android and Apple devices. The company's mobile gaming division has grown significantly over the past few years, and the decision to focus on PC and CD-ROM platforms is a reflection of its prioritization of its mobile gaming division.
This decision has been met with mixed reactions from industry leaders. Some have praised EA's forward thinking, while others have criticized it as a step back in a market that is rapidly evolving towards mobile and console gaming.
However, several gaming enthusiasts believe that this decision could result in more innovations in the PC and CD-ROM platforms, ultimately leading to the growth and success of these platforms. Moreover, as the demand for traditional gaming platforms increases, there is a chance that consumers might shift back to the PC and CD-ROM platforms, signaling a comeback in what was once a thriving market.
As the gaming industry continues to evolve rapidly and embrace new technology trends, EA's decision to stick with PC and CD-ROM platforms could very well be a strategic move that will help it remain competitive, generate substantial revenues, and deliver quality games developed with user convenience and comfort in mind.
