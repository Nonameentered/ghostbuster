Redmond, Washington - Microsoft has announced the launch of Sidewalk, a new online venture that aims to provide local news and information to users across the United States.
In today's world, where the internet has become the primary source of information for most people, local news has taken a back seat. With the closure of many local newspapers and the decline of traditional media, there has been a gap in local coverage, which Sidewalk aims to fill.
So, what exactly is Sidewalk? According to Microsoft, it is a "digital platform that connects people to their cities and communities through local news, events, and activities, and provides them the tools to engage and interact with their neighborhoods."
The platform will cover a variety of topics, including news, lifestyle, food, events, and more. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to find what they're looking for.
"We believe that Sidewalk has the potential to be a game-changer in the local news industry," said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. "With its focus on community engagement and collaboration, we hope to create a platform that brings people together and helps them stay informed about their city and neighborhood."
Sidewalk will launch initially in six cities: Seattle, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington DC. These cities were chosen because they have a strong culture of community engagement and a diverse population.
Microsoft has partnered with local news organizations in each of these cities to provide content for the platform. The company has also created a team of journalists who will cover local stories and events, producing original content for the website.
"We are excited to partner with Microsoft on this important project," said Phil Lipof, President of NBC Owned Television Stations. "We believe that Sidewalk has the potential to be a valuable resource for local communities, and we are committed to providing high-quality content that will inform and engage our audience."
One of the unique features of Sidewalk is its focus on community participation. Users will have the option to create their own profiles, join groups, and post content related to their neighborhood. They can also submit events or stories to be featured on the website.
"We believe that local news is most effective when it is a dialogue between journalists and the community," said Microsoft's Sidewalk product manager, Mary Jo Foley. "We want to give people the tools to create and share their own stories, and to connect with others who care about their neighborhood."
While the platform is currently only available in six cities, Microsoft plans to expand to other areas in the future. The company has also hinted at incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning to personalize the platform for each user.
"We know that every city and every community is unique," said Foley. "Our goal is to create a platform that adapts to the needs of each user, and provides them with the information and tools they need to be an active member of their community."
The launch of Sidewalk comes at a time when local news is more important than ever. With the ongoing pandemic and social unrest, people are turning to local sources for information and support.
"We are proud to be launching Sidewalk at a time when local news is needed more than ever," said Nadella. "We believe that technology can be a force for good in the world, and we hope that Sidewalk will help to build stronger, more engaged communities across the United States."
