A new study has found that a drug designed to treat osteoporosis can reduce the risk of hip fractures in women with previous fractures by 51%. The drug, called romosozumab, could be a game-changer for the millions of women worldwide who suffer from osteoporosis, a disease that weakens bones and makes them more susceptible to fractures.
The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved more than 4,000 women with osteoporosis over the age of 50. Half of the women were given romosozumab for a year, followed by another osteoporosis drug called denosumab, while the other half were given just denosumab.
The results showed that the women who received romosozumab had a 51% lower risk of hip fractures than those who received only denosumab. The drug also reduced the risk of vertebral fractures by 73%.
"This drug has the potential to reduce the burden of fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high risk for fracture," said Dr. Carolyn Crandall, lead author of the study.
Osteoporosis affects an estimated 200 million women worldwide, and is particularly common in postmenopausal women. It can lead to painful fractures that can severely impact quality of life and increase the risk of death. Hip fractures, in particular, can be devastating for older women, often leading to loss of independence and an increased risk of nursing home admission.
Romosozumab is designed to work differently from other osteoporosis drugs, by stimulating the growth of new bone rather than just slowing down the breakdown of existing bone. This means that it may be more effective at preventing fractures than current treatments.
However, the drug does come with some risks. In the study, women who received romosozumab had a slightly higher risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, than those who received only denosumab. This suggests that the drug may need to be used with caution in women with heart disease or other cardiovascular risk factors.
Despite these risks, the study's authors believe that romosozumab could have a significant impact on the treatment of osteoporosis, particularly in women with previous fractures.
"This is a hugely important study that provides new hope for women with osteoporosis," said Dr. Alison Graham, a consultant rheumatologist at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. "Hip fractures are a major public health problem, and if this drug can reduce the risk of these fractures by 51%, that could mean a huge improvement in the quality of life for millions of women worldwide."
The drug is currently awaiting approval by regulatory authorities, but if it is approved, it could provide a much-needed new treatment option for women with osteoporosis, offering them hope for a future free of painful fractures and the loss of independence that can come with them.
