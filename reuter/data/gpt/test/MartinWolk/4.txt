Federal Way, Washington - Weyerhaeuser Co., one of the world's largest private owners of timberlands, has reported a steep decline in its fourth-quarter earnings, attributing the slump to the plummeting prices of pulp and paper products.
The company's net income for the last quarter, which ended in December, is estimated to be around USD 69 million or 9 cents per share. This is a significant decrease from its 2018 earnings of USD 255 million or 34 cents per share. Meanwhile, its revenue for the quarter fell by 11 percent to USD 1.56 billion.
The forestry giant has said that the issues in the pulp and paper industry were a significant cause of the decline. "Lower net sales realizations for our timberlands and higher costs in our cellulose fibres segment, which includes pulp and paper, negatively impacted our earnings," Weyerhaeuser President and CEO Devin Stockfish said.
Cellulose fibers are a key product of the pulp and paper industry, and Weyerhaeuser included them in its timberland portfolio in 2016 when it acquired Plum Creek Timber. The company had been experiencing a steady growth in the demand for its pulp and paper products for quite some time. But the lumber market is susceptible to periods of severe fluctuations, and the latest downturn in prices has taken a significant toll on their financials.
Overall, Weyerhaeuser's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for its cellulose fibers segment plunged more than half, to USD 55 million, down from USD 114 million in the previous year.
While the cellulose fibers unit struggled, the company's other two divisions, Timberlands and Wood Products, held their ground. The Timberlands segment saw a slight increase in its net sales realization per acre but witnessed a decline in the harvest volumes it reported.
Weyerhaeuser's Wood Products division had a mixed fourth quarter. The segment saw its earnings increase year-over-year, but the company warned that the next year could be a difficult one for the business. "While we are encouraged by the strong performance in our Wood Products segment, we remain cautious about challenging conditions in the markets we serve," Stockfish said.
Given that lumber prices are expected to remain weak in the near-term, the timberland owner has said that it is being cautious in its operations and is planning to defer some capital spending in the Near Term. Weyerhaeuser's CEO Stockfish added, "Our long-term focus remains unchanged, and we believe strongly in our business model and growth prospects."
Despite the troubled quarter, the company's shares showed little movement after the release of the earnings report, and its investors weren't caught off guard by the news as the consensus expectation for earnings-per-share (EPS) was already at 3 cents.
Weyerhaeuser Co. joins numerous other forestry companies experiencing similar challenges in the pulp and paper industry. The slowdown in China's economy and the continuing trade dispute with the US have resulted in reduced timber prices and demand for paper-based products. Experts are predicting that the cellulose fibers segment is likely to remain under pressure until the world demand for paper and paper products picks up again.
