Boeing, the leading aerospace company, has just reported its earnings for the first quarter of this year, which showed a doubling of profits from last year. However, the figures still fell short of Wall Street's expectations.
According to the data, the US-based company reported a profit of $1.7 billion in Q1 2021, up from $641 million in the same period last year. However, analysts had predicted a higher profit of $2.14 billion. Boeing's revenue also rose by 10% to $15.2 billion, but this also came up short of Wall Street estimates of $16.1 billion.
Despite beating expectations in terms of delivery numbers, as it delivered 77 commercial airplanes during the quarter, the profit figures were affected by the continued slowdown of production and deliveries of the 737 MAX. Boeing had suspended deliveries and production of the aircraft after two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019, which led to the grounding of the entire 737 MAX fleet.
In a statement, the CEO of Boeing, David Calhoun, acknowledged that the recent production cuts had an impact on their financial performance. Calhoun stated that despite the progress in resuming deliveries and production of the 737 MAX, the company was not able to meet the demand from its customers due to supply chain issues and the ongoing pandemic's impact on travel demand.
"We're not pleased with our financial performance, as we continue to be impacted by challenges in our commercial airplane markets due to COVID-19, as well as the 737 MAX," Calhoun said. "While the global pandemic continues to present a challenging operating environment, we view 2021 as a key inflection point for our business as we work to recover from the impacts of COVID-19 to emerge stronger, more resilient, and more sustainable for the long term."
The company's revenues were also impacted by the pandemic, which led to a significant reduction in air travel and fewer orders for new planes. Boeing's commercial airplane revenue fell by 31% to $4.3 billion, while its defense and services revenue increased by 19% to $11 billion.
Despite the challenges, Calhoun said the company remained optimistic about its future, citing significant progress in resuming delivery of the 737 MAX and increasing demand for air travel as COVID-19 vaccines roll out.
"We remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, including safely returning the 737 MAX to service and driving innovation across our portfolio of products and services," Calhoun said.
"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a historic test for our industry, and we continue to adapt and respond to its impacts on our customers, employees, and the communities where we operate."
Boeing's shares fell by 2% in the premarket trading after the earnings were announced, reflecting the disappointment among investors who had hoped for better results. Nonetheless, some analysts were optimistic about the future, saying the company's focus on innovation and strong balance sheet would help it weather the pandemic's impact on air travel.
"Overall, we believe Boeing's diversified business model and solid balance sheet place it well for the eventual recovery in commercial aerospace," said Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen. "Boeing is a strong company, and once things start to recover, its shares could soar."
In conclusion, Boeing's Q1 2021 earnings report showed a doubling of profits but fell short of Wall Street expectations. The continued slowdown of production and deliveries of the 737 MAX, as well as the pandemic's impact on air travel, were cited as the reasons for the lower-than-expected numbers. However, the company remained optimistic about its future and its ability to emerge stronger and more sustainable in the long term.
