Unionized Workers Sue Albertson's for Overtime Claims, Seeking Millions in Back Wages
A group of unionized workers from Albertson's, one of the largest grocery store chains in the United States, has sued the company for unpaid overtime wages. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, seeks millions of dollars in back wages for thousands of workers.
The lawsuit alleges that Albertson's, which operates over 2,000 stores under various banners including Safeway, Vons, Jewel-Osco, and Albertsons, violated federal and state labor laws by failing to pay workers overtime wages for all hours worked over 40 hours a week. The complainants claimed that the company intentionally misclassified many workers as exempt from overtime pay, which resulted in huge losses for the employees.
Moreover, the workers said that Albertson's implemented a policy of automatically deducting 30 minutes from their timecards every day, regardless of whether or not they took a lunch break. This policy, according to the lawsuit, resulted in the workers being shorted for thousands of hours of work over the years.
The plaintiffs, represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union, are seeking to recover unpaid overtime wages, liquidated damages, and other benefits totaling millions of dollars. The lawsuit is seeking class-action status, which means that other eligible employees may join the lawsuit and share in any potential recovery.
"Albertson's has consistently flouted the law by denying its workers fair wages and overtime pay, which has resulted in significant financial harm for the employees," said Marc Perrone, president of UFCW International. "We are confident that this lawsuit will hold Albertson's accountable for its illegal conduct and provide much-needed relief for the workers."
The lawsuit comes amid a nationwide debate over raising the federal minimum wage and ensuring fair wages for all workers, especially those in essential industries who have risked their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. The complainants said that the lawsuit is not just about obtaining justice for themselves, but also about fighting for better pay and working conditions for all workers.
"We are proud of our work and commitment to serving our communities during this pandemic, but we should not have to sacrifice our rights and livelihoods to do so," said Denise Taylor, a deli clerk at Albertsons in Arizona and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. "We deserve to be paid for every hour we work and to be treated with respect and dignity."
Albertson's has not yet responded to the lawsuit. However, the company has faced similar allegations in the past, with other workers suing the company for unpaid overtime and off-the-clock work. The company has also been criticized by labor advocates for opposing unionization efforts and cutting health benefits for employees.
