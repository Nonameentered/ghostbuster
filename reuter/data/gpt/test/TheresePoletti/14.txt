New York State Attorney General Letitia James has announced her plans to file a lawsuit against America Online (AOL) over allegations of deceptive practices and numerous consumer complaints. According to James, the lawsuit will take aim at AOL's tactics for signing up customers for its Internet services, including "hidden fees" and false promises of "free trials."
In a statement, Attorney General James said, "For years, AOL has used deceptive practices to entice consumers into signing up for its Internet services, only to hit them with hidden fees and other surprises. This is unacceptable, and we will not tolerate companies taking advantage of hardworking New Yorkers."
James' office has received more than 100 complaints from consumers who say they were tricked into signing up for AOL's services, only to be hit with unexpected charges and difficulty canceling their subscriptions.
The lawsuit, which will seek restitution for consumers and a court order to stop AOL from engaging in such practices, has been in the works for several months. James has been investigating AOL since last year, and her office has been in talks with the company to resolve the issue out of court.
However, those discussions have apparently broken down, leading James to move forward with the lawsuit. A spokesperson for AOL declined to comment on the matter.
The lawsuit comes as AOL is facing increased scrutiny over its business practices. Earlier this year, the company settled a lawsuit with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over allegations that it had billed customers for services they didn't want or didn't know were being offered, and made it difficult for them to cancel those services.
The settlement required AOL to pay $3.5 million in refunds to affected customers, as well as implement a number of changes to its billing and cancellation policies.
However, the New York State lawsuit is focused on different allegations, and could result in additional penalties for AOL if it is found to have engaged in deceptive practices.
Consumer advocates have praised Attorney General James for taking action against AOL. "It's about time that someone stood up for consumers and took on AOL," said John Simpson, a spokesman for the Consumer Watchdog group. "For too long, AOL has been able to get away with deceptive practices that make it hard for people to cancel their subscriptions and protect their privacy."
In addition to the lawsuit, James has also urged consumers to be vigilant when signing up for Internet services, and to carefully review the terms and conditions of any offers before agreeing to them.
"Consumers have the right to know what they're getting into before they hand over their hard-earned money," James said. "We will continue to protect consumers from companies that engage in deceptive practices and take advantage of their trust."
The lawsuit against AOL is just the latest in a series of actions taken by James and her office to protect consumers from fraud and other forms of abuse. Earlier this year, she launched an investigation into the use of fake online reviews by businesses, and has also targeted payday lenders, debt collectors, and other industries for alleged misconduct.
Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, James remains committed to fighting for consumer rights and holding corporations accountable. "We will not let our guard down," she said. "We will continue to stand up for what is right, and ensure that all New Yorkers are treated fairly and with respect."
As the lawsuit against AOL moves forward, consumer advocates say they will be watching closely to see if the case sets a precedent for other companies that engage in deceptive practices. "This is a clear message that companies can't get away with this kind of behavior," said Simpson. "We hope that other businesses will take notice and change their ways."
