Leading tech companies have come together to form a coalition aimed at establishing industry-wide standards for network computing. The group is composed of giants in the technology sector, such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Oracle, and was formed to counter the dominance of Microsoft.
The group intends to create an open architecture for network computing which they say will promote innovation and increase competition. Currently, network computing is a fragmented area with no consistent standards, limiting interoperability between different systems. The lack of alignment creates issues for customers who find themselves locked in to a particular vendor's products and solutions.
The coalition, called the Network Computing Initiative (NCI), plans to create an open architecture which will standardize interfaces and APIs - Application Programming Interfaces - for network computing. The aim is to get different network computing technologies to work seamlessly together, promoting competition and interoperability.
"The initiative will provide customers with a greater choice of vendors and the ability to mix and match solutions," said an HP spokesperson. "The standard interface will also provide ease of integration and thereby reduce integration costs."
The NCI intends to create open interfaces that will work across different hardware and software platforms, allowing vendors to easily create new applications and network computing products that can work across a broad range of operating systems.
"The initiative is about open standards and market choice," said Scott McNealy, Chairman of Sun Microsystems. "We have set out to prevent Microsoft from dictating the direction of computing." 
While the NCI is not the first attempt at developing network computing standards, the group's members make it one of the most significant. With such large players collaborating towards the development of open standards, there is a good chance that the effort will gain traction and adoption.
The NCI hopes that manufacturers of network computing products will begin to adopt their standards in the coming months, leading to a more open and fair technology landscape. The technology industry remains optimistic about the success of this effort against Microsoft's dominance.
