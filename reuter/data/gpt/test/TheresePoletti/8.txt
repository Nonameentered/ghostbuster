IBM Reports 4Q Earnings Slightly Better Than Expected
IBM has reported earnings for its fourth quarter, and they are slightly better than what analysts anticipated. Despite a 6% decline in revenue, the tech giant's earnings per share were up by 4%, thanks to cost-cutting measures and increased focus on higher-margin businesses like cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
The company reported earnings per share of $2.07, compared to the $1.81 estimate from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Revenue for the quarter came in at $20.4 billion, which was slightly below the $20.67 billion expected by Wall Street.
However, IBM's strategic shift toward higher-margin businesses appears to be paying off. Its cloud and cognitive software segment, which includes Red Hat, posted revenue of $6.8 billion, up 9% from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, its global business services unit, which includes consulting and outsourcing services, saw revenue increase 2% to $4.2 billion.
"Our performance reflects the progress we have made to transform our business model to higher value," said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, in a statement. "We are executing a focused and disciplined strategy, taking significant actions to simplify and streamline our operations, and prioritizing investments in our highest growth opportunities."
Krishna took over as CEO in April 2020, and has been focused on shifting IBM's focus from low-margin hardware businesses and legacy services to cutting-edge technologies like cloud computing and AI. As part of this strategy, IBM acquired Red Hat in 2019 for $34 billion, the company's biggest acquisition to date.
The pandemic has brought both opportunities and challenges for IBM. On the one hand, the shift to remote work has accelerated demand for cloud infrastructure and software to support remote collaboration. On the other hand, many of IBM's clients in industries like aviation, hospitality, and retail have been hit hard by the pandemic, reducing their spending on technology services.
To weather the pandemic's impact, IBM has taken steps to cut costs, including layoffs and a spinoff of its managed infrastructure services business. The company has also been investing in key growth areas like hybrid cloud and AI.
Looking to the future, IBM expects to continue its focus on high-margin businesses, while also targeting growth opportunities in areas like blockchain and 5G. In October, the company announced plans to spin off its managed infrastructure services unit into a separate public company, in order to focus on higher-growth areas.
Overall, IBM's Q4 earnings suggest that the company's strategic shift is beginning to pay off. While revenue is still declining, the focus on higher-margin businesses like cloud and AI is boosting earnings and positioning the company for long-term growth.
"We have positioned ourselves for long-term growth and we are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong cash flow while investing in key growth areas for the future," said James Kavanaugh, IBM's chief financial officer, in a statement.
