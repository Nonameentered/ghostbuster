CompuServe, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) owned by Verizon, has set its sights on rival ISP AOL with a Super Bowl ad and print campaign to promote its services. The move is part of a wider strategy to boost subscriber numbers and take a larger share of the US ISP market.
The Super Bowl ad aired during the first quarter of the game and featured a humorous take on a hypothetical scenario where a group of coworkers are discussing their internet service providers. The ad highlights the shortcomings of AOL, such as slow speeds and outdated technology, before promoting CompuServe as the superior choice.
The print campaign takes a similar approach, with ads appearing in major newspapers across the country. The advertisements focus on the reliability and speed of CompuServe's internet service, and highlight the benefits of being a subscriber.
The move to target AOL specifically is significant, as both companies have a long history in the ISP market and have frequently competed for customers. However, in recent years, AOL has taken a back seat to other ISPs such as Comcast and AT&T, while CompuServe has struggled to gain market share.
The campaign is part of a wider effort by Verizon to revitalize CompuServe and increase its subscriber base. The company has invested heavily in upgrading its infrastructure and improving its services, which it hopes will attract new customers and retain existing ones.
"We believe that CompuServe offers the best internet service in the market," said Verizon's VP of Marketing, John Stevens. "It's fast, reliable, and provides a range of great features. We want to make sure that more people know about it and choose to subscribe."
The Super Bowl ad was widely viewed by the game's estimated 100 million viewers, and generated a significant buzz on social media. The print campaign is also expected to reach a wide audience, with ads appearing in major daily newspapers such as the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Chicago Tribune.
Reactions to the campaign have been mixed, with some praising the humor and effectiveness of the ads, while others question the wisdom of spending millions of dollars on a single Super Bowl spot. However, Verizon remains confident that the investments will pay off in the long run.
"We understand that some people may be skeptical of a print and television campaign in the age of social media," said Stevens. "But we believe that these traditional channels still have a lot of value and can help us reach a wide audience. We're committed to doing whatever it takes to make CompuServe a success."
The ISP market in the US is highly competitive, with a number of large players vying for customers. However, Verizon believes that CompuServe has a unique value proposition that sets it apart from the competition.
"Our focus is on providing the best possible internet service to our customers," said Stevens. "We're constantly looking for ways to improve our offerings, whether that's through faster speeds, more reliable connectivity, or better customer support. We believe that this commitment to quality will help us stand out in a crowded market."
The success of the Super Bowl ad and print campaign remains to be seen, but Verizon is hopeful that it will help drive growth for CompuServe in the coming months and years. With the competition showing no signs of slowing down, it will be crucial for the company to continue innovating and adapting to changing customer needs in order to stay relevant and competitive.
