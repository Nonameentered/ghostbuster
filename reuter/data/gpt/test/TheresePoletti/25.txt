America Online Inc. (AOL) saw its stock fall on Wednesday after posting a larger than expected Q2 loss and experiencing multiple analyst downgrades. The internet giant, which is now owned by Verizon Communications, reported a loss of $656 million, or $7.46 per share, compared to a profit of $1.06 billion, or $12.02 per share, a year ago. AOL's revenue for the quarter also fell by 4% to $531 million, while advertising revenue fell by 4%.
Analysts have attributed the loss to a decline in the company's advertising business, which accounts for a significant portion of AOL's revenue. With fewer advertisers choosing AOL, its ad revenue is falling behind competitors like Google and Facebook. To make matters worse, the company has also experienced a decline in its search and local properties.
AOL's disappointing performance has prompted several analyst downgrades, with at least three firms lowering their ratings on the stock. These downgrades further contributed to the company's sinking stock price, which was down by more than 20% at one point during trading on Wednesday.
AOL has attempted to diversify its business in recent years by investing in content creation and digital advertising platforms. The company's acquisition of The Huffington Post in 2011 was aimed at expanding its news and media offerings, and AOL has also launched multiple advertising platforms, including ONE by AOL and Aol Platforms.
Despite these efforts, AOL's core business remains its email and internet services, which have been largely overshadowed by newer platforms and mobile devices. In addition, the company's reliance on advertising revenue has made it vulnerable to the sudden shifts in the digital advertising market.
The decline in AOL's stock price is a major blow for Verizon, which acquired AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015. Verizon has been hinging on AOL's success to help boost its own digital advertising business. However, the acquisition has yet to deliver substantial gains for the telecommunications giant, and the recent loss has further dimmed its hopes.
As AOL continues to struggle, analysts are divided on the future prospects for the company and its parent, Verizon. Some analysts remain optimistic about Verizon's ability to leverage AOL's assets and capabilities in the digital advertising market. Others, however, are less bullish on AOL's prospects and remain skeptical about Verizon's foray into digital advertising.
For now, it appears that AOL will need to take drastic measures to stem its losses and stay competitive in the rapidly changing digital landscape. The company will need to find new ways to monetize its services and diversify its revenue streams if it hopes to regain investor confidence and turn its fortunes around.
