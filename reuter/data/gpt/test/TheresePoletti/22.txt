America Online (AOL) will refund and credit frustrated customers as part of a settlement reached with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The settlement came after the FTC accused AOL of failing to adequately disclose its cancellation policy and making it difficult for customers to cancel their subscriptions.
"This settlement holds AOL accountable for its unfair billing practices and will put money back in the pockets of affected consumers," said Edith Ramirez, FTC Chairwoman.
Under the settlement, AOL will pay $5 million in refunds to customers who were billed without their permission or were not properly notified of cancellations. In addition, AOL will provide $93 million in credits to customers who were charged early termination fees between 2004 and 2009.
The settlement also requires AOL to change its billing practices and make it easier for customers to cancel their subscriptions. AOL must clearly disclose to customers when their free trial subscriptions end and must obtain customers' consent before billing them for any additional services.
The settlement is a significant win for consumers who have long complained about AOL's billing practices. Many customers reported being billed for services they did not knowingly sign up for and finding it difficult to cancel their subscriptions.
"I tried to cancel my AOL subscription several times, but they just kept billing me," said John Smith, a former AOL customer. "It was really frustrating and I'm glad to see that they're finally being held accountable."
The settlement also comes as AOL is facing declining revenues and increased competition in the online media market. The company has struggled to adapt to changes in the industry and has seen its subscriber base shrink in recent years.
"This settlement is a wake-up call for AOL to improve its customer service and billing practices," said Ramirez. "It's also a reminder to other companies in this space that they must treat their customers fairly and honestly."
In response to the settlement, AOL issued a statement apologizing to its customers and pledging to improve its billing practices.
"We take our customers' trust seriously and we apologize to those who were affected by our billing practices," said Tim Armstrong, CEO of AOL. "We are committed to making it right and we will continue to work to improve our customer service and billing processes."
The settlement with AOL is the latest in a series of actions by the FTC to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive business practices. Last year, the FTC reached a settlement with Apple over in-app purchases made by children without parental consent.
As consumers continue to rely on online services for their daily needs, it is important for companies to be transparent and honest in their billing practices. The AOL settlement is a reminder that companies that fail to do so will face consequences.
"This settlement sends a clear message that businesses cannot deceive consumers and must provide them with accurate information about their services and fees," said Ramirez. "We will continue to hold companies accountable for their actions and protect consumers from harm."
