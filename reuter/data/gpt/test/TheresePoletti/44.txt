IBM Global Services, the subsidiary of technology giant IBM, has become a separate group with plans to hire thousands of new employees. The move comes as IBM seeks to expand its footprint in the fast-growing field of cloud computing.
The newly independent IBM Global Services will focus on providing cloud-based technology services to businesses around the world. IBM has already established itself as a leader in the cloud computing market, and its latest move is aimed at further strengthening its position.
IBM Global Services is expected to hire thousands of new employees over the coming years. Most of the new hires will be based in the United States, where IBM has a large presence. The company is also expected to expand its operations in other parts of the world, including Europe and Asia.
The move to spin off IBM Global Services into a separate group was welcomed by industry experts, who see it as a smart move by IBM. The company's cloud computing business has been growing rapidly in recent years, and establishing IBM Global Services as a separate entity will allow the company to focus more on this core business.
According to IBM, the move will also help the company to better serve its customers. By separating IBM Global Services from its other businesses, IBM can dedicate more resources to providing cloud-based technology services, which are in high demand among businesses.
"IBM Global Services is critical to IBM's success in the cloud computing market," said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna in a statement. "By establishing it as a separate group, we are signaling our commitment to this important business and our willingness to invest in its future."
The move comes as IBM faces increasing competition in the cloud computing market from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. These companies have been investing heavily in cloud-based technology services, and IBM is trying to keep up.
In recent years, IBM has been expanding its cloud computing business through a series of strategic acquisitions. Last year, the company acquired Red Hat, a leading provider of open-source software solutions. The acquisition gave IBM access to a large developer community and expanded its portfolio of cloud-based software solutions.
With the spin-off of IBM Global Services, IBM is doubling down on its commitment to the cloud computing market. The company is betting that the demand for cloud-based technology services will continue to grow, and it wants to be at the forefront of this trend.
The decision to hire thousands of new employees is a clear sign that IBM is bullish on the future of cloud computing. The company is expecting to see strong demand for its services in the coming years, and it is gearing up to meet this demand.
For job seekers, the news that IBM Global Services is hiring thousands of new employees is welcome news. IBM is known for providing its employees with excellent benefits and opportunities for career advancement. The company has a strong reputation for investing in its employees and providing them with the training and resources they need to succeed.
Overall, the move to spin off IBM Global Services into a separate group is a smart move by IBM. It will allow the company to focus more on its core business of providing cloud-based technology services, while also providing opportunities for job growth and career advancement. With the demand for cloud-based services continuing to grow, IBM is well positioned to capture a significant share of this market and establish itself as a leader in the field.
