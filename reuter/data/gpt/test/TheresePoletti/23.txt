In a move to avoid potential litigation in several states, America Online (AOL) has agreed to issue refunds and credit to frustrated customers and halt its advertising efforts. The company has been under fire for a while now due to its billing and customer service practices.
The news was announced on Monday, and it comes just a few weeks after several state attorneys general threatened to sue the company over alleged deceptive and unfair billing. The attorneys general of New York, Connecticut, and Florida accused AOL of violating consumer protection laws by signing people up for services they didn't want, and billing them for services they never received.
The attorneys general also alleged that AOL made it difficult for customers to cancel their subscriptions and imposed cancellation fees that were not adequately disclosed.
Under the terms of the settlement, AOL will have to pay $3 million in refunds and credits to customers who were unfairly billed and subjected to cancellation fees. The company will also have to change its billing and cancellation procedures to make it easier for customers to cancel their subscriptions.
"AOL has agreed to significant changes to its business practices that will help protect consumers from unfair billing practices," said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.
In addition to the refunds, AOL has agreed to stop advertising its services in ways that could mislead consumers. This includes using deceptive pop-up ads that make it difficult to cancel subscriptions, and promotional offers that are not clear about the terms and conditions.
"AOL has agreed to eliminate the use of misleading advertising, improve its disclosure practices, and strengthen its customer service policies to make it easier for consumers to cancel their subscriptions," said Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen.
The settlement is just the latest setback for AOL, which has been struggling to compete with other internet service providers in recent years. The company has been losing subscribers and revenue as people switch to faster, more reliable broadband services.
But while AOL's business may be suffering, its legal troubles are far from over. The company is currently facing a class-action lawsuit over its billing practices, which could cost the company millions of dollars in damages.
The lawsuit accuses AOL of charging customers for services they didn't want, and then making it difficult for them to cancel those services. The plaintiffs also allege that AOL imposed cancellation fees that were not disclosed in advance, and refused to issue refunds to customers who were unfairly billed.
"AOL's billing practices are deceptive, unfair, and unlawful," said the lead plaintiff in the case, a customer from Florida. "We are seeking restitution for all the customers who were unfairly billed by AOL, and we hope that this lawsuit will send a message to other companies that they can't get away with this kind of behavior."
AOL has denied the allegations in the lawsuit, and has vowed to fight the case in court. The company argues that its billing practices are perfectly legal, and that it has always been transparent about its fees and charges.
"We believe that our billing practices are fair and transparent, and that our customers are aware of the charges they are paying for," said an AOL spokesperson. "We will defend ourselves vigorously against these baseless allegations."
Despite its legal troubles, AOL remains one of the largest internet service providers in the United States, with millions of subscribers across the country. The company is currently owned by Verizon Communications, which acquired it in 2015 for $4.4 billion.
Verizon has yet to comment on the settlement with the attorneys general, but industry experts say that the company is likely to support AOL's efforts to improve its billing and customer service practices.
"This settlement is a step in the right direction for AOL, but the company still has a lot of work to do to regain the trust of its customers," said David Morken, CEO of Bandwidth, a provider of internet-based communication services. "Verizon will be keeping a close eye on AOL's progress, and will likely be insisting on further changes if the company doesn't pick up the pace."
