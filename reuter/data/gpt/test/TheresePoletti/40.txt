Former NBC Executive Brandon Tartikoff Named Chairman of America Online's Greenhouse Networks; Company Buys LightSpeed Media to Develop Interactive Entertainment Network
America Online has announced major changes in its executive team and in its operations, as it seeks to strengthen its position in the highly competitive world of digital media. The company has named Brandon Tartikoff as the new Chairman of its Greenhouse Networks division, and has purchased LightSpeed Media, a developer of interactive entertainment networks.
Tartikoff is a well-known figure in the television industry, having served as President of Entertainment at NBC from 1981 to 1991, and as Chairman of Paramount Pictures from 1991 to 1992. He is widely credited with creating some of the most successful TV shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, such as "Cheers," "The Cosby Show," "Hill Street Blues," and "Miami Vice." He is also known for his innovative approach to programming and scheduling, which helped NBC become the number one network in the United States during his tenure.
In his new role at Greenhouse Networks, Tartikoff will be responsible for overseeing the development of new digital media properties and for building strategic partnerships with other media companies. Greenhouse Networks is a division of AOL that is focused on developing and incubating new digital media businesses, including websites, apps, and interactive experiences. The division's goal is to help entrepreneurs and startups bring their ideas to market, and to help established companies expand their digital offerings.
"The opportunity to work with the talented team at Greenhouse Networks and to help shape the future of digital media is an exciting challenge," Tartikoff said in a statement. "I look forward to working with the team to identify emerging trends, develop new products and services, and build strategic relationships that will help Greenhouse Networks continue to grow and succeed."
In addition to Tartikoff's appointment, America Online has also acquired LightSpeed Media, a company that specializes in creating interactive entertainment networks. The acquisition gives AOL access to LightSpeed's expertise in developing immersive and engaging experiences for audiences, as well as its network of partners and clients.
"The integration of LightSpeed's technology and talent into AOL's portfolio will enable us to provide cutting-edge interactive entertainment experiences to our users and audiences," said Craig Bowman, CEO of Greenhouse Networks. "This acquisition is an important step in our strategy to build a world-class digital media company that can meet the demands of today's consumers."
The digital media landscape is highly competitive, with giants such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon dominating the market. America Online's move to acquire LightSpeed Media and bring in someone with Tartikoff's experience and expertise is an indication that the company is serious about expanding its digital offerings and staying ahead of the curve. With the help of its new Chairman and its newly acquired assets, AOL is poised to take on the competition and emerge as a major player in the world of digital media.
