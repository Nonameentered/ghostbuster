IBM unveiled its latest mainframe family, which is said to be twice as fast as its previous models, at the launch event in New York City, on Tuesday. The new mainframe family uses cutting-edge technology to improve performance, security, and reliability.
IBM's mainframes have been the backbone of large organizations for decades. The new family of mainframes, called the z15, is designed to handle the massive amounts of data generated by modern businesses. The z15 mainframe has been designed to provide mainframe clients with an on-premise cloud-like experience where the customers can process workloads using cloud services.
Arvind Krishna, Senior Vice President of IBM's cloud and cognitive software division, said that the new mainframe family is designed to handle the onslaught of data that businesses have to deal with today. "The platform we have built is designed to process massive amounts of data at lightning speeds, which will help our customers make better business decisions," Krishna said.
The z15 hardware is based on IBM's z14 and is designed for faster processing and improved security. The hardware features a 19 inch frame and comes in several models that customers can choose from depending on their needs. According to IBM, the new mainframe family is capable of processing 2.4 billion transactions per day in a fully encrypted environment.
One of the key features of the z15 mainframe family is its ability to extend the hybrid cloud. IBM has developed a new software solution that allows the z15 to connect to the cloud and process data from other cloud services. This means that customers can choose to use the mainframe's processing power to run cloud applications, or run the applications on their own cloud services while using the mainframe's data processing capabilities.
In addition to the improved processing and security features, IBM has also focused on improving the reliability of the z15 mainframe family. The mainframe uses several technologies to ensure that the system is always available, including hardware redundancy and automated failover capabilities. The new mainframe family also includes a feature that allows clients to monitor and troubleshoot issues remotely.
IBM has been working on the z15 mainframe family for several years and has invested over $1 billion in research and development. The company has also worked closely with its clients and partners during the development process to ensure that the new hardware meets the needs of the modern business.
Several large organizations have already announced their support for the new mainframe family. For example, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance is planning to use the z15 mainframe family to process tax returns. The department expects the new hardware to help them process returns more quickly and efficiently, which will lead to faster refunds for taxpayers.
IBM's mainframe business has been on the decline in recent years, as many businesses have shifted to cloud computing and other technologies. However, the company has been investing heavily in its mainframe business to stay relevant in a changing market.
The z15 mainframe family is expected to help IBM retain its position as the leader in the mainframe market. The market for mainframes is estimated to be worth around $4 billion annually, and IBM holds a 90% share of the market.
In conclusion, the z15 mainframe family is a significant step forward for IBM's mainframe business. The hardware offers improved processing, security, and reliability, and is designed to handle the massive amounts of data generated by modern businesses. The ability to extend the hybrid cloud is a game-changer for customers who need to process data from multiple sources, and the improved reliability features mean that the system is always available. IBM's investment in research and development has paid off, and the z15 mainframe family is a testament to the company's commitment to staying at the forefront of mainframe technology. The future looks bright for IBM's mainframe business, and the z15 mainframe family is sure to play a central role in its success.
