International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) reported slow revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 on Thursday, disappointing investors who had been hoping for significant growth as the technology company works to transform its business model. The company's revenue came in at $20.4 billion for the quarter, which was slightly lower than the same quarter in the previous year, and missed analysts' estimates of $20.7 billion.
IBM's shares dropped by about 8% in after-hours trading on Thursday, signalling that investors were displeased with the company's performance. The company's chief executive officer, Arvind Krishna, spoke about the challenges faced by IBM in the fourth quarter during an earnings call.
"The fourth quarter was a mixed bag. While we continued to make progress in key growth areas like cloud, we also experienced some headwinds in the marketplace," Krishna said. "That being said, we remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and our ability to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead."
The New York-based company has been focused on shifting its business model to cloud computing and artificial intelligence from its traditional hardware and software products. The company's strategic shift has been driven by declining demand for traditional IT services, as well as intense competition from players like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
IBM's cloud business, which is critical to its transformation strategy, showed signs of progress in the fourth quarter. The company's cloud and cognitive software revenue grew by 8% to $6.8 billion. However, this growth rate was lower than the 11% growth witnessed in the previous quarter. IBM's cloud revenue was also impacted by some large deals that were pushed back into 2021.
In contrast, IBM's global business services segment, which includes consulting, application management, and global process services, reported a 2% decrease in revenue to $4.2 billion.
IBM's hardware segment, which includes mainframes and storage equipment, also reported a decline in revenue of 17% to $1.6 billion. The company's systems segment, which sells its Power Systems and Storage products, saw revenue decline by 18% year-over-year to $2.5 billion.
Krishna said that IBM's hardware business continues to be impacted by the pandemic, as supply chain constraints have caused delays in product shipments and installations.
"We continue to invest in the hardware business, but we expect it to be a drag on our overall growth for the next couple of quarters," Krishna said.
IBM's revenue from software sales, which includes operating systems and middleware, also declined by 4% year-over-year to $6.0 billion. The company's Red Hat business, which IBM acquired for $34 billion in 2019, grew by 18% in the quarter.
However, the growth rate of Red Hat slowed down compared to the previous quarter, which is raising concerns among investors about potential headwinds in the open-source software market.
Krishna said that IBM is committed to supporting Red Hat's growth, and he is confident that the business will continue to be a key driver of revenue growth for the company.
"We are pleased with the progress Red Hat is making and remain confident in its long-term growth potential," Krishna said.
Looking ahead, IBM provided a subdued outlook for the full year in 2021. The company expects to generate revenue of $73 billion, which is below analysts' estimates of $73.2 billion.
IBM's chief financial officer, Jim Kavanaugh, said that the company's outlook for the full year assumes a more challenging environment in the first half of 2021, due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic.
"We are cautious about the near-term outlook given the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the broader business environment," Kavanaugh said.
Overall, IBM's lack of growth in the fourth quarter has disappointed investors who were hoping to see significant progress in the company's transformation efforts. However, the company maintains that it is committed to its strategic shift towards cloud computing and artificial intelligence and is confident in its long-term growth potential.
