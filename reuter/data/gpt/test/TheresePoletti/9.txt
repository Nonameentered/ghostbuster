IBM's Fourth Quarter Earnings Slightly Better Than Expected, Boosted by Service Business and Software Sales.
IBM has reported its fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, thanks to a boost in its service business and software sales. The company's revenue for the quarter came in at $20.358 billion, beating the analysts' consensus estimate of $20.697 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The tech giant's earnings per share were $2.07, which were down by 66 cents from the same quarter in the previous year. However, this still exceeded the estimated $1.82 earnings per share. The company's net income for the quarter was $1.36 billion, compared to $3.67 billion in the same period last year.
IBM's services business witnessed a 2% increase in revenue to $6.93 billion, mainly due to its growth in cloud-hosting deals. The company has been shifting its focus more towards cloud computing and artificial intelligence in recent years to enhance its service offerings and maintain a competitive edge.
The tech giant's software sales also saw a 4% growth to $7.58 billion, driven by the demand for its Cloud Pak for Security and Red Hat products. IBM acquired Red Hat, a software provider for open-source cloud computing, in mid-2019. The Red Hat acquisition was IBM's biggest purchase ever and aimed to strengthen its position in cloud computing.
IBM's hardware business, which sells mainframes and servers, saw a decline of 17% in revenue to $2.6 billion. The company has been struggling in this business recently, as customers move away from traditional data centers and towards the cloud.
Overall, IBM's revenue for the year 2020 was $73.6 billion, down by 4.6% from last year. The company's net income for the year was $5.6 billion, compared to $9.4 billion in 2019.
Commenting on the results, IBM's CEO Arvind Krishna said, "While the overall revenue performance for the year was impacted by the pandemic, we delivered strong gross profit margins and expanded free cash flow, reflecting our agility and the enduring value clients place on IBM's technology and expertise."
Krishna also stated that the company is now focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence, which he sees as the two most significant areas of opportunity for IBM. The company plans to spin-off its managed infrastructure services unit by the end of 2021, which will allow it to focus more on these emerging technologies.
In conclusion, IBM's fourth-quarter earnings beating expectations come as a promising sign for the company's future. IBM's increased focus on hybrid cloud and AI has positioned the company well for growth, and the expected spin-off of its infrastructure unit will allow it to invest more in these areas.
