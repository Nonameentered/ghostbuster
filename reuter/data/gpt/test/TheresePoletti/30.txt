In a bid to take on the big telecom companies, AOL and Tel-Save have struck a deal that will offer lower-cost long-distance service to AOL members. The $100 million marketing deal is expected to provide a much-needed boost to both AOL and Tel-Save.
Under the agreement, Tel-Save will become the exclusive provider of long-distance services to AOL's 30 million members. The service will be marketed under AOL's brand and will be offered at a discounted rate to all AOL subscribers.
This deal is a significant move for AOL, which has been struggling to compete with other internet service providers. The company has been trying to diversify its revenue streams and expand its offerings to stay relevant in an increasingly crowded market.
Tel-Save, on the other hand, is a long-established player in the telecom industry. The company has a reputation for offering reliable services at competitive prices. The partnership with AOL is expected to give Tel-Save access to a vast new market and help it grow its business.
The CEO of Tel-Save, Bob Hold, said: "We are excited to partner with AOL to bring our cost-effective long-distance service to their millions of subscribers. This deal is a win-win for both companies, and we are confident it will be a great success."
The deal is expected to be a boon for AOL members who are looking to save money on their long-distance calls. The service will be available to all AOL subscribers, regardless of whether they use dial-up or broadband internet.
AOL CEO, Tim Armstrong, said: "Our partnership with Tel-Save is an important step towards offering more value to our members. We are committed to providing our subscribers with high-quality services at affordable prices. This deal will help us do just that."
The deal is also expected to put pressure on other telecom companies, who may be forced to lower their prices to stay competitive. The move comes at a time when the telecom industry is already facing increasing competition from new players, including internet companies like Google and Facebook.
The partnership between AOL and Tel-Save is expected to roll out in the coming months. The deal is expected to provide a much-needed boost to AOL's revenue and help Tel-Save grow its business. It remains to be seen whether the partnership will be a success, but both companies are bullish about its prospects.
