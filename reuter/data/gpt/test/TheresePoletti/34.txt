Citrix Systems Inc. Shares Plummet as Microsoft Develops Competing Software
Citrix Systems Inc., the leading provider of virtualization, networking, and cloud computing technologies, has suffered a great blow as Microsoft Corporation is developing its own software to compete with Citrix Workspace.
The news sent shares of Citrix Systems plummeting shortly after the announcement was made. The stock was down more than 20% at the opening bell, dropping to its lowest point in six months.
Microsoftâ€™s new software, dubbed Windows Virtual Desktop, will offer virtual desktops and remote desktop services to enterprise customers. This will be integrated with the Microsoft Azure cloud platform and Office 365, giving users a seamless experience across all devices and operating systems. 
The move is a direct challenge to Citrix Workspace, which offers a similar suite of products and services to enterprise customers. Citrix Workspace provides a unified platform for applications, desktops, and data, allowing employees to work from anywhere, on any device. 
While Microsoft's Windows Virtual Desktop may be developed for its own cloud platform, it has the potential to take down Citrix Workspace's market share as enterprise customers may choose to switch to Microsoft's offering, which can be more easily integrated with other Microsoft services.
Citrix Systems has struggled to maintain its market position for a while. In 2017, the company reported a significant drop in its quarterly earnings, which resulted in mass layoffs and a restructuring of the company's operations. The company has since tried to regain its foothold by introducing new products and services but is now faced with the significant threat posed by Microsoft's new venture.
Citrix executives, however, are still optimistic about the company's prospects. Speaking in a recent quarterly earnings call, CEO David Henshall stated, "We see a massive opportunity for our technologies to provide secure digital workspace solutions that enable customers to embrace the cloud and take advantage of digital transformation opportunities."
Yet the company's stock performance indicates that investors remain unconvinced. Citrix Systems has consistently underperformed the broader market, and it's uncertain whether it can withstand the impact of Microsoft's Windows Virtual Desktop launch.
In conclusion, Citrix Systems Inc. faces an uphill battle to retain its relevance in the market as Microsoft's new software challenges its market position. However, it remains to be seen whether Citrix can continue to innovate and offer better solutions, or if it will fade into obscurity as its competitors take over.
