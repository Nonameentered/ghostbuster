International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) has announced one of the most significant changes in its history, with the separation of its $23 billion Global Technology Services (GTS) division. This move is expected to foster its growth and drive job creation in the technology sector.
IBM, one of the world's largest technology companies, is undergoing significant structural changes under the stewardship of its CEO, Arvind Krishna. The separation of the GTS business comes on the back of a series of divestitures that have allowed IBM to focus on its cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) services.
Krishna emphasized this point when he said, "IBM is laser-focused on the $1 trillion hybrid cloud opportunity. Client buying needs for application and infrastructure services are diverging, while adoption of our hybrid cloud platform is accelerating." He added that the company is, "taking actions to streamline our operating model and improve our cost position."
The GTS division, which provides information technology (IT) support services to companies worldwide, is an essential part of IBM's legacy. However, the business has been shrinking in recent years as clients increasingly move towards cloud-based solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this change, with many businesses adopting work-from-home models that rely on cloud computing.
IBM's announcement of the GTS division's separation surprised many industry experts who expected the company to sell or outsource its IT services business. However, IBM has stated that it will spin off GTS entirely into a new public company but retain a stake in the entity.
This move will enable the GTS division to address its structural challenges, leverage automated and AI-driven tools, and drive innovation in cloud and IT services. The division will have the flexibility to invest in its growth areas and pursue strategic partnerships as an independent entity.
IBM's decision to separate GTS is expected to create opportunities for job creation and growth in the technology sector. Krishna stated in an open letter to employees that this change would enable IBM to "create more opportunities for our people, improve productivity, and drive sustainable growth of revenue and earnings."
Industry observers agree that the new public company could become a leader in the managed IT services industry, competing against major players such as Accenture, Capgemini, and Infosys. The new entity is expected to have over 4,600 clients and a talented workforce of nearly 90,000 employees worldwide.
IBM's announcement has been received positively by industry analysts, who see it as a positive move towards consolidating the company's focus on cloud and infrastructure services. They believe that this change will help IBM become more competitive in the cloud market and help it differentiate itself from other players in the industry.
This move also aligns with IBM's strategy to focus on high-growth areas such as AI, cloud, and blockchain. The company has invested heavily in these areas in recent years, with the acquisition of Red Hat, launching Watson, and expanding its quantum computing capabilities.
In conclusion, IBM's announcement of the GTS division's separation marks a significant milestone in the company's transformation journey. The move is expected to drive growth, create job opportunities, and enable IBM to focus on its core strengths. This action is a strategic shift that could help IBM position itself as a leader in the cloud and IT services market, a step that is crucial in maintaining its leadership position in the dynamic world of technology.
