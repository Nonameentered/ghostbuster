IBM Launches New Mainframe Computer Family Twice as Fast as Previous Models
IBM is changing the game once again by announcing the launch of the new mainframe computer family that anticipates operating at twice the speed of its ancestors.
IBM's latest mainframe line, the z15, declares to be the fastest, most substantial and most secure platform ever to be released, providing enhanced data privacy, security and digital trust services for consumers.
In today's fast-paced business environment, speed, safety and stability are essentials for companies wanting to drive innovation and growth. To preserve that competitive advantage, IBM's z15 assures to offer process uptime of up to 99.999 percent availability for businesses of all sizes.
According to Ross Mauri, General Manager of IBM Z, "The IBM z15 is the culmination of decades of experience in protecting our clients' mission-critical systems, and invested in them."
Speed and Efficiency
With high-speed processing, IBM's new computer family is expected to provide substantial improvements in time-to-market, operational effectiveness, and efficiency, making it ideal for businesses operating in a fast-paced environment. Enhancements such as faster Linux performance and reduced Java garbage collection time are set to increase performance for up to 30 percent for memory-intensive workloads.
Additionally, the z15 is equipped with full encryption from the cloud to the mainframe, with no downtime or application impacts, ensuring that confidential data is protected and that businesses comply with the best data protection laws.
The security features of the z15 have been systematically designed to minimize business risks, with self-encrypting drives and intensive digital signature-based authorization procedures that prevent unauthorized access to precious data.
"The IBM Z platform never stops evolving and continues to help financial services organizations process data at high speed, secure valuable information, and build trust with consumers, all while meeting evolving compliance standards such as SIMM," says David Hulskamp, Global Head of Risk at J.P. Morgan. 
Continuous Innovation
IBM is continuously enhancing the feature-set of their mainframes, from hardware to software and automation, assisting businesses to excel and deliver value-add services. The newest technology innovations combined with proven reliability and safety features make IBM's mainframe computer family ideal for next-generation workloads that require intense processing power, such as AI, machine learning and IoT.
"We have a substantial investment in the Mainframe because it's essential for a few of the promising technologies that are coming down the pike," says Keith Zecchini, Chief Architect at USAA.
Platform for a Hybrid World
The IBM z15 is ideally suited for a hybrid multi-cloud world, providing support for new workloads in a hybrid cloud environment. It offers enterprise-level services that enable companies to operate securely in a multi-cloud environment while compensating the advantages of cloud services.
With an intuitive user interface, significant information and metrics to aid in decision-making, they also offer lower costs. A new feature is support for Red Hat Openshift, which makes it easy for developers to move workloads to the hybrid cloud.
"The world runs on mainframes, including credit card applications to airline bookings, banking transactions, healthcare records, supply chain management, and everything in between. Enterprises globally depend on the mainframe to complete billions of transactions every day; today's announcement could not be more important for our clients and the tech industry as a whole," says Bill Higgins, IBM's Director of Offering Management for z/OS and IBM z Systems Software.
Conclusion
The z15's processing power, enhanced security and support for hybrid multi-cloud environments make it an ideal candidate for companies looking to future-proof their business and stay ahead of the competition.
With data breaches and other cybersecurity threats becoming more frequent and harder to detect, businesses must safeguard their data assets while continually innovating and providing value to their customers. 
IBM's z15 aims to provide clients with the fastest, most extensive and most secure platform to achieve these goals.
