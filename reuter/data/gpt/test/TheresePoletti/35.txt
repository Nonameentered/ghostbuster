JAMtv, a leading music-streaming company, has announced its plans to launch a personalized music network on the internet, using Intel Corp's multimedia technology. This move is expected to revolutionize the music-streaming industry and change the landscape of how people listen to music online.
With the partnership with Intel Corp, JAMtv will be able to offer a personalized music experience to its users. The new platform will provide a more immersive and cutting-edge experience, allowing users to create their own custom playlists, discover new music, and enjoy high-quality audio. Additionally, JAMtv's new platform will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to analyze users' listening habits and preferences, providing more accurate music recommendations.
"This partnership is a game-changer for JAMtv, as we're excited to offer a more personalized music experience to our users," said Michael James, CEO of JAMtv. "With Intel's multimedia technology, we're able to create a more immersive and engaging platform that caters to the individual needs of our users."
The new platform will be available through a web browser or through a dedicated mobile app, making it accessible to millions of users worldwide. The platform will also feature a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and find the music they love. Furthermore, users will also have the option to share their playlists with friends and family on various social media platforms.
"We're thrilled to be partnering with JAMtv, as we believe that this collaboration will deliver a more personalized music experience to users," said Gregory Bryant, the General Manager of the Client Computing Group at Intel. "Our multimedia technology is designed to revolutionize how people listen to music online, and we're excited to see how JAMtv will leverage our technology to create a more immersive and cutting-edge platform."
The launch of JAMtv's new platform comes at a time when the music-streaming industry is growing rapidly. According to a report by Statista, the global music-streaming market is expected to grow to $23.1 billion by 2025, up from $11.2 billion in 2020. Also, with more people working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for music-streaming services has skyrocketed. The launch of JAMtv's new platform is expected to meet this growing demand and provide users with a more personalized listening experience.
The new platform will also offer an innovative approach to monetizing music streaming. Instead of the traditional ad-based revenue model, JAMtv's new platform will allow independent artists and musicians to upload their tracks directly to the platform, where they can earn a share of the revenue based on the number of streams. This new approach is expected to benefit independent artists who do not have access to traditional music distribution channels.
In conclusion, JAMtv's partnership with Intel Corp to launch a personalized music network on the internet is a significant milestone for the music-streaming industry. The new platform will offer a more personalized and engaging experience for users and revolutionize how people listen to music online. With the new platform's launch, JAMtv is set to become a major player in the music-streaming industry.
