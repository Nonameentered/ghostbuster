America Online's Refund Plan and Marketing Cuts Improve Near-Term Financial Results, Analysts Say
America Online (AOL) has recently announced a plan to refund its customers who were billed for services that they did not request. The company's decision to issue refunds, along with its marketing cuts, has led to significant improvement in near-term financial results, according to analysts.
The refunds, which would affect over a million customers, resulted from a multi-state investigation of AOL's billing practices. The company had a reputation for making it difficult for customers to cancel their accounts and continuing to bill them for services they did not want. The refunds would cost AOL a total of $5 million, a small fraction of its $2.3 billion revenue in 2016.
"AOL's decision to refund its customers is a smart move," said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "It's a small cost for the company, but it sends a message to customers that it's willing to do the right thing."
The move is part of AOL's effort to rebrand itself as a customer-focused company with a renewed commitment to transparency. The company has been trying to distance itself from its past reputation as a monopolistic entity that exploited its customers for profit.
To further boost its image, AOL has also cut back on marketing expenses, including its Super Bowl ad this year. The decision to forgo the most-watched television event in the U.S. was a significant risk, but analysts say it has paid off.
"AOL's Super Bowl ad has historically been a key driver of brand awareness," said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. "But this year, the company took a different approach and cut back on marketing expenses. The move has helped to improve profit margins and has shown that AOL is focused on financial responsibility."
The cuts in marketing expenses have also led to some staff layoffs, another step in AOL's effort to streamline its operations and cut down on costs. The company's CEO, Tim Armstrong, recently announced that AOL's staff would be reduced by 5%, or about 500 employees.
Armstrong said that the layoffs were necessary to improve AOL's efficiency and focus on its core businesses. The company operates a number of online properties, including the Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and Engadget.
Despite the layoffs, AOL's share price has risen by over 30% in the past year, reflecting investor confidence in the company's long-term prospects. The company's revenue growth has been steady over the past few years, with a growth rate of 4% in 2016.
Analysts say that AOL's focus on customer service and cost cutting will help to improve its profit margins in the near term. However, the company faces intense competition from other digital media companies, including Facebook and Google, that are vying for a larger share of the online advertising revenue.
To remain competitive, AOL will need to continue to innovate and invest in new technology. One of its recent initiatives is the launch of a new platform called One, which is designed to help advertisers reach target audiences across multiple devices and platforms.
"AOL's focus on customer service and cost cutting is a positive step, but the company needs to continue to invest in new technology to stay ahead of the competition," said Mahaney. "The company has a strong brand and an experienced management team, but it needs to remain agile and adaptive to succeed in the fast-changing digital media landscape."
Overall, AOL's decision to issue refunds and cut back on marketing expenses has been positively received by analysts and investors. While the company still faces challenges in the highly competitive digital media market, its recent focus on customer service and financial responsibility has helped to improve its near-term prospects.
