In a significant breakthrough, the Chinese police have arrested the suspected ringleader of the deadly 2014 riot in Xinjiang. The riot, which erupted in the city of Yarkand, resulted in the deaths of nearly 100 people, mostly ethnic Han Chinese. The arrest of the suspect, identified as Memeteli Rehmeti, marks a major milestone in China's efforts to crack down on terrorism and separatism in the restive Xinjiang region.
The police apprehended Rehmeti in a raid on his hideout in Hotan, a city in southern Xinjiang. According to state media reports, he had been on the run for seven years and was hiding in a rented apartment when he was caught. The police confiscated a cache of weapons and explosives during the operation, which involved more than 100 security personnel.
Rehmeti, who is said to be in his 40s, was a prominent figure in the Uighur separatist movement in Xinjiang. He was a member of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a militant group that has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations. The ETIM is known to have carried out several attacks in Xinjiang and other parts of China over the years.
The Yarkand riot, which occurred in July 2014, was one of the bloodiest incidents in Xinjiang's recent history. It began when a group of Uighur protesters attacked a police station in the city, reportedly protesting against the government's policies towards their community. The protesters, armed with knives and axes, then rampaged through the streets, attacking Han Chinese civilians and ransacking shops and homes.
The Chinese authorities responded with a massive security crackdown, deploying thousands of troops and police to the region. They also launched a high-profile campaign to root out separatist elements and extremist ideology, which they blamed for the violence. The campaign led to the arrest and imprisonment of hundreds of Uighur activists and militants, as well as the installation of extensive surveillance and security measures in the region.
Despite the crackdown, however, sporadic violence continues to occur in Xinjiang, which is home to around 12 million Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority. Many Uighurs feel marginalized by the Chinese government's policies, which they say discriminate against them and their culture. Some Uighurs have also been radicalized by extremist groups, fueling a sense of grievance and alienation that has led to violence.
The Chinese government has defended its actions in Xinjiang, saying that they are necessary to maintain stability and prevent terrorism. It has also rejected accusations of human rights abuses, including claims of mass detention of Uighurs in re-education camps, as propaganda spread by anti-China forces.
The arrest of Rehmeti is likely to be seen as a major victory by the Chinese government, which has been under pressure to demonstrate progress in its campaign against terrorism and separatism. It may also signal a renewed push by the authorities to crack down on extremist groups in the region, in the lead-up to the Beijing Winter Olympics, which are scheduled to take place in February 2022.
However, some observers have expressed concerns about the human rights implications of the crackdown. They point to reports of arbitrary detention, forced labor, and restrictions on religious and cultural practices that have affected Uighurs and other minorities in the region. They also say that the government's approach risks exacerbating tensions and fueling further violence.
The arrest of Rehmeti is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges facing China in its efforts to maintain stability and security in Xinjiang. While it may provide a temporary boost to the authorities' efforts to crack down on extremism, it is unlikely to resolve the underlying grievances that have fueled the conflict. To achieve lasting peace and stability, China will need to address the root causes of the conflict, including issues of discrimination, inequality, and political representation.
