China has hailed the appointment of Hong Kong's first post-colonial Chief Executive as the beginning of "true democracy" in the special administrative region. Carrie Lam, a former civil servant, was elected as Hong Kong's Chief Executive in March this year. China's state media praised her as a "leader of integrity and efficiency."
Traditionally, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong is elected by a 1200-member Election Committee, which is made up of various groups like business, academic and political elites. These members are largely pro-Beijing and are selected by a small circle of organizations loyal to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
Critics have long called for reforms in the election process, which they say is heavily influenced by Beijing. They have also demanded greater democracy and autonomy for the semi-autonomous region.
However, Beijing has always maintained that Hong Kong's mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, allows for the region's Chief Executive to be selected by a "broadly representative" election committee, in line with legal requirements and "the actual situation" in Hong Kong.
In the past, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have taken to the streets to demand universal suffrage and direct election of the Chief Executive. These calls reached a peak during the Umbrella Movement in 2014, which lasted for 79 days and saw thousands of protesters taking to the streets to demand greater democracy.
However, the Chinese government saw the protests as a threat to its sovereignty and cracked down heavily on the pro-democracy movement. Several leaders of the Umbrella Movement were arrested and jailed, and a number of pro-democracy lawmakers were disqualified from office.
Despite this, Beijing claims that the election of Carrie Lam as Hong Kong's Chief Executive marks the beginning of "true democracy" in the region. In an article in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the CCP, the appointment of Lam was hailed as "a new chapter in Hong Kong's democracy."
The article went on to say that "the election process is the most democratic and open in Hong Kong's history, and reflects the opinions of a large number of Hong Kong compatriots."
However, pro-democracy campaigners have rejected this claim, pointing out that Lam was only elected by a small fraction of the population, and that the vast majority of Hong Kong people had no say in the process.
They have also warned that Lam's election is a continuation of Beijing's policy of imposing its will on Hong Kong, and that it marks a further erosion of the autonomy and freedoms enjoyed by the region.
Despite these criticisms, there is no doubt that Lam's election as Hong Kong's first post-colonial Chief Executive is a significant moment in the region's history. It marks the end of decades of British colonial rule and the beginning of a new era of Chinese sovereignty.
Whether it also marks the beginning of "true democracy" in Hong Kong remains to be seen. For now, the region's pro-democracy campaigners will continue to fight for greater autonomy and democratic rights, while Beijing will continue to assert its authority over the region.
