A recent survey conducted in China has revealed a deep-seated resentment and fear of Japanese militarism among the citizens of the country. The study, which was commissioned by a leading Chinese newspaper, surveyed over 10,000 people across the country. The results have highlighted the dangerous level of mistrust and animosity that exists between the two nations.
The survey found that 82% of Chinese respondents felt that Japan has not fully apologized for its wartime actions, including atrocities committed during the Second World War. This is despite the fact that Japan has issued numerous apologies for its militarist policies and actions, including a 1995 statement by then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in which he apologized for Japan's "aggression" during the war.
The survey also revealed that 93% of Chinese respondents viewed Japan as a potential military threat. This perception has been fueled by a number of factors, including Japan's recent efforts to expand its military capabilities, as well as disputes over territorial claims in the East China Sea.
China and Japan have long been embroiled in a territorial dispute over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and the Diaoyu Islands in China. The dispute has led to a number of tense standoffs between the two countries, with each side accusing the other of violating its sovereignty.
The survey found that 77% of Chinese respondents believed that the dispute over the islands could lead to military conflict between the two nations. This fear is not unfounded, as there have been a number of close calls in recent years, including a 2013 incident in which Chinese and Japanese warplanes came dangerously close to each other over the disputed airspace.
The survey also revealed that 63% of Chinese respondents believed that Japan's military expansion poses a threat to China's national security. Japan has been working to expand its military capabilities in recent years, with the goal of becoming a "normal" military power capable of defending its interests abroad.
This has led to concerns in China that Japan may be planning to assert its military power in the region, potentially challenging China's status as the dominant power in Asia. It has also intensified fears of a return to the kind of militarism that Japan exhibited during the Second World War.
The survey found that 68% of Chinese respondents believed that Japan's military expansion was motivated by a desire to become a "great power" once again. This belief has been fueled by a number of factors, including Japan's long history of imperialism and the fact that it is the world's third-largest economy.
The survey results suggest that there is a dangerous level of mistrust and animosity between China and Japan, with deep-seated resentment and fear on both sides. While there have been some efforts to improve relations between the two nations, including a recent visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Japan, it is clear that there is still a long way to go to overcome the historical and political obstacles that stand in the way of true reconciliation.
