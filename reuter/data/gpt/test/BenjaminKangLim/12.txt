BEIJING - Deng Xiaoping, the one who put forward the "one country, two systems" policy, may not be able to attend the Hong Kong handover according to Beijing's Vice-Mayor, Wang Qishan.
The Hong Kong handover, scheduled for July 1, 1997, will be the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. The event is seen as significant, and Beijing has been preparing for it for years. However, the attendance of Deng Xiaoping, the former leader of China, is now put into question.
Wang Qishan confirmed to the press that Deng Xiaoping is seriously ill and his attendance at the Hong Kong handover is uncertain. “We have been informed that Deng Xiaoping is not in good condition, and we are not sure whether he will be able to attend the ceremony,” said Wang.
Deng Xiaoping, now 92 years old, is known for his economic reforms that transformed China into a global economic powerhouse. He is also credited for the "one country, two systems" policy, which allowed Hong Kong and Macau to maintain their capitalist economies and some political autonomy even after their return to China's sovereignty.
The news of Deng Xiaoping's illness has caused concern among the Chinese people, as he is considered a highly respected figure. Many expressed their well wishes on social media, hoping for his speedy recovery.
The Hong Kong handover has been seen as a critical moment for China's future. Hong Kong will become a special administrative region of China, with its own government, legal system, and economic policies. The transfer of sovereignty is viewed as a test for the "one country, two systems" policy, which will be applied to Taiwan in the future as well.
However, as the Hong Kong handover approaches, the authorities have faced increasing challenges. Pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong have been growing, and some citizens have expressed concerns over China's increasing influence over their city. The Chinese government has responded by tightening its grip on Hong Kong, passing laws that allow for a more drastic crackdown on dissent.
The potential absence of Deng Xiaoping at the Hong Kong handover ceremony will be a significant blow for China's leadership. Deng's presence would have symbolized the continuity of the "one country, two systems" policy, and his absence could be interpreted as a sign of weakness.
There are also questions about who will succeed Deng Xiaoping, as he has not appointed a clear successor. In the absence of a named successor, power struggles among party officials could occur, which could lead to political instability.
Despite this uncertainty, Beijing has announced that the Hong Kong handover will proceed as planned. President Jiang Zemin will lead the delegation to hand over Hong Kong's sovereignty. The government has also promised that Hong Kong's autonomy will remain unchanged and that the city's residents will continue to enjoy their rights and freedoms.
In conclusion, the absence of Deng Xiaoping at the Hong Kong handover ceremony would be a significant event in China's history. The event is seen as a test for the "one country, two systems" policy, and the absence of one of its founding fathers could symbolize a shift in China's approach to Hong Kong. As China prepares for the Hong Kong handover, the future of the city remains uncertain.
