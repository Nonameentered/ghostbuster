BEIJING- China has pledged to open up its insurance, stock, retail, wholesale, and banking sectors to foreign investment as part of its pursuit of entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), according to officials on Wednesday.
The move is said to be a major step towards liberalizing China's economy, as the country looks to bolster its efforts to join the global trade organization on equal terms with other member countries.
The announcement comes just days after the United States, Europe, and Japan had pressed China to make significant concessions in terms of access to their markets, including opening up to greater foreign investment in sensitive sectors of the economy. In response, Beijing appeared to have given the green light to many of their requests.
China's central government announced in a statement that it would now start removing foreign ownership caps in banks and insurance companies. The move to open up the insurance sector has been seen as particularly significant since it has previously been off-limits to foreign firms. The statement also stressed that foreign companies would be granted equal status as local firms in terms of access to public procurement deals.
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a briefing on Wednesday that "we will work to fully implement our promises and commitments made to the WTO and actively reduce market access restrictions, further promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and constantly improve the business environment to attract foreign investment and talent.‚Äù
The retail and wholesale industry is another key sector undergoing reform, with foreign companies soon able to hold up to 51% of stakes in joint ventures with local firms. Foreign firms will also be allowed to own up to 55% of shares in listed companies, according to the officials.
The Chinese government has made a significant effort in opening up its economy to foreign investment, despite concerns from the public and opposition from certain sectors. Foreign companies have complained for years about market access and uneven playing fields in China's domestic market, even though the country recently opened up its market to foreign investors in several sectors.
In August 2020, China published a comprehensive new negative list of industries barring foreign investors, which shrank to over 120 from 145, according to the Shanghai Securities News. The new reforms are set to further ease restrictions that have been in place for years and could attract more foreign investors.
China's willingness to open up its economy is seen as crucial by many for the success of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, a development strategy that seeks to build infrastructure projects, trade, and investment networks spanning Eurasia and beyond. As well as boosting China's economy, the initiative is expected to increase trade among nations along the routes, especially for developing countries which are in need of infrastructure investment.
Despite some resistance, China's decision to open its market is a clear indication of its intention to pursue an open and competitive economy, which experts believe is an important step towards becoming a more developed nation.
