In a press conference on Monday, Beijing's newly-elected mayor, Li Hongzhong, spoke about his plans to continue the fight against corruption in the city while also putting the recent graft scandal behind him.
The graft scandal Li referred to involved a former high-ranking official in the Beijing municipal government, who was sentenced to death in July for accepting bribes and embezzling public funds.
Addressing the press, Li stressed the importance of maintaining a clean and efficient government in order to better serve the people of Beijing. He also emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in all areas of government.
"We must continue to root out corruption and uphold the rule of law in our city," Li said. "This is essential not just for the sake of our government and our economy, but for the well-being and trust of our people."
Li also acknowledged the challenges that come with taking on such a task, especially in a city as large and complex as Beijing. He promised to work closely with other government officials, law enforcement agencies, and the public to ensure that corruption is eradicated and that honest, reliable leaders are put in place.
"We must be vigilant and proactive in identifying and prosecuting corruption," Li said. "We must also create a culture of ethics and integrity within our government, so that those who serve the people do so with honor and dignity."
Despite Li's strong words, some critics remain skeptical of his promises to tackle corruption. They point to the fact that several high-profile corruption cases in the city have not resulted in any major convictions or resignations, and they argue that the problem has only gotten worse in recent years.
In response, Li stressed that the fight against corruption is ongoing and that it will require time and effort on the part of all those involved.
"This is not something that can be solved overnight," Li said. "It will take the commitment and dedication of everyone in Beijing to make real progress."
Li also vowed to work closely with other cities and provinces in China, as well as with international organizations, to share best practices and strategies for combating corruption. He acknowledged that corruption is a global issue that requires a coordinated and collaborative response.
"We must learn from the experiences of others and apply those lessons to our own situation," Li said. "Only by working together can we truly make a difference."
As for the recent graft scandal that has plagued the city, Li reiterated his commitment to justice and fairness. He vowed to continue investigating the matter and to hold those responsible for any wrongdoing accountable.
"We must be transparent and objective in our pursuit of the truth," Li said. "We cannot allow corruption to go unpunished, but we must also ensure that the process is fair and impartial."
Overall, Li's message was one of hope and determination. He spoke of a brighter future for Beijing, one in which the government serves the people with honesty, integrity, and efficiency.
"We have a great responsibility to the people of Beijing," Li said. "We must honor that responsibility by doing everything in our power to create a better, more just, and more prosperous city for all."
