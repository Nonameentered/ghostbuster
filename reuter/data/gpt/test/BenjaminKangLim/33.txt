China Jails Two Mongolians for Separatism and Espionage, Say Human Rights Group Amnesty International
Chinese authorities have jailed two Mongolians for separatism and espionage, according to human rights group Amnesty International. The two men, identified as Baatarsuren and Tuguldur, were arrested last year and sentenced to prison terms of 10 and 9 years, respectively.
Amnesty International said that the charges against the two Mongolians were based on false premises and that their trial was marred by procedural irregularities. The human rights group called on the Chinese government to release the two men immediately and to respect the rights of Mongolians living in China.
The case of Baatarsuren and Tuguldur has heightened concerns about China's treatment of its ethnic minorities, particularly in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region where both men were from. The region is home to a large population of ethnic Mongolians who have long complained about discrimination, cultural erasure, and political repression.
The Chinese government has been accused of escalating its crackdown on dissent in Inner Mongolia as part of its wider campaign to suppress separatist movements and maintain tight control over the country's regions with large non-Han populations. In recent years, authorities have implemented a range of policies that restrict the use of Mongolian language in education and official settings, limit traditional practices and cultural expression, and increase surveillance and censorship.
Several high-profile cases of Mongolian dissidents being jailed or disappeared have come to light in recent years, including that of activist Hada, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for advocating for the rights of Mongolians in China. Many Mongolians living abroad have also reported harassment and surveillance by Chinese authorities.
Amnesty International's East Asia Director, Joshua Rosenzweig, said that the imprisonment of Baatarsuren and Tuguldur was "a blatant violation of their rights and a clear attempt to silence Mongolian voices that dare to speak out against the government's discriminatory and repressive policies."
Rosenzweig added that "China cannot claim to be a responsible member of the international community while it continues to trample on the rights of its ethnic minorities and punish those who stand up for their rights."
The case of Baatarsuren and Tuguldur has sparked outrage among Mongolians both in China and abroad, who say that their imprisonment is just the latest example of the Chinese government's attempts to suppress and erase their culture and identity. Many have taken to social media to call for their release and to express solidarity with the wider Mongolian community in China.
The Chinese government has yet to respond to Amnesty International's statement on the case of Baatarsuren and Tuguldur. However, it has repeatedly denied allegations of mistreatment of ethnic minorities and has defended its policies as necessary for national unity and territorial integrity.
