In a recent move, Beijing has accused the United States of using the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, to break up China and sow discord within its borders. The allegations come amid the ongoing tensions between the two countries, which have seen them locking horns over a range of issues, including trade tariffs, human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang province, and Beijing's handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
The accusation was levied by China's State Council Information Office on its official website earlier this week. The statement said that the US had been using the Dalai Lama as a political tool to "westernize" Tibet and stir up separatist sentiment among Tibetan people. It went on to accuse the US of backing "feel-good" policies related to the Dalai Lama, which had no real impact on Tibet, but were intended to undermine China's sovereignty.
"The US has been using the issue of Tibet to interfere in China's internal affairs and tarnish China's image. The Dalai Lama is not just a religious figure; he is a political figure who is involved in anti-China sabotage activities," the statement said.
The latest accusations from Beijing come in the wake of a meeting between the Dalai Lama and United States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, Robert A. Destro. The meeting, which took place last week, saw Destro reiterate the US's continued support for the Tibetan people and their right to "religious freedom, protection of human rights, and preservation of Tibetan culture."
China has long dismissed the Dalai Lama as a "separatist" and opposes any foreign official meeting with him. In March, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had warned that the US should not interfere in its internal affairs or support "anti-China separatist forces" in Tibet.
The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule of Tibet. Since then, he has become a global symbol of peace, non-violence, and spiritual wisdom. Despite his exile, he remains a highly revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism and continues to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the Tibetan issue.
The latest accusations from Beijing are unlikely to dampen the global support for the Dalai Lama and his cause. The US government is not the only foreign entity to lend their support to the Tibetan people - several European countries, including France and Germany, have also recognized the Dalai Lama as the spiritual leader of Tibet and expressed concern over China's suppression of Tibetan culture and religion.
As relations between the US and China continue to sour, it remains to be seen whether these latest accusations will add fuel to the fire. For the Tibetan people, however, the struggle for their cultural and religious rights remains as important as ever, and the Dalai Lama's role as a symbol of their aspirations remains undimmed.
