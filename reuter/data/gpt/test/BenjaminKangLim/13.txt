In a significant move, China has introduced new rules that allow direct shipping links with Taiwan, despite a decades-old ban. The new rules, which were approved by the State Council, will permit direct shipping of goods and people between the two sides. The move is seen as an effort to normalize ties between the two sides and promote economic growth.
The announcement was made by Li Keqiang, the Premier of China, during a press conference in Beijing. He said that the new rules would help boost trade and investment between the two sides. "We hope that through this initiative, we can improve our economic ties and bring benefits to both sides," he said.
Under the new rules, Chinese ships will be allowed to sail directly to Taiwan's ports, and vice versa. This will end a long-standing ban on direct shipping between the two sides, which was implemented in 1949. The ban was a result of the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The ban was intended to isolate Taiwan and prevent it from developing close ties with other countries.
Despite the ban, trade between the two sides has grown significantly in recent years. In 2020, trade between China and Taiwan reached $186 billion, up from $146 billion in 2015. The new rules are expected to further boost this trade and create new opportunities for businesses on both sides.
The move has been welcomed by business leaders in both Taiwan and China. Taiwan's President, Tsai Ing-wen, described the move as "a positive development" that would benefit both sides. "This is a pragmatic step that will help promote economic ties and encourage more people-to-people exchanges," she said in a statement.
Charles Hsu, the CEO of a Taiwanese shipping company, said that the new rules would make it easier for businesses to trade between the two sides. "This is a very positive step that will help reduce costs and make it easier for Taiwanese companies to do business with their counterparts in China," he said.
China's decision to allow direct shipping links with Taiwan comes at a time when the relationship between the two sides is at a low point. China considers Taiwan to be a part of its territory, and the two sides have been in a state of political tension for decades. In recent years, China has ramped up military pressure on Taiwan, and has been using its economic power to isolate the island internationally.
The move to allow direct shipping links is seen as a way for China to take a softer approach towards Taiwan, and to build closer economic ties. This could help to reduce tensions and create a more stable relationship between the two sides.
However, some experts have raised concerns about the impact of the new rules on Taiwan's security. They argue that allowing Chinese ships to sail directly to Taiwan's ports could give China greater access to the island and make it easier for China to conduct intelligence operations.
Taiwan's government has responded by saying that it will ensure that security measures are in place to prevent any security threats. "We will work closely with our partners in China to ensure that security standards are met and that our national interests are protected," said a spokesperson for Taiwan's government.
Overall, the new rules allowing direct shipping links between China and Taiwan are a positive development that could help to reduce tensions and promote economic growth. While some challenges remain, this move is a step in the right direction towards building a more stable and peaceful relationship between the two sides.
