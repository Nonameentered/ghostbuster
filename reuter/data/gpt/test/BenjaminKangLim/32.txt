In a strongly-worded statement released by China's state-run media, the country's propaganda machine mounted a scathing attack on major U.S. newspapers over their coverage of the alleged torture of Tibetan nuns and suggestions to adopt a tougher approach towards China in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Xinhua News Agency, a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), called out The New York Times and The Washington Post for spreading "false and malicious" information about China's human rights record and for propagating an "unfounded and irresponsible" theory that China was responsible for the spread of the coronavirus.
The statement was apparently prompted by a recent investigation by The New York Times that exposed the brutal treatment of nuns at a Chinese-run detention center in Tibet. The report, which included graphic photos and videos of torture, drew widespread condemnation from human rights groups, religious leaders, and the international community at large.
However, the CCP-controlled media dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and accused the U.S. newspapers of smearing China's reputation to advance their own interests.
"The so-called 'torture' and 'abuse' of nuns in Tibet is a baseless lie and a gross distortion of the facts," Xinhua claimed. "This is just another attempt by the U.S. media to demonize China and deflect attention away from their own problems."
The propaganda machine also took issue with recent calls by U.S. lawmakers and officials to impose sanctions on China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The Trump administration has repeatedly accused China of covering up the severity of the outbreak and failing to share vital information with the international community, sparking a diplomatic row between the two countries.
In response, China has retaliated by accusing the U.S. of politicizing the pandemic and spreading "conspiracy theories" about its origins.
The Xinhua statement warned that any attempt to "interfere in China's internal affairs" or "disrupt Chinese society and harm China's interests" would be met with a firm response.
"We call on the U.S. to stop its political manipulation and stop interfering in China's affairs. We urge the U.S. media to abandon their bias and prejudice against China and report the facts objectively," the statement added.
The propaganda offensive comes amid growing international criticism of China's human rights record, particularly in Tibet and Xinjiang, where the CCP has been accused of perpetrating mass detentions, forced labor, and cultural genocide against the Uighur Muslim minority.
Despite mounting evidence of China's human rights abuses, the CCP has consistently denied the allegations and accused the international community of interfering in its internal affairs.
Observers say the propaganda machine's denunciation of U.S. newspapers reflects the CCP's increasingly assertive posture on the global stage and its determination to control the narrative on issues vital to its national interests.
"The CCP's propaganda machine is a crucial tool in its wider campaign to shape global opinion and deflect criticism of its policies," said John L. Thornton China Center Director Scott Kennedy. "China is now projecting its own version of events in a more confident and forceful manner, and is increasingly willing to push back against its critics."
