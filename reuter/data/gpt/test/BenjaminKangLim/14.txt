Recently, China sent a stern warning to Britain over their intention to challenge the disbandment of Hong Kong's legislature in the World Court. The warning was issued after the UK announced its plan to officially object to China's move to oust four opposition lawmakers from the city's legislature.
China viewed the UK's challenge as an interference in its internal affairs, and an attempt to undermine the "One China" principle and the "one country, two systems" policy. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, reiterated that Hong Kong is an internal affair of China, and no foreign country has the right to interfere in it.
Despite China's warning, Britain still plans to challenge Hong Kong's legislature disbandment at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), citing a violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The declaration was signed in 1984 and outlined the principle of "one country, two systems," which guarantees Hong Kong's autonomy and rights until 2047.
The UK's objection came after the Chinese government passed a resolution allowing the disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers from Hong Kong's Legislative Council. The move was widely criticized and considered a major blow to Hong Kong's democracy.
China's unilateral decision to disqualify these lawmakers challenged the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which guaranteed the autonomy and democratic rights of Hong Kong residents. The UK had earlier called the move a "clear breach" of the declaration and said it would consider sanctions if the situation did not improve.
China's warning to Britain on Wednesday has once again heightened tensions between the two countries over the issue. Although the UK's objection at the ICJ is unlikely to change China's decision, it could still provide a platform to bring international attention and scrutiny to China's actions in Hong Kong.
The situation in Hong Kong has been extensively debated in the international community, and many countries have expressed their support for Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic rights. The European Union, for example, has called for the restoration of democratic processes, and Australia has suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in response to China's actions.
The US has also been vocal in its support of Hong Kong's autonomy and has passed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which authorizes the imposition of financial and travel sanctions on individuals and institutions that contribute to the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy.
In summary, China's warning to Britain over its intention to challenge Hong Kong's legislature disbandment at the ICJ highlights the deepening tensions between the two countries over the issue. The situation in Hong Kong continues to attract international attention and scrutiny, and the UK's objection could provide a platform to subject China's actions in Hong Kong to international examination.
