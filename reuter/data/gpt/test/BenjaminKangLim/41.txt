On Thursday, Chinese police were seen moving North Korean diplomats away from the South Korean embassy in Beijing, where a top-level official from North Korea was reportedly seeking asylum.
The incident occurred around noon local time, with eyewitnesses reporting a heavy police presence outside the South Korean embassy. There were also reports of commotion and shouting from inside the building.
According to sources, the North Korean official seeking asylum is Jo Song Gil, the ambassador to Italy. Jo had reportedly been posted to Rome in 2017 but has not returned to North Korea since November last year. He is believed to be with his wife and children and is seeking asylum in South Korea.
North Korea has not yet commented on the incident, but sources say that Jo's defection could be a significant blow to the regime. Jo is said to have been a top official in North Korea's embassy in Rome and would have had access to sensitive information about the country's operations in Europe.
The move by Chinese police to remove North Korean diplomats from the vicinity of the South Korean embassy is likely an attempt by Beijing to avoid any diplomatic fallout from the incident. Beijing has long been a key ally of North Korea and would not want to be seen as aiding a defector.
South Korea, for its part, has not yet confirmed that Jo is seeking asylum in its embassy. The country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement saying that it is "closely monitoring the situation" and would "take necessary measures in accordance with international laws and practices."
The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, with North Korea continuing to develop its nuclear weapons program despite international pressure to halt it. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been pushing for closer ties with North Korea in recent months, but progress has been slow.
It is unclear what impact Jo's defection will have on the ongoing efforts to improve relations between the two Koreas. Some experts believe that it could serve as a wakeup call to the North Korean leadership, as it highlights the level of dissatisfaction among some officials with the regime's policies.
Others, however, are more skeptical, arguing that North Korea is likely to downplay the incident and portray Jo as a traitor who has gone against the interests of the state. This would be in line with the regime's usual tactics when dealing with defectors, who are often depicted as weak and unpatriotic.
Despite the uncertain outcome of the situation, international observers have praised South Korea for its cautious approach. The country has been careful to avoid inflaming tensions with North Korea, while also protecting the rights of potential defectors.
In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of North Korean officials seeking asylum overseas, including a group of workers who defected from a North Korean restaurant in China in 2016. These incidents have highlighted the growing discontent within the country and the ongoing challenges facing the regime as it tries to maintain control.
For now, the situation at the South Korean embassy in Beijing remains tense, with both Chinese and South Korean authorities on high alert. The fate of Jo and his family is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the incident is likely to have far-reaching implications for the already fragile relationship between North and South Korea.
