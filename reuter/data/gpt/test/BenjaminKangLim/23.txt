In a move that could further strain the already fraught relations between China and Taiwan, Beijing has refused an invitation for a top policymaker to visit the island. 
The invitation was extended by Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council in an attempt to restart dialogue between the two sides. However, China's Taiwan Affairs Office rejected the offer, saying that it was "inappropriate" to send a top official to the island at this time. 
This latest development comes just weeks after China conducted military exercises in the Taiwan Strait, which were seen as a show of force and intimidation towards Taiwan. The exercises prompted a strong response from the island's government, which accused China of trying to "change the status quo" in the region. 
The rejection of the invitation is likely to fuel tensions between Beijing and Taipei, which have been at loggerheads since the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949. China views Taiwan as a renegade province that should be reunified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Taiwan, on the other hand, sees itself as a sovereign state and has been increasingly vocal in asserting its independence. 
The decision by China to reject the invitation was not unexpected, given the current state of relations between the two countries. However, it is still a blow for Taiwan's government, which had hoped that a visit by a senior Chinese official could help ease tensions and restart dialogue. 
In a statement, the Mainland Affairs Council expressed regret at China's decision, saying that it was a missed opportunity for both sides to address their differences and work towards a peaceful resolution. 
"We believe that exchanges and dialogue between the two sides are the best way to resolve our differences and promote peaceful development in the region," the statement said. 
Taiwan's President, Tsai Ing-wen, has also expressed disappointment at China's refusal to send a top policymaker to the island. In a post on Twitter, she said that "dialogue and communication are the only way to resolve differences and promote mutual understanding." 
China's rejection of the invitation is likely to further isolate Taiwan on the international stage. The island has long been diplomatically isolated as most countries have diplomatic relations with China and not Taiwan. Only 15 countries around the world recognize Taiwan as an independent country. 
Despite this, Taiwan has been seeking to strengthen its international ties, particularly with countries that share its democratic values. In recent months, the country has signed several agreements with the United States, including a trade deal, and has also been seeking closer ties with Japan and Australia. 
However, China has been ramping up pressure on these countries to keep their distance from Taiwan, warning that any support for the island could have consequences for their relations with Beijing. 
The rejection of the invitation by China is likely to make it even harder for Taiwan to break out of its diplomatic isolation and gain greater international recognition. It is also likely to fuel concerns in the region about China's growing assertiveness and ambitions. 
In recent years, China has been expanding its military and economic influence in the Asia-Pacific region, leading to fears that it is seeking to establish regional dominance. These concerns have been heightened by China's actions in the South China Sea, where it has built military installations on disputed islands. 
The rejection of the invitation by China is just the latest example of its hard-line approach towards Taiwan, which is unlikely to change anytime soon. This is bad news for the people of Taiwan, who are caught in the middle of a geopolitical struggle between two superpowers.
