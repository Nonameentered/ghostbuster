Beijing, China - A prominent Chinese dissident, whom authorities took into custody earlier this week, faces coercive ideological reform, according to his family members.
Liu Xiaobo, an activist who has been openly critical of the Chinese Communist Party, was arrested under suspicion of "subverting state power." While the details surrounding his capture remain unclear, his wife, Liu Xia, has been prevented from leaving their home in Beijing and has not been able to speak to him since he was taken away.
"Ever since my husband was detained, we've been in a state of utter desperation," Xia told reporters, whom she allowed to enter her apartment following four months of house arrest. "We know that he is being subjected to psychological torture, and I fear for my husband's life."
The authorities have not provided any official statement regarding Xiaobo's arrest, except for confirming that he is being held under "coercive measures." It is not clear whether the Chinese government intends to bring him to trial, although it has been rumored that he may be charged with "inciting subversion of state power."
The news of Xiaobo's detention has prompted international outrage, with Human Rights Watch issuing a statement calling upon Chinese authorities to immediately release Xiaobo, reminding them that detaining people for their peaceful expression of their political views is a clear violation of international human rights standards.
"China's persecution of human rights defenders like Liu Xiaobo is unacceptable and must stop," said the organization's director for China, Sophie Richardson.
Xiaobo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, has been an outspoken critic of the Chinese government and its policies. He has called for democratic reforms, greater freedom of speech and assembly, and an end to one-party rule.
He was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009 for "inciting subversion of state power," after co-authoring "Charter 08," a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms and greater respect for human rights in China. The document was signed by thousands of Chinese citizens, including many intellectuals, lawyers, and other notable figures.
Following his release from prison in 2017 due to his terminal illness, Xiaobo remained under strict government surveillance. His deteriorating health made international headlines, with many countries calling upon China to let him leave the country for medical treatment. However, the Chinese government refused to allow him to leave the country.
The move to detain Xiaobo marks a further crackdown on dissent in China, which has come under increasing international scrutiny in recent years for its human rights abuses. The government's hard-line stance against political dissent, online activism, and freedom of speech has led to the imprisonment of many activists, journalists, and lawyers.
The Chinese government has repeatedly defended its treatment of dissidents, arguing that they pose a threat to national security and stability.
The fate of Xiaobo remains uncertain, but his wife's concerns and those of human rights groups, continue to raise awareness of China's ongoing issues with human rights and political freedoms, which have remained largely unchanged for decades.
"I urge the authorities to release my husband and to stop this campaign of political persecution," Xia said. "We need to remember that the freedom to express our opinions and our beliefs is a fundamental right of every human being."
