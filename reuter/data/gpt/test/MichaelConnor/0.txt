It was announced yesterday that Kodak, the iconic American company known for its cameras and photography-related products, has sold its copier-marketing and service operations for $684 million to Danka Business Systems Plc. The move comes as part of Kodak's ongoing efforts to streamline its operations and focus on its core manufacturing and development businesses.
According to a press release issued by Kodak, the deal will see Danka take over responsibility for the marketing, sales, and service of Kodak's copier products in Europe and the Americas. In return, Kodak will receive $684 million in cash, which it plans to use to invest in its other businesses. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approval.
Kodak CEO Jim Continenza said in a statement that the sale of its copier-marketing and service operations was a "strategic move" for the company. "As we continue to transform Kodak, we are focused on growing our core manufacturing and development businesses and divesting non-core assets," he explained. "This transaction with Danka will help us do just that, while ensuring that our customers continue to receive the high-quality products and services they expect from Kodak."
Danka CEO Dan Doyle praised the deal as a "major milestone" for his company. "We are delighted to be acquiring Kodak's copier-marketing and service operations, which will greatly enhance our position in the market," he said. "This deal represents a significant growth opportunity for Danka, and we look forward to working with Kodak to ensure a smooth transition for customers and employees alike."
The sale of its copier-marketing and service operations comes as Kodak continues to pivot away from its traditional business of making film and cameras and focus on other areas of its business. In recent years, the company has invested heavily in developing new technologies, such as OLED displays and 3D printing, and has also expanded its presence in fields such as packaging and printing.
The move also follows a period of financial difficulty for the company, which filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and emerged from Chapter 11 protection in 2013. Since then, Kodak has sought to reposition itself as a technology-focused company, and has seen some success in doing so. Last year, the company reported revenues of $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2019, and is expected to continue to grow in the coming years as it invests in new technologies and expands its reach in key markets around the world.
Overall, the sale of its copier-marketing and service operations represents a major step forward for Kodak, as it seeks to position itself as a leaner, more focused company that is better equipped to take on the challenges of the 21st century. With its core manufacturing and development businesses now more secure than ever, the company is well-positioned to continue its transformation and pursue new opportunities in the years to come.
