Despite widespread vilification in Hollywood and ongoing legal action against them, US cigarette makers continue to be cash-generating machines, thanks to their diversified portfolios.
The tobacco industry has been under fire for several years now, with governments and health organizations campaigning heavily against smoking. In fact, smoking-related illnesses are one of the leading causes of death across the world, with the World Health Organization estimating that tobacco use kills over 6 million people every year.
The US government has also been actively involved in cracking down on the tobacco industry, with various measures aimed at curbing smoking, such as increased taxes, stricter advertising regulations, and warning labels.
However, despite all this backlash, tobacco companies like Altria and Philip Morris International have continued to perform strongly financially. Both companies have been around for over a century, and over the years, they have built diversified, multinational businesses that don't rely solely on cigarette sales.
For example, Altria owns a 10% stake in beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, as well as an e-cigarette company, a wine business, and a smokeless tobacco brand. Meanwhile, Philip Morris International has focused on international growth and has invested heavily in reduced-risk products like heated tobacco.
These companies generate significant amounts of cash, and that's unlikely to change anytime soon. In 2020, Altria's revenue was over $19 billion, while Philip Morris International's was over $27 billion. And while cigarette sales are declining, the growth of reduced-risk products and smokeless tobacco will likely keep the cash flowing.
Of course, there are still legal risks associated with the tobacco industry, and this isn't the first time that companies have faced action in the courts. Tobacco companies have been involved in several high-profile lawsuits over the years, including the landmark 1998 settlement that resulted in a $246 billion payout from the industry to the states.
However, despite these risks, financial analysts remain bullish on tobacco companies. Part of the reason for this is that tobacco companies invest heavily in lobbying, which helps protect them from regulation and keeps their tax rates low. In 2020, Altria alone spent over $10 million on lobbying efforts, according to OpenSecrets.org.
Of course, not everyone is happy about the tobacco industry's continued success. Hollywood has long vilified smoking on the big screen, with movies like "Thank You for Smoking" and "The Insider" highlighting the industry's shady practices.
But even this hasn't stopped tobacco companies from remaining profitable. And with their diversified portfolios, it's likely that they will continue to create significant amounts of cash flow for years to come.
