A Miami TV producer has been removed from standby jurors in Florida's $5 billion secondhand smoke trial.
The trial, which began on Monday, has pitted tobacco companies against smoking victims, who are seeking compensation for illnesses caused by secondhand smoke.
The 12-person jury was selected last week, but several alternate jurors were also selected to stand by in case any of the original jurors became ineligible.
However, one of those standby jurors, a TV producer from Miami, was removed from the case after it was revealed that she had a conflict of interest.
According to reports, the juror had been involved in producing a TV show that featured interviews with tobacco company executives.
The judge presiding over the case, Circuit Judge Kevin Emas, said that the juror's involvement with the TV show could create the appearance of bias and could compromise the integrity of the trial.
"The court cannot have a juror who has a conflict of interest, especially one as significant as this," Emas said in his ruling.
The decision to remove the juror from the case is not expected to have any impact on the trial, which is expected to last several weeks.
The case is being closely watched by both sides of the tobacco industry, as it could set a precedent for other lawsuits that are currently pending.
The plaintiffs in the case are seeking $5 billion in damages from three tobacco companies, Philip Morris USA Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and Liggett Group LLC.
The plaintiffs argue that the tobacco companies knew for decades about the health dangers of smoking and secondhand smoke, but chose to conceal that information from the public.
In his opening statement, attorney Scott Schlesinger, who is representing the plaintiffs, said that the tobacco companies had engaged in a "conspiracy of lies" to mislead the public and protect their profits.
"They knew that their products caused cancer, they knew that their products caused heart disease, yet they continued to lie," Schlesinger said.
The tobacco companies, meanwhile, have denied the allegations and say that they have always been transparent about the health risks associated with smoking.
In their opening statement, attorneys for the tobacco companies argued that the plaintiffs' claims were unsubstantiated and that there was no evidence to support their allegations.
"This case is not about the health effects of smoking or secondhand smoke, it's about individual responsibility," said attorney Michael Carvin, who is representing Philip Morris USA Inc.
The trial is being closely watched by public health advocates and anti-tobacco groups, who say that a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs would send a strong message to the tobacco industry.
"This is a historic trial that could have far-reaching implications for public health," said Erika Sward, assistant vice president of national advocacy for the American Lung Association.
The trial is expected to continue for several weeks, with testimony from experts in public health, tobacco industry executives, and smoking victims. The outcome of the trial could have significant implications for the tobacco industry and for public health policy in the United States.
