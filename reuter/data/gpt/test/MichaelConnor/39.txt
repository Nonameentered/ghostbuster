Despite the potential settlement between major tobacco companies and state governments, anti-smoking lawsuits are continuing as litigators argue that the proposed settlement is not enough to cover the long-term health effects of smoking. 
The proposed settlement, which has been in the works for months, would require tobacco companies to pay billions of dollars to state governments to cover the cost of smoking-related medical expenses. The settlement would also impose new regulations on cigarette packaging and advertising. 
However, anti-smoking advocates say that the proposed settlement does not go far enough to hold tobacco companies accountable for the damage they have inflicted on public health. Some argue that the settlement does not provide enough money to cover the full scope of smoking-related illnesses and deaths. 
“Even if this settlement is approved, we will continue to pursue legal action against tobacco companies,” said Karen Wilson, a lawyer representing a group of anti-smoking activists. “We believe that tobacco companies have caused immense harm to the public, and we will not rest until they are held accountable.”
Wilson and other anti-smoking advocates believe that lawsuits are a more effective way to hold tobacco companies accountable than settlements, as settlements often provide only a fraction of the compensation that is deserved. They also argue that lawsuits have the potential to uncover new evidence of tobacco companies’ wrongdoing.
“Settlements are often negotiated behind closed doors, and the terms are typically confidential,” said Wilson. “Lawsuits provide an opportunity to bring tobacco companies’ actions into the light, and to hold them accountable publicly.”
Tobacco companies, meanwhile, are eager to put the anti-smoking lawsuits behind them. The industry has faced mounting legal challenges in recent years, as more and more states have pursued lawsuits against them. The lawsuits have been fueled by the public’s growing awareness of the health risks associated with smoking, as well as evidence that the tobacco industry actively covered up the dangers of smoking for decades.
The tobacco industry has already paid billions of dollars in settlements and fines, but legal challenges continue. Earlier this year, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Philip Morris International in a case that resulted in a $1.1 billion verdict against the company for misleading advertising. 
Other tobacco companies have faced similar legal challenges, including RJ Reynolds, which was hit with a $23.6 billion verdict in 2014 for concealing the dangers of smoking. The verdict was later reduced to $16.9 million, but the case remains an important precedent for anti-smoking advocates. 
Despite the ongoing legal challenges, some observers believe that the tide is turning against tobacco companies. Public sentiment has shifted dramatically against tobacco in recent years, as more and more people have become aware of the risks of smoking. 
“The tobacco industry is losing the battle for public opinion,” said Michael Siegel, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health. “As more people become aware of the dangers of smoking, they are less likely to support tobacco companies and more likely to support anti-smoking efforts.”
Siegel expects that anti-smoking lawsuits will continue to be a powerful tool for holding tobacco companies accountable for their actions. He believes that as more evidence of the tobacco industry’s deception comes to light, there will be a growing backlash against the industry.
“For decades, tobacco companies lied to the public about the dangers of smoking,” said Siegel. “But now, the truth is coming out. The more we learn about the tobacco industry’s actions, the more people will demand justice for the harm that has been done.” 
Whether anti-smoking lawsuits will ultimately succeed in holding tobacco companies accountable remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the battle over tobacco is far from over. As long as tobacco companies continue to profit from their harmful products, there will be those who seek to hold them accountable.
