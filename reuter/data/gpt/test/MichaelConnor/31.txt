Philip Morris International CEO, Andr√© Calantzopoulos, has expressed his willingness to implement reasonable measures to resolve the ongoing anti-tobacco lawsuits filed against the company in the United States. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, the CEO emphasized the need for a comprehensive and rational approach to address the complex issues surrounding smoking and health.
"We are open to reasonable proposals that would genuinely benefit public health, while also protecting the rights of adult smokers who choose to use our products," Calantzopoulos said. "We believe that an evidence-based approach is the best way forward, and we are committed to working with all stakeholders to find practical solutions to these challenges."
Philip Morris, one of the world's largest tobacco companies, has faced a barrage of lawsuits in the US in recent years. The plaintiffs allege that the company's cigarettes are responsible for causing cancer, lung disease, and other health problems, and that the industry has knowingly misled consumers about the risks of smoking.
While the tobacco industry has long denied these allegations, Calantzopoulos acknowledged that there is a growing need for meaningful action to address these concerns. He highlighted the company's investment in smoke-free products, such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco devices, as examples of its commitment to reducing the harm caused by smoking.
"We have a responsibility to provide smokers with choices that are less harmful than cigarettes, and we are dedicated to bringing innovative products to market that can help achieve that goal," he said.
However, Calantzopoulos acknowledged that there is still much to be done to convince regulators, public health officials, and the public at large about the benefits of these products. He said that the company is committed to working with all stakeholders to conduct rigorous scientific research on the potential health impacts of these products and to ensure that they are both safe and effective.
"We understand that there may be concerns about the potential risks associated with these products, and we are committed to addressing those concerns through rigorous research, testing, and verification," he said.
Despite the ongoing lawsuits, Philip Morris International has continued to post robust financial results, with the company reporting a net income of $7.9 billion in 2020. Calantzopoulos said that the company's success was due in part to its commitment to innovation and its focus on meeting the changing needs of consumers around the world.
"As a global company, we understand that the needs and preferences of consumers are constantly evolving, and we are committed to staying ahead of those trends," he said. "We will continue to explore new ways to meet the needs of adult smokers, while also promoting public health and sustainability."
While the fight against smoking-related illnesses and deaths is far from over, Calantzopoulos's remarks suggest that the tobacco industry may be open to working with public health advocates and policymakers to find a way forward. With the number of smokers worldwide expected to decline in the coming years, the industry may need to adapt to survive, and that could mean more investment in less harmful products and practices.
