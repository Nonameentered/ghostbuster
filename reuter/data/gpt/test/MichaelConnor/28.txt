General Electric CEO Defends $28.2 Million Salary in Face of Shareholder Criticism
John Flannery, the CEO of General Electric (GE) defended his $28.2 million salary at the company's annual meeting in April, following criticism from several shareholders. Flannery faced tough questioning from some who accused him and the company of being out of touch with average workers and for failing to deliver on its promises.
"I understand and appreciate the scrutiny regarding executive pay and am confident that our board had done its duty," Flannery said in a statement ahead of the meeting. "We take that responsibility very seriously, as we do the responsibility to lead GE through the many changes and challenges we face today."
Flannery has been at the helm of the industrial conglomerate since 2017, taking over from Jeff Immelt who resigned amid investor pressure. Since his appointment, Flannery has overseen a major cost-cutting program that has led to layoffs and the divestiture of some of GE's business units.
However, despite these changes, GE's stock has underperformed, with the share price falling over 50% in the past year alone. This has led to criticism of Flannery's leadership and his compensation package, which includes a $2.5 million base salary, a $4 million target annual bonus, and $8.5 million in performance-based stock awards.
The CEO defended his salary, saying that it was in line with industry standards and that he had delivered value for shareholders. "I know that for some of you here, it won't be enough. But I want to assure you that I am committed to continuing to deliver on our commitments and creating value for our shareholders," he said.
Some shareholders, however, were not convinced. "We need leaders that understand the value of every worker, every retiree, every customer, every community in which we operate," said a member of the company's retiree association.
Others raised concerns about the company's investment in fossil fuels and its impact on the environment, calling on Flannery to take action to address climate change. "Our dependence on fossil fuels is contributing to the destruction of our planet and the health of our communities," said a representative from an environmental group.
Despite these criticisms, Flannery was re-elected to the board of directors with 96% of the vote. Speaking after the meeting, the CEO said that he was committed to addressing the concerns raised by shareholders and working to improve the company's performance. "We understand that there are challenges ahead, but we are confident that we have the team and the strategy in place to succeed," he said.
