Anti-tobacco activists in Florida are preparing for a potential attack on a groundbreaking law that they say has led to a significant reduction in smoking rates among young people. The law, which was passed in 2019, raised the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products from 18 to 21, and also banned the sale of flavored e-cigarettes.
But now, with the legislative session in full swing, there are concerns that the law could be watered down or even repealed entirely. Proponents of the law say that tobacco industry lobbyists have been working hard behind the scenes to try and convince lawmakers to weaken the legislation.
"The tobacco industry is extremely powerful and they have a lot of money and resources at their disposal," said Rachel Grana Mayne, a senior scientific advisor at the anti-tobacco organization Truth Initiative. "They are very good at manipulating the system and pushing their agenda."
One of the key arguments being made by tobacco industry groups is that the law is having a negative impact on small businesses, particularly convenience stores and gas stations. According to the Florida Retail Federation, many of these businesses are struggling to stay afloat due to the decline in sales of tobacco products.
"We understand the need to address public health concerns, but we also have to take into account the impact on small business owners," said James Miller, a spokesperson for the Florida Retail Federation. "We believe there needs to be a more balanced approach that takes into account the needs of both public health advocates and small businesses."
But Grana Mayne says that this argument is based on flawed reasoning. "The truth is that many of these small businesses are already adapting and finding new ways to generate revenue," she said. "There are plenty of other products they can sell besides tobacco."
In addition to concerns about the impact on small businesses, tobacco industry lobbyists are also arguing that the law is having little effect on youth smoking rates. But according to data from the Florida Youth Tobacco Survey, the percentage of high school students who reported smoking cigarettes dropped from 7.5% in 2019 to 4.3% in 2020, and the percentage who reported using e-cigarettes fell from 27.4% to 19.9%.
"Those numbers speak for themselves," said Grana Mayne. "The data clearly shows that this law is having a positive impact."
Despite the concerns of anti-tobacco groups, some lawmakers appear to be sympathetic to the arguments being made by the tobacco industry. Last month, the Florida House of Representatives passed a bill that would prohibit local governments from banning the sale of certain tobacco products, such as flavored e-cigarettes.
"We believe that individual citizens and businesses should have the freedom to make their own choices," said state Representative Jenna Persons, who sponsored the bill. "We don't think the government should be dictating what products people can and cannot buy."
But anti-tobacco activists say that this is a misguided approach. "We're not talking about personal freedoms here," said Grana Mayne. "We're talking about a public health crisis that is especially harmful to our youth. We need to do everything we can to protect them from the harms of tobacco use."
The fate of Florida's anti-tobacco law remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the battle between public health advocates and the tobacco industry is far from over. As lawmakers continue to debate the issue, anti-tobacco groups will be watching closely and advocating for the preservation of the groundbreaking law that has helped to reduce smoking rates among young people in Florida.
