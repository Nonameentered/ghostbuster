"Our company's success is directly linked to our ability to meet the needs of our customers. With the increasing demand for automotive services, we are excited to be expanding our operations and creating more jobs across the country," said Press.
The announcement comes as Republic Industries prepares to release its annual financial report. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has been able to maintain strong financial performance, with revenues expected to exceed $12 billion for the year.
Moreover, Republic Industries has been investing heavily in technology aimed at improving customer experience and streamlining operations. These investments, coupled with the expansion plans, are expected to attract significant attention from investors and analysts.
