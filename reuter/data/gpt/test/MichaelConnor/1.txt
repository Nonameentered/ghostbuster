Washington, D.C. â€“ In a landmark class-action trial against cigarette makers, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy testified against the tobacco industry's deceptive marketing tactics and their impact on public health.
The trial, which began on Monday, brought together a group of smokers who claim they were misled by cigarette makers about the dangers of smoking. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for their addiction and related health problems.
Dr. Murthy, who served as Surgeon General from 2014 to 2017 under President Barack Obama, argued that the tobacco industry has long been aware of the harms of smoking, but chose to hide the truth from the public. He cited decades of research showing the link between smoking and lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and other illnesses.
"Big Tobacco has engaged in a campaign of deception and concealment that has led to countless deaths and illnesses," Dr. Murthy said in his testimony. "They deliberately targeted vulnerable populations like children, minorities, and low-income communities with their advertising and promotions."
Dr. Murthy also criticized cigarette makers for their marketing tactics, such as using celebrity endorsements, sponsoring sporting events, and giving away free samples. He argued that these techniques were designed to glamorize smoking and make it seem like a socially acceptable behavior.
The former Surgeon General's testimony echoed the findings of a 2006 federal court ruling that found tobacco companies guilty of racketeering and fraud for deceiving the public about the dangers of smoking. As part of that ruling, the companies were ordered to issue public statements admitting to their past misdeeds.
However, Dr. Murthy argued that cigarette makers have continued to mislead the public, particularly young people, by introducing new products like e-cigarettes and marketing them as safe alternatives to traditional cigarettes.
"These products may not have the same level of toxic chemicals as cigarettes, but they still contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and can harm developing brains," Dr. Murthy said. "We need to be honest with young people about the risks of these products and discourage them from using them."
The class-action trial, which is being heard in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks. The plaintiffs are seeking damages from major tobacco companies like Philip Morris USA, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and Lorillard Tobacco Company.
In response to Dr. Murthy's testimony, the tobacco companies argued that the plaintiffs should have known about the risks of smoking and that they were not misled by the industry's marketing tactics.
"We believe that people have the right to make informed decisions about their health and that the plaintiffs in this case were fully aware of the risks of smoking," said William Ohlemeyer, a lawyer for Philip Morris USA.
The tobacco companies also argued that they have taken steps to reduce smoking rates and promote public health, such as funding anti-smoking campaigns and supporting research into smoking-related diseases.
However, Dr. Murthy argued that these efforts were not enough and that the tobacco industry should be held accountable for its past actions.
"It's time for the cigarette makers to take responsibility for the harm they have caused and to make meaningful changes to protect public health," Dr. Murthy said. "We cannot let profits take priority over people's lives."
