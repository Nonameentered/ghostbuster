Sterling Software is set to complete its acquisition of Texas Instruments' software unit on June 14, in a move that is expected to boost the company's financials almost immediately by as much as $165 million. This acquisition will help Sterling Software broaden its product offerings in select markets, something it has been striving to achieve for some time.
The acquisition of Texas Instruments’ software unit was first announced in early March. The deal will see Sterling Software acquire the semiconductor manufacturer’s software business, including its technologies, patents, and talent pool. This move is intended to create a new product offering for Sterling Software, allowing it to complement its existing software portfolio and expand its reach into new markets.
Officials at Sterling Software say that closing the $165 million purchase of Texas Instruments' software unit will be a significant milestone for the company and its shareholders, as it will immediately contribute to 2021 earnings and cash flows. The acquisition of Texas Instruments' software unit also aligns with Sterling Software's broader growth strategy, which includes driving innovation and expanding its product portfolio to enhance value for customers and shareholders.
"This acquisition will help us to strengthen our technology capabilities and enhance the value we offer our customers," said John Mazzuto, CEO of Sterling Software. "We are excited about the opportunities that this acquisition creates for us, and we are confident that it will provide us with a strong platform for growth in the years ahead."
The deal represents a significant milestone for both companies, as it highlights Sterling Software's commitment to expanding its software product offerings and Texas Instrument’s strategic focus on moving towards their core semiconductor business. The acquisition also serves as a testament to Sterling Software's financial stability and growth potential, as the company has continued to see solid financial results in recent quarters.
Once the purchase is completed, Sterling Software will gain access to Texas Instruments' proprietary software technology, including advanced algorithms, software frameworks, and visualization tools. These technologies will allow Sterling Software to broaden its offerings in several markets, including the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Analytics.
The acquisition of Texas Instruments' software unit positions Sterling Software to be a major player in the software industry, as the company continues to develop innovative solutions and expand its offerings to meet the evolving needs of its customers. With this purchase, Sterling Software’s growth trajectory is set to accelerate, bringing new and exciting opportunities for the company’s customers, employees, and shareholders.
