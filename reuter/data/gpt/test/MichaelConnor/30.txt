Philip Morris International CEO Andr√© Calantzopoulos has stated that the company is open to "reasonable measures" to resolve anti-tobacco lawsuits. The announcement comes after several high-profile cases have been brought against the company by individuals, governments, and advocacy groups.
"We are committed to finding a solution that works for everyone," said Calantzopoulos in a recent interview. "We understand the concerns of those who have been harmed by tobacco use, and we are willing to work with them to find common ground."
Philip Morris has faced numerous lawsuits in recent years, including a $31 billion judgment handed down by a Canadian court in 2015. The ruling found the company guilty of concealing the health risks of smoking and failing to adequately warn consumers. Other cases have been filed in the United States, Europe, and Asia, with plaintiffs seeking damages for health problems caused by smoking as well as compensation for the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses.
Calantzopoulos acknowledged the damage that smoking has caused to public health and said that Philip Morris was "deeply sorry" for the harm caused by its products. He also stressed that the company had taken steps to reduce the risks associated with smoking, including developing and marketing smoke-free products such as heated tobacco and e-cigarettes.
"Science has advanced, and we have developed new technologies that are potentially less harmful than smoking," he said. "We believe that these products offer smokers a better option, and we are committed to making them available to those who want them."
However, critics of the company say that it has not done enough to address the negative effects of smoking, and that its marketing of new products is a cynical attempt to keep customers hooked on nicotine. They also point to the fact that Philip Morris is still heavily reliant on traditional cigarettes for its profits, and that its efforts to promote smoke-free products are a reaction to declining sales of tobacco.
"Philip Morris talks about innovation and harm reduction, but in reality it's just trying to preserve its profits and maintain its position in the market," said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "The company should be held accountable for the damage that it has done and continue to do to public health around the world."
Calantzopoulos said that he recognized the skepticism of some critics but insisted that Philip Morris was committed to "transforming" the tobacco industry. He suggested that a solution to the anti-tobacco lawsuits could involve a settlement or other compensatory measures, but did not provide details on what those measures might be.
"We are prepared to sit down with all stakeholders and work towards a resolution that is fair and reasonable," he said. "We believe that it is in everyone's interest to put this issue behind us and move towards a future where tobacco is no longer a major public health concern."
