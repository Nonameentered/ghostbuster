Cruise ship operators are gearing up to tailor their offerings to the unique needs of European and Asian markets in a bid to capitalize on growing demand in those regions.
According to industry analysts, such efforts could help drive growth in the years ahead and enable cruise operators to tap into new customer bases.
"Europe and Asia represent two of the most promising markets for the global cruise industry, and many companies are recognizing that they need to tailor their offerings in order to meet the unique needs and desires of consumers in those regions," said John Doe, a senior analyst at the consulting firm GlobalData.
Already, several major cruise operators have announced plans to expand their presence in Europe and Asia.
Carnival Corporation, for example, recently unveiled a new strategy to boost its capacity in the Chinese market, with plans to bring three additional ships to the region by 2020.
Meanwhile, Royal Caribbean is investing heavily in its new Quantum Class of ships, which are designed specifically for the Chinese market and feature a range of amenities aimed at Chinese consumers, such as casinos, karaoke rooms, and Asian-style dining options.
Other cruise operators, including Norwegian Cruise Line, MSC Cruises, and Costa Cruises, are also ramping up their efforts to cater to European and Asian consumers, with new ships and expanded itineraries planned for the coming years.
Experts say that such moves are crucial for the industry as it seeks to rebound from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused significant disruptions in the cruise market.
"COVID-19 has had a major impact on the global cruise industry, but many operators see the Asia and Europe markets as key to their long-term success," said Lisa Smith, an industry analyst at IBISWorld.
"Cruise ship operators need to adapt to changing consumer demand in order to remain competitive and thrive in a rapidly evolving market," she added.
To that end, operators are focusing on a range of strategies to cater to European and Asian consumers.
In Europe, for example, many cruise operators are investing in smaller, more intimate ships in order to offer a more personalized and authentic experience for travelers.
MSC Cruises, for example, recently launched its new MSC Seashore ship, which is designed to offer a more intimate experience for travelers with fewer passengers, more open spaces, and a range of new dining options.
"European travelers are increasingly seeking a more personalized, intimate travel experience, and our new ships are designed to cater to those needs," said Gianni Onorato, CEO of MSC Cruises.
Meanwhile, in the Asian market, cruise operators are making a range of adaptations to cater to the unique cultural preferences and spending habits of consumers in the region.
"Chinese consumers, for example, tend to spend more time on shipboard entertainment and less time on shore excursions," said John Doe of GlobalData. "Cruise operators are investing in new shipboard amenities – from casinos and karaoke rooms to cultural performances and cooking classes – in order to cater to those needs."
At the same time, some operators are also exploring new destination options in Asia, such as Japan and Vietnam, which offer a range of cultural and historical attractions for travelers in the region.
Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, cruise operators remain confident that continued investment in the European and Asian markets will pay off in the long run.
"Europe and Asia represent two of the most promising growth markets for the global cruise industry, and we believe that continued focus on those regions will be key to our long-term success," said Richard Fain, chairman and CEO of Royal Caribbean.
With a range of new ships, itineraries, and amenities in the works, the cruise industry is poised to capitalize on the growing demand for ocean travel in Europe and Asia – and take advantage of emerging opportunities in those regions for years to come.
