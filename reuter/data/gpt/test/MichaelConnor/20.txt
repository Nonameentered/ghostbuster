New York, NY - Top Citicorp executives testified before a grand jury on Tuesday regarding a possible money laundering scheme involving the brother of the Mexican president. The probe centers around whether Citicorp was complicit in the transfer of funds worth millions of dollars to companies controlled by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's brother, Pio Lopez Obrador. 
The grand jury probe follows a New York Times report in 2020, which detailed the emergence of video footage that allegedly showed Pio Lopez collecting cash from David Leon, a political operative who has worked for the presidentâ€™s party. The report suggested that the money was meant to be used to fund Mr. Lopez Obrador's 2018 presidential campaign.
Citicorp executives have been called upon to answer questions about their role in the money transfer. The bank previously acknowledged that it processed certain wire transfers involving companies tied to Mr. Lopez. However, the executives have denied any wrongdoing or knowing that the transfers were intended to fund the president's campaign.
The bank stated it has fully cooperated with the investigation and has highlighted its efforts to prevent and combat financial crimes such as money laundering. In a statement, Citicorp expressed its commitment to upholding strong global standards for anti-money laundering measures. 
The investigation has provoked strong reactions from both sides of the border. Mexican officials criticized the investigation, calling it an attempt to interfere in the country's political affairs. Meanwhile, American lawmakers welcomed the development, with some calling for additional scrutiny of Citicorp's role in the alleged scheme.
This is not the first time Citicorp has found itself in the crosshairs of regulators over money laundering and compliance issues. In 2012, the bank paid $360 million in fines for facilitating dodgy transactions that violated US sanctions against Iran. More recently, in 2018, Citicorp was hit with a $100 million fine for failing to correct deficiencies in its anti-money laundering compliance program.
The Citicorp investigation adds to the recent scrutiny faced by the Mexican president's family. Mr. Lopez Obrador has worked to distance himself from any allegations of wrongdoing involving his brother. However, the developments raise questions about his administration's ability to maintain its anti-corruption agenda. 
The investigation marks a significant blow to Citicorp's reputation, which is likely to undergo harsh scrutiny for possible involvement in international money laundering in the coming days and weeks.
