Philip Morris International has announced that it will not disclose any information on its ongoing settlement talks at the upcoming Annual Shareholder Meeting. The tobacco giant is facing numerous lawsuits alleging that its products caused serious health issues. The company has previously indicated its willingness to negotiate a settlement, but their lawyers have warned that disclosing details of negotiations could undermine the process. This decision has disappointed many activists who argue that shareholders have the right to know how the company plans to address the significant legal risks it faces. The Annual Shareholder Meeting is set to take place at the end of the month.
