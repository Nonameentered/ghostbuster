General Electric CEO, Larry Culp, has come under fire from shareholders for his $28.2 million pay package. However, the CEO has defended his compensation, stating that it reflects the company's strong financial growth.
In the 2021 annual meeting held virtually on May 4, shareholders questioned Culp's $28.2 million compensation package, which is a hefty increase from his 2019 pay of $10.4 million. Critics pointed out that Culp's compensation is not proportional to the company's lackluster stock performance since he assumed the role in October 2018.
Despite the company's financial struggles in the past year, Culp defended the compensation saying it was tied to the company's performance and that the package was approved by an independent board of directors. He pointed out that the company's stock price had gone up by more than 100% since he took over the leadership of the company.
Moreover, Culp's pay package was not only based on his performance but also saving the company from bankruptcy. In 2019, Culp made drastic cost-cutting moves that included selling off GE's assets such as GE Capital and its bio-pharmaceutical unit. These measures proved to be successful, which allowed the company to pay off billions of dollars in debt and stabilized their finances.
In response to the growing concern of shareholder criticism, Larry Culp stated that he understood where shareholders were coming from, given the company's sluggish performance in recent years. However, he also explained that the company managed to reach a significant milestone in 2020, with free cash flow of $4.4 billion, which was a significant jump from the previous year's free cash flow loss of $2.15 billion.
Larry Culp also emphasized that his compensation was in line with industry standards and comparable to other corporate leaders. He added that his compensation was also determined by factors, such as bonuses for meeting targets, long-term incentives based on performance, equity increases, and other factors.
Despite Culp's defense, some of the company's shareholders remain dissatisfied with his compensation. Several proxy advisory firms, such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, recommended that shareholders vote against the executive compensation package, citing concerns about arbitrary performance criteria.
Regardless of the backlash, Culp appears to remain committed to maintaining the company's financial growth. With his leadership, GE aims to focus on its core businesses and invest in high-growth sectors such as renewable energy, hydrogen, and electric aviation. These steps may prove to be successful for shareholders in the long term.
