General Electric (GE) CEO, Jack Welch, has defended his 1996 salary, bonuses, and incentives, amounting to $28.2 million. Welch, who is one of the most successful executives in history, said that he deserved every penny that he earned that year and that his compensation was justified.
Welch’s comments came after he was criticized for his 1996 pay, which was 564 times the salary of the average GE worker. Critics argued that such a high salary was unfair and that it showed the growing income inequality in America.
However, Welch said that his pay was not just a reflection of his own success, but also of the success of the company. He pointed out that during his tenure at GE, the company’s earnings increased more than tenfold, and its market value grew from $14 billion to $410 billion.
“I’m proud of what we accomplished at GE,” Welch said. “We transformed the company into a global powerhouse and delivered tremendous value to our shareholders. And I believe that my compensation was commensurate with that achievement.”
Welch also defended the bonuses and incentives that he received, saying that they were an important part of the company’s compensation philosophy. He said that GE had a culture of rewarding high performance and that he was not the only one who received large bonuses.
“Bonuses are a way of motivating and rewarding employees,” Welch said. “And they’re not just for the CEO. We had a performance-based compensation system at GE that applied to all employees, from the shop floor to the boardroom.”
Welch’s comments are likely to be controversial, given the current debate over income inequality in America. Many people feel that the gap between the rich and the poor has grown too large, and that executive compensation is a major factor in this trend.
However, Welch’s defenders argue that his pay was justified based on his performance and the value he delivered to shareholders. They say that executives who create value and grow companies should be rewarded accordingly, and that the free market should be allowed to determine their compensation.
In any case, the debate over executive compensation is likely to continue. As long as there are executives like Welch who earn millions of dollars per year, there will be people who question the fairness of the system and call for change.
