Knight-Ridder Inc, a leading American newspaper publisher, has announced it is acquiring four newspapers from Disney in a whopping deal worth $1.65 billion. The transaction will give Knight-Ridder control of the Anaheim Bulletin, San Bernardino Sun, Riverside Press-Enterprise, and Los Angeles Daily News. The acquisition is part of Knight-Ridder's strategy to expand its operations in Southern California.
In a statement released by Knight-Ridder, the company's CEO, Tony Ridder, said, "We are pleased to add these high-quality newspapers to our portfolio. They are an excellent fit for our existing publications in the region and will provide significant opportunities for synergies."
In addition to the acquisition, Knight-Ridder has also announced that it is putting another electronic unit up for sale. The unit in question is Media General Interactive, which provides online advertising, marketing, and website development services for newspapers and other media organizations. The move is part of the company's strategy to narrow its focus on its core business of publishing newspapers.
"We are confident that our decision to sell Media General Interactive and to focus on our core newspaper business will benefit our shareholders and strengthen our operations," said Ridder.
Knight-Ridder has been actively expanding its newspaper business in recent years, even as the industry has faced challenges from declining readership and advertising revenue. The company has been investing in digital media technologies to stay competitive and has also been acquiring newspapers in key markets.
The acquisition of the four newspapers from Disney will give Knight-Ridder a stronger presence in Southern California, where it already owns the San Jose Mercury News, the Contra Costa Times, and the Oakland Tribune. The company says it expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2006, pending regulatory approval.
The sale of Media General Interactive is also expected to generate significant proceeds for Knight-Ridder. The company has not disclosed the price it is seeking for the unit, but given the strong demand for digital media services, the sale is likely to be lucrative. Knight-Ridder says it will use the proceeds from the sale to invest in its core newspaper business and to pursue other strategic opportunities. 
Overall, the acquisition and sale are both major moves for Knight-Ridder, as the company continues to position itself for growth in a rapidly changing media landscape.
