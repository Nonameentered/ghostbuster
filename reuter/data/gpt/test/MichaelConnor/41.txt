MIAMI- A landmark class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry is set to go to trial today in a Florida courtroom, as a group of flight attendants sue major tobacco companies for their role in causing nicotine addiction and related health problems as they worked in a smoke-filled environment.
The lawsuit, filed in 1997, is the first of its kind and represents a major moment in the ongoing struggle against tobacco companies. The plaintiffs include 5,000 flight attendants who worked for major airlines such as American Airlines, Delta, and United in the 70s and 80s. They argue that the tobacco industry knowingly concealed the addictive and harmful nature of their products, thereby causing them to suffer premature aging, debilitating cancers, and other health conditions. The plaintiffs seek monetary damages and acknowledgment from the tobacco industry that their products are unsafe and addictive.
Among the plaintiffs is flight attendant Susan Reigler, 64, who began working for Eastern Airlines in 1971 and has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma and other cancers she says were caused by secondhand smoke exposure on the job.
"For years, the airlines allowed people to smoke freely on planes. It didn't matter if it meant that we had to put up with it," Reigler said, choking back tears at a pre-trial hearing last week. "We didn't know any better at that time. We thought it was normal."
The case, which could take months or even years to resolve, is expected to turn on a pair of crucial questions: whether the tobacco companies concealed the harmful nature of their products and whether the plaintiffs' exposure to secondhand smoke was significant enough to cause their illnesses.
The tobacco industry has fought back vigorously, arguing that the flight attendants were well aware of the risks associated with smoking, both firsthand and secondhand, and that the companies could not have been expected to foresee their illnesses.
"Everyone knew smoking was harmful," said Philip Morris' attorney, David Bernstein, in court last week. "Why should we be held responsible for something people are fully aware of?"
The airlines, which are not named as defendants in the suit, have also pushed back, arguing that they acted within the limits of the law at the time and that the flight attendants' exposure to secondhand smoke was relatively limited.
"This lawsuit is frivolous and without merit," said American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller in a statement.
The case has attracted widespread attention both for its potential implications on the tobacco industry and for the personal stories of the plaintiffs involved. It also comes at a time when smoking rates have fallen dramatically in the United States, from over 40 percent in the 1960s to less than 15 percent today.
The trial is expected to be one of the longest and most complex in U.S. history, with over 10 million pages of documents and dozens of witnesses expected to take the stand.
For the plaintiffs, it offers a chance to hold the tobacco industry accountable for their alleged role in causing widespread illness and suffering, and to demand that they take responsibility for the harm they have caused.
"For years, the tobacco industry has claimed that they didn't know their products were harmful, but the truth is they knew all along," said Elizabeth Cabraser, the plaintiffs' lead attorney. "This lawsuit is about holding them accountable for their actions."
