Florida courts have seen an upsurge in tobacco lawsuits filed by plaintiffs who have been inspired by John Grisham's novel "Runaway Jury." The book, which was turned into a popular movie in 2003, tells the story of a juror who manipulates his colleagues in a high-stakes tobacco lawsuit.
The novel is still relevant today, as cigarette companies face mounting lawsuits from customers who allege that smoking caused their health problems. In Florida alone, tobacco firms are being sued by thousands of plaintiffs who argue that the companies knew smoking was harmful but hid the evidence to keep selling their products.
Many of these cases bear striking similarities to the events in Grisham's book. Lawyers on both sides are using the tactics portrayed in "Runaway Jury" to try and sway the jury to their side. Some plaintiffs' attorneys are even using the book as a playbook for their own cases.
Matt Frazier, a lawyer representing a former smoker in one of the lawsuits against cigarette companies, said that he watched the "Runaway Jury" movie right before jury selection to get a sense of how to pick the right people for his case. "It's a great resource for picking jurors," he said. "It shows you how to pick people who are willing to stand up to big corporations."
But cigarette companies are fighting back. They argue that the book and movie are fiction and paint a false picture of how the legal system works. They also point out that the tobacco industry has changed since the events depicted in the book took place.
Still, the popularity of "Runaway Jury" is hard to ignore. The book has sold over 9 million copies since it was first released in 1996, and the movie grossed over $80 million at the box office. Grisham himself has talked about the impact his book has had on the legal system.
"I think it's fair to say that lawyers and judges have read my novels, and I hope that some of what I've written about the legal system has contributed to a better understanding of it," Grisham said in an interview.
Whether or not "Runaway Jury" has influenced the outcome of any of these lawsuits remains to be seen. But for many lawyers and plaintiffs in Florida, the book has become a symbol of hope and inspiration in their fight against the tobacco industry.
As the lawsuits continue to play out in courtrooms across the state, it's clear that the legacy of "Runaway Jury" will continue to loom large over the legal system. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing depends on who you ask.
