The Liggett Group's recent settlement with state attorneys general may not have as great an impact on the tobacco industry in the South as it will in other parts of the country. Liggett, one of the smallest tobacco companies in the U.S., has agreed to pay $1 billion to settle lawsuits over its marketing practices, which were alleged to have targeted minors.
The settlement is part of a broader effort by states to hold tobacco companies accountable for the impacts of smoking on public health. Even though Liggett is not one of the major players in the tobacco industry, the settlement could have far-reaching implications for the industry as a whole.
However, the South has long been a stronghold of the tobacco industry, and it remains unclear how much impact the Liggett settlement will actually have on tobacco use in the region. For starters, many of the states where Liggett focused its marketing efforts are in the Northeast, not the South.
Moreover, while other tobacco companies may be affected by the settlement, there is little evidence to suggest that they will change their own practices as a result. The South is home to some of the largest tobacco companies in the country, including RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris, and these companies have so far shown little interest in changing their marketing practices.
In fact, tobacco use in the South has remained relatively constant over the years, despite efforts by public health officials to encourage people to quit smoking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly a quarter of adults in the South smoke, compared to just under 15% in the rest of the country.
Some public health officials believe that the Liggett settlement could still have an impact on tobacco use in the South, particularly if it leads to other states enacting similar regulations. "It's still too soon to say how this will play out," said Dr. Karen DeSalvo, former Acting Assistant Secretary for Health in the Obama administration. "But anything that raises awareness of the harmful effects of smoking is a step in the right direction."
Others are more skeptical, however. "The tobacco industry is deeply entrenched in the South, both culturally and economically," said Dr. David Michaels, a former assistant secretary of labor under President Obama. "It's going to take a lot more than a settlement with one small player to change that."
What is clear is that the Liggett settlement is just one piece of a much larger puzzle when it comes to reducing tobacco use in the U.S. While the agreement may serve as an important precedent for future lawsuits against tobacco companies, it will take much more than legal action to make a real dent in the nation's smoking rates. Public health officials will need to continue to work closely with communities and individuals across the country to raise awareness of the dangers of tobacco use and help smokers quit.
