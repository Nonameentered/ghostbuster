Florida anti-tobacco activists are facing a legislative assault on a decades-old law that allows individuals and organizations to sue tobacco companies for damages caused by smoking. The law, known as the "Engle Progeny" law, has been the backbone of many successful lawsuits against tobacco companies and has resulted in billions of dollars in damages awarded to victims and their families.
The assault on the Engle Progeny law is being led by lawmakers who have received significant contributions from the tobacco industry. These lawmakers argue that the law is being abused by trial lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits against tobacco companies in order to make money for themselves.
Opponents of the legislative efforts to weaken the Engle Progeny law argue that the tobacco industry is trying to avoid paying for the harm caused by their products. They argue that the Engle Progeny law is a critical tool for holding tobacco companies accountable for the harm caused by their products and that weakening the law would be a major setback for public health in Florida.
According to the American Lung Association, smoking-related illnesses are responsible for more than 28,000 deaths in Florida each year. The Engle Progeny law provides a pathway for victims and their families to seek justice and compensation for damages caused by smoking-related illnesses.
The legislative efforts to weaken the Engle Progeny law are part of a broader effort by the tobacco industry to push back against anti-smoking measures in Florida. In recent years, the tobacco industry has been increasingly targeting youth with flavored e-cigarettes and other products in an effort to keep them hooked on nicotine.
Anti-tobacco activists are calling on lawmakers to reject the efforts to weaken the Engle Progeny law and to stand up to the tobacco industry. They argue that weakening the law will only embolden the tobacco industry and put more Floridians at risk for smoking-related illnesses and death.
"We cannot allow the tobacco industry to bully our lawmakers into weakening the Engle Progeny law," said John Schachter, senior director of state communications for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "We need to stand up to the tobacco industry and protect the rights of victims and their families to seek justice and hold tobacco companies accountable for the harm caused by their products."
The legislative assault on the Engle Progeny law comes at a critical time for public health in Florida. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of strong public health measures, including efforts to reduce smoking and other harmful behaviors.
Despite these challenges, anti-tobacco activists remain optimistic that they can defend the Engle Progeny law and protect Floridians from the harm caused by smoking. They argue that the law has been a critical tool for promoting public health in Florida and that weakening it would be a major setback for public health and for the rights of victims and their families.
"We are going to keep fighting to protect the Engle Progeny law and to ensure that the tobacco industry is held accountable for the harm caused by their products," said Schachter. "We will not be deterred by the efforts of the tobacco industry and their allies in the legislature. We will stand up for the health and well-being of all Floridians."
