North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein has expressed doubts about the usefulness of the documents promised by Liggett Group in tobacco lawsuits. Stein has raised concerns that the documents may lack credibility and usability, making it difficult to prosecute claims against tobacco companies.
The Liggett Group, the fifth-largest tobacco company in the United States, made the promise as part of a settlement agreement with North Carolina and other states in 1998, which allowed them to cap their liability exposure. Liggett agreed to provide documents to the states that would help in litigation against other tobacco companies.
However, Stein has questioned the value of the documents, citing a report by the National Association of Attorneys General that suggested Liggett's documents lacked credibility and could not be used as evidence in court.
"This report confirms what we have long suspected â€“ that Liggett's documents are of limited value to us in our pursuit of justice for North Carolina," Stein said in a statement. "We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to hold the tobacco industry accountable for the harm they have caused our state's communities."
The report found that Liggett's documents contained many errors, including inaccurate dates, names, and locations, which could render them useless in litigation. Additionally, the report highlighted concerns about the authenticity of the documents, noting that many of them were photocopies of originals with no clear chain of custody.
Despite these concerns, Liggett maintains that their documents are valuable and have been used in successful lawsuits against the tobacco industry. The company has said that it stands by the accuracy and authenticity of the documents and will continue to cooperate with the states in tobacco litigation.
In conclusion, the North Carolina Attorney General's questioning of the usefulness of Liggett Group's promised documents for tobacco lawsuits has raised concerns about the credibility and authenticity of the documents. It remains to be seen what impact these concerns will have on ongoing litigation against the tobacco industry in North Carolina and other states across the United States.
