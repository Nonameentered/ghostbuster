AutoNation, the largest automotive retailer in the United States, is facing lawsuits from Toyota and Honda over its recent dealership acquisitions.
Toyota and Honda have filed separate lawsuits against AutoNation, alleging that the company breached franchise agreements by acquiring dealerships in their networks without their approval.
In the lawsuit filed by Toyota, the carmaker alleges that AutoNation acquired a dealership in Orange County, California, that was authorized to sell Toyota vehicles without obtaining the necessary approval from Toyota. According to the lawsuit, AutoNation has also acquired another dealership in Poway, California, that was authorized to sell Lexus vehicles without obtaining the necessary approval from Toyota.
Similarly, in the lawsuit filed by Honda, the carmaker alleges that AutoNation acquired a dealership in Santa Clara, California, that was authorized to sell Honda vehicles without obtaining the necessary approval from Honda.
Both Toyota and Honda claim that AutoNation's acquisition of the dealerships is a violation of their franchise agreements, which require that any change in ownership or control of a dealership must have the prior written approval of the carmaker.
In a statement, Toyota said: "Toyota has a long-standing and well-established network of exceptional dealers, who are essential to providing our customers with a great experience. We take our relationship with our dealers seriously, and we expect them to operate within the terms of their franchise agreements."
Honda also issued a statement, saying: "Honda is committed to maintaining and enhancing the value of its dealership network. We have a responsibility to our dealers and their customers to ensure that our franchise agreements are respected and upheld."
AutoNation, for its part, has denied the allegations made by Toyota and Honda. In a statement, the company said: "AutoNation is a publicly traded company and we take our obligations under our manufacturer agreements very seriously. We believe these allegations are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them."
The lawsuits come at a time of heightened tension between carmakers and their dealerships, as the traditional business model of selling cars through franchised dealerships comes under pressure from new technologies and changing consumer preferences.
AutoNation, which operates more than 300 dealerships in the U.S., has been expanding its reach through a series of acquisitions in recent years, as it seeks to position itself as a dominant player in the rapidly changing automotive industry.
The outcome of the lawsuits could have significant implications for AutoNation, as well as for other automotive retailers and carmakers, as they navigate the changing landscape of the industry.
