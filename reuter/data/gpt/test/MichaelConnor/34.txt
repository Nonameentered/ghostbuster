Philip Morris International, the tobacco giant behind the Marlboro brand, has rejected a shareholder proposal that aimed to limit the company's marketing efforts to young people abroad. The proposal, put forward by the American Federation of Teachers' pension fund, called for Philip Morris to issue a report detailing its efforts to reduce smoking among young people under the age of 18 in countries where the tobacco industry is less regulated.
The proposal stated that Philip Morris has a responsibility to prevent children from "developing an addiction that will kill them." However, Philip Morris argued that its marketing efforts overseas are aimed at adult smokers and comply with all relevant regulations.
"We reject the insinuation that we are marketing to youth," said Jacek Olczak, chief executive officer of Philip Morris International. "We are a responsible company that prioritizes the safety and welfare of people above all else."
Olczak also defended the company's use of the Marlboro Man, the iconic cowboy featured in its advertising campaigns since the 1950s. Critics have long argued that the Marlboro Man's association with rugged masculinity and adventure has targeted young men, who are more likely to take up smoking.
"The Marlboro Man is a symbol of freedom and individuality, not youth or irresponsibility," said Olczak. "He has been an important part of our brand's identity for decades and we remain committed to him."
The decision to reject the shareholder proposal has drawn criticism from anti-smoking advocates, who argue that Philip Morris has a moral obligation to reduce smoking rates among young people worldwide.
"Philip Morris is, once again, prioritizing profits over people," said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "It's time for the company to take responsibility for the harm caused by its products and stop targeting vulnerable populations."
According to the World Health Organization, tobacco use kills more than 8 million people each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in developing countries. Young people are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking, which increases their risk of cancer, heart disease, and other health problems.
Despite increased regulation and awareness campaigns, tobacco use among young people remains a serious public health challenge. It remains to be seen whether Philip Morris will reconsider its marketing strategies and take more proactive steps to reduce smoking rates among young people globally.
