A Florida judge has denied the request of tobacco companies to delay the trial of a class-action lawsuit filed by flight attendants seeking compensation for health issues allegedly caused by exposure to secondhand smoke during flights.
The lawsuit, which was filed in 1991, accuses major tobacco companies, including Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and others, of knowingly and willfully concealing the harms of secondhand smoke. The plaintiffs allege that as a result of their exposure to secondhand smoke during flights, they suffered a range of adverse health effects, including respiratory illness, cancer, and other serious conditions.
The case has been in litigation for nearly three decades, with the tobacco companies making numerous attempts to delay or dismiss the lawsuit. In their latest request, the companies argued that they needed more time to review the claims of the plaintiffs and requested a delay of up to six months.
However, U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro rejected the tobacco companies' request, stating that the defendants had already been given ample time to prepare for the case and that further delays would not be in the best interests of justice.
"This case has been pending for almost 30 years, and the plaintiffs have waited long enough for their day in court," Judge Ungaro said. "The defendants have had ample time to prepare for this trial, and I see no reason why the proceedings should be further delayed."
The trial is set to begin on July 19 in Miami and is expected to last several months. The plaintiffs are seeking compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages, which could amount to billions of dollars.
In a statement, the plaintiffs' attorneys praised the judge's decision and reiterated their commitment to holding the tobacco companies accountable for their actions.
"We are grateful that Judge Ungaro has denied the request of the tobacco companies to delay this trial," the attorneys said. "We look forward to presenting our case to the jury and seeking justice for our clients, who have suffered for far too long as a result of the defendants' reckless conduct."
The tobacco companies have not yet issued a statement in response to the judge's decision. However, they are likely to appeal the ruling, which could further delay the trial.
The flight attendants' class-action lawsuit is one of the largest and longest-running legal battles in U.S. history, and its outcome could have significant implications for public health and tobacco regulation.
