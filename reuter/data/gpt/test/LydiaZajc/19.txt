Ottawa, Canada – Corel Corporation CEO, Patrick Nichols, has announced that the company is set to take more market share from Microsoft following a series of new deals aimed at boosting the company’s revenue and expanding its product base. Corel, which is known for its graphic design software, has recently extended its product portfolio to include video and collaboration tools, posing a direct threat to Microsoft.
In an interview with Reuters, Nichols revealed that Corel's move to offer a broad range of products puts the company in a unique position to compete with Microsoft. "We have always been in competition with Microsoft," he said. "Now, with our extended product offerings, we are better positioned to take market share away from them."
Nichols added that the company's recent partnerships with Lenovo and Hewlett Packard will help the company reach new customers and increase its revenue. "We are excited about these partnerships and believe that they will help us to expand our customer base and drive sales," he said.
Corel's recent acquisition of Parallels, a virtualization tool, has also positioned the company as a serious competitor to Microsoft's Windows operating system. Parallels allows users to run operating systems such as Windows on Apple's MacOS platform. This puts Corel in a unique position to offer an alternative to Microsoft's dominance in the operating system market.
Nichols also addressed concerns over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the company's business. He acknowledged that the pandemic has caused disruptions in the market but expressed optimism about the company's ability to navigate the challenges. "We have adapted to the changes brought about by the pandemic, and we are confident that we will continue to grow and succeed," he said.
With the new partnerships and acquisition, Corel is poised to challenge Microsoft and take a significant share of the market. The company is confident that its broad range of products will be attractive to customers, and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances will help it to maintain its competitive edge.
