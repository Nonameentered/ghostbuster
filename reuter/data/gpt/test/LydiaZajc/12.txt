Internet service provider iStar Internet Inc. has predicted a reduced loss in the third quarter of this year, according to a statement from the company's CEO, John David. The company had earlier recorded a revenue loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but David said they have put in place measures to limit the impact of the pandemic.
According to the CEO, the pandemic caused a significant decline in subscriber numbers, which resulted in a loss of revenue. However, the company has been able to attract new subscribers in recent months, and they are confident that they will make up for the decline in revenue in the third quarter.
David also said that the company has been able to cut costs significantly in the past few months, which has helped to reduce the loss they would have incurred. He also announced that the company would reduce its marketing and advertising expenses for the remainder of the year.
"We are confident that we will see a significant reduction in our loss in the third quarter, and we expect to do even better in the fourth quarter," David said.
The CEO also stated that iStar Internet Inc. has plans to introduce new products and services in the coming months, which they believe will help attract new subscribers and boost revenue.
"We are constantly assessing the needs of our customers and what they want from an internet service provider. We have new products and services that we plan to introduce in the next few months, which we believe will be well-received by our customers," David said.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the economy, David believes that it has also created opportunities for companies like iStar Internet Inc.
"The pandemic has forced companies to rethink the way they do business. The internet has become even more essential, and as an internet service provider, we have a pivotal role to play in ensuring that people can remain connected in these challenging times," he added.
Looking forward, David said that iStar Internet Inc. is well-positioned to emerge stronger from the pandemic. He also said that the company is committed to providing superior service to its customers and expanding its reach across the country.
"We are optimistic about the future of iStar Internet Inc. We have ambitious plans for growth, and we will continue to work hard to provide our customers with the best internet service possible," David concluded.
In conclusion, iStar Internet Inc. appears to be on track to reduce its Q3 loss, thanks to cost-cutting measures and the introduction of new products and services. With the CEO's optimism, it seems like the company is well-positioned to withstand the challenges of the pandemic and emerge stronger in the coming months.
