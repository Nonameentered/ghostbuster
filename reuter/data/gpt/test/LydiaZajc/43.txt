Toronto's Stock Index Ends Flat Despite Wall Street Rally and Currency Concerns
Toronto's main stock index struggled to gain positive momentum on Thursday, as the market ended the day almost unchanged despite an early rally triggered by positive news on Wall Street. The index closed at 20,033.34, up just 0.2 percent from the previous day's close. This left investors wondering what could be holding the Canada's biggest stock market down, amid optimism in the US about the speedy economic recovery and upbeat earnings expectations for the coming months.
The main reason for the underperformance was the Canadian currency, which fell sharply against the US dollar during the day, as investors were concerned about the impact of the ongoing pandemic and the state of the global economy. The loonie lost 0.84 cents, closing at US78.50 cents, amid expectations of higher oil prices and weaker demand.
Despite this, the Toronto stock market opened higher in the morning session, following several upbeat earnings reports from the major US banks, such as Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. These results showed a positive trend in their trading and investment banking businesses, thanks to the continued solid digital revenues and the rebounding global economy.
However, this rally in US earnings failed to impress the Canadian market, as several key sectors such as energy, utilities and materials underperformed, while the tech sector was also under pressure. In addition, the Canadian bond market remained almost unchanged, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond up just two basis points at 1.628%.
Analysts said that the flattening of the Canadian equity market was above all a reflection of a cautious mood among investors, who felt that the risks in the current economic landscape were more significant than any potential gains. Moreover, there were concerns about the upcoming earnings results from Canadian companies, which are expected to be weaker than the US counterparts due to the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions in Canada.
Overall, the Toronto stock market ended the week on a flat note, reflecting the mixed feelings of the investors which were withstanding the currency concerns and Wall Street rally. However, despite the apprehension, the market looks forward to the coming weeks and remains hopeful for the Canadian economy's successful bounce-back.
