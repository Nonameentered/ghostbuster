Toronto stocks fell on Wednesday, May 12, 2021, despite a rally in gold issues. The S&P/TSX Composite Index closed down 85.01 points, or 0.44%, to 19,145.42.
Gold mining stocks saw a surge in the market, with the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index rising by 3.3%. This is due to the increase in the value of gold, which rose by 0.7% to reach its highest level in three months. 
However, this rally was not enough to offset losses in other sectors. The energy sector saw a decline of 1.6%, while the technology and financial sectors also fell by 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively.
One of the factors that contributed to the decline was the rise in inflation concerns. Investors feared that rising inflation would lead to higher interest rates, which could negatively impact the stock market. This was reflected in the 10-year Canadian government bond yield, which rose to 1.554% on Wednesday.
There were also concerns around the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy. Despite the rollout of vaccines, some countries are experiencing a third wave of infections, which could lead to further lockdowns and restrictions.
The Canadian dollar also fell on Wednesday. The loonie was trading at 81.49 US cents, down from 81.70 US cents on Tuesday.
Some stocks managed to buck the trend and trade in the green. Companies such as Shopify Inc. and Enbridge Inc. saw gains of 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.
Overall, the market was relatively quiet, with a total of 330.8 million shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. This is lower than the six-month average of 351.9 million shares.
Investors will continue to monitor the market closely in the coming days as they assess the impact of inflation concerns and the ongoing pandemic on the economy.
