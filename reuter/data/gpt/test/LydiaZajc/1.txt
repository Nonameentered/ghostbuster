Gendis Inc., a Canadian retail company, recently announced that it is expected to report "extensive" losses after the bankruptcy of its subsidiary, Greenberg Stores Ltd.
Greenberg Stores Ltd. was a discount department store chain that had been struggling financially for some time. Gendis Inc. attempted to turn the business around by closing underperforming stores and reducing costs, but ultimately, the subsidiary was unable to recover.
The bankruptcy of Greenberg Stores Ltd. is expected to have a significant impact on Gendis Inc.'s financial results for the year. The extent of the losses has not yet been disclosed, but it is anticipated to be a substantial amount.
Gendis Inc. is currently reviewing its options for the future of the business, including potential restructuring and the sale of assets. The company is also exploring opportunities to improve its financial performance and restore shareholder value.
In a statement, Gendis Inc. expressed disappointment over the bankruptcy of Greenberg Stores Ltd. but emphasized that it remains committed to its other retail operations, including its franchised Dollar Giant stores.
"We are disappointed by the outcome of Greenberg Stores Ltd.," said Gendis Inc. CEO, Lewis Rose. "However, we remain committed to our retail operations and are exploring all options to improve the financial performance of our business."
The bankruptcy of Greenberg Stores Ltd. is just the latest blow to the struggling Canadian retail industry, which has been hit hard by factors such as competition from online retailers, changing consumer preferences, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
