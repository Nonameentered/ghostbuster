Toronto Stocks Rise One Percent, Trailing New York's Stronger Rally on Easing Rate Hike Fears
Toronto stocks rose one percent on Tuesday, following a stronger rally in New York as the market eased fears of an interest rate hike. The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index closed at 20,905.84, up by 203.54 points or 0.98 per cent, which was still short of the 1.7 per cent surge on the Nasdaq and a 1.4 per cent increase on the S&P 500.
North of the border, the financial and energy sectors led gains, with the Bank of Montreal up 1.6 per cent, the Royal Bank of Canada up 1.5 per cent and Enbridge Inc. up 2.1 per cent. However, the tech sector saw losses, with Shopify and Lightspeed POS both losing more than four per cent.
According to analysts, the market was responding to comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said that there was still "some ground to cover" before the central bank could start raising interest rates. This eased concerns that the Fed would move to raise rates earlier than expected as the economy recovers from the pandemic.
The easing of rate hike fears also contributed to a surge in bond and gold prices, which had sold off on concerns about inflation. Gold hit its highest level since mid-June, while the yield on 10-year Treasuries fell to 1.44 per cent.
While Toronto's gains may have trailed those of New York, the market still reflected a positive day for investors and the broader economy. With the rollout of vaccines continuing and businesses reopening, there is growing optimism that the worst of the pandemic is behind us.
Moving forward, the market will continue to be sensitive to developments on the pandemic and the economy, as well as to changes in interest rate policy. But for now, investors are celebrating a day of gains and looking forward to the future.
