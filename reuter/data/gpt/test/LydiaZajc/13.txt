Toronto stocks plummeted on Tuesday following remarks made by former Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, about the sustainability of the current economic growth spurt. The TSX index fell by 2.5%, or 365 points, to close at 14,271, as investors expressed concerns that the ongoing robust growth could come to an end.
In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Greenspan warned that the current economic expansionary phase cannot continue indefinitely and predicted that there could be a recession in the near future. He said, "I think we're seeing widespread signs of a dangerous bubble in the economy and in the stock market."
The comments sparked a sell-off of shares across the Canadian market, with sectors including financials, energy, and materials experiencing the biggest losses. Several blue-chip companies such as Royal Bank, Suncor Energy, and Barrick Gold saw their share prices fall by more than 3%.
The market had been on a bullish trend in recent months, buoyed by a strong Canadian economy, rising oil prices, and improved investor confidence. As a result, some analysts believe that the drop, while significant, may be temporary. "We've seen selloffs like this before, and the market has a way of bouncing back," said one market observer.
However, others caution that the current global economic climate, especially with the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, could make it difficult for the Canadian economy to avoid a downturn. "There are a lot of headwinds facing us right now," noted another analyst. "We have to be careful not to be too optimistic."
The Toronto Stock Exchange remains one of the strongest markets in the world, and it has weathered many economic storms in the past. Despite this recent setback, there is hope among many investors that the market will regain its momentum in the weeks and months to come.
