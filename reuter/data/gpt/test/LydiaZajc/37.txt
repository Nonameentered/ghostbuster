The Vancouver Stock Exchange has recently introduced after hours trading in an effort to attract more Asian investors. This new offering will allow investors in Asia to trade on the Vancouver Stock Exchange during their normal business hours, which is a significant step towards increasing the exchange's global reach.
The Vancouver Stock Exchange has been looking for ways to expand its reach in Asia, as the continent is now home to some of the world's fastest-growing economies. It believes that allowing investors in Asia to trade on the exchange during their local business hours will create a lot of opportunities for both Asian and Canadian investors.
According to Vancouver Stock Exchange CEO, Margaret Wong, "The addition of after hours trading on the Vancouver Stock Exchange is a great opportunity for investors in Asia to participate in our market, which is known for its open and transparent trading environment. We believe that this move will bring more liquidity to our market and help us to attract new investors".
In addition to this, Wong also believes that it will help to increase the volume of trading on the Vancouver Stock Exchange, which is currently well below its peak levels. Wong stated that "The introduction of after hours trading will help us to be more competitive and attract more capital to our market. As we've seen with other exchanges that have introduced after hours trading, it can be a powerful way to increase liquidity and attract new investors".
The introduction of after hours trading comes at a time when the Vancouver Stock Exchange is trying to position itself as a global player in the financial markets. Wong believes that this new move will help to solidify the exchange's position as a leading exchange for Asian investors looking to invest in Canada.
Overall, the introduction of after hours trading on the Vancouver Stock Exchange is a positive development for both Canadian and Asian investors. It will enable investors in Asia to trade on the exchange during their normal business hours, which will likely increase liquidity and trading volumes on the exchange. This move is expected to be well-received by investors and could be a significant step towards increasing the exchange's global reach.
