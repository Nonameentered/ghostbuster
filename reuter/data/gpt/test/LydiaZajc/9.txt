Toronto stocks closed weaker after a New York-led sell-off amid rising US treasury yields. The S&P/TSX Composite Index slipped 0.21 percent, or 42.23 points, to finish at 20,401.49.
Market analysts attributed the decline to concerns about inflation, which has been exacerbated by the ongoing global semiconductor shortage that has affected various industries. Moreover, many investors have been skeptical about the pace of economic recovery, particularly with the emergence of new COVID-19 strains that could potentially impede vaccine efficacy.
The sell-off in Toronto was led by declines in the technology and materials sectors, which fell 1.05 percent and 1.29 percent, respectively. The healthcare sector ended flat, while financials and industrials managed to eke out marginal gains.
The heavily weighted energy sector, which includes some of the country's largest oil and gas companies, also performed poorly. The sector fell 0.5 percent, despite a small uptick in crude oil prices.
Other Canadian benchmarks also closed in the red, with the S&P/TSX 60 Index falling 0.1 percent and the S&P/TSX Venture Composite Index slipping 0.4 percent.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's poor performance mirrored that of Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.1 percent.
The sell-off came as the yield on the US ten-year treasury note hit its highest level since January 2020, raising concerns about the impact of higher borrowing costs on economic recovery. This has led many investors to shift their focus towards value stocks, which tend to perform better in higher interest rate environments.
Going forward, investors will be closely monitoring economic data, particularly the upcoming consumer price index report, for any signs of rising inflation and its potential impact on monetary policy.
Despite the recent volatility, some analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the Canadian stock market, particularly with the country's strong fiscal position and positive vaccine rollout. However, uncertainty and potential headwinds remain as the world struggles to emerge from the pandemic.
