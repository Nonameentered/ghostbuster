In a move that will create the largest recycling company in North America, Philip Environmental is set to acquire both Allwaste and Serv-Tech in a deal worth $612 million.
Philip Environmental, which is already a major player in the recycling industry, will gain significant market share and expand its services with the acquisition of Allwaste and Serv-Tech. Allwaste is a leading provider of waste management services while Serv-Tech specializes in industrial cleaning, hazardous waste management, and environmental services.
According to sources, the deal is expected to close by the end of the year pending regulatory approvals. Once the acquisition is complete, Philip Environmental will have a workforce of more than 4,000 employees and operations in over 60 locations across North America.
The acquisition comes at a time when demand for recycling services is on the rise. With consumers becoming more environmentally conscious, the recycling industry has seen significant growth in recent years. According to a report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the recycling industry generated $110 billion in economic activity in the United States in 2019.
The acquisition of Allwaste and Serv-Tech will allow Philip Environmental to further expand its capabilities in providing advanced recycling solutions to its customers. The combined company will be able to offer a wide range of recycling and waste management services, including hazardous waste disposal, industrial cleaning, and environmental consulting.
In a statement, Philip Environmental CEO, David Philip, said: "This acquisition will bring together three companies with a shared commitment to sustainability and the circular economy. We are excited to work together to bring innovative solutions that will accelerate the transition to a more sustainable future."
The acquisition will also enable Philip Environmental to enhance its position as a leader in the circular economy. The circular economy is an economic model that is focused on keeping resources in use for as long as possible by reducing waste, using fewer resources, and recycling more materials.
With the acquisition of Allwaste and Serv-Tech, Philip Environmental will be in a better position to help its customers achieve their sustainability goals while reducing their environmental footprint.
Overall, the acquisition of Allwaste and Serv-Tech is a significant move that will benefit both Philip Environmental and its customers, as well as contribute to the growth of the recycling industry in North America.
