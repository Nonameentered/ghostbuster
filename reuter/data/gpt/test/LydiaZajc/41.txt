Toronto Stock Market Weakened by New York Sell-Off in Quiet Trading Session
The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) dropped on Tuesday due to a sell-off in New York, resulting in a quiet trading session. The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index plunged by 160.13 points, or 0.81%, to close at 19,662.02.
Weighed down by negative sentiments, the Toronto stock market struggled throughout the day, with most sectors ending in the red. Energy stocks faced the biggest decline, falling by 2.6% due to weaker oil prices. Materials and financial sectors also fell by 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively, while health care and utilities were the only sectors to end in positive territory.
Analysts cited the sell-off in New York as the primary reason for the weak performance of Toronto stock market. Major indices on Wall Street, including the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, declined sharply, as investors were concerned about the latest surge in coronavirus cases and the potential economic impact of new travel restrictions.
“Investors remain bearish as the threat of a new COVID variant looms large. The situation is made worse by the increasing likelihood of more fiscal tightening policy,” said Kevin Headland, senior investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management.
With a lack of major economic news and no significant corporate earnings reports, trading volume remained thin on Tuesday. Approximately 392.7 million shares were traded on the TSX, compared to an average of 509.2 million in the past month.
Despite the recent weakness, the TSX remains up by 16.9% year-to-date, as it has been boosted by a string of positive economic data, strong corporate earnings, and higher commodity prices.
