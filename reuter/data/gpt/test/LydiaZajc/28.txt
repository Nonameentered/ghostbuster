A recent study has shown that the Toronto Stock Exchange's (TSX) switch to decimal trading has not boosted trading volume since its implementation in 2016.
The study, conducted by a team of researchers from the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, analyzed the trading data of 177 Canadian companies listed on the TSX from January 2014 to March 2019. The researchers found that while there was a temporary increase in trading volume immediately after the switch to decimal trading, this effect dissipated over time.
Decimal trading refers to the practice of pricing securities in increments of one cent, rather than the traditional method of using increments of one-eighth or one-sixteenth of a dollar. The goal of decimal trading is to increase market efficiency and liquidity by providing traders with more precise information about market movements and reducing trading costs.
The TSX adopted decimal trading in 2016, following similar moves by other major exchanges around the world. However, the researchers found that this change had no significant impact on trading volume.
According to the study, the average daily trading volume of the 177 companies analyzed was 1,031,054 shares in the pre-decimal period (January 2014 to June 2016) and 1,011,019 shares in the post-decimal period (July 2016 to March 2019). This represents a decrease of 1.94 percent in trading volume, which the researchers noted was not statistically significant.
The study also found that the adoption of decimal trading did not significantly affect bid-ask spreads, which is a measure of liquidity and trading costs. Bid-ask spreads refer to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a security (the bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (the ask). Tighter bid-ask spreads generally indicate greater liquidity and lower trading costs.
The researchers found that bid-ask spreads were largely unaffected by the switch to decimal trading. The average bid-ask spread for the 177 companies was 6.04 cents in the pre-decimal period and 6.02 cents in the post-decimal period, which is not a statistically significant difference.
The researchers noted that while decimal trading may have benefits for certain types of securities, such as small-cap stocks, the overall impact on market efficiency and liquidity may be limited by other factors, such as market conditions and trading regulations.
The study's findings are likely to be of interest to regulators and industry participants who are seeking to improve market efficiency and liquidity. The researchers suggested that future studies could explore the impact of decimal trading on other aspects of market performance, such as price volatility and market quality.
Despite the lack of significant impact on trading volume, some industry experts argue that decimal trading is still a positive step for the TSX and for the Canadian securities industry as a whole. They point to the benefits of greater precision and transparency in pricing, as well as the potential for increased competition and innovation in trading technology.
Overall, the study highlights the complexities and nuances of market structure and regulation, and the need for continued research and analysis to inform policy decisions and market developments.
