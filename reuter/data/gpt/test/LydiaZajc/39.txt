Toronto stocks  gained nearly one percent on Monday, driven by strong performances by conglomerates and banking groups. The S&P/TSX composite index rose 0.8% to close at 19,307.97, marking a three-day winning streak. The gains were driven by strong earnings from several large companies, including AGT Food and Ingredients Inc., Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., and the Royal Bank of Canada.
AGT Food and Ingredients Inc., a maker of pulse-based products, reported higher sales and profits in the first quarter, as the company benefited from increased demand for plant-based foods. The firm's shares rose more than four percent on the news.
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Canada's largest oil and gas company by market capitalization, posted strong earnings and revenue growth in the first quarter, as the firm benefited from higher oil prices and improved efficiencies. The company's shares rose more than three percent on the news.

Overall, the conglomerates and banking groups helped to push the Toronto Stock Exchange higher on Monday, as investors cheered the strong earnings.
