Toronto stocks closed weaker on Tuesday, with the Toronto Stock Exchangeâ€™s S&P/TSX composite index falling by 150.71 points, or 0.84%, to finish at 18,045.68. This followed cautionary comments from former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Monday night, about the elevated risks of a market correction or crash.
Greenspan noted that the stock market was expensive and that there were growing signs of a bubble in the market. He added that there was too much optimism and that the market was not reflecting the risks, including inflation and geopolitical tensions.
His comments weighed on the financial sector, which was one of the biggest declining sectors on the market. The S&P/TSX financials index closed down 1.4%, with large banks and insurers facing losses.
The materials and energy sectors also contributed to the decline, with a fall in oil prices affecting energy stocks. The S&P/TSX energy index declined 0.9%, while the materials index fell 0.7%. The technology sector, however, managed to make gains and was the only sector to do so, with the S&P/TSX technology index rising 1.9%.
Analysts say that Greenspan's cautionary comments could signal the start of a market correction, which could lead to increased volatility and potentially impact the global economy. Investors will be monitoring upcoming economic reports and earnings announcements to better gauge the health of the market.
