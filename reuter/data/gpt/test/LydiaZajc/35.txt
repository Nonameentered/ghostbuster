The Toronto Stock Exchange closed in the red on Tuesday, due to weak performances from gold shares and growing concerns about a potential interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada.
The TSX Composite Index slipped by 83.35 points, closing at 20,144.07. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar also experienced a dip, falling by 0.14 cents to close at 79.20 cents US.
The drop in gold prices was a key factor in the TSX's weaker performance. Gold futures for June delivery fell $27.70 per ounce, or 1.6%, to close at $1,727.80. This was a reflection of weaker demand for the precious metal, driven in part by rising bond yields and a strengthening US dollar.
At the same time, growing fears of a potential interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada also contributed to the drop in the TSX. This followed comments by Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem, who suggested that the bank may need to raise interest rates if inflation continues to rise.
The prospect of rising interest rates is generally seen as negative for stocks, as it can elevate the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers. This, in turn, can limit economic growth and reduce corporate earnings.
Although markets have been buoyed recently by an improving global economic outlook and rising commodity prices, many analysts warn that a correction may be on the horizon. This has led to increased market volatility and a degree of caution among investors.
Despite the latest dip, many experts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the Canadian stock market. The country's strong economic fundamentals and ongoing vaccine rollout are expected to support growth and provide a boost to key industries.
Investors will be closely watching future developments, however, including any further hints from the Bank of Canada about the possibility of an interest rate hike.
