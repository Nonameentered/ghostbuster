Toronto's Key Stock Index Ends Higher Despite Wall Street Losses
On Wednesday, Toronto's key stock index, the S&P/TSX Composite Index, ended higher, with gains in the resource and financial sectors. This came as Wall Street experienced losses due to concerns over the state of the global economy.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index closed up 185.70 points, or 0.95%, at 19,630.81. It was boosted by a surge in energy stocks, with Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. rising by 5.6% and Suncor Energy Inc. gaining 4.4%.
The financial sector also provided a boost, with Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank up by 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.
However, the situation in the U.S. was less positive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 382.59 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 fell by 1.6%, marking its worst day since May.
Investors were worried about the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19, and its potential impact on the global economic recovery, especially after China's economic growth slowed to a weaker-than-expected 7.9% in the second quarter of the year.
Despite these global concerns, Canada's stock market managed to hold its own, with positive indicators from the domestic economy providing some support.
Furthermore, the Bank of Canada had recently lowered its bond-buying program, signaling confidence in the strength of the country's economic recovery.
Overall, the resilience of Toronto's key stock index in the face of global challenges bodes well for Canada's economic outlook, and offers hope for investors as the world continues to grapple with the ongoing impact of the pandemic.
