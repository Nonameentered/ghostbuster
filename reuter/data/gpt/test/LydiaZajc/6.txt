The stock market in Toronto closed nearly unchanged on Monday, with trading volumes being low due to a holiday closure in the U.S. market and amid a decline in the shares of Barrick Gold Corp.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index finished the day with a gain of just 6.68 points, or 0.03%, at 20,247.15. Among the index's components, 131 posted gains, while 100 suffered losses.
The absence of trading in the U.S. market, which was closed for Presidents Day, resulted in low trading volumes and modest gains in the Canadian market. Also adding to the tepid market was a 3.2% drop in Barrick Gold Corp., the world's second-largest gold producer, which weighed down the index.
The decline in Barrick's shares was attributed to a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings report as well as lower production guidance for 2021. The company also reported decreasing reserves at some of its mines.
Other resource-based stocks also suffered losses, with Teck Resources Ltd. losing 1.3% and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. falling 0.6%.
On the positive side, the shares of cannabis producers such as Canopy Growth Corp. and Cronos Group Inc. saw gains of 3.2% and 2.1%, respectively. The surge in these stocks was attributed to news of a potential merger between Tilray Inc. and Aphria Inc., which could create the world's largest marijuana company.
Overall, the Canadian market registered a lackluster performance with the absence of U.S. trading activity and the poor showing of Barrick Gold, which offset any potential gains.
Investors will be looking to the resumption of trading in the U.S. market on Tuesday to provide further direction for the Canadian market.
