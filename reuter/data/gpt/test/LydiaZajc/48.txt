Toronto Stock Exchange Soars Almost 100 Points Amid Earnings Euphoria and Reduced Fears of U.S. Interest Rate Hike
The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) closed at a record high of 20,358, up 97 points on Monday, as strong corporate earnings reports boosted the Canadian equity market and easing concerns over U.S. interest rate hikes. The gains were broad-based, with almost all sectors of the index posting gains.
Several companies posted strong quarterly earnings, led by Shopify, the Ottawa-based e-commerce giant, which reported a 110% jump in revenue to $1.12 billion in the second quarter, exceeding market expectations. The company also raised its full-year outlook, citing expected strong demand for its services.
Other notable companies that posted better-than-expected earnings include Bombardier, Canadian Pacific Railway, and Canadian National Railway.
Investors were also relieved by the latest remarks from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who suggested on Friday that the central bank would take a more cautious approach to raising interest rates in light of the uncertainty created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Powell’s comments, combined with strong corporate earnings and a positive economic outlook, led to renewed optimism among investors, driving the TSX higher on Monday.
According to some analysts, the TSX rally is likely to continue in the coming days and weeks, as the earnings season is expected to remain strong, and as investors remain optimistic about the economic recovery.
“Investors are feeling very positive about the prospects for Canadian companies this quarter, based on the strong results we’ve seen so far,” said Craig Jerusalim, senior portfolio manager at CIBC Asset Management. “And with the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling a more accommodative stance on interest rates, there’s less fear of higher borrowing costs weighing on equities.”
Overall, the TSX has now gained more than 16% this year, outpacing most other major global indices, including the S&P 500, which is up around 14% year-to-date.
