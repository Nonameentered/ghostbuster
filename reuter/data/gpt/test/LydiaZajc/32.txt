Investors in the Toronto Stock Exchange market closed soft on Wednesday, following the announcement of short-term rate hikes in the United States. The move left investors concerned about a similar scenario in Canada, leading them to sell off their stocks.
The US Federal Reserve increased the short-term interest rates by a quarter-point in December, a move that has raised alarm among Canadian investors. There are fears that the Bank of Canada may follow the same path, increasing its rates in the coming months.
Canadian investors are worried about the impact of a rate hike on the country's already-fragile economy and the stock market. The Canadian economy is showing signs of slowing down after more than a decade of steady growth, and the steep slide of oil prices is also affecting the country's fiscal health.
Many major Canadian stocks saw a dip in their share prices over concerns of possible rate hikes. The S&P/TSX ratio closed 49.54 points lower at 15,108.35, with the stock trading volumes hitting a new all-time low at 16,023,324.
The Bank of Canada stated earlier this month that the country's economy is expected to slow down next year as it reaches full capacity and investment growth slows. It is a trend the country has seen in other areas as well, including consumer spending, exports, and business investment.
The Canadian central bank has so far held its benchmark rate steady at 1.75%, which is the highest it has been since 2008. But with the recent developments in the US and the slowdown in Canada's economy, many experts are predicting a rate hike soon.
"A rate hike would hurt many of the biggest companies in the country, as well as Canada's housing market," warned James Caldwell, CEO of the Toronto-based investment company, Northland Wealth Management.
Despite the fears of rate hikes, some companies are still doing well in the Canadian market. Shopify, a key e-commerce site, saw a surge in its stocks, rising 3.2% to 192.53. Canopy Growth Corp., the world's largest cannabis company, also saw a 4% increase in its stocks, rising to 38.38.
Analysts are advising investors to remain cautious as the Canadian market faces uncertainty over the coming months.
"Canadian markets could continue to be hit by negative sentiment as investors await clarity on the interest rate front," says one expert. "In this climate, it's important for investors to assess the market carefully before making any hasty decisions."
