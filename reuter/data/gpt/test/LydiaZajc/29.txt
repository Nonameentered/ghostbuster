Toronto stocks were mixed on Friday amid nervousness over a possible interest rate hike in the United States and triple-witching.
The interest rate hike in the United States is expected later this year, and investors are worried about what the impact will be on Canadian stocks. The triple-witching is an event that occurs once a quarter when stock index futures, stock index options, and stock options all expire on the same day. It can cause volatility in the market.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index in Toronto closed at 20,031.14, up 12.8 points or 0.06%. The TSX was dragged down by the energy sector, which fell 1.9%, and the materials sector, which fell 0.4%. However, the financial sector rose 0.7%, and the technology sector rose 2.5%.
Investors were also keeping an eye on the Canadian economy, which saw a rebound in employment in June, with 231,000 jobs added, according to Statistics Canada. The unemployment rate fell to 7.8% from 8.2% in May.
“While the June report was much better than expected, questions remain about what comes next,” said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, in a note to clients. “The choppy path that could lie ahead for the labour market means that the Bank of Canada will likely wait a bit longer before removing stimulus.”
Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada left its key interest rate unchanged at 0.25% on Wednesday, as expected. The central bank also maintained its economic projections, but said it would continue to monitor developments and adjust policy as needed.
Looking ahead, investors will be watching for the release of Canadian inflation data next week, which could influence the Bank of Canada’s decision on when to raise interest rates.
In the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 299.07 points, or 0.86%, to 34,687.85. The S&P 500 dropped 32.87 points, or 0.75%, to 4,327.16. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 115.90 points, or 0.79%, to 14,427.24.
Overall, nervousness over the U.S. interest rate hike and triple-witching sent mixed signals throughout the stock market in Toronto, and investors will be watching closely for any developments that may impact their portfolios in the upcoming weeks.
