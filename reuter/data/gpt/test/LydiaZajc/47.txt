Toronto stocks ended higher on Thursday, with the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite index up by 0.7%. The gains were largely driven by strong performances from the banking sector as concerns over interest rate hikes eased. 
Bank stocks rallied after the Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem indicated that interest rates were unlikely to rise until the economy shows steady signs of recovery. This provided much-needed relief to Canadian investors who were worried that an interest rate hike could derail the country's economic recovery.
The banking sector was the biggest contributor to the gains, with Royal Bank of Canada rising by 1%, Bank of Montreal up by 0.7%, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce up by 0.6%. The strong performance of these banking stocks helped to lift the financial sector of the index by 0.8%. 
In addition to banks, other sectors also performed strongly, with energy stocks up by 0.9% and materials up by 0.8%. 
The positive sentiment extended beyond the Canadian border as well. US stocks also surged, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recording new highs. Investors were bullish on the prospects of an economic recovery as the vaccination roll-out continues and the government stimulus measures take effect.
In conclusion, the upbeat mood in the Toronto stock market was driven by the strong performance of the banking sector and easing fears of interest rate hikes. The positive sentiment was not limited to Canada, as investors across the continent seem to be optimistic about the prospects of economic recovery.
