Toronto stocks closed at a record high on Monday, led by gains in the gold and base metal sectors. The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index surged 1.6% to close at 17,572.45, the highest level since February 21. The rally was spurred by the rising prices of gold and copper, which boosted the shares of mining companies.
Gold futures climbed 1.7% to trade at $1,996.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since September 2011. The rally was driven by the weakening of the US dollar, which makes gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies. The rise in gold prices also reflected concerns over the escalation of the US-China trade tensions, which have raised the demand for safe-haven assets.
The rise in gold prices benefited Canadian gold miners, which saw their shares surge on Monday. Barrick Gold, the world's second-largest gold producer, saw its shares rise by 6.5%, while Kinross Gold and Yamana Gold gained 7.1% and 4.5%, respectively.
Base metal prices also rose on Monday, due to a surge in demand from China, the world's largest consumer of metals. Copper prices climbed 1.3% to trade at $6,432 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest level since June 2018. The rally was driven by the recovery of the Chinese economy, which has boosted the demand for metals used in construction and manufacturing.
The rise in base metal prices benefited Canadian miners, which saw their shares soar on Monday. Teck Resources, Canada's largest diversified miner, saw its shares rise by 11.3%, while First Quantum Minerals and Hudbay Minerals gained 8.6% and 9.5%, respectively.
The rally in the precious and base metal sectors helped offset the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Canadian economy. The outbreak has disrupted supply chains and led to a sharp reduction in consumer spending, which has hurt many industries. However, the rise in gold and base metal prices has provided a much-needed boost to the mining sector, which is a key driver of the Canadian economy.
Investors will be closely watching the developments in the US-China trade tensions, as well as the performance of the global economy, to determine the outlook for the precious and base metal sectors. If the tensions escalate further, it could boost the demand for safe-haven assets, such as gold, and lead to further gains in the mining sector.
