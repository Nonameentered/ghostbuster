The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) saw mixed performance in Wednesday's trading session. The bank rally managed to outweigh profit-taking in other sectors, resulting in a relatively stable market.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index gained 17.79 points, or 0.09%, to close at 20,157.65. The day's activity saw gains in the financial sector, which led the way with a 1.2% gain. As the Bank of Montreal announced better-than-expected earnings, five of the six major banks saw gains, with BMO up by 2.4% and Scotiabank up by 1.3%.
Meanwhile, profit-taking was seen in the technology sector, which fell 1.7%. Shopify's shares dropped 3%, while Lightspeed POS Inc. was down by 4.8%. In addition, the energy and communication services sectors also faced minor losses, down 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively.
The market's mixed performance comes amid continued uncertainties over the global economic recovery, with concerns about rising inflation and the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 affecting investor sentiment.
Some analysts suggest that the current market conditions could offer opportunities for value investors. "There's a good chance that value could outperform growth for a little bit longer as we move through this reopening unevenly around the world," said Candice Bangsund, vice-president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital.
Overall, the Canadian stock market continues to be buoyed by a rise in crude oil prices, which touched their highest level in nearly three years on Wednesday. Brent crude oil futures rose 22 cents to $74.92 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 26 cents to $72.23 a barrel.
Investors will continue to monitor global economic developments, including upcoming earnings reports, as well as progress on COVID-19 vaccination efforts, to make informed trading decisions in the days ahead.
