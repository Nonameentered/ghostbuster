Mitel Corp, a leading provider of unified communication solutions, has revealed that its growth in computer telephony integration (CTI) has been slower than expected. The company's CEO, Rich McBee, made the announcement during a recent earnings call.
CTI is the technology that enables computers to interact with telephone systems, allowing for advanced call controls and other features. Mitel has been a major player in this market, but it appears that growth has been slower than anticipated.
During the earnings call, McBee stated that while Mitel's overall growth rate had been strong in the fourth quarter of 2020, the growth in CTI was "somewhat slower than we expected." He went on to say that the company was still seeing demand for CTI solutions, but that sales cycles were longer than anticipated.
Mitel has been working to expand its offering of CTI solutions, including a recent partnership with Google Cloud to offer an AI-powered contact center solution. Despite the slower-than-expected growth, Mitel remains committed to the CTI market and sees it as an important part of its overall strategy.
"We believe that we have a very strong value proposition in CTI and we will continue to invest in the market," McBee said during the earnings call.
Overall, Mitel reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020, with revenues of $329.9 million, up from $310.8 million in the same quarter the previous year. The company also reported adjusted EBITDA of $75.5 million, up from $70.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
