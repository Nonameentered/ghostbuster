The Toronto Stock Market achieved its ninth record close in heavy trading on Friday, thanks to the inflow of pension funds. A surge in buying activity in technology, health care, and cannabis sectors fueled growth across the board. The TSX composite index ended the day up 0.36% at 16,126.85, setting a new all-time high.
According to analysts, Toronto's stock market has surged by more than 6% in the past two months amid mounting optimism that the country's economic recovery is continuing. Canada's pension funds, among the world's largest investors, played an instrumental role in propelling the stock market higher.
After a year of lackluster investment returns, Canadian pension funds are pouring money back into equities, particularly targeting tech, health care, and renewable energy sectors. Pension funds such as the CPP Investment Board and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan are among the leading investors in these sectors.
Some experts suggest that Canada's growing commitment to renewable energy could further boost interest in equities. They note that the federal government has pledged to invest $10 billion over the next three years in green infrastructure projects, including public transit, electric vehicle charging stations, and energy-efficient buildings.
Moreover, experts say that Canada's significant infrastructure investments could stimulate a boom in demand for the metals and minerals used in green technologies. This could lead to renewed interest in natural resource equities, which have been a staple of the Canadian stock market for decades.
On Friday, the top gainers in the S&P/TSX Composite Index included Shopify Inc., Bausch Health Companies Inc., and Bombardier Inc., all of which recorded solid gains on heavy volume. Other notable contributors to the market rally included Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria Inc., and Aurora Cannabis Inc.
Overall, market analysts are optimistic about the stock market's outlook for the rest of the year. They suggest that the continued inflow of pension funds, coupled with Canada's focus on renewable energy and infrastructure investments, could prove to be a powerful catalyst for growth.
