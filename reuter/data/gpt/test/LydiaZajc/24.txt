Yogen Fruz, the Canadian frozen yogurt franchise, has proposed a co-branding strategy with global fast food chains Subway and KFC in an effort to expand its reach worldwide. The move is part of Yogen Fruz’s bid to capitalize on the growing demand for healthy and convenient eating options and to diversify its product offerings.
The proposed partnership would see Yogen Fruz’s yogurt products sold alongside Subway and KFC’s sandwiches and fried chicken meals in their respective outlets. This would provide customers with a wider range of food options, catering to different dietary requirements and preferences. For instance, customers on-the-go can grab a quick and healthy frozen yogurt dessert after having a sandwich at Subway, or opt for a refreshing drink when enjoying the spicy offerings of KFC.
Yogen Fruz’s co-branding strategy is also expected to benefit Subway and KFC, as it will attract more health-conscious customers to their outlets. In recent years, the fast food industry has come under criticism for promoting unhealthy eating habits and contributing to the global obesity epidemic. By offering frozen yogurt products alongside their existing menu items, Subway and KFC can promote a more balanced and healthy diet to their customers.
Speaking at a press conference to announce the proposal, Aaron Serruya, CEO of Yogen Fruz, said: “We’re very excited about this partnership. There is a growing demand for healthy eating options, and frozen yogurt is a perfect fit for that trend. By partnering with Subway and KFC, we can tap into their existing customer base and introduce our products to a wider audience.”
The proposed partnership is not the first of its kind in the food industry. Co-branding has been successfully implemented by other fast food chains, such as Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, which are both owned by Yum Brands. The strategy allows companies to leverage each other’s strengths and resources, such as marketing and distribution channels, to expand their reach and increase profits. In addition, co-branding allows companies to share the costs of lease agreements, equipment, and labor, which makes it a more cost-effective way to expand.
Yogen Fruz currently has over 1,400 stores in over 47 countries worldwide, and the proposed co-branding strategy is expected to increase its presence in key markets such as the United States, China, and India. The company also plans to expand its product offerings to include smoothies, acai bowls, and other healthy snacks, in response to the growing trend of healthy eating and plant-based diets.
The co-branding proposal has been well-received by industry experts and analysts, who see it as a strategic move to capitalize on the growing demand for healthy and convenient food options. However, some critics have raised concerns over the quality and nutrition of the frozen yogurt products, which can vary depending on the amount of sugar, additives, and preservatives used. Yogen Fruz has assured customers that its products are made from high-quality ingredients and contain live and active cultures that promote gut health and immune function.
The proposed co-branding agreement is still subject to approval from Subway and KFC’s respective headquarters, and negotiations are ongoing. If successful, the partnership is expected to be rolled out in selected markets by 2022. For Yogen Fruz, the co-branding strategy represents an opportunity to strengthen its brand positioning and expand its customer base, while for Subway and KFC, it offers a chance to diversify their offerings and differentiate themselves from their competitors.
