Toronto's key stock index, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), witnessed a boost on Tuesday, June 1st, 2021 despite the weakness in the gold group companies. The banking sector played a crucial role in lifting the TSX while other sectors struggled.
The TSX index rose by 57.25 points to settle at 19,357.88 by the end of the trading session. The increase was mainly driven by strong performances of bank stocks, with the financial sector leading the charge with a 1.5% gain. Bank of Montreal (BMO), Bank of Nova Scotia, and Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) saw their shares climb 1.3%, 1.9%, and 1.1%, respectively. These gains come as the country's economic recovery speeds up.
Conversely, the gold group shares recorded a decline of 0.8% as the precious metal prices dropped below the $1,900/oz mark. Kinross Gold Corp and Iamgold Corp were the biggest drags, with their shares declining by 3.7% and 3.1%, respectively.
The energy and the technology sectors didn't have much of a positive impact on the TSX. However, Suncor Energy witnessed a 1% increase and has announced plans to expand its Terra Nova offshore oil project in the Atlantic. Shopify was down by 1.5%, and several other tech stocks recorded significant losses.
In conclusion, the TSX saw a boost despite a weak performance from the gold group companies. The banking sector and a resilient market outlook have contributed to the increase in the TSX index. While some sectors did not fare so well, the overall consensus for the future of the stock market remains optimistic.
