Cognos Inc, the leading provider of business intelligence and performance management software, has announced that it expects a strong fiscal year 1998. The company's revenue growth is projected to be in the mid-to-high teens, and it anticipates continued momentum in the industry.
As part of its strategic planning for the year, Cognos is considering two options for its $100 million cash reserve. The first option is a share buyback program, which would involve the company purchasing its own shares on the open market. The second option is an acquisition, which would involve the company acquiring another firm that aligns with its business focus and growth objectives.
"We are in a strong financial position and have a clear path for continued growth," said Ron Zambonini, Cognos' CEO. "We are analyzing all potential opportunities and weighing the benefits of a share buyback versus an acquisition. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value and drive long-term growth for our company."
Cognos has a history of delivering strong financial results, with a track record of consistent revenue growth and profitability. The company has a global presence, with customers in over 135 countries and offices in 24 countries worldwide.
The announcement of Cognos' strong fiscal year 1998 expectations and plans for its cash reserves is welcome news for investors. Shares of the company have been performing well in recent months, with a current market value of over $2 billion. However, the decision to pursue a share buyback or acquisition will ultimately depend on strategic priorities and market conditions.
"We are confident in our ability to execute on our plans and deliver value for our shareholders," said Zambonini. "We have a talented team, a strong product portfolio, and a commitment to innovation and customer success. We look forward to a successful year ahead."
