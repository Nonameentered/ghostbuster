In a move that has sent ripples through the retail industry, Hudson's Bay Co has announced that a former Wal-Mart executive will be taking over as CEO. Doug McMillon, who most recently served as the CEO of Wal-Mart, will be taking the reins at Hudson's Bay Co, which operates stores including Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor.
Investors appear to be ecstatic about the news. Shares of Hudson's Bay Co soared by nearly 15% in early trading following the announcement, signalling that shareholders believe McMillon has what it takes to turn the company around. Hudson's Bay has struggled in recent years as department stores have fallen out of favour with consumers, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the company's woes.
However, McMillon is known for his savvy when it comes to navigating difficult retail environments. During his tenure at Wal-Mart, he oversaw the company's expansion into e-commerce offerings as well as the acquisition of Jet.com. Many industry insiders believe that McMillon's experience in transforming Wal-Mart will serve him well in his new role at Hudson's Bay Co.
McMillon himself seemed upbeat about the move, stating that he is excited about the "opportunities and challenges" that lie ahead. He acknowledged that the retail environment is changing rapidly, but expressed confidence in the company's ability to adapt. "Hudson's Bay Co has a rich history and an incredible portfolio of brands," he said. "I'm looking forward to working with the team to build on that and create a sustainable future for the company."
Industry analysts are also cautiously optimistic about the appointment of McMillon. "He's a proven leader, and he knows how to make a retail business successful," said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData. "But that being said, Hudson's Bay Co is facing some pretty significant challenges. Turning this ship around won't be easy, even for someone with McMillon's experience."
McMillon is slated to take over as CEO on February 5th. Hudson's Bay Co has said that he will also be joining the company's board of directors. It remains to be seen exactly what changes McMillon will make in his new role, but investors are hoping that his appointment is the first step towards a brighter future for the struggling retail giant.
