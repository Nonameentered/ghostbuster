Toronto's stock market rallied on Monday, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index surging over 1% to close at 19546.34 points. The rally was led by blue-chip stocks, which saw gains across several sectors, including financials, energy, and consumer staples. However, the broader market ended mixed amid weaker bullion prices.
The financial sector was the biggest gainer of the day, rising 2.1%. Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank of Canada, and TD Bank all saw gains of over 2%, while Manulife Financial Corporation rose 3.6%. The energy sector also saw gains, rising 1.5%, with Suncor Energy and Canadian Natural Resources both rising over 1%.
The consumer staples sector was up 1.2%, with Loblaw Companies Limited rising nearly 3% and Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. rising 1.8%. The healthcare sector was the only one to see a decline, falling 0.3%.
The blue-chip rally was fueled by positive news from the US, where President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package into law on Thursday, providing a boost to the economy. Additionally, oil prices rose after Saudi Aramco announced it would keep prices steady for a second month in a row, calming fears of a potential price war between major oil producers.
However, the broader market was held back by weaker bullion prices, with the materials sector falling 0.3%. Gold prices fell 0.6%, with Barrick Gold Corporation and Kinross Gold Corporation both falling nearly 1%. The technology sector was also down, falling 0.2%, with Shopify Inc. down 1.3%.
The mixed market also saw rising Covid-19 cases in Canada, with Ontario reporting over 1,000 daily cases for the third straight day over the weekend. The surge led to new restrictions in the province, including the closure of gyms and indoor dining in some regions.
Despite the mixed market, analysts remain optimistic about the future, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index up over 10% this year. "We think the TSX Composite Index will continue to outperform other major indices, given the composition of its sectors and the improving economic outlook," said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments. "We remain bullish on the bank stocks, as well as the energy and consumer sectors."
In summary, Toronto's stock market rallied on Monday, led by blue-chip stocks across several sectors. However, weaker bullion prices led to a mixed broader market. Analysts remain optimistic about the future, with the TSX Composite Index up over 10% this year.
