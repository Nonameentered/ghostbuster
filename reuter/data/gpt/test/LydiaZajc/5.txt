The Toronto Stock Market reached its eighth record close of the year on Wednesday as gold stocks soared and takeover news emerged in the oil patch.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index closed at 15,917, up 56 points from Tuesday's close. The market has been riding a wave of optimism fueled by a strong economy and rising commodity prices.
Gold prices hit a two-month high on Wednesday, boosting the shares of gold producers such as Barrick Gold and Goldcorp. Barrick Gold rose 2.9 percent to $18.44, while Goldcorp gained 2.5 percent to $17.05.
Meanwhile, the oil and gas sector was buzzing with takeover news. Canadian Natural Resources announced it was buying Cenovus Energy's assets in Alberta for $3.8 billion. Canadian Natural Resources shares rose 1.1 percent to $42.83, while Cenovus shares climbed 5.1 percent to $11.67.
Other energy stocks also saw gains, with Suncor Energy rising 0.9 percent to $41.30 and Enbridge gaining 1.2 percent to $50.01.
The technology sector also saw notable gains, with Shopify rising 2.6 percent to $135.37 and BlackBerry gaining 2.1 percent to $12.20.
Despite the market's record-breaking run this year, some analysts are cautioning that the rally may not be sustainable.
"There are certainly some reasons to be cautious," said Craig Fehr, an investment strategist at Edward Jones. "While there's a lot of optimism about the economy and corporate earnings, we do have to remember that there are still some headwinds, whether that's geopolitical risks or the potential for higher interest rates."
Still, investors seem to be shrugging off those concerns for now and continuing to pour money into stocks.
"It's been a great year for the market so far, and investors are feeling pretty bullish," said Fehr. "They're definitely not in any rush to take profits off the table."
With the Toronto Stock Market reaching its eighth record close of the year on Wednesday, it's clear that investors are finding plenty of reasons to be optimistic about Canada's economy and its prospects for growth in the coming months.
