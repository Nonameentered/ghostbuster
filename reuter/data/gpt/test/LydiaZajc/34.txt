Toronto stocks experienced a sharp drop on Thursday as U.S. producer price data raised concerns about possible interest rate hikes. The S&P/TSX composite index lost a total of 150.73 points, or 0.8%, finishing the day at 19,057.37.
The U.S. producer price index, which measures the prices that producers receive for their goods and services, increased by 1% in May from the previous month, according to data released Thursday. This was higher than expected and fueled speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates sooner than anticipated to combat inflation.
The technology sector suffered a significant blow with Shopify Inc. falling 4.7% and CGI Inc. dropping 2.2%. Meanwhile, financials and energy sectors also experienced losses, with Royal Bank of Canada dropping 1.6% and Canadian Natural Resources falling 2.9%.
In addition to the U.S. producer price index, investors were also concerned about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy. The rising number of cases in some countries and the slow pace of vaccination in others have added to uncertainty in the markets.
The drop in Toronto stocks mirrored similar trends in other global markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both fell by 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped by 1%. European stocks also saw losses, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index falling by 0.5%.
Investors are now keeping a close eye on the upcoming meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, scheduled for June 15-16. Many are hoping for more clarity on the central bank's plans for interest rates and inflation.
Overall, the market volatility highlights the ongoing uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the global economy. Investors will continue to monitor economic data and make adjustments accordingly.
