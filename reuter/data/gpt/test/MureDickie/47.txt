In what can only be described as a glimmer of hope for relations between China and the United States, the two nations have avoided a potentially disastrous trade war by extending their textile deal.
The 10-year textile deal, which was due to expire at the end of last year, governs the import and export of textiles and clothing between the two countries. With China being the world's largest textile and clothing producer, and the United States being the world's largest consumer, this deal is of vital importance to both nations.
However, with tensions escalating between the two nations in recent months over issues such as Taiwan, the South China Sea and trade, there were fears that the textile deal extension would not happen and that a full-blown trade war would ensue.
The potential fallout from such a conflict would be catastrophic, not just for China and the United States, but for the global economy as a whole.
Thankfully, after months of negotiations, the two nations have come to an agreement to extend the deal for a further five years, providing some much-needed breathing space and stability for the textile industry.
The extended deal will see China continue to limit its exports of certain textile products, such as cotton trousers and wool knitwear, to the United States, while the United States will continue to limit its exports of certain textile products, such as man-made fiber knit shirts and blouses, to China.
"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with our Chinese partners," said United States Trade Representative Michael Froman. "This deal is a testament to the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in resolving trade disputes, and we remain committed to working with China to ensure a fair and level playing field for all."
The news of the deal extension has been welcomed by the textile industry on both sides of the Pacific, and will be seen as a positive step in the ongoing efforts to improve relations between China and the United States.
