China Makes Yuan Convertible Under Current Account: Analysts Urge Caution on Full Convertibility Goal
China's long-awaited move to make its currency, the Yuan, convertible under the current account has been seen as a significant milestone towards the liberalization of the Chinese financial system. The move has been well-received by the global community, but analysts have cautioned against China rushing into full convertibility too quickly.
Historically, China had restricted the use of its currency, and the government had imposed strict capital controls on the currency to prevent large flows of money from leaving the country. This regulation had made it difficult for foreign investors to invest directly in China and had stifled the growth of China's financial markets.
However, China’s central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), recently announced the scrapping of a quota system that had previously been the only way foreign investors could buy securities through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program. Under the new regulations, foreign investors can now freely purchase Chinese stocks, bonds, and other financial assets with yuan sourced overseas.
The latest change allows for an acceleration of China's push to internationalize its currency and open up its financial system to the world – a move aimed to achieve a renewed position in the global currency market.
While the move is seen as essential to China's goal of challenging the US dollar's supremacy in the international monetary system, the country's leaders have been cautious on full convertibility, citing the risk of capital flight that could damage its financial stability.
With the new regulation, China aims to strike a delicate balance between promoting the internationalization of the yuan and maintaining a stable financial system. The PBOC's goal is a gradual, orderly, and cautious internationalization of the yuan, conducted under a prudent macroeconomic framework.
While the move towards greater convertibility has been welcomed by foreign investors, analysts have expressed caution and apprehension about China's ultimate goal of full convertibility.
Analysts argue that full convertibility of the yuan could lead to an influx of risky foreign capital that could destabilize the financial system, which is still characterized by an underdeveloped bond market, weak corporate governance, and a high level of debt.
"The decision to make the yuan convertible under the current account represents an essential step towards greater liberalization of China's financial system. Nevertheless, China still faces significant challenges on the path to full convertibility, and haste could lead to undesirable outcomes," says Professor John Lee of the University of Sydney.
The challenge of achieving full convertibility remains significant, even for a powerful economy like China. The country's enormous foreign exchange reserves, which stand at $3.2 trillion, make it tough to liberalize the financial system quickly, as more capital could rapidly escape the country, leading to pressure on the yuan.
Furthermore, the country's stock market has yet to mature and is currently plagued by high volatility, requiring state intervention when it plunges to protect investors.
In conclusion, while China's decision to make the Yuan convertible under the current account represents a significant milestone towards the liberalization of the Chinese financial system, it would be wise to proceed cautiously on the road towards full convertibility. Achieving such a goal requires the establishment of a stable macroeconomic environment, strengthened financial infrastructure, increased financial transparency, and high-quality financial regulation. Rushing towards full convertibility too quickly may invite significant risks that could jeopardize China's financial stability and economic development.
