In a rare move, Chinese dissident, Xu Zhiyong, has called for stronger anti-corruption laws in China in an open letter addressed to parliament. The letter, which was posted on social media on Tuesday, has sparked widespread debate in China, where dissent is often suppressed.
Xu, a former law professor and human rights activist, has been a vocal critic of China's ruling Communist Party and its policies. He was imprisoned for four years on accusations of "gathering crowds to disrupt public order" in 2014.
In the letter, Xu highlighted the need for an independent body to investigate and prosecute corrupt officials, saying that the current anti-corruption system in China is substandard and ineffective. He also called for greater transparency in government affairs and for the public to have access to information on officials' assets and liabilities.
"The current anti-corruption system is both incomplete and lacking in efficiency," Xu wrote, adding that corruption has become a significant barrier to China's development. "We cannot let corruption become the number one enemy of the people."
Xu's letter comes at a sensitive time for China, with the country facing mounting economic and political challenges both at home and abroad. Corruption has long been a serious problem in China, with officials often using their positions of power for personal gain. President Xi Jinping has launched a highly publicized campaign against corruption since taking office in 2012, but critics say it has been more about consolidating his power than rooting out corruption.
Xu's call for tougher anti-corruption laws has been welcomed by reform-minded lawmakers and activists, who see it as a step towards greater accountability and transparency in government. However, it is unlikely to be well-received by the ruling Communist Party, which is notoriously intolerant of dissent.
The Chinese government has been tightening its grip on civil society in recent years, cracking down on activists, lawyers, and journalists who dare to challenge its authority. Xu himself has been under house arrest since his release from prison in 2017.
Despite these challenges, Xu remains optimistic about the future of China. "I believe that a better China is possible," he wrote in the letter. "A China where citizens can speak their minds freely, where the rule of law is supreme, where officials are held accountable for their actions, and where corruption is a thing of the past."
It is unclear what impact Xu's letter will have, but it has already sparked a lively debate on social media and highlighted the growing discontent with corruption and lack of accountability in China.
In conclusion, the call for tougher anti-corruption laws has been a long-standing demand of the Chinese people. Xu's open letter to parliament has drawn attention to this issue and reignited the debate on how best to combat corruption in China. It remains to be seen if the government will take action to address these concerns, but Xu's message serves as a reminder that the fight against corruption is far from over.
