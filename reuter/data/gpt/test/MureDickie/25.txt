Hong Kong - Britain and China have agreed to share a symbolic embrace at the Hong Kong handover ceremony scheduled for later this month. The gesture, which will see representatives from both countries jointly hoisting the Hong Kong flag, is intended to signify the end of British rule in the territory and the beginning of a new era under Chinese sovereignty.
The ceremony, which will take place on July 1st, will mark the 24th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997. The event, which is expected to be low-key due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, will be attended by a small number of dignitaries and guests.
Both Britain and China have emphasized the significance of the handover ceremony, with officials from both countries stressing the importance of maintaining stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. The territory has experienced significant unrest in recent years, with pro-democracy protests and clashes with authorities sparking concerns about the erosion of civil liberties and the autonomy of Hong Kong.
The joint flag-raising ceremony is intended to convey a message of cooperation and reconciliation between Britain and China, as well as a commitment to the long-term development and stability of Hong Kong. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement that the ceremony would be a historic moment that "reflects the UK's commitment to the 'one country, two systems' model and our enduring friendship with the people of Hong Kong."
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, welcomed the joint ceremony as a "positive step" towards improving bilateral relations between China and the UK. "China stands ready to work with the UK to strengthen communication, deepen mutual trust, and promote sound and steady development of China-UK ties," he said at a press conference on Monday.
The symbolic embrace between Britain and China comes at a time of strained relations between the two countries over issues such as human rights, trade, and security. The UK has been a vocal critic of China's human rights record, particularly with regard to the treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.
However, both sides have emphasized the need for dialogue and cooperation, particularly in the face of global challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change. In a joint statement issued in June, British and Chinese officials reaffirmed their commitment to "working together to tackle global challenges and promoting a stronger global governance system that is more representative and effective."
The Hong Kong handover ceremony is a significant milestone in the history of British-Chinese relations, marking the end of 156 years of British colonial rule in Hong Kong. The territory was ceded to Britain in 1842 after the Opium War, and its importance as a trading port grew throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.
In 1984, Britain and China signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which established the terms of the handover and pledged to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms under the principle of "one country, two systems." The arrangement was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status for 50 years after the handover, but concerns have grown in recent years over China's efforts to tighten its grip on the territory.
Many activists and pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong have criticized the joint flag-raising ceremony between Britain and China, arguing that it sends the wrong message about the state of democracy and human rights in the territory. However, others have welcomed the gesture as a step towards reconciliation and dialogue between the two countries.
As the world continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic and other pressing challenges, the Hong Kong handover ceremony serves as a reminder of the complex and often fraught nature of international relations. While the symbolic embrace between Britain and China may not solve all of the challenges facing Hong Kong and the wider world, it remains an important reflection of the ongoing efforts to build stronger and more collaborative global partnerships.
