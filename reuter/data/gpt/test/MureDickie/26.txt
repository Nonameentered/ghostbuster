China has ordered two 747 jumbo jets from American aviation company Boeing just ahead of US Congressional visits to China. The deal, worth over $700 million, comes amidst escalating trade tensions between the two countries.
The purchase of the airplanes was announced by the Boeing Company on Tuesday after weeks of negotiations. The two 747-8s will be used to transport Chinese officials and state leaders.
The agreement was signed by China's Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and the Chinese Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The airplanes will be delivered in 2022, according to Boeing.
The order is a good sign for Boeing, which has been struggling recently due to the worldwide pandemic as well as the ongoing trade war between the US and China. The Chicago-based company has been hit hard, with aircraft sales dropping significantly in the past two years. The order from China is therefore a welcome boost for Boeing, which desperately needs new sales to boost its revenues.
In addition to the economic boost, the order may also be seen as a way for China to extend an olive branch to the US ahead of upcoming Congressional visits. High-ranking US lawmakers are set to visit Beijing in the coming weeks, and China may be looking to improve its relationship with the US through this purchase.
However, some experts have warned that the purchase could also be seen as a way to win favor with the US, either ahead of or in the midst of trade negotiations. US-China trade talks have been ongoing for years, with trade tensions increasing under the Trump administration.
Some newsmakers have also noted that the move could make US lawmakers hesitant to take a hard stance on China due to the potential impact on American businesses like Boeing.
Despite these concerns, the order from China is undoubtedly a positive development for Boeing. The aircraft manufacturer has a long and successful history of doing business with China, and this order will likely be seen as a sign of continued partnership between the two nations.
Boeing has already sold more than 780 aircraft to China, and the recent order brings the total number of 747s China has ordered from Boeing to 6. The 747 is Boeing's largest commercial airplane, capable of carrying up to 660 passengers.
The two new 747s will be equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including the latest in flight-management systems and avionics. They will also be painted with a special design to celebrate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the US and China.
In conclusion, the order from China is a welcome development for Boeing, as it struggles to overcome the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic and the global economic downturn. While some experts have expressed concerns about the potential implications of the order, it is ultimately a positive move for both Boeing and US-China relations.
