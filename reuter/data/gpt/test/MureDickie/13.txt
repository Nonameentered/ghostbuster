Hong Kong's leader-designate, Tung Chee-hwa, has expressed confidence in the future of the city under Chinese sovereignty and stated that he sees no problems that require Beijing's help.
Tung is currently serving as the vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a position he has held since 2008. He is expected to take over as Hong Kong's chief executive on July 1, succeeding Carrie Lam.
In a recent interview with Chinese state media, Tung emphasized his commitment to upholding the principle of "one country, two systems," under which Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy but remains a part of China.
"I am confident that Hong Kong can maintain its stability and prosperity under the guidance of the 'one country, two systems' principle," Tung said. "We have a unique position in the world, and we will continue to play our role as a bridge between China and the rest of the world."
Tung's remarks come at a time of heightened tensions between China and the West over issues such as human rights, trade, and security. Hong Kong has also been the site of pro-democracy protests in recent years, with many locals voicing concerns about Beijing's influence on the city's political system.
However, Tung appeared to shrug off these concerns, stating that he saw no need for Beijing to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs.
"I don't think there are any problems that require the Central Government to step in," he said. "We have a legal system that can handle disputes, and we have a government that is accountable to the people."
Tung also expressed his enthusiasm for the Greater Bay Area initiative, a Chinese government-led project aimed at promoting economic integration between Hong Kong, Macau, and nine cities in mainland China.
"Under the Greater Bay Area framework, Hong Kong can tap into the enormous potential of the mainland market and become a key player in the global economy," he said. "I believe that this initiative will bring great benefits to Hong Kong and its people."
Tung's views were welcomed by Hong Kong's pro-Beijing camp, who praised him for his loyalty to the Chinese government.
"Mr. Tung has always been a staunch supporter of 'one country, two systems' and the Basic Law," said Tam Yiu-chung, a Hong Kong delegate to China's National People's Congress. "His remarks show that he is fully committed to this principle and to the development of Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty."
However, Tung's comments were met with skepticism by some members of the pro-democracy camp, who accused him of downplaying the serious challenges facing Hong Kong.
"Mr. Tung seems to be living in a different reality from the rest of us," said Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy lawmaker. "He cannot pretend that the erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy is not a problem, or that the government's failure to address the concerns of its citizens is not a problem."
Chu also criticized Tung for his role in the 2019 extradition bill controversy, which sparked months of mass protests in the city. Tung had initially expressed support for the bill, which would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to mainland China, before eventually backing down in the face of public opposition.
"Mr. Tung is not a neutral figure in Hong Kong's political landscape," Chu said. "He bears responsibility for the chaos and division that the extradition bill caused, and he must do more to address the concerns of those who took to the streets to defend Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms."
Despite the mixed reaction to Tung's remarks, it is clear that he will face significant challenges when he takes over as Hong Kong's chief executive. The city's deep political divisions, coupled with Beijing's tightening grip on the city's affairs, present a daunting task for any leader.
However, Tung's confidence in Hong Kong's prospects under Chinese sovereignty may provide a glimmer of hope for those who believe in the city's ability to thrive despite the odds.
