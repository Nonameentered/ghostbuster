Chinese President Jiang Zemin has pledged his support for Hong Kong's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, promising to work closely with him in a new era for the region.
In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Jiang spoke about the importance of Hong Kong's role in China's development, emphasizing his confidence in Mr. Tung's leadership.
"As the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Tung Chee-hwa has overcome many difficulties and achieved great success in the past five years," Mr. Jiang said. "We firmly support him and expect him to lead Hong Kong into a new era."
Mr. Tung, who was appointed as Hong Kong's first chief executive in 1997 following the city's handover from British rule to China, is set to begin his second five-year term on July 1.
Under his leadership, Hong Kong has faced economic challenges, including the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. However, Mr. Tung has also overseen the region's integration with China, as well as the launch of landmark projects like the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.
Mr. Jiang's endorsement comes as Hong Kong faces increasing political pressure and tensions with China. Pro-democracy activists have criticized Beijing's tightening grip on the city's autonomy, while some have called for greater independence from mainland China. In recent years, Hong Kong has seen mass protests and political unrest, culminating in violent clashes between police and demonstrators in 2019.
In his speech, Mr. Jiang acknowledged the challenges facing Hong Kong, but stressed that the region's future was intertwined with China's development.
"We must be aware of the complicated and changing situations facing Hong Kong," he said. "We must fully understand the important role of Hong Kong in our overall development strategy and strive to create a new pattern of mutually beneficial cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong."
Mr. Jiang's remarks were well-received by business leaders and members of the pro-Beijing camp in Hong Kong. However, they were met with skepticism by some pro-democracy activists, who argue that Beijing's support for Mr. Tung undermines Hong Kong's autonomy.
"The Chinese government's support for Tung Chee-hwa is a clear indication that they will continue to control Hong Kong's political development," said Joshua Wong, the leader of the now-disbanded pro-democracy group Demosisto. "We need a leader who can stand up to Beijing and fight for Hong Kong's interests."
Mr. Tung himself has remained relatively silent on the issue of democracy, instead focusing on economic and social issues facing Hong Kong.
"I will continue to work hand in hand with the central authorities and get things done for Hong Kong," he said in a statement. "We need to focus on Hong Kong's economy and livelihoods and ensure our prosperity and stability in the post-pandemic era."
As China continues to assert its influence over Hong Kong and its leadership, Mr. Tung's second term is likely to be marked by the ongoing struggle for political autonomy and self-determination in the region. While Mr. Jiang's endorsement may strengthen Mr. Tung's position, it remains to be seen whether he will be able to navigate the complex political landscape and maintain Hong Kong's unique identity in the face of Beijing's growing influence.
