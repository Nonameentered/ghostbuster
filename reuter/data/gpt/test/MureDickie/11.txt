Tsingtao Brewery, China's largest beer company, is facing stiff competition from foreign beer makers who have been eating into its market share, threatening its dominance in the country's beer industry.
According to a recent report by Euromonitor International, a market research firm, the market share of Tsingtao Brewery has been declining steadily over the past few years, from 23.2% in 2016 to 20.3% in 2020. Meanwhile, the market share of foreign beer brands like AB InBev's Budweiser and Carlsberg has been increasing steadily, from 17.7% in 2016 to 20.1% in 2020.
This trend has been attributed to a number of factors, including changing consumer tastes, the growth of e-commerce platforms, and the increasing popularity of craft beer.
Changing Consumer Tastes
As China's middle class has grown and become more affluent, their tastes in beer have also changed. Many consumers are now looking for higher quality, more flavorful beer, rather than the mass-produced lagers that Tsingtao Brewery has been traditionally known for.
To meet this demand, foreign beer brands have been introducing new and innovative products, such as flavored and craft beers, which are often marketed as more premium and high-end than traditional lagers.
According to a survey by market research firm Nielsen, younger consumers in China are increasingly interested in trying new and different types of beer, with 77% of respondents saying that they had tried a new beer brand in the past three months.
E-Commerce Platforms
Another factor contributing to Tsingtao Brewery's declining market share is the growth of e-commerce platforms, which have made it easier for consumers to buy imported beers online.
Platforms like Taobao and Tmall, which are owned by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, have become increasingly popular among Chinese consumers, who are now able to purchase a wide range of imported beers from around the world with just a few clicks.
This has given foreign beer brands an advantage over local Chinese brands, as they are now able to reach new consumers in regions where they may not have a physical presence.
Craft Beer
Finally, the increasing popularity of craft beer has also contributed to Tsingtao Brewery's declining market share, as consumers are looking for more flavorful, unique, and locally-produced beers.
This trend has been driven by a number of factors, including the growing interest in craft beer among younger consumers, the rise of online beer clubs and forums, and the growth of small, independent breweries across China.
According to a recent report by the China Alcoholic Drinks Association, there are now more than 10,000 craft beer producers in China, with the market for craft beer expected to grow by 20% annually in the coming years.
What Tsingtao Brewery is Doing to Fight Back
In response to these challenges, Tsingtao Brewery has been trying to adapt to changing consumer tastes and market conditions by introducing new and innovative products and marketing strategies.
For example, the company has launched a range of flavored and craft beers to appeal to younger, more discerning consumers, while also focusing on expanding its distribution channels and partnerships with online platforms like Tmall.
In addition, Tsingtao Brewery has also been working to improve its supply chain and logistics operations, in order to stay competitive with foreign beer brands that are able to offer faster and more efficient distribution services.
Despite these efforts, however, Tsingtao Brewery still faces a number of challenges in the coming years, as it tries to fend off competition from foreign beer brands and adapt to the changing tastes and preferences of Chinese consumers.
Overall, the decline of Tsingtao Brewery's market share is a reflection of the growing competition and dynamism of China's beer industry, which is rapidly evolving to meet the changing needs and desires of consumers in the country. Whether the company can successfully adapt to these changes and maintain its position as China's "King of Beers" remains to be seen.
