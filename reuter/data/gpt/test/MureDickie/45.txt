After months of tense negotiations, China and the United States have signed a new textile agreement, avoiding a potential trade war between the two economic giants.
The deal was signed by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, and will see the two countries work together to address long-standing issues in the textile trade.
"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with our partners in China," Tai said in a statement following the signing. "This deal represents a major step forward in our efforts to build a stronger, more stable relationship with one of our most important trading partners."
Under the terms of the agreement, China has agreed to take steps to address concerns raised by the U.S. textile industry over issues such as forced labor, intellectual property, and market access.
In particular, the deal will require China to increase its purchases of American-made textiles and apparel, and to improve enforcement of intellectual property rights within its own borders.
"This is good news for American textile workers and manufacturers," said Kim Glas, president and CEO of the National Council of Textile Organizations. "We look forward to working with the Biden administration and our partners in Congress to ensure that this agreement is fully implemented and enforced."
The new agreement comes after a series of high-profile trade disputes between China and the United States, including tariffs on goods worth billions of dollars and accusations of unfair trade practices on both sides.
The two countries have been negotiating the new textile agreement since earlier this year, with talks stalled at times over issues such as the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region, which the U.S. government has classified as genocide.
However, the signing of the deal represents a significant step forward in the relationship between the two countries, and could pave the way for further cooperation on trade and other issues.
"I am confident that this agreement will help to strengthen our economic ties with China and provide new opportunities for American businesses and workers," Tai said. "We look forward to a brighter future for our two countries and for the world as a whole."
The new textile agreement will also help to address concerns raised by labor rights groups about the treatment of workers in the global textile industry.
China is one of the world's largest producers of textiles and apparel, with exports worth around $294 billion in 2020 according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.
However, concerns have been raised about the use of forced labor in China's Xinjiang region, where the Chinese government has been accused of detaining Uyghur Muslims in so-called "re-education camps."
Under the new agreement, China has agreed to take steps to ensure that textiles and apparel produced in Xinjiang are not made using forced labor, and to work with international organizations to address human rights concerns in the region.
The U.S. government has also committed to working with its international partners to address these issues, and to support efforts to improve working conditions and protect the rights of textile workers worldwide.
The signing of the new textile agreement has been welcomed by industry stakeholders on both sides, with many expressing hope that it will help to promote greater economic cooperation and stability in the years ahead.
"We are pleased to see that the U.S. and China have come to an agreement that will benefit the textile industry and our workers," said Stephen Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. "This is a positive step forward for our two countries and for the global economy as a whole."
