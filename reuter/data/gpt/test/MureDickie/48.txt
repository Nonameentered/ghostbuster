In a major speech at the Asia Society in New York on Thursday, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out her vision for a "new model of great power relations" between China and the United States. The speech, which was keenly anticipated by China's leaders, reassured Beijing that a future Clinton presidency would prioritize engagement with China and deeper bilateral dialogue.
Clinton, a likely contender for the Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nomination, stressed the importance of building trust and cooperation between the world's two biggest economies, saying that the US needed to "rebalance to Asia" and "develop a multifaceted partnership with China."
She also praised Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent anti-corruption campaign, which has targeted high-ranking officials and members of the Communist Party. "I have followed with interest what President Xi has been doing in China," Clinton said, describing his campaign as a "positive step" towards good governance and transparency.
Clinton, who has strong credentials in China policy, having served as Secretary of State under President Barack Obama, emphasized the need for cooperation on issues ranging from climate change to cybersecurity and regional security. She said that the US and China needed to resolve their differences peacefully, and suggested that the two countries could work together to tackle global challenges such as the Ebola crisis.
Clinton's speech comes at a time of rising tensions between the US and China, with both countries engaged in a bitter rivalry over geopolitical influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The US has accused China of aggressive territorial expansion in the South China Sea, while China has accused the US of destabilizing the region by aligning itself with Japan and other allies.
However, Clinton suggested that the US could work with China on regional security issues, saying that the two countries had "shared interests" in promoting peace and stability. She also suggested that the US should be more open to Chinese investment in the US, saying that such investment could create jobs and promote economic growth.
Clinton's speech was well-received in China, where many analysts saw it as a positive signal that a future Clinton presidency would prioritize engagement with China and work towards building a more stable and cooperative relationship.
"The relationship between the US and China is the most important bilateral relationship in the world today," said Bonnie Glaser, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Clinton's speech signaled that she wants to deepen the dialogue with China and work towards a more productive relationship."
China's leaders have also expressed optimism about the prospects for improved US-China relations under a future Clinton presidency. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that China hoped that "the US will continue to demonstrate a positive and constructive role in promoting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region."
However, some analysts remain skeptical about the prospects for improved US-China relations under any future US president, given the deep-seated mistrust and competition between the two countries.
"The reality is that the US and China have fundamental differences that are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon," said Steve Tsang, a China expert at the University of Nottingham. "There are limits to what bilateral dialogue can achieve, particularly when it comes to issues of political ideology and values."
Despite these challenges, however, many experts agree that Clinton's speech was an important step towards a more positive and constructive relationship between the US and China.
"Clinton's speech was a signal that the US is committed to engaging with China in a productive way," said Professor Zhao Quansheng, a China expert at American University in Washington, D.C. "This is a welcome development, and a sign that the US is serious about building a more stable and cooperative relationship with China."
