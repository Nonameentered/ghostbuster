Moody's, the credit rating agency, has cautioned foreign lenders to brace for an unanticipated response from Chinese regulators in the event of an expected default by investment trust house (ITH). The warning from the global rating agency comes as ITH, one of China's domestically-operated trust firms, appears to be struggling with asset quality issues.
Credit risk, liquidity risk, and regulatory risk are the top challenges facing the Chinese trust industry, according to a recent report by Fitch Ratings. The outlook for the domestic trust market in China has worsened for 2021, as regulators tighten their grip on the industry to tackle systemic risk.
Moody's assessment of ITH is that the firm's financial position is vulnerable and that a default would have negative implications for foreign investors. The agency lists ITH's exposure to poorly-performing sectors, such as debt issued by electric vehicle manufacturer Byton, as a factor that could lead to a default scenario.
The main concern for investors, according to Moody's senior credit officer Ivan Chung, is the unpredictability of regulatory response in China. In an interview with CNBC, Chung said that foreign creditors need to be prepared for "surprises," as Chinese regulators could clamp down on capital flows or impose other measures to protect the domestic market.
"The problem is nobody knows what will be the reactions of the regulator or if there will be an impact from the broader market," Chung warned. "That's the main risk."
China's trust sector has been under pressure in recent months, with regulators clamping down on risky lending practices and tightening supervision. The crackdown comes as authorities look to address long-standing concerns around shadow banking and financial stability.
The trust sector has played a key role in China's shadow banking system, with firms offering high-yielding investments to individuals and businesses outside the traditional banking system. However, the sector has been associated with a host of risks, including default risks and regulatory risks.
The industry's troubles have intensified this year, with a high-profile default by China Huarong Asset Management, a state-owned financial firm, in April. Huarong's debt woes have triggered waves of selling in China's onshore bond market, with investors spooked by the potential contagion risks in the sector.
Now, investors are bracing for more defaults, with ITH seen as a likely candidate. The firm has exposure to sectors ranging from real estate to renewable energy, and investors have reportedly been withdrawing funds in recent weeks.
The risks to foreign investors are compounded by the fact that most of the securities issued by ITH are sold to offshore funds, including in Hong Kong. The lack of transparency around ITH's assets and liabilities has also raised concerns.
Moody's warnings are a stark reminder of the risks associated with China's shadow banking system and the broader financial sector. The regulatory crackdown is likely to continue as authorities seek to address the risks and strengthen financial stability, but the unpredictability of the responses from regulators adds to the uncertainty around investing in China.
For foreign investors, the key takeaway is to be prepared for turbulence and to closely monitor the regulatory environment. The risks are considerable, but the potential rewards for those who navigate the market successfully could be significant.
