China's bold and comprehensive plan to eradicate extreme poverty has fallen short of its target, according to analysts. While the country has made significant progress in fighting destitution over the last few years, it has been unable to fully achieve its goal of eliminating absolute poverty.
The Chinese government launched its ambitious campaign in 2015, pledging to lift everyone above the poverty line by 2020. The initiative involved a range of measures, including job creation, relocation of people from impoverished areas, and investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
Over the last five years, China has lifted close to 100 million people out of extreme poverty, and the poverty rate has declined from 10.2% in 2012 to less than 1.5% in 2020. However, analysts say that the government's definition of poverty is too narrow, and many people are still struggling to make ends meet.
"The Chinese government defines poverty in terms of an income threshold, but the threshold is set too low and does not take into account the high cost of living in many areas," said Ding Shuang, head of Greater China economic research at Standard Chartered Bank. "Many people who are slightly above the official poverty line still face significant financial challenges and cannot afford basic necessities."
China's poverty line is set at an annual income of 2,300 yuan ($350) per person. However, in many parts of the country, especially rural areas, the cost of living is much higher than that. For example, in some remote villages, the price of basic goods such as food, clothing, and medicine is several times higher than in urban areas.
Another factor that has hindered China's anti-poverty efforts is the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak of the virus and subsequent lockdowns and travel restrictions have disrupted many of the government's poverty alleviation projects, especially in the most remote and impoverished regions.
"The pandemic has created a lot of uncertainty and challenges for China's anti-poverty campaign," said Ding. "Many of the income-generating projects and employment opportunities have been put on hold, and the government has had to redirect resources to deal with the health crisis."
Moreover, some analysts argue that China's definition of poverty is too narrow. By focusing solely on income, the government ignores other important aspects, such as access to healthcare, education, and social protection. "There are many people who are technically not poor according to the government's income threshold but do not have access to basic public services," said Li Shi, a professor of economics at Beijing Normal University.
Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to its poverty alleviation campaign. In March, President Xi Jinping declared that China had achieved a "complete victory" over extreme poverty, although he acknowledged that "the battle to overcome poverty and achieve common prosperity is far from over."
The government has pledged to continue its efforts to improve the lives of the people in the country's poorest regions. This includes investing in infrastructure, education, healthcare, environmental protection, and other social programs. According to official estimates, China will spend more than 1.3 trillion yuan ($200 billion) on poverty alleviation in 2020, up from 18.3 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) in 2012.
Analysts say that China's effort to eradicate poverty is an important achievement, but more needs to be done to ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities and public services. "The government has made significant progress in fighting poverty, but we need to look beyond the official numbers and address the underlying issues, such as income inequality, lack of education, and discrimination," said Li. "Only then can we truly achieve a society of common prosperity."
