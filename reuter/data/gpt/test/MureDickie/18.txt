Chinaâ€™s economy achieved steady growth and low inflation in the year 1996, according to the latest report released by the National Bureau of Statistics. The country's GDP growth rate was 8.8%, with inflation at only 4.2%. These positive economic indicators are attributed to a successful economic policy that emphasized structural reforms, international trade and investment, and keeping the value of the yuan stable.
The rapid growth in China's economy was mainly driven by its vast industrial sector. The country's export-driven manufacturing firms enjoyed increasing overseas demand, while the services sector also made contributions to economic growth. In addition, the agricultural sector experienced stable and moderate growth due to technological improvements and rural reform.
Meanwhile, the government's initiatives to keep inflation low were also successful. The central bank aggressively controlled money supply through targeted monetary policies, such as reducing bank lending rates and lowering reserve requirements. In addition, there was a restructuring of state-owned enterprises and deregulation of product markets, which led to increased market competition that further moderated prices.
Reform measures like these not only boosted economic growth and kept inflation low, but also increased employment and improved living standards for ordinary citizens. With China becoming more open and integrated into the global economy, the country's potential for economic development is enormous.
Further, experts predict that 1997 will bring even more improvements for China's economy. There are indications that the inflation rate in China will remain low and stable while economic growth will continue to be strong. These improvements are underpinned by a positive outlook for China's trade with other countries. 
In general, the Asian region experienced a collective decline in economic growth rates in 1996. However, China's success in maintaining favorable conditions, growth, and low inflation, helped it stand out among the rest. Furthermore, economic analysts suggest that this stability has the potential to attract more foreign investment to China.
The overall prognosis for China's economy is quite promising. China is expected to make further inroads into the global economy, and its reform policies are expected to attract more foreign investment. China's economy has effectively outperformed many developed and developing economies in recent years. As China shifts its economic focus, innovates and reforms, the country is sure to continue on this remarkable growth trajectory.
