Mekong River nations agree to push cross-border cooperation for economic development
The Mekong River countries, which include Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, have agreed to push cross-border cooperation for economic development. The aim is to promote sustainable, inclusive economic growth and reduce poverty in the region.
At a recent meeting in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, leaders of the six nations expressed their commitment to deepen cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, infrastructure development, tourism, and agriculture. The meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith of Laos, which holds the rotating chairmanship of Mekong-Japan cooperation.
According to a joint statement released by the leaders, they recognized the need to enhance regional connectivity and promote better economic integration among their countries. They pledged to facilitate trade and investment flows by reducing barriers to cross-border trade and investment, and by enhancing the efficiency of customs procedures and logistics.
The leaders also agreed to collaborate on infrastructure development, particularly in the areas of transport, energy, and telecommunications. They recognized the importance of building high-quality and sustainable infrastructure that can boost economic growth and improve the livelihoods of their people.
In addition, the leaders expressed their commitment to promote sustainable tourism that benefits local communities and preserves the region's natural and cultural heritage. They also pledged to prioritize cooperation in agriculture and rural development, which are key sectors for poverty reduction in the Mekong countries.
The Mekong region has a combined population of over 300 million people and a total GDP of around $800 billion. Despite its vast potential, the region still faces many challenges, including poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. Cross-border cooperation is seen as a key strategy for addressing these challenges and unlocking the region's economic potential.
The meeting in Vientiane was also attended by representatives of the Mekong River Commission (MRC), which is an intergovernmental organization that coordinates the management and development of the Mekong River. The MRC plays a crucial role in ensuring that the river is used sustainably and that its benefits are shared equitably among the Mekong countries.
In a separate statement, the MRC welcomed the leaders' commitment to cross-border cooperation and urged them to promote the sustainable use of the Mekong River's resources. The MRC highlighted the need to address the impacts of hydropower development, which can have significant social and environmental consequences, and encouraged the countries to work together to address these challenges.
The meeting in Vientiane was seen as a positive step towards deeper regional integration and cooperation in the Mekong region. However, many challenges remain, including the need to address the impacts of climate change, promote social inclusion and gender equality, and strengthen institutions and governance.
The leaders of the six Mekong countries pledged to continue working together to address these challenges and promote sustainable, inclusive economic growth in the region. As Prime Minister Sisoulith noted, "We are committed to enhancing cross-border cooperation and connectivity for the benefit of our people, especially the poor and vulnerable, and to achieving our shared vision of a prosperous and sustainable Mekong region."
