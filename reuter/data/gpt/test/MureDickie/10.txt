Yangon, Myanmar - The Burmese Minister for International Cooperation, U Kyaw Tin, has urged Japan to release a multi-billion yen loan that was suspended after the country's democratic suppression. However, Japanese officials have remained cautious about lending to Myanmar.
The loan, worth approximately 500 billion yen ($4.5 billion), was originally approved by Japan in February 2021. However, it was suspended by the Japanese government in response to Myanmar's military coup in February, which saw the ousting of the democratically elected government and the subsequent arrest of political leaders including Aung San Suu Kyi.
Speaking at a press conference on Monday, U Kyaw Tin said that the loan was essential for Myanmar's recovery and development. He added that Japan "can play a major role in (the) revival of the country's economy," and urged Japanese officials to reconsider their decision to suspend the loan.
"We deeply regret that the Japanese government suspended the loan to Myanmar," U Kyaw Tin said. "We urgently request Japan to reconsider and to understand that the suspension of the loan can create negative impacts not only on Myanmar but also on the region as a whole."
The loan was part of a larger economic cooperation package between Japan and Myanmar that was signed in 2020. The package aimed to support Myanmar's economic development and improve infrastructure in the country, including the construction of a mega-bridge that would link Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, with the rest of the country.
However, since the coup, Japan has joined other western countries in imposing sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders. Japanese officials have stated that the suspension of the loan was meant to send a message to Myanmar's military regime that their actions would not be tolerated.
Japanese officials remain cautious about resuming the loan. "We are closely watching the situation in Myanmar, including the human rights situation and the democratic transition," said Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi at a press conference in Tokyo on Tuesday.
"We have been providing support to Myanmar, but we have also expressed our concerns to them," he added. "We will continue to work closely with the international community to support Myanmar's democratic transition."
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the coup earlier this year. Protests against the military regime have been ongoing, and the military has responded with violence and brutality, killing over 750 people and arresting thousands more.
Several western countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have imposed sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders and their business interests. The United Nations has also imposed targeted sanctions on individuals and organizations linked to the military regime.
Japan, as a major economic partner of Myanmar, can play a significant role in the country's recovery. However, the country's government remains cautious about resuming economic cooperation with Myanmar until there is progress in restoring democracy and human rights in the country.
"We hope that Myanmar will quickly restore democracy and we will continue to work towards that end with other countries," said Minister Motegi. "We want to support Myanmar's growth and development, but we want to do so in a way that maintains our commitment to human rights and democratic values."
