The Chinese government is placing pressure on countries around the world that have been supporting Taiwan, using its influence in the United Nations to stall peace processes in nations like Guatemala and punish governments that refuse to toe their line.
China has long maintained that Taiwan is a province of the country that deserves to be reintegrated, with the use of force if necessary. This has consistently been a sticking point for countries that support the democratic and self-governing island, leading to a growing international rift.
Recently, the Chinese government took its efforts to punish pro-Taiwan countries to new heights. In Guatemala, the UN-backed peace process has been hindered in part due to Chinese intervention. Beijing has been punishing Guatemala for its refusal to reverse its recognition of Taiwan by refusing to engage with the country on key peace negotiations. 
According to sources close to the situation, China has refused to attend any peace talks or negotiations in Guatemala, making it more difficult for the negotiations to proceed, and effectively blocking any hopes of a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict. 
In addition to stalling peace in Guatemala, China has also recently been exerting pressure on European nations who have been showing support for Taiwan. In a response that was widely criticized by human rights advocates, China banned all European Parliament officials from visiting Hong Kong and China. This was in a response to a resolution passed by the European Parliament that called for the country to release detained journalists, activists, and human rights lawyers from prison.
While these moves by China have been met with widespread criticism, some experts say that it is in line with the country's long-term goals. China is focused on becoming the dominant superpower in the world and has been increasingly putting pressure on countries around the world to fall in line with its own policies and plans.
However, this growing assertiveness by the Chinese government has led to some pushback from the international community. Countries such as the United States, Japan, and Australia have all grown increasingly wary of China, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the country's handling of it.
But despite the increasing pushback, China has continued to push its own agenda, using its clout within the United Nations and its growing influence around the world to punish those who do not fall in line with its plans. In the case of Guatemala, this has meant stalling peace processes, while in the case of European nations, it has meant freezing out officials altogether.
This latest move by China has raised concerns about the country's growing influence around the world and its willingness to use its position in the United Nations for its own political ends. Experts say that it is time for countries around the world to stand up to China and to push back against their attempts to exert control over other nations.
The growing rift between China and pro-Taiwan countries, as well as the Chinese government's recent actions in Guatemala, has only served to highlight the importance of upholding democratic values around the world and protecting the basic human rights of individuals everywhere.
It is uncertain how this latest move by China will play out in the international community and whether it will help to cement the country's reputation as a global superpower or cause a backlash against its aggressive tactics. However, one thing is certain: as long as China continues to use its influence to punish other countries, the world will be a worse off place.
