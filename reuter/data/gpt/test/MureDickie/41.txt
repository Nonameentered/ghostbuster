The father of Wang Dan, a prominent Chinese dissident who has been imprisoned multiple times for his outspoken activism, has spoken out against China's human rights record following the release of a report by the United States.
In the report, the U.S. State Department detailed numerous human rights abuses committed by the Chinese government, including arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances, and suppression of freedom of speech and assembly. The report also criticized China's treatment of ethnic minorities, particularly the Uighurs, who are interned in large-scale internment camps.
These findings have been met with condemnation from Wang Dan's father, who spoke to reporters from his home in the city of Shenyang.
"My son has been in and out of prison for years simply for speaking his mind," said Wang Tiexiong, himself a former political prisoner. "And he is only one of many who have suffered at the hands of the Chinese government for daring to challenge their authoritarian rule."
Wang Dan became a prominent figure in the pro-democracy movement that swept China in the late 1980s, leading protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Following the bloody crackdown by Chinese military forces on June 4, 1989, Wang was among the thousands of activists arrested and detained.
He was eventually released from prison in 1993, but was arrested again in 1995 and sentenced to 11 years in prison for his continued activism. Upon his release in 2004, Wang went into exile, remaining a vocal critic of the Chinese government from afar.
Wang's father, who himself spent several years in prison for his pro-democracy activism, has long been an advocate for human rights in China. But he says that recent events, including the crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and the treatment of the Uighurs, have pushed him to speak out even more forcefully.
"The Chinese government claims to be a responsible global power, but their actions say otherwise," he said. "They are a regime that crushes dissent and tramples on the basic rights of their citizens."
Wang Tiexiong's condemnation of China's human rights record comes as the country faces increased international scrutiny over its treatment of minority groups and its crackdown on dissent.
The U.S. report, which was released last week, is just the latest in a series of condemnations from the international community. The United Nations, for example, has repeatedly criticized China's treatment of the Uighurs, while the European Union has expressed concern over the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong.
But the Chinese government has pushed back against these criticisms, arguing that they are an interference in their domestic affairs.
"We are an independent sovereign state, and we will not allow any country to interfere in our internal affairs," said a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry in response to the U.S. report.
Despite the pushback from the Chinese government, Wang Tiexiong says he will continue to speak out against what he sees as an unjust regime.
"I know the dangers of speaking out against the government," he said. "But I cannot stay silent while my son and so many others suffer for simply wanting a better life for themselves and their families."
Wang Dan, who is currently living in the United States, has praised his father's activism, saying that he is proud to have such a courageous parent.
"My father has always been a fighter for justice and freedom," he said. "I am grateful for his support, and I know that he will never give up in his fight for a better China."
