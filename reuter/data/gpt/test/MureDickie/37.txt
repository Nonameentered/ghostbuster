Washington, D.C. - Negotiators from China and the United States have made progress on a textile trade accord during their latest round of talks in Washington, sources close to the negotiations said late Wednesday. However, the talks may stretch late into the night as both sides remain cautious in their approach.
The talks began on Monday and were initially expected to last just two days. But sources say that negotiators have been making significant progress, discussing ways to strengthen intellectual property rights protections for both countries and improving market access for American textile and apparel manufacturers in China.
One of the key issues being discussed is the ongoing trade imbalance between the two countries, with China exporting far more textile and apparel products to the United States than it imports in return. This has led to a significant loss of jobs in the United States, and President Joe Biden has made it a top priority to address the issue.
The talks are being led by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. Tai has been working to build a strong relationship with Beijing since taking office earlier this year, and the textile negotiations are seen as an early test of her ability to deliver results on trade.
The progress made in the talks has been welcomed by textile industry leaders in the United States, who say that they have been hit hard by years of cheap imports from China. Some have warned, however, that the negotiations could be derailed by other issues, such as tensions over Taiwan or human rights concerns in China's Xinjiang region.
"Anything can happen at this stage," said David Trumbull, vice president of the National Textile Association. "We remain cautiously optimistic that a deal can be reached, but there are still many hurdles to overcome."
The talks have been complicated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted global trade flows and made it difficult for negotiators to meet in person. Both sides have been negotiating virtually, with Tai and Liu meeting online for several hours each day.
Despite the challenges, sources say that the negotiations have been conducted in a positive and constructive manner, with both sides eager to reach an agreement. In recent months, the Biden administration has shown a willingness to engage with China on issues where there is a potential for cooperation, while also taking a tough line on issues such as human rights and intellectual property theft.
The textile trade accord is just one of several issues on the agenda for the talks this week, which also include discussions on climate change, cybersecurity, and other trade issues. This latest round of negotiations comes just weeks after President Biden held his first virtual summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which was seen as an important step in reducing tensions between the two countries.
As the talks stretch late into the night, both sides will be hoping to make further progress on the textile trade accord and other issues. While a comprehensive agreement may still be some way off, the fact that both sides are engaging in productive and constructive dialogue is a positive sign for the future of the U.S.-China relationship.
