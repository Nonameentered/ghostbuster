A group of Chinese academics has slammed a recent report published by the US government, calling it "malicious and slanderous." The report, titled "2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices," accuses China of human rights violations in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang.
In a statement released on Monday, a group of Chinese scholars and researchers, including legal experts, political scientists, and social scientists, accused the US of trying to interfere in China's internal affairs. They also accused the US of spreading lies and misinformation about China's human rights record.
"We strongly object to the malicious and slanderous statements made by the US in its so-called 'human rights report,'" the statement said. "The US has no right to interfere in China's internal affairs, and it is not qualified to judge the human rights situation in China."
The statement also accused the US of hypocrisy, pointing out human rights violations in the US itself. "The US has a long history of human rights violations, with systemic racism, police brutality, and a lack of healthcare for millions of Americans," the statement said. "The US should focus on solving its own problems before criticizing other countries."
The Chinese academics also defended China's actions in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang, saying they were necessary to maintain social stability and protect national security. The statement accused the US of supporting separatist movements in these regions and using them as a tool to interfere in China's internal affairs.
The statement comes amid growing tensions between China and the US over trade, technology, and human rights issues. The US has accused China of committing genocide against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, a charge that China denies. China has also been criticized for its crackdown on democracy activists in Hong Kong and its treatment of Tibetan separatists.
The Chinese government has dismissed the US report as "biased" and "unfounded." In a press conference on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the report "ignores facts and truth, and makes groundless accusations against China." He also accused the US of using human rights issues as a tool to interfere in China's internal affairs.
The Chinese academics' statement is likely to further strain relations between China and the US. It also highlights the growing divide between China's view of human rights and the Western view. China argues that its actions are necessary to maintain stability and protect the country's sovereignty, while the West sees them as violations of human rights and democratic values.
The statement also reflects growing nationalist sentiment in China, with many Chinese people feeling that the country is being unfairly targeted by the West. This sentiment has been fueled by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment in the US and other Western countries.
The US report is unlikely to have any impact on China's actions in Hong Kong, Tibet, or Xinjiang. Chinese leaders have shown little willingness to change course, and the country's economic and political power make it difficult for other countries to pressure China into changing its policies.
However, the report and the response from Chinese academics highlight the growing divide between China and the US on human rights issues. It also underscores the challenge of finding common ground on issues that are fundamental to Western values, but that China sees as a threat to its stability and sovereignty. The tension is sure to persist, with both sides unlikely to back down anytime soon.
