AT&T Raises Basic State-to-State Call Rates by 5.9% Effective Dec. 1, Adding an Average of 60 Cents a Month to Residential Bills
AT&T recently announced that it is increasing its basic state-to-state call rates by 5.9%, effective Dec. 1. This will add an average of 60 cents a month to residential bills. The increase is the first of its kind in nearly three years, according to the company.
The telecommunications giant stated that the rate increase is necessary to offset rising costs associated with delivering long-distance calls. The company also cited the need to invest in its networks to keep up with evolving customer needs.
AT&T's basic long-distance calling plan will see an increase from 7.4 cents per minute to 7.8 cents per minute. The change will affect both residential and business customers using the company's traditional long-distance services.
The rate increase will not only apply to state-to-state calls but also to calls made from the United States to Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Marianas. International calls will not be affected by the increase.
In a statement released by AT&T, the company acknowledged that the rate increase may be a burden for some customers and encouraged them to explore alternate calling options. The company suggests that customers use their mobile phones or switch to their unlimited calling plans. AT&T also offers its internet-based phone service, AT&T Phone, which has unlimited calling plans starting at $20 a month.
Additionally, the company has reminded customers that they can contact AT&T customer service to explore options for reducing their monthly bill. Customers can also review their account online to see which services they are using and how much they are costing them.
The AT&T rate increase comes as other telecommunications companies are revamping their traditional calling services. Rivals such as T-Mobile and Sprint are offering unlimited calling plans that include unlimited texting and data. These plans are popular with younger consumers who prefer to communicate through apps and messaging services, rather than making traditional phone calls.
It remains to be seen how customers will respond to the rate increase. Some may be willing to pay the additional charges, while others may seek alternate calling options or switch to other providers. The timing of the rate increase, just before the holiday season, may also factor into customers' decisions.
The rate increase comes amid a turbulent year for AT&T. The company faced regulatory challenges in its attempt to merge with Time Warner, and its flagship streaming service, HBO Max, has struggled to gain traction in a crowded streaming market.
AT&T's traditional calling services have also faced stiff competition from internet-based calling services such as Skype and WhatsApp. These services offer users the ability to make calls and send messages over the internet, often for free or a low cost.
The rate increase may be a way for AT&T to encourage customers to switch to its internet-based calling service, AT&T Phone. The service allows customers to make calls over their internet connection, rather than through traditional phone lines, potentially saving them money on their monthly bill.
The rate increase may also be a sign of things to come for traditional calling services. As more consumers move to internet-based services, traditional providers may face challenges maintaining their existing networks and increasing rates to cover their costs.
In conclusion, AT&T's rate increase is a reminder of the changing telecommunications landscape. Customers may need to consider alternate calling options or invest in newer technology to save money on their monthly bill. The rate increase, while a burden for some customers, is necessary for the company to invest in its networks and keep up with customer needs. It remains to be seen how customers will respond to the rate increase, but it may be a sign of things to come for traditional calling services.
