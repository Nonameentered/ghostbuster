Wireless companies that offer rural services expect rapid growth in the coming years thanks to the lack of competition from their urban-focused counterparts. The gap in coverage leaves a significant opportunity for rural firms to expand their market share. Currently, most of the rural areas in the US are served by specialized wireless carriers. There is little to no presence of PCS (Personal Communication Systems) companies in these parts.
The big players in the wireless industry typically concentrate on metropolitan areas, leaving the rural areas under-served when it comes to wireless coverage. There are only a few providers that focus solely on rural sites, which creates an opportunity for them to grow without competition.
The opportunity is tied to the fact that as much of the country becomes technologically advanced, there will remain a significant population that needs wireless services. The rural population has grown accustomed to using their mobile devices, and many businesses rely heavily on online connectivity. With increased demand comes increased competition.
Analysts predict that the industry will see a significant shift in the coming years. Over 50% of the population still resides in rural areas, and by 2025, the number of Americans living outside cities is projected to reach over 64 million. The rural wireless market has the potential to be as lucrative as the urban markets. Over the years, rural services have grown to offer more than just wireless internet and phone services. They now provide critical infrastructure for IoT devices in fields such as agriculture, tracking and monitoring services, and home security systems.
In the coming years, there will likely be an uptick in mergers and acquisitions of rural companies that have been successful in carving out their niche. The rural market is fragmented with no clear leader, giving smaller companies an opportunity to step in and create a footprint in the space.
Some businesses are already reaping the rewards of a rural-specific focus. For example, Patriot Mobile, a Texas-based wireless carrier, has reported record profits over the last year, seeing significant growth in subscribers. CEO of Patriot Mobile, Ryan Dickerson, attributes their success to their focus on areas that have been largely ignored by the larger carriers. "We have a particular focus to support conservative values and have offices in Texas, all located 100% in Republican districts," he explained in a recent interview. "Our customers appreciate that and itâ€™s helping to drive success, of course, in Texas but also in other rural areas where this message resonates."
With smartphones and devices becoming an essential part of daily life, rural wireless is forecast to become a key driver of growth for the telecoms industry. In the coming years, we can expect to see more diversity in the telecoms space, as more providers break into the rural space. Customers will also benefit from improved service, more advanced technologies, and, potentially, lower prices as competition heats up.
