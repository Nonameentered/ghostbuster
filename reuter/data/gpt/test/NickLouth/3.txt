AT&T teams up with Shaklee Corp. to bring face-to-face sales pitches for long-distance service to your doorstep.
AT&T has partnered with nutrition and wellness company Shaklee Corp. to offer a new approach to its sales strategy, bringing long-distance service sales pitches to potential customers' doorsteps.
Shaklee Corp. is known for its direct selling business model, where independent distributors provide personalized wellness solutions directly to customers. This direct approach has proven successful for Shaklee, and AT&T hopes to adapt this strategy to its own long-distance service sales tactics.
The partnership will launch in select cities across the United States, with Shaklee distributors offering AT&T long-distance service packages during their in-home wellness consultations. This new strategy aims to reach customers who may not be aware or have not considered AT&T's long-distance services, and to provide a more personalized sales experience.
"Partnering with Shaklee Corp. gives us the opportunity to reach more potential customers and create a more personalized sales experience for them," said Jill Han, Vice President of Marketing for AT&T. "We believe this approach will not only benefit our business but will also provide convenience and ease for our customers."
Shaklee distributors who choose to participate in the program will receive training and resources from AT&T to help them effectively market and sell the long-distance services. In addition, AT&T will offer attractive commission rates for distributors who successfully sell these service packages to their clients.
"We are excited to partner with AT&T and bring their long-distance service offerings to our customers," said Roger Barnett, Chairman and CEO of Shaklee Corp. "This partnership is a win-win, as it provides an additional revenue stream for our distributors and offers customers a new and convenient way to access AT&T's services."
The partnership comes at a time when AT&T is looking to expand its customer base and innovative sales strategies. With more consumers turning to digital platforms and mobile devices to research and purchase products and services, company officials believe that a more personalized and face-to-face sales approach will effectively reach a wider audience.
"Providing a personalized and customer-focused sales experience is key for our success. By partnering with Shaklee Corp., we can offer an extra touchpoint for customers to learn more about our long-distance service offerings," said Han.
While some may think that the face-to-face approach may not be as effective in a world where instant gratification can be achieved through online purchases, AT&T is confident this strategy will be a success. With more and more companies offering personalized and door-to-door services, consumers may appreciate the convenience and attention provided by this type of sales model.
"Direct selling and face-to-face sales still have a significant place in the modern sales landscape. By partnering with a company like Shaklee Corp. that specializes in this type of sales strategy, we believe we can effectively adapt to today's evolving market," said Han.
The partnership between AT&T and Shaklee Corp. is set to launch in the coming months, and company officials are optimistic about its potential to reach new and untapped customers.
"We look forward to seeing the results of this partnership and working together to provide the best possible customer experience," said Barnett. "With AT&T's long-distance service packages and Shaklee's personalized and direct sales approach, we believe we can make a real impact on the marketplace."
By leveraging Shaklee Corp.'s direct selling model and incorporating it into the company's sales strategy, AT&T is taking steps to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing sales landscape. With this new partnership, they hope to bridge the gap between digital marketing and in-person sales, offering customers a truly unique and personalized experience.
