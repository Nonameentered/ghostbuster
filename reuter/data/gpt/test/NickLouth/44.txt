Citizens Utilities Co. is aiming to expand its services by becoming a top telephone company in the United States through acquiring other companies. This Tucson, Arizona-based company was founded in 1936 and has been providing gas, electricity, and water services to many American cities and states for over 80 years. Now, as the needs of customers change, they have decided to focus on building their telephone services.
The decision to focus on telephone services was made as the company’s leadership saw a gap in the market. Citizen Utilities Co. CEO, Robert M. Firkser, said “We believe that making acquisitions is our best bet for growing. By acquiring other companies, we can grow our business while offering new products to our existing customers. In addition, by tapping into telecommunication, we are unlocking the potential for future growth”.
This decision is coming at a time when the need for reliable and accessible telecommunication services is high. With the increasing use of the internet, the demand for broadband is on the rise. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people were forced to work from home, causing a significant increase in internet usage across the country.
Citizens Utilities Co. intends to make quality communications services available to everyone while making sure that it is affordable. In order to achieve this aim, the company will have to look into making considerable investments in the acquisition process, which would see getting their hands on some of the best telecom companies in the U.S.
There are obstacles to overcome when it comes to making acquisitions, as the competition from competitors is high. The United States has many big-name telecom companies that have already made a name for themselves. Despite this, Robert Firkser believes that the opportunity to grow in the industry is achievable. By combining telecoms services with the utility services, Citizens Utilities Co. can provide a more comprehensive service to their customers.
As part of its expansion strategy, Citizens Utilities Co. has employed a team of professionals to help with their acquisitions. They have already started evaluating possible targets while considering the competition. The company is not just focusing on large telecoms companies, but also smaller, up-and-coming firms that can complement their services. They have made some gains in the acquisition process, and the company is already in negotiation talks with a few small telecom companies.
The acquisition process is not an easy feat, as there are regulatory hurdles to overcome. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and the Sherman Act all have a role to play in approving the acquisition deals, which can slow down the process. However, Robert Firkser is confident that the company can navigate through these hurdles and achieve their short-term and long-term goals.
Citizens Utilities Co’s expansion strategy could see the company become a top telecommunications company in the United States and bring in considerable profits. However, the company understands that they have to provide a service that customers are happy with for it to be successful. Therefore, they have pledged to make sure that their services are of the highest quality, offering affordable rates for their customers.
In conclusion, Citizens Utilities Co. has made the decision to expand its services by acquiring telecom companies. The move towards becoming a top U.S. telecoms company is not an easy task, but the company has employed professionals to help navigate the complex process of making acquisitions while maintaining quality service for their customers. If it can successfully navigate the regulatory hurdles, this move could bring in significant profits for the entity. Time will tell if they are successful.
