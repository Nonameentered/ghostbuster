AT&T Corp. Faces Unpaid Bills Despite Increase in Operating Profits
AT&T Corp. has reported an increase in operating profits, however, the telecommunications giant is facing a new problem, unpaid bills. AT&T's operating profits rose to $3.5 billion for the second quarter of 2021, up from $1.2 billion in the previous quarter. However, the company is struggling to collect outstanding debts, including unpaid bills from both business and individual customers.
Analysts argue that the missed payments are a consequence of the pandemic, as individuals and businesses have been hit hard by the economic repercussions of COVID-19. In addition, there is a growing concern that AT&T's customer service may be deteriorating, further exacerbating the issue.
Cameron Davis, director of research at Onward Equity Research, stated, "AT&T's recent revenue trend reflects the broader operating environment for the telecom industry over the past 18 months, which has been negatively impacted by the pandemic. The major players in the industry are grappling to offset declining revenue within their traditional core businesses."
According to AT&T's latest quarterly report, the company experienced a decline in its mobility services unit. This unit, which includes wireless phone and data services, saw revenues drop to $18.9 billion, a decline of 22.9%. AT&T attributed the decline to a loss of postpaid phone customers.
Despite the difficulties, AT&T is optimistic about its future prospects, pointing to the successful launch of its streaming services, HBO Max and Discovery Plus. The company reported that HBO Max has 47 million domestic subscribers, and 67.5 million subscribers worldwide. The launch of Discovery Plus in January 2021 attracted eight million subscribers during the first few months of operation. The company aims to reach 120 million subscribers globally across its various streaming services by 2025.
AT&T CEO John Stankey said, "We're pleased with the progress we're making to transform our business, and we're confident in our ability to manage through current industry transitions and emerge from the pandemic in a strong position."
The current situation is not unique to AT&T. Other telecom companies are reporting the same issues with unpaid bills, as individuals and businesses struggle with the pandemic's economic repercussions.
According to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 11% of consumers were behind on their bills in June 2021. This was a slight improvement from December 2020 when 13% of respondents were late on payments. The survey also revealed that late payments were more prevalent among lower-income households, renters, those with less education, and people of color.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also conducted a survey of small businesses in June 2021, which found that 41% of businesses were experiencing financial difficulties resulting from the pandemic. Of those struggling, 67% were behind on rent payments, and 63% were behind on utility payments.
The situation is not expected to improve anytime soon. As the Delta variant continues to surge, and the threat of further lockdowns and restrictions looms, businesses and individuals may continue to struggle to pay their bills.
AT&T is taking steps to address the problem, including adding more customer service agents and improving its digital offerings. The company has also extended payment plans for customers who are struggling financially.
The telecommunications giant is not alone in experiencing financial difficulties. Many businesses have been hit hard by the pandemic, including retail, hospitality, and the airline industry.
The renewed focus on unpaid bills highlights the need for strong customer service and support. AT&T's customer service has been widely criticized in recent years, with complaints ranging from long wait times, incorrect billing, and lack of resolution of problems. Improving customer service will be crucial for the company's future success, as it looks to compete with rivals such as Verizon and T-Mobile.
In conclusion, AT&T is facing a new challenge in the form of unpaid bills, despite an increase in operating profits. The pandemic has taken a toll on individuals and businesses, leading to financial difficulties and missed payments. AT&T is taking steps to address the problem, but the situation is not expected to improve anytime soon. The company's focus on customer service will be crucial in the coming months as it looks to emerge from the pandemic in a strong position.
