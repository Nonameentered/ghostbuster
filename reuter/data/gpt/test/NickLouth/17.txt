The division operates in 20 states, including California, New York, and Texas, and has more than 2 million customers.
In a statement, Qwest CEO Joe Nacchio praised Bingaman's "deep understanding of the telecommunications industry and her extensive experience working with regulators and policymakers at all levels."
"I am confident that Anne will be able to lead our local telecommunications division to even greater heights, and help us continue to provide our customers with the latest in cutting-edge technology and top-notch customer service," Nacchio said.
