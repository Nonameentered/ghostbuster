Eastman Kodak Co Sees Innovation as Key to Protecting Profits
The Eastman Kodak Co, popularly known as Kodak, is an American technology company that has been in business for over a century. Kodak, which is based in Rochester, New York, was once the leader in photography and camera technology. However, the digital age has overtaken the company, causing Kodak to lose its market share and fall into bankruptcy in 2012.
Despite its struggles, Kodak has been working hard to regain its footing and stay relevant in the ever-evolving tech industry. Innovation has been a key area of focus for the company, as it is continuously seeking opportunities to introduce new products and services to the market.
Kodak CEO Jim Continenza recently said that innovation is essential to Kodak's future success and its ability to protect its profits. In an interview with Reuters, Continenza stated that Kodak's ultimate goal is "to build out a platform of products and services that will be sustainable for the long-term."
One of the latest innovative products from Kodak is its new smartphone, the Kodak Ektra. This phone combines Kodak's signature camera technology with modern smartphone features, making it a unique and appealing option for photography enthusiasts.
In addition, Kodak has also been focusing on expanding its printing business. The company recently acquired the commercial imaging division of Cinesta for $340 million, which is expected to significantly boost Kodak's printing capabilities.
Kodak's push towards innovation has also extended into the field of blockchain technology. In January 2018, the company announced its intention to launch a blockchain-based platform for managing digital rights and royalties for photographers and musicians. KodakOne, which is powered by blockchain technology, is designed to protect and safeguard the intellectual property of its users.
Furthermore, Kodak has also announced plans to launch KodakCoin, a cryptocurrency that will be used to pay photographers for their work. KodakCoin is expected to provide a more secure and transparent way for photographers and agencies to manage their finances.
These innovative moves by Kodak have gotten them noticed in the tech industry once again, with investors expressing renewed confidence in the company's future. Kodak's stock has risen significantly since the announcement of KodakOne and KodakCoin, and analysts believe these new ventures could help the company regain its position as a leader in the tech industry.
While it remains to be seen whether Kodak can fully turn around its fortunes, it is clear that the company's focus on innovation has been a step in the right direction. With the introduction of new products and services, as well as its foray into blockchain technology, the company is positioning itself for long-term success. The future looks bright for this once-iconic brand.
