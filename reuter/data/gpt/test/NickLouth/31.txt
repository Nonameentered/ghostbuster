SBC Communications Inc, the US telecommunication giant, is predicting that the demand for wireless services will continue to soar in 1997. The company has attributed this to the steady increase in mobile phone ownership and the acceleration of data usage through wireless devices.
According to the latest report by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), there are over 350 million mobile phone users in the US alone. This marks a significant rise from just 110 million users in 1997, indicating a steady annual growth rate of around 8.3%.
SBC Communications is a significant player in the US wireless market, with its wholly-owned subsidiary AT&T Wireless Services being the second-largest wireless network operator in the country. The company is currently looking to build on this position and expand its wireless offerings.
The company's CEO, Michael Armstrong, has said that he expects demand for wireless services to continue to grow amid increasing use of data and digital services. He has cited the increasing number of connected devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices, as evidence of this trend.
Armstrong has also highlighted the potential of 5G wireless technology, which promises faster speeds and improved network capacity compared to existing 4G networks. SBC Communications has been investing in 5G technology over the past year, with plans to launch a 5G network later this year.
The CEO said that SBC Communications is committed to leading in the 5G space and is confident that the technology will drive significant growth for the company in the coming years. He added that the company is looking to expand its wireless offerings beyond mobile phones and into areas such as connected cars, smart homes, and public safety.
The demand for wireless services has already been evident in the telecom giant's latest earnings report, which revealed that wireless revenue increased by over 2% compared to the previous year. The rise in wireless revenue was driven by a 1.3% increase in the number of wireless subscribers and a 0.8% increase in average revenue per user.
SBC Communication's bullish outlook on wireless services has been echoed by other industry players, including Verizon and T-Mobile, both of whom have reported strong demand for wireless services in recent quarters. T-Mobile, in particular, has been aggressively gaining market share with its "Un-carrier" strategy, which offers unlimited data plans and other perks to customers.
The telecom industry is also waiting for the much-hyped merger between T-Mobile and Sprint to get regulatory approval. The $26 billion merger is expected to create a new wireless giant with the potential to shake up the industry even further.
Overall, SBC Communications' prediction of strong demand for wireless services in 1997 is reflective of broader trends in the industry. As more devices become connected and demand for data continues to grow, companies that are investing in technologies such as 5G are poised to benefit.
