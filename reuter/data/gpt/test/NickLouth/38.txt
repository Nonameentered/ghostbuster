ATLANTA, GA - BellSouth Corp, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, has exceeded its earnings expectations for the third quarter with strong growth in access lines and cellular customers.
The company reported that it earned $0.54 per share in the quarter, higher than the expected $0.51 per share. Its revenue also rose to $2.30 billion from $2.16 billion a year ago, beating Wall Street's expectations of $2.28 billion.
BellSouth credited its success to the growth in access lines and cellular customers. The company added 84,000 new access lines in the third quarter, bringing the total to 19.3 million. It also gained 196,000 new wireless customers, bringing its total to 14.3 million.
"Our investments in network infrastructure and customer service have paid off with strong growth in our customer base," said BellSouth Chairman and CEO, Duane Ackerman. "We continue to see strong demand for our services, and we will continue to invest to meet that demand."
In addition to the growth in its customer base, BellSouth's earnings were also boosted by its cost cutting measures. The company reduced its operating expenses by 1 percent to $1.70 billion, compared to $1.71 billion in the same quarter last year.
"We have been focused on controlling our costs while continuing to invest in our core business," said Ackerman. "We are pleased to see the results of our efforts reflected in our strong financial performance."
BellSouth's strong financial results come at a time when the telecommunications industry is undergoing significant changes. The industry is seeing increased competition from cable and internet providers, as well as from new technologies like voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services.
However, Ackerman remains bullish on BellSouth's future prospects. "We are committed to meeting the changing needs of our customers and adapting to the rapidly evolving telecommunications landscape," he said. "Our strong financial results are a testament to the strength of our business and our ability to compete in this dynamic market."
Looking ahead, BellSouth is expected to continue investing in its network infrastructure to support the growing demand for its services. The company recently announced a plan to invest $1 billion in expanding its high-speed internet service to new areas in the Southeastern United States.
BellSouth's strong financial performance has also resulted in a boost to its stock price. The company's shares rose by 2.5 percent to $22.25 on Tuesday following the earnings report.
Overall, BellSouth's earnings report has impressed investors and analysts alike, showing that the company is well positioned to navigate the challenging telecommunications landscape and continue to grow in the coming years.
