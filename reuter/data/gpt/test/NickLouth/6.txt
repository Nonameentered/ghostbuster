AT&T and Shaklee Corp. Team Up for Face-to-Face Sales Strategy to Boost Long-Distance Market Share
AT&T and Shaklee Corporation, two leading American companies, have joined hands to revolutionize the long-distance market. The duo is coming together to market their products together and tap into the potential of the long-distance market. With the changing consumer dynamics, an alliance like this was long overdue.
AT&T has been a long-standing player in the American telecommunication industry. The company has recently focused on expanding its horizons beyond its core telecommunication services. AT&T’s decision to broaden its verticals has opened a plethora of opportunities, and one of the main areas of interest is health and wellness. Shaklee Corporation, on the other hand, has worked towards promoting health and wellness for almost 70 years.
The face-to-face sales strategy utilized by Shaklee has been a significant contributor to their success. Now this strategy will be applied to promote AT&T’s telecommunication services to Shaklee’s wide network of consumers. The move seems like a logical step as both companies serve the needs of a wide range of consumers, mainly the millennial crowd.
The announcement of this collaboration could not have come at a better time as it coincided with a dramatic increase in long-distance communication amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The work from home culture has pushed people to be more reliant on their phone, and AT&T’s long-distance call services are an appropriate fit.
AT&T’s VP of marketing, Grace Caruso, expressed her excitement about this collaboration with Shaklee. She said, “Shaklee Corporation’s strengths in health and wellness, coupled with AT&T’s vast reach, make us a perfect match for this venture. We hope to introduce our reliable long-distance plans to a broader audience through this partnership.”
This strategic partnership will benefit both parties. Shaklee Corp. will have access to AT&T’s telecommunication services, which they could use for their internal communication needs. In contrast, AT&T will tap into Shaklee’s diverse customer base to promote their products and services more effectively.
Shaklee Corporation CEO, Roger Barnett, stated that the collaboration was a wise decision, considering the changing dynamics of business, especially during the pandemic. He added, “We are excited to collaborate with AT&T and devise new and innovative methods of promoting our products and services. We believe that our face-to-face sales strategy will have a significant impact on the telecommunication market.”
One of the novel approaches the partnership offers is the integration of AT&T’s reliable long-distance call services into Shaklee’s wellness events. Shaklee Corporation has an extensive network of independent distributors, who are referred to as "members." Members could use AT&T’s services to connect with other members spread across the county, boosting their productivity and efficiency.
Furthermore, AT&T’s range of telecommunication services, including high-speed internet and digital TV, can be incorporated into Shaklee’s wellness events. This will help AT&T reach both existing and potential customers of Shaklee Corporation's nutrition, personal care, and home care products.
In conclusion, AT&T and Shaklee’s partnership brings together two different companies from various sectors united by a common goal. Both companies have recognized that the long-distance market has massive potential, and by joining hands, they hope to revolutionize the market. The collaboration is a unique initiative that combines the strengths of both parties to create a compelling, customer-centric approach.
The partnership is strategically beneficial and will enhance both companies’ competitive advantages. AT&T will benefit from Shaklee’s network of independent distributors, while Shaklee Corporation will have access to reliable long-distance call services. The initiative will prove essential for both the companies to reach a wider audience and drive growth in their respective verticals.
There is no doubt that this move is a smart one, and other firms may take a cue from AT&T and Shaklee’s strategic partnership. Such collaborations create an opportunity for companies to tap into new markets and reach out to potential customers. It seems clear that the face-to-face sales strategy perfected by Shaklee Corporation will play a crucial role in promoting AT&T’s telecommunication services. Through this partnership, AT&T and Shaklee Corporation have set a new standard for other firms to follow.
