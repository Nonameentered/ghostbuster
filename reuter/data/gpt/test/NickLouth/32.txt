Regional Bells' Fourth Quarter Results Show Booming Demand for Additional Lines and Services, Despite Investor Worries About Looming Competition in Core Markets.
The regional bells, the dominant providers of local phone service in the United States, reported results for the fourth quarter that were better than expected, with strong demand for additional lines and services despite concerns about looming competition.
The companies reported that they added 1.2 million lines in the quarter, up from 950,000 a year ago, and that they had a net gain of 555,000 long-distance customers, up from 460,000 a year ago.
In addition, the companies reported that they added 244,000 DSL (digital subscriber line) customers in the quarter, bringing the total to 3.5 million, and that they had a total of 14.5 million high-speed Internet customers, up from 12.8 million a year ago.
Despite the strong showing, some investors remained concerned about the competitive environment for the regional bells, particularly in light of the planned entry of cable companies into the local phone market.
Some analysts have also voiced concerns about increased regulation of the industry by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is considering rules that would require the regional bells to open their networks to competitors.
Nevertheless, the regional bells remain optimistic about their prospects, with most reporting solid growth in their core markets and success in expanding into new areas, such as wireless and data services.
Verizon, which is the largest of the regional bells, reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.5 billion, or 61 cents a share, up from $1.9 billion, or 48 cents a share, a year ago. The company also raised its dividend by 7% and announced plans to buy back up to $10 billion of its own stock.
SBC, the second-largest regional bell, reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.7 billion, or 49 cents a share, up from $1.4 billion, or 42 cents a share, a year ago. The company also announced plans to buy back up to $5 billion of its own stock.
BellSouth, the third-largest regional bell, reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.2 billion, or 66 cents a share, up from $1.1 billion, or 59 cents a share, a year ago. The company also announced plans to buy back up to $1 billion of its own stock.
Overall, the results for the regional bells were a clear indication of the booming demand for additional lines and services, and of the companies' ability to adapt to new challenges and opportunities in the marketplace. Despite some investor worries about increased competition and regulation, the regional bells remain well-positioned to grow and thrive in the years ahead.
