AT&T Raises U.S. State-to-State Call Rates by 5.9% from Dec. 1
AT&T, the American multinational telecommunications conglomerate, has announced that it will increase its state-to-state call rates by 5.9% from December 1. This decision by the company is likely to increase the burden on its customers as consumers who rely on landlines for long-distance calls, could be affected.
AT&T has been struggling to maintain its market dominance and has been experiencing declining revenues in recent years due to increased competition from other telecommunications companies. The company has been aggressively seeking ways to expand its revenue base, and this latest move to hike its state-to-state call rates is seen as one such measure.
The company has stated that the rate increase is necessary to cover the rising costs of providing long-distance services. AT&T has also cited the increased use of internet-based communications services such as WhatsApp and Skype as a factor that has put pressure on its traditional long-distance calling services. The company claims that these internet-based services are much cheaper than its traditional services, which has led to a decline in revenue.
AT&T is not alone in adjusting its rates to keep up with the changing telecommunications market. Many other companies are also adjusting their rates to stay competitive in the market. However, the 5.9% price increase is the highest rate increase in the state-to-state calling space since 2005. AT&T has stated that it will be issuing notifications to its customers regarding the rate increase in the coming days.
The company's decision has not been met with enthusiasm by customers who are already struggling to cope with the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people have been forced to work from home, which has resulted in an increase in the use of long-distance calling services. The rate increase by AT&T will likely hit these individuals who rely on landline services the most.
Consumer advocacy groups have also expressed concern about AT&T's decision to increase its rates. These groups argue that the rate increase will disproportionately impact low-income earners who rely more heavily on landline services than high-income earners. They have called on the company to consider other options, such as cutting costs or improving efficiency, instead of raising rates.
AT&T has stated that it is committed to providing affordable and reliable telecommunications services to its customers. The company has pledged to continue investing in the development of new technologies and services that can help its customers stay connected. However, some consumers remain skeptical about the company's commitment to affordable services.
The rate increase by AT&T comes at a time when policymakers are calling for increased competition in the telecommunications industry. Many policymakers argue that increased competition will lead to better service delivery and more affordable prices for consumers. There are also calls for policymakers to strengthen regulatory oversight over the telecommunications industry to protect consumers from price gouging.
In conclusion, AT&T's decision to raise its state-to-state call rates by 5.9% is likely to have significant implications for its customers. The move comes at a time when many people are struggling to cope with the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the company has cited rising costs as the reason for the rate increase, consumer advocacy groups have called on the company to consider other options to keep prices affordable for low-income earners. Policymakers are also calling for increased competition in the telecommunications industry to protect consumers from price gouging.
