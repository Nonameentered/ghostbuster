Sprint Corp's Fourth Quarter Results Show Strong Core Growth but Earnings Trail Estimates Due to Dilution from New Ventures.
Sprint Corp, the American telecommunications company, has reported its fourth-quarter results for the year 2021. The results indicated that the company's core performance is strong, but earnings have fallen short of analysts' expectations.
Sprint Corp's revenue for the quarter ending on December 31st, 2021, was $9.1 billion, which is 3.4% more than it was during the same period last year. The growth in revenue was mainly driven by an increase in subscribers and user revenue, arising from higher average revenue per user (APRU) from unlimited data plans.
Furthermore, Sprint's core adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the quarter were $3 billion, representing a 5% jump from the previous year's Q4. The adjusted EBITDA margin also improved by 1.2 percentage points YoY to 33.1%, suggesting operational efficiency for the company.
However, despite the satisfactory core results, Sprint Corp's diluted net loss during Q4 was $2.2 billion or $0.52 per share. This is because of the dilutive effect of new ventures, such as the company's partnership with T-Mobile, its 5G network investment plans, and its acquisition of the Virgin Mobile brand.
Sprint Corp's CEO, Michel Combes, said in a press release, "We continue to execute on our strategy, driving strong core performance in Q4. Our network has never been stronger, and our customer loyalty metrics are at all-time highs. Our focus on building the best 5G network in the country is unmatched, and our merger with T-Mobile remains on track to close in the first half of this year."
Sprint Corp also announced that its total subscriber base has grown to 54.4 million, an increase of 256,000 subscribers from Q3 2021. The company's postpaid phone net additions were approximately 77,000, which shows the continuing trend of Sprint's loyal subscribers preferring to move to unlimited plans.
Moreover, the company reiterated its commitment to deploying 5G networks across the country, with coverage already available in nine metropolitan areas. Sprint also expects to launch Samsung Galaxy S20 5G smartphones on its network soon, becoming the first carrier in the nation to do so.
In conclusion, Sprint Corp's fourth-quarter results have shown a strong core growth in revenue and EBITDA. The company is performing well in attracting and retaining subscribers to its unlimited data plans while continuing to focus on building the 5G network of the future. However, investors are unsure about the effectiveness of the new ventures announced by the company that may take time to yield results. Nevertheless, the company remains optimistic about its prospects and its merger with T-Mobile, expected to be completed soon.
