AT&T Corp, the American multinational telecommunication conglomerate, has reported a significant rebound in its core businesses in Q4 1996, however, the mounting bad debts from business customers have raised concerns for the company.
The company's revenues from its long-distance phone and wireless services have risen in the last quarter, primarily driven by a surge in demand from residential customers. AT&T's operating income from long-distance phone services increased by 5.4% to $2.5 billion, and its wireless revenues rose by 10.8% to $851 million. The company's net income for the quarter stood at $1.79 billion, compared to $785 million the previous year. 
The company's CEO, Robert Allen, attributed the strong performance to the company's extensive investments in network infrastructure over the past few years, which have enabled it to meet the rapidly growing demand for data and voice services. "Our investments in the network are paying off," he said. "We are able to offer our customers reliable, high-quality services, and this is reflected in our financial performance."
However, AT&T's financials were also impacted by the mounting bad debts from business customers, which have been struggling to pay their bills due to the economic downturn. The company's bad debt expense rose by 18% to $620 million, mounting concerns for the company's long-term profitability. 
In response to the challenges, AT&T has announced plans to tighten its credit policies and improve its debt collection processes. The company also plans to work with business customers to develop payment plans to help them better manage their cash flows.
"We understand the challenges that our business customers are facing, and we are committed to working with them to find solutions," Allen said. "At the same time, we need to protect our financial position and manage our risk appropriately."
AT&T faces tough competition in the telecommunications space from rivals such as Verizon and T-Mobile. The company's strategy to diversify its business by acquiring media assets, such as WarnerMedia, has also come under scrutiny from investors who feel that the company should focus more on its core operations. 
"We are, of course, aware of the concerns of our investors," Allen said. "We will continue to evaluate our strategic options to ensure that we are generating maximum value for our shareholders."
Overall, AT&T's Q4 1996 performance represents a strong comeback after a tough year. While the mounting bad debts from business customers remain a concern, the company is taking steps to mitigate the risks. With its extensive network infrastructure and growing demand for digital services, AT&T is well-positioned for long-term growth in the telecommunication sector.
