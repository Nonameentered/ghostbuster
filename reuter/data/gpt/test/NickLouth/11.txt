Kodak President Emphasizes Innovation as Key to Protecting Profit Margins
Rochester-based tech and photography company Kodak, is ramping up its efforts to protect its profit margins by focusing on innovation as a means for growth. The company has been struggling financially in recent years and has been exploring different measures to secure its future in the market. In a recent press statement, Kodak President Jeff Clarke said that the key to Kodak's financial success in the long term lies in its ability to innovate.
"Kodak has always been associated with photography, but the world has moved on since our heyday," said Clarke during a recent press event. "We need to provide innovative solutions that not only cater to photographers but also to customers in other sectors."
Kodak has a rich legacy dating back to the late 1800s and was once a major player in the photographic equipment and consumables business. However, the advent of digital photography and the subsequent rise of smartphone cameras changed the landscape of the photography industry. In recent years, Kodak has diversified its business operations, but has struggled to generate significant revenue and profitability.
Clarke said the company is now doubling down on innovation, exploring new ways to leverage Kodak's expertise in areas such as imaging science, printing, and materials science, to break into new markets such as pharmaceuticals, food safety, and packaging.
"We've got some very exciting projects in the works that take advantage of our cutting-edge research into advanced materials and imaging," he said. "Our aim is to develop products and platforms that not only offer superior performance but also provide eco-friendly and cost-effective solutions."
Kodak's shift towards innovation is already bearing fruit. The company has recently partnered with printing solutions firm EVERSFRANK to develop a new digital printing platform called ULTRASTREAM. The technology is a game-changer in high-speed production inkjet printing. It also has industrial applications such as flooring, textiles, and packaging. Likewise, Kodak has expanded its product portfolio with offerings such as offset plates, inkjet systems, digital cameras, and functional printing materials.
Kodak's shift towards innovation has been welcomed by analysts who believe the company has significant potential in new and emerging markets. "Kodak has always been at the forefront of technology and innovation," said Stuart Carlaw, Chief Research Officer of ABI Research. "A company with a pedigree like that should not be underestimated. If Kodak can channel its expertise into new areas and break out of its traditional photography markets, it could be looking at a bright future."
Overall, Kodak's renewed focus on innovation is a welcome development for the company. With the photography industry evolving, incorporating new technologies and exploring new markets, Kodak now finds itself in a position to be part of that innovation and inspire new ways to make a profit.
