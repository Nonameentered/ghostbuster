Sprint Corp has had a year of unprecedented strength in its core operations but has announced that its 1997 results will be diluted by future investments. The telecommunications company has seen significant growth in its wireless and long-distance divisions, but is now looking to the future with investments in new technology and infrastructure.
Over the past year, Sprint has added over 3 million wireless customers. This growth has been fueled by the addition of new markets and the rollout of new products and services. The company's long-distance division has also seen growth, with an increase in both residential and business customers. However, despite these successes, Sprint is now focusing on investing in new technology to keep up with the demand for faster speeds and more reliable service.
"We are thrilled with the progress we have made in our core operations," said Sprint CEO William T. Esrey. "Our wireless and long-distance businesses are performing at the highest levels we have seen in years. But to continue this growth, we must invest in the future."
These future investments include the deployment of a new network infrastructure that will be needed to support the growth in data-heavy applications such as streaming video and virtual reality. Sprint is also investing in new technology such as 5G, which will provide faster speeds and more reliable service to customers.
While these investments are necessary for Sprint to remain competitive in the ever-changing telecommunications industry, they will have an impact on the company's 1997 results. The costs associated with these investments will be reflected in the company's financial statements, meaning that earnings per share may be lower than expected.
"We understand that these investments may impact our short-term earnings," said Esrey. "But we believe that they are necessary to ensure the long-term success of the company."
Sprint's shareholders are supportive of these investments, seeing them as necessary for the company's future growth. The company's stock has remained steady despite the announcement of potentially lower earnings for 1997.
Investors are also optimistic about Sprint's potential merger with MCI Communications Corp. The two companies are currently in talks about a possible merger that would combine their long-distance services. The merger would create a formidable competitor to industry leaders AT&T and WorldCom.
Sprint Corp is entering a new phase in its growth, with a focus on investing in new technology and infrastructure to keep up with the demands of its customers. While the company's 1997 earnings may be impacted by these investments, investors are optimistic about the company's future growth potential.
