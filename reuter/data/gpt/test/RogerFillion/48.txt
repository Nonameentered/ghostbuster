In 1984, a historic antitrust case culminated with the breakup of the Bell System, leading to the creation of several regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs). The man who presided over that case was Judge Harold Greene, and he is now voicing his concerns over the proposed merger between AT&T and SBC Communications.
Judge Greene, who is now 88 years old, stated in an interview with The New York Times that he is worried that the merger would create a "monolith" that would dominate the telecommunications industry in the United States. He observed that the companies have already been merging for years, with AT&T acquiring DirecTV in 2015 and SBC (which became AT&T) acquiring BellSouth in 2006.
The concern with this merger, as Judge Greene sees it, is that it would take these two already large companies and create a single entity that could use its size to stifle competitors and put its own interests above those of consumers. The combined company would control a significant portion of broadband connections, mobile subscribers, and television customers.
Judge Greene's opinion carries weight, as he is widely regarded as a visionary judge who recognized the dangers of monopolies in the telecommunications industry. He was also critical of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which he saw as a failure to preserve competition in the face of consolidation and technological change.
He pointed out that even with the Bell System's breakup, the RBOCs ended up merging back together over the years, leading to the current situation where the industry is dominated by a few large companies. He believes that the proposed merger between AT&T and SBC is just another step in that direction.
There are concerns from other experts in the industry that this merger would be bad for competition. Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, echoed Judge Greene's concerns. He stated that the merged company would "have the power, the incentive, and the opportunity to impose anticompetitive terms and conditions that would threaten to choke off competition."
However, not everyone is against the proposed merger. AT&T and SBC executives argue that the merger would lead to lower prices for consumers by streamlining operations and allowing for more powerful deals with content providers. They also claim that the merger is necessary to compete with newer, larger technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook.
The Justice Department, which would be responsible for approving the merger, has not yet made a decision. However, they have raised concerns about the potential effects on competition and are reportedly considering imposing conditions on the merger to address those concerns.
Judge Greene's concerns about the proposed merger are reflective of a larger issue facing the telecommunications industry. As technology continues to evolve and companies merge and consolidate, the question of how to maintain competition and protect consumers becomes ever more critical. The decision that is ultimately made by the Justice Department could have significant implications for the future of the industry.
