Former Judge Who Oversaw Dismantling of Ma Bell Warns Against AT&T and SBC Merger
A former judge who presided over the landmark antitrust case that broke up telecommunications giant AT&T, known as Ma Bell, in 1984 has spoken out against the proposed merger between AT&T and SBC.
Harry T. Edwards, a retired judge from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and a prominent antitrust expert, recently penned an op-ed in The New York Times warning against the merger.
Edwards argued that the proposed combination of AT&T and SBC, which would create a company with more than 190 million wireless subscribers and control over large swaths of the telecommunications industry, poses a significant threat to competition and could harm consumers.
"History teaches us that consolidation in the telecommunications industry is a recipe for higher prices, less innovation, and fewer choices for consumers," Edwards wrote. "We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past and allow AT&T and SBC to consolidate their market power."
Edwards' warning comes as the proposed merger between AT&T and SBC, which was announced earlier this year, is facing increased scrutiny from antitrust regulators and consumer advocates.
Critics of the merger argue that the combination of the two telecom giants could create a new duopoly in the industry, with only AT&T and Verizon controlling the vast majority of wireless and broadband services in the U.S.
They also point out that the merger could stifle competition and innovation in the industry, as the combined company would be able to exert greater control over the market and potentially limit access to new technologies and services.
In his op-ed, Edwards noted that the dismantling of Ma Bell in the 1980s was one of the most significant antitrust cases in U.S. history, and helped to pave the way for the rise of new telecommunications companies and the emergence of the internet.
He argued that the breakup of Ma Bell was necessary to ensure that the company could not use its market power to stifle competition and innovation, and that the same logic should apply today.
"If the proposed merger between AT&T and SBC is allowed to proceed, the consequences could be dire for competition and innovation in the telecommunications industry," Edwards wrote.
Edwards' warning echoes concerns raised by other antitrust experts and consumer advocates, who have called on regulators to block the merger or impose strict conditions to ensure that it does not harm competition or consumers.
However, AT&T and SBC have defended the merger, arguing that it will allow them to better compete with rivals like Verizon and Comcast, and that it will ultimately benefit consumers by enabling them to offer new and innovative products and services.
The companies have also pointed out that the telecommunications industry has changed significantly since the breakup of Ma Bell, and that new technologies and competitors have emerged to challenge the dominance of the largest players in the market.
Nevertheless, Edwards and other critics of the deal remain unconvinced, and argue that the proposed merger poses a significant threat to competition and could harm consumers in the long run.
As the debate over the merger continues, it remains to be seen whether regulators will heed the warnings of experts like Edwards and take steps to ensure that the telecommunications industry remains open and competitive for years to come.
