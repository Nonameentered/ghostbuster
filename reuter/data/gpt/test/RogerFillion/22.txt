Distillers are urging the establishment of a common advertising code for alcohol, but the wine and beer industries are rejecting the idea. Distillers say it's necessary to promote a responsible drinking culture and prevent advertisements from promoting binge drinking. However, the beer and wine industries argue that they should not be held accountable for the irresponsible actions of a few.
Distillers lobby group, The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), proposed the code as a way to promote a responsible drinking culture across all sectors of the industry. The code would include a requirement to communicate the risks of excessive drinking and provide guidance to limit advertising to adults.
"By having a common advertising code, we can ensure that all players in the alcohol industry are promoting responsible drinking and not promoting excessive drinking, which can lead to harm," said DISCUS CEO Chris Swonger.
However, the wine and beer industries have rejected the idea, arguing that they should not be held accountable for the actions of a minority of drinkers. The Wine Institute said in its official statement that "the vast majority of adults who enjoy beer, wine or spirits do so responsibly, and we support efforts to promote responsible consumption."
The Beer Institute also issued an official statement saying, "broad-brushed restrictions will not address the behavior of those who misuse alcohol."
The beer and wine industries also believe that the code could limit their freedom of speech when promoting their products. The Wine Institute stated that "any advertising guidelines should be based on empirical data, not conjecture or unscientific opinion."
But Swonger disagrees, stating that the code will not limit freedom of speech but rather provide guidance to ensure there is a common responsibility among all sectors when promoting alcohol.
"We are not promoting regulation or banning advertising altogether. We are simply asking for a code that will promote advertising that is responsible and that will not lead to harm," said Swonger.
The advertising of alcohol has long been a contentious issue, with many advocating for stricter regulations to protect vulnerable groups such as young people and those with addiction issues. Currently, regulations differ across states and territories in the U.S., leading to confusing and inconsistent advertising practices.
Some analysts believe that a common advertising code could help to standardize advertising practices across the industry and promote responsible drinking and reduce harm.
Whether the code is established or not, it's clear that the conversation around responsible drinking and advertising will continue. As Swonger says, "It's time for the industry to come together and agree on a framework that promotes responsible drinking."
