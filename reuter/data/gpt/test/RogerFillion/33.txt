The US Justice Department has launched an investigation into possible bid-rigging in airwaves auctions for wireless phone licenses. According to sources, the investigation involves a dozen or more companies that may have colluded to keep prices low during the auctions to obtain favorable terms when it comes to spectrum licenses. The investigation could result in the biggest antitrust case in the telecommunications industry since the AT&T breakup in the 1980s.
The airwaves auctions in question took place from 2012 to 2017 and involved licenses for wireless frequencies to be used for high-speed internet and other mobile applications. The federal government expected to receive high bids from wireless carriers to use these airwaves, which are becoming increasingly scarce and valuable due to the rapid growth of smartphones and other wireless devices. But the actual bids that came in were less than expected, leading some to speculate that something was amiss.
The Justice Department’s antitrust division is reportedly examining whether companies coordinated their bidding to suppress prices, and whether they shared confidential information to do so. The Federal Communications Commission, which oversaw the auctions, has said that it was not aware of any improper activities, but it is cooperating with the investigation.
The auctions in question raised $23 billion for the federal government, but reports suggest that the bids could have been much higher if companies had not colluded to keep prices low. This could have resulted in a loss of billions of dollars for the government, as well as limiting competition in the wireless industry.
The investigation is still in its early stages, but it could have major implications for the telecommunications industry and the broader economy. If companies are found to have colluded, they could face significant fines and penalties, and executives could even face criminal charges. The investigation could also spur the federal government to take a closer look at the way it conducts airwaves auctions, and may lead to changes in the process to prevent bid-rigging in the future.
The telecommunications industry is critical to the US economy, and ensuring fair competition is essential to its continued growth and success. The Justice Department’s investigation into possible bid-rigging in airwaves auctions for wireless phone licenses is an important step towards maintaining a level playing field for all companies in the industry, and protecting consumers from anticompetitive practices.
