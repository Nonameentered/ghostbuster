Opposition Builds to Renewed China Trading Status
As the deadline for China's trading status approaches, opposition is mounting against the renewal of its status. Many lawmakers, activists, and industry groups are expressing their concerns about China's human rights violations, its treatment of Uighur Muslims, and the country's massive trade surplus with the US. This opposition could have serious consequences for the global economy if China's trading status is not renewed.
China has had permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status with the US since 2001. This means that China is treated like any other member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and tariffs on Chinese goods are no longer subject to annual renewal. This status has been crucial for China's economy, as it has helped the country become a major global trading power.
However, the US must renew China's PNTR status every year, and the deadline for renewal is fast approaching. Lawmakers and advocates are calling for the renewal to be reconsidered.
One of the most significant concerns is China's treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province. According to reports, China has detained more than one million Uighurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in internment camps. The Chinese government has also been accused of forced labor, sterilization, and other human rights abuses against these groups.
Many lawmakers are calling on the US government not to renew China's trading status until the country addresses these concerns. In a recent open letter, a group of senators wrote that "providing PNTR to China at a time when China's government is engaged in genocide and other human rights abuses is simply unacceptable."
Moreover, some industry groups are also voicing their opposition to China's trading status. The US-China Business Council, which represents over 200 American companies doing business in China, has urged the US government to renew China's trading status. However, the group also acknowledged that "the issue of human rights abuses in Xinjiang is of great concern to our membership."
Another concern is China's trade surplus with the US. In 2020, the US trade deficit with China was around $310 billion. The issue of trade imbalance has long been a contentious one, and many lawmakers are calling for a more balanced trade relationship with China.
Many experts argue that China's massive trade surplus with the US is the result of China's manipulation of its currency, the yuan. According to them, China artificially keeps the yuan weak, making its exports cheaper and more competitive than those of other countries.
In light of these concerns, lawmakers are considering several proposals to address China's human rights violations and trade practices. One proposal is the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would prohibit imports from Xinjiang, where many Uighurs are detained in internment camps.
Another proposal is the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act. This bill would create new rules for the Treasury Department to address currency manipulation by countries like China.
While these proposals are still in the early stages, they indicate that the issue of China's trading status is far from settled. If China's trading status is not renewed, it would have significant consequences for the global economy, as it would likely increase tariffs on Chinese goods.
Moreover, the Biden administration has signaled that it wants to cooperate with China on issues like climate change and the economy. If China's trading status is not renewed, it could impede efforts to collaborate with China on these issues.
In conclusion, opposition to China's trading status is growing, and there are legitimate concerns about China's human rights violations and trade practices. Lawmakers and advocates must weigh these concerns against the economic benefits of renewing China's trading status. Whatever decision is made will have far-reaching consequences for both the US and China, as well as the global economy.
