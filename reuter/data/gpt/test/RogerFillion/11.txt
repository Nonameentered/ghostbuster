Wireless Phone License Winners Urge Government for Leniency in Payment Schedule
Several wireless phone license winners have requested the government to grant them leniency in the payment of their license fees. The license winners, consisting of networks and operators, cite challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic that have affected their operations and revenue streams.
The Communication Authority of Kenya (CAK) awarded licenses to various companies to roll out Fourth Generation Long Term Evolution (4G LTE) network services in 2018. The licenses were valid for 15 years, with a payment plan allowing for staggered payments spread over five years. The first payment of 25% was due when the license was awarded, and the remaining payments carried a 10% annual interest rate.
A consortium of six operators, including Safaricom, Airtel, Telkom, Jamii Telecommunications, and a subsidiary of Liquid Telecom, won the bid for the licenses. The consortium has reportedly requested the government to extend the payment period and lower the interest rates to ease the financial burden on the companies.
According to the operators, the pandemic has hit their operations hard, affecting their revenue streams and ability to pay the license fees. The operators have requested the government to review the repayment terms and provide a stimulus package to assist them in meeting their obligations.
Safaricom Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Peter Ndegwa, in a statement, noted that the company had already invested billions in the network infrastructure and that the hefty license fee outlay could not have come at a worse time. Mr. Ndegwa further indicated that Safaricom, which is the leading mobile network provider in Kenya, had to forego some of its investments due to the pandemic's impact on the economy.
In its defense, the government has stated that the license fee is part of the agreement between the operators and the regulator and, therefore, cannot be subjected to a review. The government has also indicated that it has set up a relief fund to assist businesses affected by the pandemic.
The operators claim that the relief fund is not sufficient, as it is yet to tricklet down to the companies' level, and there are concerns over the transparency of its distribution. They are requesting that they be granted a waiver or a lowered interest rate on the remaining license fees.
The operators have argued that a review of the payment terms could allow them to continue investing in the network infrastructure, thereby providing faster data speeds to Kenyan consumers. They also state that a lower interest rate would allow them to make more investments into the network infrastructure and create employment opportunities.
The operator's request comes at a time when the government is pushing for the rollout of the 5G network, a move that is expected to transform the landscape of the internet and enhance digital inclusion in the country. The government's aim is to enable access to the high-speed network across the country, with an emphasis on facilitating smart cities, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications that require access to high-speed and reliable internet connectivity.
If the operators' request is granted, it could be a significant boost for the industry, allowing for more investments to be made in the rollout of the 4G and 5G networks across the country. However, critics warn that the decision could set a bad precedent, especially if other sectors start clamoring for the same benefits.
Notably, Kenya's telecommunication industry has been one of the most robust and growing industries in the country, with mobile penetration standing at over 100%. The industry has also been a significant growth contributor to the country's economy, which has seen its GDP grow by an average of 5.5% over the last five years.
The operators hope that the government will review the repayment terms in good faith, noting that they are fully committed to rolling out high-speed internet connectivity across the country. The operators further note that the benefits that come with a robust internet infrastructure far outweigh the short-term costs of establishing it.
In conclusion, wireless phone license winners are urging the government to provide leniency in the payment schedule of the license fees, citing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic that have affected their operations. The operators have requested a review of the payment terms and a stimulus package to support them through these challenging times. If granted, the operators could potentially make more investments in the network infrastructure, creating employment opportunities, and driving economic growth. However, the decision could set a dangerous precedent, opening the floodgates to other sectors seeking similar benefits.
