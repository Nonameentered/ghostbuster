Opponents of U.S. Trade Concessions to China Gear Up for Congressional Battle
As trade tensions between the United States and China continue to simmer, opponents of the Trump administration's pro-China trade policies are gearing up for a congressional battle. The opponents of U.S. trade concessions to China are taking up a range of tactics, including ramping up lobbying efforts, mobilizing grass-roots activists, and mounting lawsuits in the courts.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Senate passed the Strategic Competition Act of 2021 by a vote of 68-32. The bill aims to counter China's economic and strategic competition with the United States, and includes provisions for increased investment in research and development, targeted sanctions against Chinese officials accused of human rights abuses, and funding for technology development in key industries.
However, critics of the legislation argue that it does not go far enough in tackling China's economic and military ambitions. In particular, they are concerned that the bill does not address the issue of Chinese currency manipulation or intellectual property theft, two key areas where China has been accused of unfairly competing with U.S. businesses.
"China's predatory economic policies have caused immense harm to American workers and businesses, and we need to take decisive action to hold the Chinese government accountable," said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), one of the bill's co-sponsors. "This bill is a good first step, but we need to be more aggressive in order to protect American jobs and preserve America's economic competitiveness."
At the heart of the debate over U.S. trade concessions to China is the question of how to balance the need for economic engagement with China and the imperative to protect American jobs and intellectual property. The Trump administration took a hardline stance towards China, imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods and attempting to block Chinese access to key technologies.
The Biden administration has signaled a more conciliatory approach, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other officials indicating a willingness to work with Chinese policymakers to resolve trade disputes. However, some industry groups and lawmakers are pushing back against this approach, arguing that it will not result in meaningful changes to China's trade policies.
"China has been cheating us for years, stealing our intellectual property, manipulating their currency, and using unfair trade practices to put American companies out of business," said Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), a leading opponent of U.S. trade concessions to China. "We need to be much tougher with them if we want to have a level playing field."
One area of concern for opponents of U.S. trade concessions to China is the issue of backdoor access to U.S. technology. Chinese investors have been investing heavily in U.S. tech startups and other high-tech firms, leading to concerns that China may be using these investments to acquire sensitive technologies and gain a strategic advantage over the United States.
Earlier this month, the U.S. government blocked the sale of AI tech firm Xilinx to a Chinese investment firm, citing national security concerns. Critics of U.S. trade concessions to China say that the Xilinx case is just the tip of the iceberg, and that the U.S. government needs to do more to protect sensitive technologies from Chinese acquisition.
"We are handing over our technology and our intellectual property to China on a silver platter," said Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), another vocal opponent of U.S. trade concessions to China. "We need to be much more vigilant about protecting American innovation and preventing China from gaining access to our most cutting-edge technologies."
The battle over U.S. trade concessions to China is likely to intensify in the coming months, as industry groups, lawmakers, and advocacy organizations continue to push for changes to U.S. trade policy. While the Biden administration has signaled a more conciliatory approach towards China than the Trump administration, it remains to be seen how it will balance the need for economic engagement with China against the imperative to protect American interests.
"Trade with China is necessary for our economy, but we cannot let them take advantage of us," said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), another leading opponent of U.S. trade concessions to China. "We need to find a balance that protects American workers and businesses while allowing for continued economic engagement with China. It's not going to be an easy task, but it's one that we must undertake."
