A new report has revealed that alcohol and tobacco companies are exploiting social media to target underage youth, using flashy graphics to lure them into a lifetime of addiction.
The study, conducted by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the American Heart Association, found that major alcohol and tobacco brands are using social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to market their products to young people.
According to the report, companies are using bright colors, catchy slogans, and other eye-catching graphics to attract the attention of underage users. Some even incorporate popular memes and slang language to create a sense of familiarity and relatability.
"These companies know exactly what they're doing," says Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "They're deliberately designing their ads and messaging to appeal to young people, despite knowing that it could have devastating consequences for their health."
The report highlights several examples of alcohol and tobacco companies using these tactics. For instance, one major tobacco company used a bright green color scheme and catchy slogan ("Get What You Want") to promote its vaping products on Instagram. Similarly, a popular alcoholic beverage brand used flashy graphics and bright colors to promote its products on Snapchat.
The report also found that companies are using social media influencers - popular individuals with a large following on social media - to promote their products to young people. These influencers are often paid by companies to post photos of themselves using the products, creating a sense of peer pressure and social validation that can be particularly effective among young people.
"The use of influencers is particularly troubling," says Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association. "These individuals are seen as trusted peers and can have a significant impact on the behavior of young people. It's imperative that we take action to prevent this type of marketing."
The report comes at a time when underage drinking and tobacco use are major public health concerns in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 high school students smoke cigarettes, while about 1 in 10 students report drinking alcohol before the age of 13.
Advocates say that the use of social media to market these products only exacerbates the problem, making it easier for young people to access and use alcohol and tobacco products.
"We need to take swift action to address this issue," says Myers. "We cannot afford to sit idly by while alcohol and tobacco companies target our youth with their deceptive marketing tactics. It's time for lawmakers and regulators to step in and hold these companies accountable."
Some lawmakers are already taking action. In January, a group of senators introduced the Tobacco-Free Youth Act, which would ban the sale of flavored tobacco products and e-cigarettes to anyone under the age of 21. The bill also includes several provisions aimed at reducing youth exposure to tobacco advertising, including restrictions on online and social media marketing.
Advocates say that more needs to be done to protect young people from the harmful effects of alcohol and tobacco. They are calling for stronger regulation of these industries, including restrictions on marketing and advertising aimed at young people.
"This report is a wake-up call," says Brown. "We can no longer allow alcohol and tobacco companies to continue their harmful marketing practices. It's time for action, and we need to act now."
