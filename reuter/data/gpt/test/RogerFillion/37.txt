The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved a significant overhaul of domestic telephone charges that will make long-distance calls more affordable for consumers and help wire schools and libraries across the country to the internet.
In a unanimous vote, the FCC passed a measure that will reduce some of the fees that telecom providers charge each other for handling long-distance calls to rural areas. This will help to lower the cost of long-distance calling for consumers, especially in rural areas where calling rates can be high.
The measure also includes an increase in the funding for the Universal Service Fund (USF), which is used to expand and improve telecommunications services in underserved areas of the country. The FCC will allocate $2 billion annually from the USF to go toward wiring schools and libraries to the internet.
The FCC's decision was met with praise from consumer advocacy groups and organizations that work to bridge the digital divide. They have long called for lower rates and increased funding to help close the gap in internet access and connectivity that exists between urban and rural areas.
"Today's action is a critical step forward in making sure that every community has access to affordable and high-quality telecommunications services," said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. "By lowering the cost of long-distance phone calls and increasing funding for the Universal Service Fund, we can help bridge the digital divide and ensure that all Americans can participate in the digital economy."
The new rules will go into effect on January 1, 2022. Telecom providers will be required to reduce the fees they charge each other for long-distance calls to rural areas by up to 8%, which will result in lower rates for consumers in those areas. The increased funding for the USF will also begin in 2022.
According to the FCC, the increased funding for the USF will help connect more than 20 million students to the internet and provide faster and more reliable internet access to thousands of libraries across the country. This will be especially beneficial for students in rural areas who often lack access to reliable internet connections.
The overhaul of domestic telephone charges is part of a broader effort by the FCC to increase access to affordable, high-quality telecommunications services for all Americans. The FCC has also been working to promote the deployment of high-speed broadband networks in rural areas and to expand access to telecommunications services for low-income households.
The FCC's decision to overhaul domestic telephone charges has been widely hailed as a positive step in the right direction. It is hoped that the increased funding for the USF and the lower rates for long-distance calls to rural areas will help bridge the digital divide and ensure that all Americans have access to affordable, high-quality telecommunications services.
