Washington D.C. – The Clinton Administration has thrown its support behind new legislation aimed at preventing the imposition of taxes on internet commerce. The proposed law, known as the Internet Tax Freedom Act, has gained bipartisan support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The bill, which was introduced by Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), seeks to extend the moratorium on internet taxes that was initially implemented in 1998. The original legislation, which prohibited taxes on internet access, was set to expire in 2001 but has been repeatedly extended, most recently in 2015.
The proposed legislation would make the moratorium permanent and expand it to include taxes on online sales of goods and services. The bill has received strong support from tech industry leaders, including Amazon, Google, and Facebook, who argue that the taxation of online transactions would stifle innovation and harm the nation’s economy.
In a statement released on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the administration “supports the permanent extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act to ensure that Americans are not burdened with unnecessary taxes when accessing and using the internet.”
The statement went on to say that the legislation “promotes continued growth and innovation in the digital economy, which is key to our nation’s prosperity and competitiveness in the global marketplace.”
The internet tax issue has been a controversial one over the years, with various states attempting to enact taxes on internet sales and access, despite the federal moratorium. Proponents of such taxes argue that they are necessary to help fund state and local governments, and that they level the playing field for brick-and-mortar retailers who must collect sales tax on their transactions.
Opponents of internet taxes, however, argue that they would place an undue burden on consumers and small businesses, and that they would be difficult to enforce. They also argue that the internet is a unique and constantly evolving medium that should not be subject to the same tax laws as traditional commerce.
The proposed legislation has gained widespread support in Congress, with over 50 co-sponsors in the House and 10 in the Senate, and it is expected to pass with wide bipartisan support. If enacted, it would be a significant victory for the tech industry and for internet users across the nation.
The bill’s proponents argue that a permanent moratorium on internet taxes would not only encourage innovation and growth but would also protect consumers from unnecessary fees and taxes. With the backing of the Clinton Administration, the Internet Tax Freedom Act has a strong chance of becoming law and ensuring that the internet remains a tax-free zone for years to come.
