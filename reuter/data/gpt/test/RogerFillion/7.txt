Regulators are considering extending consumer safeguards for pay-per-call services beyond 900 numbers, following mounting complaints of fraud and deceptive marketing practices.
Pay-per-call services typically involve callers dialing a designated phone number to access certain information or services, such as horoscopes, psychic readings, adult entertainment or customer support.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws, has long warned of the risks associated with pay-per-call services, particularly those using 900 numbers, which charge premium rates.
Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), the FTC has imposed strict rules on companies providing pay-per-call services that use 900 numbers, requiring clear and conspicuous disclosure of the costs involved, explicit consent from consumers, and limits on the length and frequency of calls.
However, as pay-per-call services have expanded beyond 900 numbers to include toll-free, local and mobile numbers, the FTC has struggled to maintain the same level of oversight and enforcement.
In recent years, the FTC has received numerous complaints from consumers who have been misled or overcharged for pay-per-call services, many of which exploit vulnerable populations such as the elderly, low-income or non-English speaking.
According to the FTC’s Consumer Sentinel Network database, which tracks consumer complaints, there were more than 63,000 fraud reports related to pay-per-call services in 2020, with losses totaling $132 million.
The most common types of pay-per-call scams involve fake technical support, social security or Medicare enrollment, fake grants or debt relief, and adult content or dating services.
In response to these concerns, the FTC is now considering expanding its regulations to cover all pay-per-call services, regardless of the number used.
The proposed rules would require companies to clearly disclose the costs and terms of pay-per-call services in their advertising, provide consumers with a way to opt-out or cancel at any time, and limit calls to a maximum of three minutes unless the caller approves longer calls.
The FTC is also seeking feedback on whether to impose additional requirements for verification of consumer consent, third-party billing and dispute resolution.
Public comments on the proposed rules can be submitted until October 22, 2021.
Consumer advocates welcome the move to strengthen protections for pay-per-call services but caution that more needs to be done to educate consumers about the risks and to hold companies accountable for fraudulent activities.
"Pay-per-call scams are a pervasive and pernicious problem that affects millions of consumers every year," said Linda Sherry, director of national priorities at Consumer Action.
"We support the FTC’s efforts to crack down on this type of fraud, but we urge the agency to go further by proactively identifying and investigating potential violations, rather than waiting for consumers to report them."
Industry representatives are also weighing in on the proposed rules, expressing concern that they could stifle innovation and harm legitimate businesses.
"The pay-per-call industry is a critical part of the advertising ecosystem, providing consumers with access to valuable information and services they might not otherwise find," said Jennifer Rieff, executive director of the Pay-Per-Call Forum.
"While we support efforts to combat fraud and abuse, we believe the FTC should avoid imposing one-size-fits-all regulations that could have unintended consequences for businesses and consumers alike."
