ITT Corp. announced on Monday that it had sold its $300 million stake in French engineering company Alcatel Alsthom in a move to fend off a takeover bid from Hilton Worldwide Holdings.
In a statement released on Monday, ITT Corp. said it had sold its 7.3% stake in Alcatel Alsthom to institutional investors, without naming the buyers. The sale would increase ITT Corp.'s cash balance by $300 million, the company added.
ITT Corp. is a diversified manufacturing company based in the United States, with operations in the defense, energy, and industrial sectors. It had acquired its stake in Alcatel Alsthom in 1999, when the French company merged with Italia Telecom.
The move to sell the stake came in response to a takeover bid from Hilton Worldwide Holdings, a global hospitality company based in the United States. Hilton had offered to acquire all outstanding shares of ITT Corp. for $7.5 billion, or $45 a share, in cash and stock.
However, ITT Corp. had rejected the bid, saying it undervalued the company. In a letter to Hilton's CEO Christopher Nassetta, ITT Corp.'s CEO Luca Savi said the company's board of directors had concluded that the offer was "not in the best interests of ITT and its shareholders."
Instead, ITT Corp. said it would pursue a "value-enhancing strategy" that would include spinning off its three main businesses - defense, energy, and industrial - into separate publicly traded companies. The company said the spinoff would enable each business to focus on its core competencies and unlock value for shareholders.
The sale of the Alcatel Alsthom stake is part of this strategy, ITT Corp. said. The company noted that the stake had appreciated significantly since its acquisition, but was now less strategic to its core businesses.
"We are pleased to have reached this agreement to divest our Alcatel Alsthom equity investment, which we believe is the right decision for ITT and our shareholders," Savi said in the statement. "As we move forward with the separation of our three businesses, we remain committed to unlocking the full potential of ITT's diverse portfolio of innovative products and services."
The sale of the Alcatel Alsthom stake is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, the company said.
Hilton, for its part, said it was disappointed by ITT Corp.'s decision to reject its offer and pursue a different strategy. In a statement released on Monday, Hilton said it believed its offer was fair and represented a "compelling opportunity" for ITT's shareholders.
"We continue to believe that combining Hilton and ITT represents a unique opportunity to create significant value for both companies and their stakeholders," Nassetta said. "We are disappointed that ITT's board has chosen a path that we believe is not in the best interests of its shareholders. Nevertheless, we remain focused on creating value for our own shareholders and executing on our strategic priorities."
The proposed acquisition of ITT Corp. by Hilton would have created a new global player in the hospitality and defense industries, combining Hilton's expertise in hotel management with ITT Corp.'s experience in defense electronics and other advanced technologies.
However, the deal faced several hurdles, including regulatory scrutiny and objections from some ITT Corp. shareholders who believed the offer undervalued the company. With the sale of the Alcatel Alsthom stake, ITT Corp. has now signaled that it intends to pursue a different path to create value for its shareholders.
