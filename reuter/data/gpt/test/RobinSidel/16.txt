Service Corp to Continue Pursuing Acquisitions After Withdrawing Bid for Loewen Group Inc.
Houston-based funeral service provider, Service Corporation International (SCI), has announced it will continue to pursue acquisitions after withdrawing its bid for the Loewen Group Incorporated. The corporation stated that the decision was based on regulatory concerns and a lack of synergies between the two firms.
SCI's parent company, the Houston American Energy Corporation, made a $16.45 per share all-cash offer for Loewen back in November 2021. This bid was intended to expand SCI's foothold in the funeral market, increasing its operating income by an estimated $640 million.
However, the company changed its stance after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) expressed regulatory concerns over the proposed merger. SCI's announcement emphasized that the company will continue to pursue acquisitions, but only where there are clear benefits for shareholders, a strong strategic rationale, and no significant regulatory hurdles.
Loewen has a significant presence in Western Canada and is the second-largest operator of funeral homes in the United States, with an estimated 3,000 locations. SCI is also a large player in the funeral industry, with more than 1,800 funeral homes and cemeteries across North America. Its flagship brand, Dignity Memorial, has been serving families for over 50 years.
SCI CEO R. William Shouldice stated that the corporation remains "committed to growing our share of the death care industry," but emphasized the need to "look at each potential acquisition as a standalone opportunity." He added that the company's recent acquisition of a network of cremation centers in Florida demonstrates its continuing acquisition strategy.
Service Corp International is one of the largest providers of funeral and cemetery services in the US and Canada, with a market capitalization of over $9 billion. It operates under a number of brands, including Dignity Memorial, Advantage, and Funeraria Del Angel. The company has grown substantially through acquisitions in recent years, acquiring over 1,200 funeral homes and 400 cemeteries across North America.
The funeral industry is highly fragmented, with an estimated 19,000 funeral homes and 120,000 cemeteries operating across the US. The industry is also expected to experience growth over the next decade, driven by an aging population and changing consumer preferences.
Service Corp International's decision to withdraw its bid for Loewen may have disappointed some investors, but the company's continuing acquisition strategy suggests that it remains committed to expanding its presence in the funeral industry. The company's focus on regulatory compliance and strategic fit may lead to more targeted and successful acquisitions in the future.
