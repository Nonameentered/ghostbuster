Tyco International Bids $4 Billion for American Standard; Offer Rejected
Tyco International, a global security company, recently made a $4 billion bid for American Standard, a plumbing supplies and fixtures manufacturer. However, their offer was rejected by American Standard's board of directors.
The bid was made in the hopes of expanding Tyco's presence in the building and construction industry. American Standard is a leading manufacturer of bathroom and kitchen fixtures, as well as heating and air conditioning systems. The acquisition would have allowed Tyco to diversify its portfolio and offer a wider range of products to its customers.
The decision to reject the offer was based on American Standard's belief that the bid undervalued the company. "After careful review and consideration, the board of directors has determined that the offer from Tyco International does not reflect the full and fair value of American Standard," said the company in a press release.
Tyco responded to the rejection by stating that they believed their offer was fair and would have been beneficial for both companies. "We believe that our proposal represented a compelling opportunity for the shareholders of American Standard, as well as for customers and employees of both companies," said a spokesperson for Tyco.
The bid was seen as a strategic move by Tyco, which has been undergoing a transformation in recent years. The company has been focusing on diversifying its portfolio and moving away from its roots as a security provider. In 2016, Tyco merged with Johnson Controls to create Johnson Controls International, which was later renamed to Johnson Controls.
Johnson Controls is now a leading provider of building and energy solutions, offering products and services in the areas of HVAC, fire and security, and energy storage. The acquisition of American Standard would have further bolstered Johnson Controls' position in the building and construction industry.
Despite the rejection, Tyco has not ruled out the possibility of making another bid in the future. "While we are disappointed that our proposal was not accepted at this time, we remain committed to pursuing opportunities that will create long-term value for our shareholders and customers," said the spokesperson.
The rejection of Tyco's bid has not had a significant impact on the stock prices of either company. American Standard's shares remained largely unchanged, while Tyco's shares saw a slight dip following the announcement.
As for American Standard, the company is now focused on continuing its growth strategy and expanding its presence in the market. "We remain committed to executing our growth strategy and delivering value to our shareholders," said the company in the press release.
The bidding war between companies is not uncommon, particularly in the building and construction industry. In recent years, there have been several high-profile acquisitions and mergers, as companies seek to expand their portfolios and gain a greater share of the market.
While Tyco's bid for American Standard may have been rejected, it is likely that the company will continue to seek out other opportunities for growth and expansion in the years to come.
