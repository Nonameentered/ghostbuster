Hilton Hotels Corp has announced plans to launch a hostile takeover bid for ITT Corp in a move that could see the hospitality giant take control of ITT's top-quality assets. The deal is estimated to be worth $6.5 billion and would bring together two of the biggest players in the hotel industry.
The move by Hilton comes as part of a wider strategy to expand its presence in the luxury hotel market. ITT owns a number of high-end hotel brands, including Sheraton and Westin, as well as a range of vacation resorts and cruise lines.
"We believe that ITT Corp's premium brands and unique assets would be an excellent fit for the Hilton portfolio," said a spokesperson for Hilton. "We are excited about the opportunity to work with ITT's talented teams and to bring our expertise in hospitality to their existing operations."
However, ITT's management has indicated that it is not interested in selling the company to Hilton, and has urged shareholders to reject the deal. In a statement, ITT CEO Mary Dillon said that the proposed takeover would undervalue the company and its assets, and would not be in the best interests of shareholders.
"We are confident in the strength of our business and our ability to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term," said Dillon. "We believe that Hilton's proposal is opportunistic and does not reflect the true value of ITT's unique assets."
In response, Hilton has launched a public relations campaign to rally support for its bid. The company has released a series of statements and advertisements outlining the benefits of the proposed takeover, and has held meetings with key ITT shareholders to discuss the potential deal.
"Our offer represents a significant premium on the current value of ITT shares, and we believe that our proposal is fair and reasonable," said the Hilton spokesperson. "We are confident that our strategy for unlocking the value of ITT's assets will benefit all shareholders."
If the takeover bid is successful, it would mark a major consolidation in the hotel industry. Hilton is already one of the largest hotel companies in the world, with a portfolio of more than 6,000 properties across 118 countries. Acquiring ITT's assets would further cement its position as a leader in the luxury hotel market.
However, the proposed takeover has faced criticism from some quarters, with analysts warning that the combined company could face antitrust scrutiny. The US Department of Justice has previously scrutinized mergers in the hospitality industry, and it is possible that any deal between Hilton and ITT could come under similar scrutiny.
In addition, some ITT shareholders have expressed concerns over the potential impact of the merger on the company's culture and operations. ITT has a longstanding reputation for innovation and entrepreneurialism, and some investors fear that a takeover by a larger, more established company could stifle this culture.
Despite these concerns, however, Hilton remains confident in the potential of the proposed takeover. "We believe that bringing ITT's assets into the Hilton portfolio would allow us to offer a wider range of options to customers and to capitalize on growth opportunities in the luxury hotel market," said the spokesperson. "We are committed to working with ITT's teams to ensure a smooth transition and to deliver value to all shareholders."
The outcome of the takeover bid remains uncertain, and it is possible that the two companies could reach a compromise or that ITT could find another buyer. However, for now at least, all eyes are on Hilton as it seeks to take control of some of the most sought-after assets in the hotel industry.
