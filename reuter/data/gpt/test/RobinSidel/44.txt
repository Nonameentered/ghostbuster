On Monday, ITT Corporation announced that it has rejected a takeover offer of $6.5 billion from Hilton Worldwide Holdings. ITT said that the proposal significantly undervalued the company, and that it was not in the best interests of shareholders to sell at the current price.
ITT, a global engineering and manufacturing company, has been exploring strategic options to boost shareholder value for the past few months. The company recently spun off its water business into a separate publicly traded company, Xylem, and agreed to sell its Industrial Process business to Flowserve Corporation for $1.8 billion.
In a statement, ITT said that it is committed to maximizing value for its shareholders, and is still exploring strategic alternatives, including the potential sale of non-core assets. The company has already identified several businesses that could be sold, including its Interconnect Solutions and Control Technologies businesses.
The Interconnect Solutions business designs and manufactures connectors, cable assemblies, and other interconnect products for a variety of industries, including aerospace, defense, and transportation. The Control Technologies business provides custom-engineered valves and pumps for the oil and gas industry.
“These businesses have strong market positions and technical capabilities, but they are not core to our long-term strategy,” said ITT CEO Denise Ramos in a conference call on Monday. “We believe that divesting these businesses could unlock significant value for our shareholders and allow us to focus on our core businesses, which have higher growth potential and better margins.”
ITT also announced that it plans to increase its share buyback program by $500 million, bringing the total authorized amount to $1.5 billion. The company said that it has already repurchased $590 million worth of shares this year, and expects to continue buying back shares in the near future.
Investors reacted positively to the news, sending ITT’s share price up nearly 4% in early morning trading on Monday. However, some analysts were disappointed that the Hilton deal fell through, as it would have added a well-known brand to the company’s portfolio and given it a stronger presence in the hospitality industry.
“ITT needs to be more aggressive in pursuing acquisitions that can add value to the company,” said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, which owns shares in ITT. “We believe that the Hilton deal would have been a good strategic move, and we’re disappointed that it didn’t work out.”
Hilton has not commented on ITT’s rejection of the takeover offer, but analysts have speculated that the company may still be interested in acquiring ITT at a higher price. Hilton, one of the world’s largest hotel companies, has been actively expanding its portfolio in recent years, acquiring several hotel brands and properties around the world.
For ITT, the focus is now on divesting non-core assets and maximizing value for shareholders. The company said that it expects to complete the sale of its Industrial Process business to Flowserve by the end of the year, and hopes to have a plan for the Interconnect Solutions and Control Technologies businesses by early 2017.
“We’re committed to unlocking value for our shareholders, and we believe that our strategic plan will do just that,” said Ramos. “We will continue to evaluate all options and make decisions that are in the best interests of our shareholders and our business.”
