The bidding war between Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway over Conrail Inc may have come to an end, but legal and regulatory battles are expected to linger.
Canadian Pacific Railway had initially made a $27 billion offer for the U.S. railway company, but Canadian National Railway swooped in with a higher bid of $33.6 billion, leading Conrail to accept the latter offer.
However, the approval process for the acquisition is expected to be a long and arduous road as it navigates through regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and political pushback.
Many concerned parties are worried about the implications of this acquisition on competition in the railway industry. The acquisition would mean that Canadian National Railway would have access to more than 19,500 miles of railroad tracks, which would give them a significant edge over other railway companies.
The Surface Transportation Board, the regulatory body responsible for overseeing the merger of railway companies, has stated that it will carefully scrutinize the acquisition to ensure that there are no negative effects on competition in the industry.
It is also likely that legal challenges will arise, as some parties seek to challenge the acquisition on antitrust grounds. These parties argue that the acquisition would result in reduced competition, leading to higher prices and poorer service for customers.
In addition to the legal and regulatory battles, there has been political pushback against the acquisition. Some lawmakers have voiced concerns about the potential loss of jobs and the impact on rural communities that rely on rail transportation.
The mayors of several cities, including Philadelphia and Detroit, have also expressed their opposition to the acquisition, citing concerns about reduced competition and the potential for increased freight congestion in their regions.
Despite the challenges ahead, Canadian National Railway remains optimistic about the acquisition. The company has stated that the acquisition would enable them to create a more efficient and reliable rail network that will benefit customers and the North American economy as a whole.
Canadian Pacific Railway, however, remains determined to fight the acquisition. The company has criticized the Surface Transportation Board's approval process, arguing that it is too lenient on mega-mergers and that the acquisition would have disastrous consequences for the railway industry.
In a statement to the media, Canadian Pacific Railway's CEO, Keith Creel, said: "We continue to believe that the Canadian National proposal is ill-advised and not in the best interests of the North American rail industry. We remain committed to pursuing all available options to have our superior proposal considered by the Surface Transportation Board."
The impact of this acquisition on the railway industry and on North American businesses remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: the legal and regulatory battles ahead will be long and difficult, and the outcome is far from certain. 
In conclusion, while the bidding war over Conrail Inc may have ended, a new battle is just beginning, and the outcome of this acquisition will have far-reaching consequences for the railway industry, businesses, and consumers alike.
