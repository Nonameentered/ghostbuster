Western Resources Inc has announced that it intends to increase its offer for ADT Ltd, as it seeks to take control of the leading provider of electronic security, fire protection, and other monitoring services for businesses in North America.
In a statement released on Friday, Western Resources stated that it was planning to raise its bid for ADT from $11 to $12 per share, valuing the company at around $8 billion. This marks an escalation of the hostile takeover bid that the company has been pursuing since November last year.
Western Resources has made several attempts to acquire ADT over the past few months, but each offer has been rejected by the target company's shareholders. The latest bid was initially made in January and was due to expire on Friday, but the company has now extended the offer until May 23 to give shareholders more time to consider the proposal.
In its statement, Western Resources said that it believed the revised offer was "extremely attractive" and represented "the best opportunity for ADT shareholders to realize full and fair value for their investment." It added that it remained committed to the transaction and was "prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to consummate the offer."
The hostile takeover bid has been contentious from the start, with ADT's management team and board of directors rejecting the initial offer and urging shareholders to do the same. They argued that the company was worth more than the $11 per share value that Western Resources had offered and that the takeover would not be in the best interests of the company or its stakeholders.
However, Western Resources has remained undeterred, saying that its offer represented a significant premium over ADT's current trading price and that it could provide valuable synergies and growth opportunities for both companies.
The takeover bid has also attracted scrutiny from regulators, with the US Federal Trade Commission launching an investigation into the proposed merger earlier this year. The agency is concerned that the combination of the two companies could harm competition in the electronic security and monitoring industry.
Western Resources has said that it is confident that the proposed merger would not violate antitrust laws and that it would work with regulators to address any concerns they may have. However, it remains to be seen whether the increased offer will be enough to persuade ADT shareholders to accept the deal.
The takeover bid has also sparked a lot of interest among investors, with many analysts expecting a bidding war to break out for ADT's assets. Some have speculated that other companies, such as Honeywell, Johnson Controls, or even Google, could enter the fray with competing offers, further driving up the price of the company.
Despite the uncertain future of the takeover bid, Western Resources remains bullish about its prospects. The company's CEO, John Greer, said in a recent interview that he believed the electronic security industry was poised for strong growth in the coming years, driven by the increasing demand for advanced security solutions in a wide variety of industries.
"We believe that ADT is the perfect fit for our business and that our combined strengths will position us as a leader in the electronic security industry," he said.
However, the future of the electronic security industry remains uncertain, and it is unclear whether a takeover of ADT by Western Resources or any other company would ultimately be beneficial for the industry or its customers. Nonetheless, the growing interest in the sector suggests that investors and analysts are betting on its success in the years to come.
