Norfolk Southern Prepares to Buy Nearly 10% of Conrail in Railroad Giant Control Fight
Norfolk Southern Corporation, one of the leading transportation companies in the United States, is preparing to acquire a stake of nearly 10% in Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), intensifying a control fight among the railroad giants.
Conrail is a major provider of rail freight transportation in the northeastern part of the US and is considered a prize asset. Its board of directors, however, has been at the center of a takeover battle in recent weeks. Canadian Pacific Railway had bid for Conrail, but the offer was rejected by Conrail's board as undervalued. Now, Norfolk Southern is eyeing the asset.
According to reports, Norfolk Southern is seeking to buy a 9.9% stake in Conrail, equivalent to around $3 billion, from hedge fund Mantle Ridge, which owns nearly 8.1% of Conrail. An agreement has not yet been reached, but industry insiders say that the deal is in the final stages of negotiation.
In an attempt to stop the acquisition, Canadian Pacific Railway has reportedly hired a lobbying firm in Washington, D.C. to pressure the US government to intervene in the potential sale.
The takeover bid by Norfolk Southern follows a difficult year for the company. The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced demand for transportation services, including rail freight. The company also suffered a significant loss in its third-quarter earnings, falling 29% to $1.5 billion compared to the same period in 2019.
The acquisition of Conrail could provide a much-needed boost to Norfolk Southern's earnings, as the company looks to expand its operations in the northeastern part of the US.
"The acquisition of Conrail would be a significant win for Norfolk Southern," said an industry expert. "It would allow them to expand their operations and give them a foothold in the lucrative northeastern market."
The acquisition would also give Norfolk Southern a considerable advantage over its competitors. The transportation industry in the US is highly fragmented, and rapid consolidation has been occurring in recent years. The acquisition of Conrail would put Norfolk Southern in a much stronger position in the industry.
However, the acquisition could also face regulatory hurdles. The Biden administration is expected to take a tougher stance on antitrust issues than the previous administration, and a potential acquisition of Conrail by Norfolk Southern could be scrutinized.
In summary, Norfolk Southern's bid for nearly 10% of Conrail is the latest development in the fight for control of the railroad giant. Although a deal has not yet been reached, the acquisition would be a significant win for Norfolk Southern, allowing them to expand their operations in the northeastern US and put them in a stronger position in the industry. However, regulatory hurdles could delay or even prevent the acquisition, making the ongoing control fight all the more interesting and uncertain.
