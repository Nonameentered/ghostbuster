Jacksonville, FL - In a recent interview, CSX Chairman and CEO James Foote expressed his confidence in the approval of the Conrail merger, calling a rival bidder's move "desperate."
Last week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) submitted a last-minute bid to acquire Conrail, seeking to outbid CSX's offer. However, Foote believes that CP's bid is just a last-ditch effort to derail the Conrail-CSX merger.
"We've been working closely with Conrail for months to ensure a seamless integration, and we remain fully committed to this transaction," Foote said. "Canadian Pacific's sudden bid seems desperate. We're confident that our proposal is the best one for Conrail and its shareholders."
Foote also highlighted the benefits of the merger for both CSX and Conrail customers, emphasizing the improved efficiency and expanded network that would result from the combination of the two railroads.
"Both CSX and Conrail have long-standing commitments to providing our customers with reliable and efficient service," Foote said. "By bringing our networks together, we can enhance these commitments and offer even greater value to our customers. This merger will create a more competitive and efficient rail industry."
In response to CP's bid, Conrail released a statement reaffirming its support for the CSX merger.
"Conrail's board of directors and management team have thoroughly evaluated the strategic and financial merits of both proposals, and remain convinced that the transaction with CSX is the best outcome for Conrail and its shareholders," the statement reads.
CP has yet to issue a formal response to Foote's comments.
The Conrail-CSX merger has been under review by regulatory agencies since it was first announced in July. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) is currently conducting a comprehensive environmental and economic review of the merger, examining its potential impact on competition, service quality, and environmental factors.
Foote expressed confidence in the outcome of the STB review, stating that CSX and Conrail have taken significant steps to address any concerns raised by regulators and stakeholders.
"We're committed to working with the STB to ensure a thorough and transparent review process," Foote said. "We're confident that the benefits of this merger will ultimately outweigh any potential concerns, and we look forward to completing this transaction and delivering value to our customers and shareholders."
