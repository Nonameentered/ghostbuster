The Chairman and CEO of Capgemini, Paul Hermelin, has announced that CGIP, the holding company of the French multinational information technology services company, is looking to sell up to a 20% stake in Capgemini. The Chairman declared that this move would provide more liquidity to CGIP while providing additional growth opportunities for Capgemini.
Hermelin expressed that there are a number of investment options available for CGIP, including the possibility of a share buyback and acquisitions. However, the 20% stake sale remains the most notable action that the company has considered at present.
A sale of shares to institutional investors has been seen as a possibility following the recent strong performance of Capgemeni and its substantial market capitalization of €19.3 billion. The shares of Capgemini are currently priced at €141.70, reflecting an increase of 17% over the past year.
CGIP currently owns 24% of Capgemini, and its proposed sale of shares would reduce its stake in the company to around 4%. In the past, Capgemini has been subject to shareholder activism that sought greater returns for shareholders, which could trigger a response from current shareholders, particularly with the pricing of the shares being set to receive a boost on the back of a strong financial performance.
Capgemini may further look at acquisitions to boost its growth, with Hermelin indicating that the company may be interested in acquiring other businesses within the IT services sector. The focus of the acquisitions would be on building out its digital strategy capabilities and coming up with new products. 
Capgemini has pressed on with acquisitions in the past; the company recently purchased Altran for €3.6 billion, which was considered a major move towards the strengthening of the company's digital capabilities. 
The Chairman has stated that while CGIP has no concrete plans for acquisitions, it would be a consideration for the company if the opportunity presented itself. Hermelin added that Capgemini is still on the lookout for businesses that would fit in with the company's overall strategy, and that the company would keep pursuing acquisition targets so as to hasten its growth through inorganic means.
In conclusion, the sale of the 20% stake in Capgemini is currently being considered as a potential option by CGIPs Chairman, Paul Hermelin, with the hopes of building more liquidity and creating new growth opportunities for Capgemini. While other investment options, including acquisitions and share buybacks, are also being weighed up, a sale of shares appears to be a more viable option at the moment. Whether this move will lead to greater shareholder returns or leave investors hesitant to act will be seen in the months ahead.
