ITT Corp, the leading provider of technology solutions for the global hospitality and travel industries, has announced that it will defend against an unsolicited bid from Hilton Hotels Corp. ITT, which has a market capitalization of approximately $3.5 billion, said that it would review Hilton's offer but would continue to pursue its growth strategy.
"We have a strong and proven track record of delivering value to our shareholders, and we believe that our existing growth strategy will deliver even greater returns in the years ahead," said ITT CEO Jay Bartlett. "We will carefully evaluate Hilton's proposal, but we remain committed to the long-term success of our business."
The offer from Hilton, which has a market capitalization of approximately $30 billion, would value ITT at around $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Hilton's bid follows months of speculation that the hotel giant was interested in acquiring a technology provider to enhance its capabilities in the fast-growing digital travel market.
"ITT has a unique set of assets and capabilities that would complement Hilton's existing business and accelerate our growth in the hospitality and travel sectors," said Hilton CEO Chris Nassetta. "We believe that our offer represents a compelling opportunity for ITT's shareholders and for our own stakeholders."
ITT's shares rose nearly 20% following news of the offer, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. However, some analysts have expressed skepticism about the deal, noting that ITT's business is highly specialized and may not fit well with Hilton's broader hotel portfolio.
"It's not clear that Hilton would be able to extract significant synergies from the acquisition, given the nature of ITT's business and the fact that it operates in a somewhat niche market," said David Schick, an analyst at Consumer Edge Research. "It's possible that other suitors could emerge, but for now it seems that ITT intends to stand its ground."
ITT has been investing heavily in new technologies and digital platforms in recent years, as it seeks to capture a larger share of the rapidly growing online travel market. The company has launched a suite of innovative products and services, including a mobile app that allows travelers to book and manage their trips from their smartphones and a cloud-based reservation system that enables hotels to automate and streamline their operations.
"We believe that our investments in technology and our focus on innovation have positioned ITT as a leader in the hospitality and travel industries," said Bartlett. "We will continue to build on that leadership position and to pursue growth opportunities that deliver value to our shareholders."
