Rubbermaid, an American manufacturer of household goods and storage containers, has announced its acquisition of Graco, a global leader in baby products and equipment. The move is part of Rubbermaid's strategy to reduce its reliance on plastic and diversify its product portfolio amid rising raw material costs.
According to industry experts, the price of plastic resin – the raw material used to make plastic products – has surged by nearly 120% in the past year due to supply chain disruptions and increasing demand. This has put pressure on companies like Rubbermaid, which rely heavily on plastic in their manufacturing processes.
To address this challenge, Rubbermaid has decided to acquire Graco, which specializes in high-quality baby gear and equipment such as strollers, car seats, and playpens. This will allow Rubbermaid to tap into a new market and expand its offerings beyond traditional household and storage products.
"We are excited to add Graco to our family of brands and offer our customers a wider range of products that are made using sustainable and eco-friendly materials," said Rubbermaid CEO Mike Bauer. "This acquisition reflects our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint and supporting the transition to a circular economy."
In addition to reducing its reliance on plastic, Rubbermaid is also focusing on reducing waste and promoting sustainable manufacturing practices. The company has set a goal to achieve 100% recycled or renewable materials in its products by 2025 and has introduced several initiatives to promote recycling and reusing its products.
The acquisition of Graco is expected to further enhance Rubbermaid's sustainability efforts and drive growth by expanding its customer base and reaching new markets. Graco, with its established reputation for quality and innovation, is a perfect fit for Rubbermaid's brand portfolio and will help the company stay ahead of changing consumer trends and preferences.
"We are thrilled to join forces with Rubbermaid and leverage their expertise in sustainable and eco-friendly manufacturing practices," said Graco CEO James Barwille. "Together, we can develop new products and services that cater to the evolving needs of our customers while also minimizing our impact on the environment."
The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of this year and will involve a cash payment of $1.2 billion. Rubbermaid expects the deal to be accretive to earnings in the first full year after closing and to generate significant cost synergies over time.
Overall, the acquisition of Graco marks a significant step forward for Rubbermaid in its efforts to reduce its reliance on plastic and promote sustainable manufacturing practices. With this strategic move, the company is well-positioned to thrive in an increasingly competitive and challenging business environment.
