Waltham-based Raytheon and General Motors announced yesterday the completion of their $9.5 billion deal for Raytheon’s acquisition of the Hughes Aircraft unit of General Motors. The newly expanded defense contractor will become the third-largest in the US and will have the capability to offer a wider range of products and services.
“The acquisition of Hughes Aircraft strengthens our ability to provide our customers with the advanced technology and solutions they need to enhance national security,” said Raytheon CEO Thomas A. Kennedy. “We are excited to welcome Hughes Aircraft employees to our team and look forward to integrating their expertise and capabilities into our business.”
The acquisition brings Raytheon’s workforce to nearly 100,000 employees worldwide. Hughes Aircraft, which is based in El Segundo, California, employs approximately 25,000 people and produces a wide range of defense products, including electronic systems, air-to-air missiles, and reconnaissance aircraft.
Under the terms of the deal, Raytheon will assume all of the liabilities and assets associated with Hughes Aircraft’s operations, including its existing contracts with the US government.
General Motors had been considering the sale of Hughes Aircraft for several months, as part of its ongoing effort to streamline its business and focus on its core operations. The company said it will use the proceeds from the sale to invest in its automotive business and other strategic initiatives.
“This transaction is the culmination of a year of hard work by our team and represents a major step forward in our efforts to enhance shareholder value,” said General Motors CEO Mary Barra. “We are proud of our legacy as one of America’s leading defense contractors and are confident that Raytheon will continue to build on that legacy as it moves forward.”
The acquisition of Hughes Aircraft is expected to provide Raytheon with several important strategic benefits. For one, it will enable the company to expand its presence in the electronic systems market, one of its core areas of strength. In addition, it will provide Raytheon with access to new customers and markets, particularly in the area of reconnaissance systems.
“This acquisition is a transformative moment for Raytheon,” said Kennedy. “It will enable us to offer a broader range of products and services to our customers, while at the same time driving greater efficiency and profitability for our shareholders.”
The acquisition of Hughes Aircraft is the latest in a series of moves by Raytheon to consolidate its position as a leading provider of advanced military technology. Last year, the company acquired United Technologies’ aerospace and defense businesses in a deal worth $121 billion. The acquisition of Hughes Aircraft is expected to build on that momentum and help Raytheon to continue to grow its business and capabilities in the coming years.
The deal is also part of the ongoing consolidation trend in the aerospace and defense industry, as companies seek to gain scale and efficiency in an increasingly competitive market. The combination of Raytheon and Hughes Aircraft will create a formidable competitor to industry leaders like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.
However, there are concerns that the consolidation trend could ultimately lead to reduced competition and higher prices for government customers. In response to these concerns, the US Department of Defense has indicated that it will closely monitor the impact of the Raytheon-Hughes Aircraft deal on the industry.
Overall, though, the acquisition of Hughes Aircraft appears to be a significant step forward for Raytheon and a positive development for the defense industry as a whole. With its expanded capabilities and expertise, the company is well-positioned to meet the evolving needs of its customers and contribute to the ongoing development of new and advanced military technologies.
