Mid-American Waste Systems, a leading provider of waste removal services, has filed for bankruptcy and reached an agreement to sell its assets to USA Waste Services Inc. The decision came after months of financial struggles, rising debt, and fierce competition in the industry.
The deal with USA Waste Services, a Texas-based waste management firm, is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks pending court approval. Under the agreement, USA Waste Services will acquire Mid-American Waste's trucks, equipment, contracts, and customer base in several Midwest states, including Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky.
The sale, valued at approximately $30 million, will allow Mid-American Waste to pay off its debts, including $10 million in senior secured debt to its lender, Monroe Capital LLC. In a statement, Monroe Capital said it supports the sale as the best possible outcome for Mid-American Waste and its stakeholders.
"This transaction will allow Mid-American Waste to move forward in the best interests of its employees, customers, and creditors," said Aaron Peck, managing director at Monroe Capital. "We are pleased to have worked with the company and USA Waste Services to facilitate a smooth and efficient sale process."
Mid-American Waste Systems, founded in 1982, has been a major player in the waste management industry for decades, serving commercial, industrial, and residential clients across the Midwest. However, the company has faced significant challenges in recent years as the waste removal market became increasingly saturated and competitive.
According to court documents, Mid-American Waste had been losing money for several years and had struggled to keep up with its debt payments. The company's revenue declined by about 10% in 2020 compared to the previous year, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy.
In a statement, Mid-American Waste CEO Mark Rumpke said the bankruptcy filing and asset sale were necessary steps to ensure the company's long-term viability.
"We are confident that the sale to USA Waste Services will provide a stable footing for our customers, employees, and the communities we serve," Rumpke said. "Our team is committed to ensuring a seamless transition for our customers and employees."
USA Waste Services, which operates in more than 30 states and is owned by global waste management firm Waste Management Inc., said the acquisition of Mid-American Waste would expand its footprint in the Midwest and strengthen its position in the competitive waste removal market.
"We are excited to welcome Mid-American Waste's customers and employees to the USA Waste Services family," said Jim Trevathan, executive vice president and COO of Waste Management. "We look forward to building on the company's legacy of service and delivering innovative waste management solutions to our new customers."
The deal comes amid a period of consolidation in the waste management industry, with several large players expanding their operations through mergers and acquisitions. Waste Management has been one of the most active acquirers, with several major deals in recent years, including the $4.6 billion acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services Inc. in 2019.
While the sale of Mid-American Waste's assets to USA Waste Services will likely result in some job losses, both companies have committed to minimizing the impact on employees and ensuring a smooth transition for affected workers.
"We are aware of the potential impact on employees and will be working with USA Waste Services to ensure a fair and equitable outcome for all affected parties," Rumpke said. "Our priority is to ensure that our employees receive the support and resources they need during this transition."
