The board of ITT Corp has announced its plan to sell non-core assets rather than accepting a $6.5 billion bid from Hilton Hotels. However, financial analysts are skeptical of ITT Corp's strategy, questioning the effectiveness of selling assets to create long-term value.
The move comes after Hilton Hotels made an unsolicited bid for ITT Corp, one of the world's largest manufacturers of pumps, valves, and other engineered products. Instead of accepting the offer, ITT Corp's board has decided to pursue a strategy of asset sales in the hopes of unlocking value for shareholders.
According to ITT Corp's CEO, the company's non-core assets are worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. The company plans to sell these assets over the next few years, with the proceeds being used for share buybacks, debt repayment, and acquisitions in ITT Corp's core businesses.
However, some analysts are concerned that ITT Corp's plan may not be the best strategy for creating value. They point out that selling assets is often a short-term fix that doesn't address underlying issues in a company's core businesses.
"There's a danger in just selling off assets to create value," said John S. Roberts, a senior analyst at UBS. "It's not a sustainable strategy in the long run. You have to ask, what is the strategy for growth?"
Other analysts suggest that ITT Corp's board may be overvaluing the company's non-core assets. "There's a view that they're selling assets that are not particularly valuable to begin with," said Steve Milunovich, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Meanwhile, some investors are frustrated with ITT Corp's decision to reject the Hilton Hotels bid. "It's disappointing that the board didn't consider the offer seriously," said Robert Olstein, chairman of Olstein Capital Management, which owns shares in ITT Corp. "I think they missed an opportunity to create value for shareholders."
However, ITT Corp's board defends its decision to pursue a strategy of asset sales. In a statement, the board said that it believes the company's non-core assets are undervalued and that selling them will create value for shareholders in the long run.
"We are committed to creating sustainable value for our shareholders," said ITT Corp's CEO, Denise Ramos. "Our strategy of asset sales, debt reduction, and acquisitions in our core businesses is designed to do just that."
Ultimately, only time will tell whether ITT Corp's plan will be successful in creating value for its shareholders. While some analysts are skeptical, others are cautiously optimistic that the company's strategy will pay off in the long run.
