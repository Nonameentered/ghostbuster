On Tuesday, ITT Corp. announced that it was considering acquiring another company as a defense against Hilton's $6.5 billion bid. The company has been recently seeking strategic alternatives after a drop in their stock price of more than 20%. ITT's current market value is approximately $4.4 billion, making Hilton's bid a considerable one.
ITT is a diversified manufacturing company that supplies products and services to a range of industries including the aerospace, defense, and industrial markets. The company has been exploring options to enhance shareholder value, including a potential sale or merger with another entity. The prospect of acquiring another company may provide ITT with the opportunity to strengthen its position in the market and help fend off Hilton's bid.
Hilton's acquisition proposal poses a significant threat to ITT's future. The potential acquisition would merge two of the world's largest hotel chains, creating a company with over 1.5 million hotel rooms globally. The merger would put significant pressure on ITT's hotel business, which generates a large portion of the company's revenue. This pressure could force ITT to sell off assets, reduce headcount or undertake other initiatives to increase profitability.
The company's CEO, Luca Del Passo, stressed that ITT would consider "all options" to enhance shareholder value, and that the acquisition of another company was one of the options being considered. He also mentioned that ITT has a strong balance sheet and a history of executing successful acquisitions.
It remains unclear which company ITT is considering to acquire. However, sources say that the company is exploring potential acquisitions in the defense industry. The acquisition of a defense contractor could create a more diversified portfolio for ITT, with a focus on expanding its product offerings in the defense sector. 
The potential acquisition of a defense contractor may help ITT to better position itself as the U.S government increases defense spending. Over the last few years, the U.S government has steadily increased its defense budget. The increase is centered on modernizing and expanding the U.S military's capabilities. ITT, being a leading manufacturer of defense industry products, may be well-positioned to take advantage of this increased spending.
Analysts, however, believe that ITT's best move may be to focus on its core businesses, such as aerospace and defense industries, rather than acquiring another company. Some also suggest that ITT should focus on improving its current operations to create more shareholder value.
ITT's management is expected to provide more details on their strategic alternatives in the upcoming weeks. It remains to be seen whether ITT will explore the acquisition route to counter Hilton's big bid or if it will stick to improving its own business operations.
In conclusion, the future of ITT is uncertain. However, the company's management is determined to provide maximum value to shareholders. Analysts suggest that the company should focus on improving its core businesses but acquiring a company may be a viable option if it makes sense strategically. Nonetheless, investors will be closely watching how ITT responds to this potential acquisition threat.
