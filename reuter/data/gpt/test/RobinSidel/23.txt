Norfolk Southern, a major transport company, has unveiled a new strategy to block the planned merger of competitor firm Conrail. However, industry experts have expressed skepticism over its potential for success.
Norfolk Southern announced its plan on Monday, which will involve lobbying government regulators, customer outreach, and potential legal action. The company claims that the proposed merger of Conrail and Canadian Pacific Railway would be bad for competition and reduce customers' options for freight transport.
"We're deeply concerned about the potential merger between Conrail and Canadian Pacific," Norfolk Southern's CEO, James A. Squires, said in a statement. "It would undermine competition, eliminate choices for customers, and lead to higher prices and reduced service quality."
The merger, which was announced in early November, would create the largest rail company in North America, with a combined market value of around $70 billion. The plan has received support from both Conrail and Canadian Pacific, as well as some notable industry figures.
However, Norfolk Southern's new strategy aims to challenge this. The company plans to launch a public campaign to highlight the potential negative impact of the merger. It also intends to work with lawmakers, regulators, and industry partners to push for stronger antitrust enforcement measures.
Furthermore, Norfolk Southern is considering taking legal action to block the merger, depending on the outcome of regulatory reviews. "We will exhaust all legal and regulatory options to protect competition and ensure fair treatment," Squires said.
Despite the firm's confidence, industry experts are not convinced that its plan will be successful. The merger has already received support from several state governments, and many lawmakers have expressed their approval.
"It's a long shot that Norfolk Southern's efforts will succeed," said John Larkin, the CEO of transportation research and consulting firm Clarendon Group. "The regulatory environment is such that mergers like this are usually approved."
Other industry analysts agreed, citing the current political climate as a major obstacle for Norfolk Southern's efforts. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and a rapidly changing economic landscape, there are likely to be bigger concerns for lawmakers.
Additionally, some experts questioned Norfolk Southern's motivations. Critics have pointed out that the company's own proposed merger with Canadian Pacific was blocked by regulators in 2016, and that its opposition to the Conrail merger could be seen as an attempt to stifle competition.
In response to such criticisms, Squires stated that "Norfolk Southern has never opposed mergers that enhance, rather than diminish, competition." He added that the Conrail merger would give Canadian Pacific control of a crucial rail network, potentially reducing competition and increasing costs for customers.
Despite the skepticism from industry analysts, Norfolk Southern's new strategy demonstrates its determination to challenge the proposed merger. As the regulatory reviews continue, it remains to be seen how effective the transport giant's campaign will ultimately be.
