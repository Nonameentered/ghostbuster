Texaco Inc., one of the world's leading oil and gas companies, announced on Monday that it has completed its exit from the chemicals business by selling its Texas facility to Huntsman Corporation for $600 million. The move comes as part of Texaco's ongoing strategic review to focus on its core operations and invest in high-growth areas like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and digital technology.
The facility, located in Port Arthur, Texas, produces ethylene, propylene, and other chemical intermediates used in the manufacturing of a wide range of products, from plastics and packaging to automotive parts and electronics. Huntsman, a global specialty chemicals company based in The Woodlands, Texas, said it plans to integrate the facility into its own operations and expand its global reach.
"We are pleased to announce the successful completion of our exit from the chemicals business and the sale of our Port Arthur facility to Huntsman Corporation," said Peter Iamarino, Texaco's CEO. "This transaction enables us to sharpen our focus on our core businesses and accelerate our growth strategy to meet the changing needs of our customers and stakeholders."
The sale of the Port Arthur facility, which employs more than 500 people, is part of Texaco's broader plan to divest its non-core assets and streamline its operations. Last year, the company announced it would sell its lubricants business to Chevron Corporation for $1.2 billion. Texaco has also been exploring opportunities to sell its natural gas assets in the U.S. and Canada.
For Huntsman, the acquisition of the Port Arthur facility is expected to strengthen its position in the global chemical industry and enable it to better serve its customers. The company said it plans to invest in the facility and expand its product offerings, adding that it expects the acquisition to be accretive to its earnings immediately.
"Huntsman is excited to acquire this world-class facility and add its talented workforce to our team," said Peter Huntsman, Huntsman's CEO. "This acquisition represents a significant step in our portfolio transformation as we deepen our presence in the Gulf Coast region, which is a key hub for the chemical industry."
The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2021. It is also subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain third-party consents and the execution of various ancillary agreements.
This announcement marks the latest in a string of major deals in the chemical industry, as companies seek to consolidate their operations and focus on core businesses. Last year, for example, Dow Chemical and DuPont merged in a $130 billion deal, while BASF acquired the agricultural seed and chemical business of Bayer for $7 billion.
Overall, the chemical industry has been experiencing a period of growth and innovation, driven by advancements in materials science, biotechnology, and digital technology. With increasing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly products, companies are ramping up their investments in research and development to meet the changing needs of consumers and society.
In conclusion, the sale of the Port Arthur facility marks an important milestone for Texaco and Huntsman, as they both seek to enhance their positions in the global chemical industry. With its focus now squarely on its core operations, Texaco is well-positioned to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future, while Huntsman is poised for growth and expansion. As the chemical industry continues to evolve, these companies are sure to remain at the forefront of innovation and excellence.
