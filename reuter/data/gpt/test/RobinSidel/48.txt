ITT Corp, a leading global engineering and manufacturing company, has recently announced that it expects the sale of its non-core assets to take up to six months. The company has been focusing on restructuring and streamlining its operations to improve its financial position. 
ITT Corp has identified several non-core assets that it plans to sell, including its industrial process business, which includes pumps, valves, and aftermarket services, its connector business, and its KONI shock absorber business, among others. These businesses are expected to generate over $1 billion in proceeds when sold.
The sales process for these assets is expected to be rigorous and involves identifying potential buyers, evaluating bids, and conducting due diligence. This process is expected to take up to six months to complete.
In contrast, Madison Square Garden Properties, the entertainment company that owns and operates several high-profile venues, is expected to sell quickly. Madison Square Garden Properties has been exploring a sale of its assets since last year, and the company has recently stated that it has received several unsolicited offers for its assets.
Madison Square Garden Properties owns and operates several high-profile venues, including Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, and the Beacon Theatre. These venues attract millions of visitors each year and are considered some of the most iconic entertainment destinations in the world.
The sale of Madison Square Garden Properties is expected to be completed within a few months, and the company is expected to attract significant interest from potential buyers. The sale is expected to generate billions of dollars in proceeds, which will be used to invest in new growth opportunities and pay down debt.
Overall, the sale of these non-core assets represents a significant step forward for ITT Corp and Madison Square Garden Properties. By streamlining their operations and focusing on their core businesses, these companies are positioning themselves for long-term success and growth. The sales process is expected to take time, but the ultimate outcome is expected to be positive for both companies.
