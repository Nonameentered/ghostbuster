CSX and Conrail, two of the largest railway companies in the United States, announced today that they have reached an agreement on sweetened terms for their $8.5 billion merger.
The announcement followed weeks of negotiations between the two companies, during which both sides worked to address concerns raised by shareholders and regulators.
Under the revised terms of the merger, CSX will increase the cash component of its offer from $3.04 per Conrail share to $3.16 per share. In addition, Conrail shareholders will receive a one-time special dividend of $1.09 per share following the consummation of the merger.
CSX CEO Jim Foote said the revised terms “demonstrate our commitment to creating value for all shareholders and advancing our position as a global transportation leader.”
“We believe this transaction will unlock significant long-term value for both companies, and we are excited to move forward with the integration process,” Foote said.
Conrail CEO James Squires said the updated terms of the deal “reflect our shared belief in the tremendous potential of this partnership.”
“We are pleased to have reached an agreement that provides our shareholders with even greater value and positions the combined entity for long-term success,” Squires said.
The merger, which was first announced in February, has faced scrutiny from regulators and some Conrail shareholders who argued that the original offer undervalued the company.
The revised terms of the deal are expected to receive approval from both companies’ shareholders and regulatory agencies in the coming weeks.
If the merger is completed, the combined company will have an extensive network of rail yards and intermodal facilities throughout the eastern United States and will be capable of transporting a wide range of goods, including coal, chemicals, and finished products.
The deal is also expected to streamline operations and improve efficiency, which will help the company remain competitive in an increasingly crowded market.
The merger is one of the largest in the transportation industry in recent years and comes as railroads are under pressure to modernize their infrastructure and improve safety standards.
CSX, which is based in Jacksonville, Florida, has a market value of approximately $85 billion and operates in 23 states, while Conrail, which is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a market value of approximately $15 billion and operates in 10 states.
The two companies have a combined workforce of approximately 57,000 employees and generated net revenues of more than $26 billion in 2020.
The news of the revised merger terms was met with cautious optimism by industry analysts, who noted that the deal still faces some regulatory hurdles and could take several months to complete.
However, some analysts said that the revised terms of the deal were a positive development and could help address some of the concerns raised by Conrail shareholders.
“The sweetened terms are a clear signal that both sides remain committed to the merger and are working to address the concerns of all stakeholders,” said David Vernon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
“While there are still some regulatory hurdles to clear, this is a step in the right direction and could help pave the way for a successful integration.”
