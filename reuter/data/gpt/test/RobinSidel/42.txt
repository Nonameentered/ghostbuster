CVS Health Corporation announced its plan to acquire Revco drugstore chain for $2.8 billion, a move that the company expects will have a positive impact on its earnings in 1997 and 1998. The acquisition will increase CVS's presence in the drugstore market and extend its reach across the United States.
The purchase of Revco, the largest drugstore chain in the Midwest, will add 1,165 stores to CVS's existing network of over 4,000 stores. The acquisition will also give CVS access to Revco's customer base, which is concentrated in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. The transaction is set to be completed in the next six months, subject to regulatory approval.
In a statement released on Thursday, Larry J. Merlo, the President and CEO of CVS Health Corporation said, "We are thrilled to bring the Revco drugstore chain under the CVS Health Corporation umbrella. This acquisition will allow us to expand our presence in the Midwest and provide greater access to affordable healthcare products and services to a greater number of patients."
Mr. Merlo added that the strategic acquisition is expected to generate cost savings of approximately $350 million by 2000, with most of the savings to be realized in 1998 and 1999. The purchase price includes approximately $1.4 billion of Revco's debt. The acquisition will be financed through a combination of stock, cash, and debt.
Following the announcement of the acquisition, CVS's stock rose by 3.9%, closing at $80.60, while Revco's stock climbed by 9.6%, closing at $31.938. Wall Street analysts have praised the move, with many citing the benefits of increased economies of scale and greater geographic reach.
CVS Health Corporation is one of the largest pharmacy chains in the world, with revenues of approximately $256 billion in 2020. The company operates over 4,000 stores across the United States and Puerto Rico, as well as offering mail order pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy services, and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. The acquisition of Revco is part of the company's strategy to expand its operations and solidify its position in the highly competitive retail drugstore market.
