New York - The chairman of ITT Corp, Thomas Rise, has rejected an invitation from Hilton Worldwide to meet and discuss its proposal to acquire ITT's hotel operations for $10.5 billion. This comes in the midst of a hostile takeover bid from Hilton, which was announced earlier this month.
In his letter to Hilton's CEO, Christopher Nassetta, Rise said that the company had already received and was considering several other proposals from potential buyers, and that it was important to take the time to review and evaluate all offers before making any decisions.
"Given the complex financial and strategic considerations involved, we believe it is our responsibility to carefully consider all proposals in order to determine what is in the best interests of ITT's shareholders, customers and employees," Rise wrote. "Therefore, we cannot agree to a meeting at this time."
Hilton, in turn, has criticized ITT's decision, calling it a missed opportunity for both companies to "explore the potential benefits that a combination would bring to all stakeholders."
In a statement released on Tuesday, Nassetta said, "ITT's refusal to engage in discussions is disappointing and contrary to the best interests of its shareholders. We remain committed to pursuing this compelling opportunity and are confident that our proposal is superior to others that may be considered."
The proposal from Hilton includes a mix of cash and stock, valuing ITT's hotel business at $10.5 billion. If successful, the deal would create the world's largest hotel company by number of rooms and would give Hilton a significant foothold in the luxury hotel sector.
However, ITT has made it clear that it intends to explore all alternatives, including the possibility of selling its hotel business to a different buyer or spinning it off into a separate company.
Industry analysts have speculated that the decision to reject Hilton's invitation for a meeting could indicate that ITT is leaning towards other potential buyers or strategic alternatives.
Shares of ITT rose slightly on the news, closing up 0.8% at $54.62 on Tuesday. Hilton's stock also rose, gaining 1.6% to close at $28.48.
The battle for ITT's hotel business is expected to be a closely watched takeover saga in the coming weeks and months, with investors and industry insiders eagerly anticipating how the situation will play out.
