Patterson Dental Co Expects Strong Fiscal Third-Quarter Earnings, Beating Analyst Estimates
Patterson Dental Co, a leading distributor of dental supplies, equipment, and software in the United States, is expecting a strong fiscal third-quarter earnings report, beating analyst estimates. The company has recently provided an update on its financial performance for the three months ended January 25, 2020, citing solid growth in its dental and animal health segments.
According to the preliminary figures, Patterson Dental expects to report net sales of approximately $1.4 billion for the third quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of about 2.1%. The company attributes its sales growth to a favorable product mix and higher average selling prices, offset in part by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fewer selling days due to the timing of the Christmas and New Year holidays.
Patterson Dental also anticipates adjusted earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.42 to $0.44 for the quarter, up from $0.38 in the same period last year. This guidance includes a gain of approximately $0.03 per share related to the sale of certain software assets, as well as a charge of about $0.02 per share associated with restructuring costs and other expenses. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had projected third-quarter EPS of $0.41, on average.
"We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter, which demonstrates the continued strength of our business and our ability to execute on our strategic priorities," said Mark Walchirk, President and CEO of Patterson Companies, Inc., the parent company of Patterson Dental. "We remain focused on driving growth and innovation across our portfolio of solutions while also improving our productivity and efficiency."
Patterson Dental's dental segment, which supplies dental practitioners with consumable products and equipment, is expected to generate sales of about $770 million in the third quarter, up 2.9% from the prior-year period. The company cited growth in its private-label and branded consumables products, as well as robust demand for its digital technology solutions and equipment. However, these gains were partly offset by softer sales of certain equipment categories and a decline in merchandise sales to DSO customers.
Meanwhile, the company's animal health segment, which distributes veterinary products and services, is projected to report sales of approximately $645 million, an increase of 1.3% from the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Patterson cited strong growth in its production animal business, driven by increased demand for livestock vaccines and pharmaceuticals. However, sales to companion animal customers were slightly lower than expected due to a timing issue.
Patterson Dental reiterated its full-year guidance for fiscal 2020, which calls for net sales growth of 1% to 2%, adjusted EPS of $1.40 to $1.50, and operating margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points. The company noted that it expects to incur restructuring expenses of approximately $8 million to $10 million in the fourth quarter, related to its ongoing efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs.
Investors praised the news of Patterson Dental's expected earnings beat, sending shares up more than 5% in after-hours trading. The stock is currently trading at around $25 per share, down from a 52-week high of $29.37 in June 2019.
Patterson Dental, which has been in business for more than 140 years, serves more than 100,000 dental and animal health customers across North America and the United Kingdom. The company has continued to expand its offerings in recent years, with a focus on digital solutions, e-commerce, and strategic acquisitions.
