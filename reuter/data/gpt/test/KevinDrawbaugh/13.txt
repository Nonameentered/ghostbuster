Humana Reports Lower Quarterly Profits, but Stock Rises on Optimism over New President's Turnaround Plan
Health insurer Humana reported lower than expected quarterly profits on Wednesday, but its stock rose on optimism stemming from its new president's turnaround plan.
Humana, which is one of the largest health insurers in the United States, said that its net profit for the three months to the end of December had slipped by around 10 percent to $512m. This was despite revenues for the quarter climbing by 7.2 percent to $14.5bn, helped by an increase in premiums and an uptick in membership.
The company said that its bottom line had been affected by higher costs related to its healthcare services and a rise in administrative expenses due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, its medical loss ratio, which looks at the amount of money spent on medical claims versus premiums, edged up to 82.7 percent from 81.8 percent.
However, despite the dip in profits, Humana's shares rallied as investors cheered the new strategic plan unveiled by its recently appointed president, Chris Hunter. The company said that it is targeting a revenue growth rate of between 9 percent and 12 percent over the next three years, as well as aiming to boost its operating cash flow to $5bn.
Hunter, who took over as Humana's president in January, said that the company's new plan focuses on three key pillars: expanding its portfolio of healthcare services, investing in technology and analytics, and improving its customer experience.
"We're excited to embark on this journey of growth and expansion, and we believe we're well positioned to capture the opportunities ahead," Hunter said in a conference call with investors.
Humana said that it is ramping up its efforts to provide more integrated healthcare services to its customers, including by expanding its primary care offering and launching a new platform to help patients manage their chronic conditions.
The company is also investing heavily in data and analytics capabilities, which it believes will help it to better understand patient needs and improve the efficiency of its operations.
Finally, Humana said that it is working to improve its customer experience, including by enhancing the online portal that its members use to manage their healthcare benefits.
Investors were largely bullish on Humana's new plan, with many believing that it could help to drive growth over the coming years.
"While the lower-than-expected earnings may be disappointing, the longer-term outlook for Humana looks positive thanks to its new strategic plan," said Jim Smith, a healthcare analyst with investment firm JP Morgan.
Humana's shares closed up by around 3.5 percent on Wednesday following the earnings announcement.
Despite the optimism, however, Humana will face some challenges in the coming years, particularly as the Biden administration looks to expand access to healthcare and lower costs.
The company will also need to navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has created strategic challenges for many healthcare providers.
Nevertheless, Hunter struck a confident tone in his comments to investors, stating that Humana was "well positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing healthcare environment".
"We believe we have a unique opportunity to drive meaningful change and create value for our members and shareholders," he said.
