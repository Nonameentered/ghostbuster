Home goods retailer Pier 1 Imports is aiming for high earnings growth in 2021 through a combination of expansion and new offerings. The company is looking to build on the success it experienced in 2020, despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Pier 1 Imports has already started the process of expanding its physical presence, with plans to open several new stores across the United States. The company is also ramping up its online offerings, with a focus on making it easier and more convenient for customers to shop from home.
“We’re really excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Pier 1 Imports,” said CEO Sarah Rasmusen. “Despite the challenges we faced last year, we were able to build momentum and grow our customer base. Now, we’re looking to build on that momentum and take our business to the next level.”
In addition to its physical and digital expansion efforts, Pier 1 Imports is also introducing new product lines and offerings to its existing customers. The company recently launched a line of sustainable and ethically-sourced home goods, which has already proven popular with environmentally-conscious shoppers.
“We’re always looking for ways to innovate and offer our customers something new,” said Rasmusen. “Our new sustainable home goods line is just one example of how we’re working to stay ahead of the curve and meet our customers’ evolving needs.”
Pier 1 Imports’ earnings growth comes as the retail sector as a whole continues to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite initial concerns that the pandemic would lead to a long-term shift in consumer behavior away from physical stores and towards online retailers, many retailers have reported strong sales growth in the months since the height of the pandemic.
For Pier 1 Imports, the focus on both physical and digital expansion, as well as new product offerings, is part of a broader strategy to capitalize on this rebound and win over customers in an increasingly competitive market.
“We know that there are a lot of options out there for customers,” said Rasmusen. “That’s why we’re working hard to offer something unique and compelling, both in our stores and online. We believe that with the right mix of products, convenience, and innovation, we can continue to grow and succeed in the years to come.”
