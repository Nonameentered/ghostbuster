St. Jude Medical Inc.'s $505 million acquisition of Ventritex is set to proceed despite recent concerns over patient deaths, according to the company's Chief Financial Officer. In an interview with Forbes, John Heinmiller stated that the acquisition would go ahead, but that St. Jude would be "vigilant" in monitoring the performance of Ventritex's products.
The concerns over the safety of Ventritex's defibrillators were first raised in a report by the New York Times, which highlighted 20 deaths that were linked to the devices. The report also suggested that St. Jude had been aware of the issue for some time, but had failed to take action to address it.
In response to the report, St. Jude issued a statement denying the allegations and stating that it was committed to patient safety. However, the company's stock price took a hit, as investors began to worry about the impact that the controversy would have on the acquisition of Ventritex.
Despite the negative publicity, Heinmiller remained optimistic about the deal, stating that St. Jude was confident in the quality of Ventritex's products. He acknowledged that there had been some issues with the devices, but emphasized that they were rare and that St. Jude was working to address them.
"We take any concerns about patient safety very seriously," Heinmiller said. "But we believe that the benefits of this acquisition outweigh the risks."
The acquisition of Ventritex is part of St. Jude's broader strategy to expand its offerings in the field of cardiac care. Ventritex specializes in the development and manufacture of implantable defibrillators and other devices for the treatment of heart disease.
Despite the controversy surrounding the deal, some analysts have praised St. Jude's decision to proceed with the acquisition. They argue that the expansion into new markets is essential for the company's long-term growth and that the risks associated with the acquisition are manageable.
"St. Jude has a strong track record of innovation and patient care," said Paul Johnson, an analyst at Credit Suisse. "While there are certainly risks associated with this acquisition, we believe that the potential benefits are significant enough to justify the investment."
The controversy surrounding Ventritex's defibrillators is likely to continue, as investigators work to determine the cause of the patient deaths. However, for the moment at least, it appears that St. Jude is determined to press ahead with the acquisition, despite the risks involved.
