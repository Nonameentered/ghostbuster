WMX Technologies, a waste management and environmental services company, has announced it will be selling its stake in ServiceMaster L.P., a home and commercial services provider, for $626 million. The decision comes after months of pressure from WMX shareholders calling for the company to divest from the struggling ServiceMaster.
ServiceMaster has been a weak spot in WMX's portfolio for several years, with the service provider suffering from declining revenue and profits. In 2019, ServiceMaster reported a net loss of $197 million and has struggled to turn things around since.
WMX initially acquired a stake in ServiceMaster in 1994, but it has since become a liability for the company, and investors have been calling for a divestment. WMX will be selling the stake to the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, who plans to merge ServiceMaster with another home services provider, Frontdoor.
The sale will generate $626 million in cash for WMX, which the company has earmarked for debt repayment and capital expenditures. WMX CEO, David Steiner, stated that the sale will allow the company to focus on its core business and invest in growth opportunities.
However, not all shareholders are pleased with the announcement. Some are calling for more resignations on the WMX management team, arguing that the decision to invest in ServiceMaster was a costly mistake that resulted in substantial losses for the company.
Activist investor, Carl Icahn, who holds a stake in WMX, has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the company's management. In June, Icahn called for Steiner's resignation, citing his poor track record and lack of accountability for past mistakes.
Icahn has also been pushing for WMX to spin off its subsidiary, Wheelabrator Technologies, a company that operates energy-from-waste facilities. According to Icahn, Wheelabrator's assets could be worth up to $5 billion, and a spinoff could unlock significant value for WMX shareholders.
In response to the criticism, WMX has appointed two new directors to its board, including William McNabb, former CEO of Vanguard Group, and Cynthia Niekamp, former executive of Duke Energy. The appointments were made in an effort to address shareholder concerns and improve the corporate governance of the company.
Despite the new appointments, some investors are still calling for more changes. James Mitarotonda, CEO of Barington Capital, a WMX shareholder, issued a statement saying that the company needs to focus on "improving its operating performance, enhancing its capital allocation, and divesting non-core assets."
Mitarotonda also suggested that WMX needs to be more proactive in addressing shareholder concerns and engaging with its investor base. "It is time for the Board and management to work constructively with shareholders to unlock the full value of the company," he said.
The sale of the ServiceMaster stake is expected to close by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. Clayton, Dubilier & Rice plans to merge the company with Frontdoor, a move that is expected to create a leading provider of home services with $2.5 billion in annual revenue.
For WMX, the sale represents a significant step in its efforts to streamline its operations and improve its financial performance. However, the company will need to address the concerns of its shareholders and take steps to improve its corporate governance if it wants to win their support in the long term.
