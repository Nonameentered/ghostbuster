Triarc Companies, Inc. announced yesterday that it has acquired the Snapple brand from Quaker Oats Company for $300 million in a deal that marks the latest attempt to revive the struggling beverage brand.
According to Triarc, the acquisition includes the Snapple brand, as well as Mistic and Royal Crown Cola, which were also owned by Quaker Oats. Triarc, of course, is best known for its ownership of Arby's, the fast food chain.
"Snapple is a beloved brand with a great heritage, but it has not achieved its full potential in recent years," said Nelson Peltz, Triarc's CEO. "We believe that we can inject fresh energy and innovation into Snapple, and restore it to its rightful place as one of the most exciting and engaging brands in the beverage market."
Snapple was originally launched in 1972, and quickly gained a cult following for its quirky flavors and colorful packaging. The brand was acquired by Quaker Oats in 1994, in a deal worth $1.7 billion, and grew rapidly under the company's ownership. However, in the early 2000s, Snapple began to lose ground to other beverage brands, and Quaker Oats struggled to turn the brand around.
In 2001, Quaker Oats sold Snapple to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion, but the brand continued to struggle under the new ownership. In 2018, the brand's sales were estimated to be around $700 million, down from a high of $1.2 billion in the late 90s.
Triarc's acquisition of Snapple comes at a time when the beverage market is highly competitive, and consumers are increasingly focused on healthy and natural products. Snapple, with its sugary and artificial ingredients, has struggled to keep up with shifting consumer tastes.
However, Peltz says that Triarc is committed to revitalizing the brand, and has a plan to make Snapple more relevant to modern consumers.
"Our goal is to make Snapple the most innovative and exciting brand in the beverage market," he said. "We plan to invest in new flavors and formats, and to focus on healthier and more natural ingredients."
Triarc also plans to leverage its expertise in the fast food industry to help boost sales of Snapple. The company says that it will work closely with Arby's to develop new menu items featuring Snapple products, and to cross-promote the two brands.
"We see a tremendous opportunity to leverage the strengths of Triarc and Snapple, and to create a powerful partnership that can drive sales and growth for both brands," said Peltz.
The acquisition of Snapple is the latest move by Triarc to expand its portfolio of brands beyond fast food. Earlier this year, the company acquired the LaCroix sparkling water brand, which has been growing rapidly in popularity among health-conscious consumers.
"With the addition of Snapple and LaCroix, Triarc is now positioned as a major player in the beverage market, with a portfolio of brands that appeal to a wide range of consumers," said Peltz. "We are excited about the opportunities ahead, and look forward to bringing new energy and excitement to the beverage industry."
