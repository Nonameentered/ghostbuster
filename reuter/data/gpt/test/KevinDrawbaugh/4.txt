St. Jude Medical Inc, the medical device manufacturer, has decided to delay its acquisition of Ventritex Inc after the death of a third patient during a clinical trial.
The company had announced its plans to acquire Ventritex last year for a price of $800 million, with the deal expected to be completed by the end of this year.
However, the latest death of a patient, who was using Ventritex's implantable defibrillator, has raised concerns about the safety of the device. The first two patient deaths occurred in April and May, and St. Jude Medical said it would work with Ventritex to investigate the cause of the deaths.
The implantable defibrillator is designed to deliver electric shocks to the heart to prevent sudden cardiac arrest. While this type of device has been widely used for many years, there have been concerns about the safety of some models, particularly those that rely on wireless technology.
The cause of the patient deaths is currently unknown, and investigators are examining the medical records of the patients and the data captured by the implantable defibrillators.
St. Jude Medical said it was delaying the acquisition of Ventritex until the investigation was completed and it was satisfied with the safety of the device. In a statement, the company said it was committed to patient safety and would not proceed with the acquisition until it was satisfied that the technology was safe.
The delay is a setback for both St. Jude Medical and Ventritex. St. Jude Medical had hoped to expand its portfolio of medical devices, while Ventritex had been looking forward to the financial boost that would come from the acquisition.
The news has also raised concerns among investors, who have seen the value of St. Jude Medical's stock drop by more than 5% since the announcement. However, some analysts have suggested that the delay may be a good thing in the long run, as it shows that St. Jude Medical is committed to ensuring the safety of its products.
The medical device industry is highly regulated, and companies are required to conduct extensive clinical trials before their products are approved for use. However, even after a device is approved, there is a risk that it may cause harm to patients.
St. Jude Medical has a strong record of safety when it comes to its medical devices, and the delay in the acquisition of Ventritex may indicate that the company is taking a cautious approach to ensure that its record remains intact.
