As the U.S. nursing home industry continues to struggle with financial challenges and staffing shortages, experts are predicting an increase in merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the coming years.
According to a recent report from Moody's Investors Service, the nursing home industry is facing significant financial pressures, including low Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, rising labor costs, and declining occupancy rates. These challenges are likely to lead to increased consolidation as providers seek to gain scale, reduce costs, and diversify their revenue streams.
"Consolidation will likely increase as the nursing home sector experiences significant financial stress and heightened regulatory scrutiny," the report stated. "Well-capitalized players that can weather these challenges will likely seek to consolidate their positions."
Experts say that the nursing home sector is ripe for M&A activity because of the number of small and mid-sized providers operating in the space. Many of these providers are struggling to stay afloat, and consolidation could be a lifeline for some.
"There are a lot of small operators in the nursing home industry that are struggling to make ends meet," said Matt Fishman, a managing partner at LHP Capital, a developer of senior living communities. "They're struggling to keep up with all the regulations and the staffing issues, and so consolidation is a natural next step."
Consolidation can also benefit residents and staff by increasing resources and improving care quality. "Larger providers can achieve economies of scale and invest in technology and talent management practices that smaller providers cannot," the Moody's report noted. "These investments could lead to improved resident outcomes and staff satisfaction."
However, experts caution that consolidation can also lead to reduced competition, which could have negative implications for consumers. "Consolidation could result in reduced competition, a lack of choice, and less innovation," the report stated. "Regulators will need to balance the benefits of consolidation against these risks."
Several high-profile M&A deals have already taken place in the nursing home sector in recent years. In 2018, Welltower Inc., a healthcare real estate investment trust, acquired Quality Care Properties Inc. for $1.95 billion. The deal added 257 nursing homes to Welltower's portfolio and made it the largest nursing home landlord in the U.S.
Last year, private equity firm KKR & Co. acquired nursing home operator Envision Healthcare Corp. for $9.9 billion. The deal was one of the largest-ever private equity deals in the healthcare sector and signaled growing investor interest in the nursing home industry.
Experts expect that M&A activity will increase in the coming years as the nursing home industry continues to face financial pressures. However, they caution that the regulatory environment will play a critical role in shaping the landscape.
"Regulatory scrutiny will likely intensify in the nursing home industry, particularly around staffing levels and quality of care," the Moody's report noted. "This could create obstacles to consolidation if regulators are concerned about reduced competition and quality of care."
Despite these challenges, some providers are optimistic about the potential benefits of consolidation. "By consolidating, we can leverage our resources and expertise to provide better outcomes for residents and staff members," said Scott Kirschner, CEO of SavaSeniorCare, a provider of skilled nursing and rehabilitation services. "It's a win-win situation for everybody."
Overall, the nursing home industry is facing significant headwinds as it tries to navigate an increasingly complex and competitive landscape. While consolidation may offer a path forward for some providers, it will be important for regulators to monitor the implications for consumers and ensure that quality of care remains a top priority.
