The nursing home and sub-acute medical care services industry is undergoing a major consolidation, with two major mergers announced. The first merger involves the acquisition of Sun Healthcare Group by Genesis Healthcare Corporation, while the second merger involves the purchase of Curis Healthcare by HealthSouth Corporation.
The acquisition of Sun Healthcare Group by Genesis Healthcare Corporation is valued at approximately $275 million and will create one of the largest providers of post-acute care in the United States. Sun Healthcare Group operates over 200 nursing homes and assisted living facilities in 29 states. Genesis Healthcare already operates over 400 skilled nursing centers and assisted living facilities in 29 states, and the acquisition of Sun Healthcare group is expected to increase the company's revenue by 25%.
The purchase of Curis Healthcare by HealthSouth Corporation is valued at approximately $750 million and will combine two of the largest providers of sub-acute medical care services in the United States. Curis Healthcare operates over 20 sub-acute inpatient rehabilitation facilities, while HealthSouth Corporation operates over 100 inpatient rehabilitation facilities across the country. The merger is expected to increase the company's revenue by 35%.
These mergers are reflective of a growing trend in the healthcare industry, where larger healthcare providers are acquiring smaller nursing home and sub-acute medical care services providers to consolidate operations and reduce costs. These mergers are also expected to result in higher quality care for patients and increased access to specialized services.
However, some industry experts have expressed concern over the impact of consolidation on patients and their families. According to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office, consolidation can result in reduced access to care, increased prices, and decreased quality of care.
Despite these concerns, the trend towards consolidation is expected to continue in the nursing home and sub-acute medical care services industry. With an aging population and increasing demand for healthcare services, larger providers are better situated to meet the needs of patients and provide higher quality care.
Overall, the consolidation of the nursing home and sub-acute medical care services industry through these two major mergers reflects a growing trend in the healthcare industry towards consolidation. While the benefits of consolidation are numerous, the potential impact on patients and their families must also be taken into consideration.
