The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is investigating another death linked to Ventritex implantable defibrillators. This marks the third death connected to the medical device. The defibrillators are used to monitor and regulate the heart rate of patients who are at risk of sudden cardiac arrest.
The FDA's investigation began after they received numerous reports of device malfunctions. In some cases, the defibrillator failed to deliver the necessary shocks to the patient's heart. In other cases, the device malfunctioned and delivered too many shocks, causing damage to the heart muscle. These malfunctions have led to several deaths, including the latest case.
The latest death occurred in California. A patient had the Ventritex implantable defibrillator inserted in early 2021. A few months later, the patient experienced cardiac arrest, and the defibrillator failed to deliver a shock. The patient died shortly after. The FDA has not released any further information, including the patient's age or gender.
The previous two deaths linked to the Ventritex implantable defibrillator occurred in 2020. One patient died after the device malfunctioned and delivered too many shocks to the heart. The other patient's device failed to deliver a shock, leading to their death.
Ventritex is a subsidiary of Boston Scientific, a leading manufacturer of medical devices. The company has issued a statement expressing sympathy for the families affected by the deaths and is cooperating with the FDA's investigation. Boston Scientific has also acknowledged that it has had issues with the Ventritex implantable defibrillators.
The FDA has advised doctors to closely monitor patients with the Ventritex implantable defibrillator and to be aware of the potential malfunctions. Additionally, the FDA is urging patients with the device to contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms such as a rapid or irregular heartbeat, dizziness, or fainting.
The FDA's investigation into the Ventritex implantable defibrillator is ongoing. The agency has not yet determined the cause of the device malfunctions. However, the investigation is likely to focus on the design and manufacturing of the device.
The news of the third death linked to the Ventritex implantable defibrillator has raised concerns among patients and doctors. The device is widely used in the US and is implanted in thousands of patients each year. Patients who have the device implanted are advised to contact their healthcare provider to discuss any concerns they may have. Doctors are also advised to closely monitor patients with the implantable defibrillator and report any malfunctions to the FDA.
