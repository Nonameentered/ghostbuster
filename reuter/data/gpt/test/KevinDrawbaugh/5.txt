Baxter International Inc Comfortable with 1997 Earnings Forecast of $2.36 Per Share
Deerfield, IL - Baxter International Inc, a leading American healthcare company, announced yesterday its Q3 1997 earnings report and reiterated its full-year earnings forecast of $2.36 per share, on an adjusted basis. The company's earnings exceeded analysts' expectations, attributed to strong sales in its biopharmaceutical division and cost controls initiated by the management.
Baxter reported a net income of $232 million or $1.15 per share, on a diluted basis, for the quarter ended September 30, 1997. This compares to $191 million or $0.93 per share, reported in the same quarter last year. Adjusting for the impact of divestitures, restructuring, and special charges, Baxter's earnings per share were $1.21, in line with analysts' estimates.
The company's biopharmaceutical division, which specializes in developing and manufacturing recombinant proteins used in treating hemophilia and other bleeding disorders, performed exceptionally well, driven by strong sales of Advate, Feiba, and Recombinate. Baxter's biopharmaceuticals sales were up 33% to $256 million in Q3 1997, compared to $192 million in Q3 1996, and accounted for about 19% of Baxter's total sales.
"The sustained growth in our biopharmaceuticals business reflects our strong product portfolio and continued expansion into new markets," said Vernon R. Loucks Jr., chairman and CEO of Baxter International Inc. "We are committed to building on our biopharmaceuticals leadership position and maximizing its potential, as evidenced by our recent acquisition of Immuno International AG and its recombinant Factor VIII manufacturing technology."
Baxter's medical products division, which produces a broad range of medical devices used in hospitals and healthcare facilities worldwide, reported sales of $1.1 billion in Q3 1997, up 7% from $1.03 billion in Q3 1996. The division's sales growth was driven by increased demand for products such as Autoseal and Curos disinfectant caps, as well as successful product launches in the renal and cardiovascular space.
Looking ahead, Baxter management remains confident in the company's ability to meet its full-year earnings forecast, despite ongoing challenges in the healthcare industry, such as increased competition, pricing pressures, and regulatory uncertainties.
"We are pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter and remain comfortable with our full-year earnings guidance," said Robert L. Parkinson Jr., president and chief operating officer of Baxter International Inc. "We are focused on executing our strategic initiatives, including driving growth in our core businesses and expanding in key therapeutic areas, while maintaining tight control over costs and achieving operational efficiencies."
Baxter's management expects the company's earnings growth to be primarily driven by the biopharmaceuticals division, which is expected to continue growing at a double-digit rate, fueled by demand for its hemophilia products and expansion into new markets, such as China and Latin America.
In addition, Baxter is pursuing several strategic initiatives to diversify its product portfolio, including the recent acquisition of Immuno International AG and its recombinant Factor VIII manufacturing technology, as well as the partnership with Novartis AG to develop and commercialize biosimilars for oncology and immunology indications.
Despite the challenges facing the healthcare industry, Baxter's strong financial position, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.35 and a current ratio of 2.0, provides the company with the flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and weather any external shocks.
"We are well-positioned to navigate the current healthcare landscape and capitalize on the long-term growth potential of our core businesses," said Loucks. "We are committed to delivering value to our shareholders, while fulfilling our mission of saving and sustaining lives."
