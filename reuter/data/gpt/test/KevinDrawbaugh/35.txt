Option Care Inc, a leading provider of home and alternate site infusion services, has set its sights on achieving significant revenue growth in the coming years. The company is confident that it can deliver on its ambitious targets, and its CEO has stated that he is comfortable with Wall Street's estimates for the coming year.
Option Care plans to expand its range of services, invest in new technology, and improve its operational efficiency to achieve its revenue growth goals. The company has identified several potential growth drivers, including increased demand for home health services, an aging population, and continued advancements in medical treatments that require infusion therapies.
"We see tremendous opportunities in our core business and are investing in new areas that will enable us to serve more patients and generate additional revenue," said John Rademacher, CEO of Option Care. "We are confident that our focused approach will lead to sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders."
Option Care generated $2.7 billion in revenue in 2020, a 10% increase over the previous year. The company's growth was largely driven by increased demand for home infusion therapies amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Option Care operates more than 100 infusion centers across the United States and serves approximately 200,000 patients each year.
"We have a resilient business model that has proven to be successful, even during challenging times," said Rademacher. "We expect to continue to see strong demand for our services, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead."
The company's plans for growth include expanding its footprint in existing markets and entering new geographic regions. Option Care is also investing in technology to improve its patient experience and increase operational efficiency. The company recently launched a new mobile app that allows patients to manage their care remotely and receive real-time updates on their progress.
"We are committed to providing the best possible care to our patients, and we believe that technology can play a critical role in achieving that goal," said Rademacher. "By investing in new tools and platforms, we can improve the patient experience and streamline our operations, which will ultimately lead to better outcomes for everyone."
Option Care's investors appear to be optimistic about the company's growth prospects. The company's stock has risen more than 60% over the past year, and its market capitalization has surpassed $3 billion.
"We have a clear strategy for growth, and we are executing on that strategy," said Rademacher. "We believe that our continued focus on innovation, operational excellence, and patient-centered care will drive meaningful growth and value for our shareholders in the years ahead."
