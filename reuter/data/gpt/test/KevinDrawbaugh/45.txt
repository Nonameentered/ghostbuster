Triarc Plans to Apply Successful Marketing Principles to Turn Around Snapple Sales
Triarc Companies, Inc., the parent company of Snapple, has announced its plans to revitalise the brand by introducing successful marketing principles. The company believes that this will reverse the downward trend in Snapple's sales in recent years. According to Triarc, the new strategy will focus on the product's unique characteristics and the brand's history.
Snapple's sales slowed in the early 2000s, and the company struggled to enter new markets. Currently, it holds a 4% market share in the US of ready-to-drink teas and fruit drinks. The brand has struggled against competitors like Coca-Cola's Honest Tea and PepsiCo's Pure Leaf.
Triarc's new marketing plan aims to rejuvenate Snapple's brand image and product positioning. The company will incorporate successful marketing principles that have been used to build strong brands in recent years. These techniques include emphasising the brand identity, investing in experiential marketing, and focusing on millennial tastes.
Central to the plan is Snapple's unique product offerings. Triarc seeks to highlight Snapple's inventive and quirky flavours, which are still relatively unknown to consumers. The company will also place greater emphasis on Snapple's 40-year history as a small-batch brewer, using this point of differentiation as a selling point. Triarc aims for Snapple to be the quirky drink for consumers looking for something unique.
To help achieve this objective, Triarc plans to introduce experiential marketing strategies. These tactics will focus on building brand awareness for Snapple through in-person events, social media campaigns, and digital advertising. The company's new marketing campaigns will bring Snapple products directly to consumers in a fun and engaging way. They will use online influencers, such as chefs, to promote Snapple products and create buzz on social media platforms.
Triarc's overarching strategy is to appeal to the millennial demographic, which has a distinctive taste for products with unique flavours and brand personalities that align with their values. By targeting this demographic, Triarc believes it can create a strong following for Snapple among young people, who will help to spread the brand's popularity to other age groups.
Triarc's new marketing plan also includes new product development. The company plans to introduce new flavours of Snapple that cater to the younger demographic's tastes. Such drinks will have unique flavours such as mango, lavender, and elderflower. These flavours are popular among the millennial demographic and should appeal to Snapple's target market.
In summary, Triarc hopes to revitalise the Snapple brand and turn around declining sales by applying successful marketing principles. The company aims to emphasise Snapple's unique flavours and quirky history. It will target the millennial demographic, invest in experiential marketing, and develop new products to appeal to this market. If successful, these efforts will likely boost Snapple's stagnant market share in the US ready-to-drink tea and fruit drinks category.
