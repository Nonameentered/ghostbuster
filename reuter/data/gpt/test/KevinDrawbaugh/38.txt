A new study has found that Retavase, a thrombolytic medication, does not outperform Genentech's TPA (tissue plasminogen activator) when it comes to treating acute heart attacks.
Retavase, manufactured by Daiichi Sankyo, had been touted as a potential alternative to TPA, which has been the standard treatment for heart attack patients for over three decades. However, the new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Retavase was not superior to TPA in terms of improving outcomes for patients.
The study, which analyzed data from 209 hospitals across 10 countries, involved over 1,700 patients who were randomly assigned to receive either Retavase or TPA. The researchers found that there was no statistically significant difference in the rates of death, recurrent heart attacks, or stroke between the two groups.
The study's lead author, Dr. Gregg Stone, a professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, said that although Retavase was not proven to be better than TPA, it could still be a useful alternative in certain situations. "Retavase may still have a role in settings where TPA is unavailable or contraindicated," he said.
The findings are a setback for Daiichi Sankyo, which has been trying to gain market share for Retavase in the United States. TPA, which is sold under the brand name Activase by Genentech, is the top-selling drug in its class and brings in over $500 million in annual sales.
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or heart attack, is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment. Thrombolytic medications like TPA and Retavase are used to dissolve blood clots and restore blood flow to the heart.
The study's authors say that more research is needed to determine the optimal use of thrombolytic medications in different patient populations. In the meantime, TPA remains the standard treatment for AMI.
