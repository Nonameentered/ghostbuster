Quaker Oats announced on Thursday that they have sold Snapple, their once high-flying beverage brand, for $300 million to Triarc Companies, owners of Mistic and Stewart's. The surprise move, dubbed a "fire sale" by some industry analysts, marked the conclusion of Quaker Oats' difficult and frustrating experience with the tea and juice brand, which they bought in 1994 for $1.7 billion.
Snapple, which first gained fame with its quirky "Real Fact" caps and offbeat marketing campaign, struggled to maintain its position as a leading contender in the increasingly crowded fruit juice and tea market. Quaker hoped that the brand would be a perfect complement to their popular breakfast items such as oatmeal or cereal, but the integration proved a difficult task.
Quaker Oats announced the sale in a statement, saying that the deal would include all elements of the Snapple business, including the brand name, inventory, and facilities. Triarc will also assume Snapple's debts, which total roughly $25 million. The deal is expected to close no later than the end of the year.
Industry insiders believe that Quaker Oats' decision to sell Snapple was long overdue. The brand had lost significant ground to other players in the beverage space, like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, despite significant marketing and advertising investments.
"It was clear that Snapple was no longer fitting in with Quaker Oats' core business," said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. "For a while, they tried to make it work, but when they couldn't, they decided to cut their losses and move on."
But the sale to Triarc may not be the end of the story for Snapple. Triarc is a savvy player in the beverage industry and has a track record of successfully revitalizing struggling brands. The company already owns Mistic and Stewart's, two beverage brands that have maintained steady growth over the past few years, and has the resources and expertise to turn Snapple around.
Craig Owens, CEO of Triarc, expressed enthusiasm about the acquisition in a statement. "We are confident that we can unlock the full potential of Snapple by leveraging our expertise in marketing and distribution," he said. "We are excited to welcome Snapple to the Triarc family and look forward to working with the talented and dedicated employees who have made it a beloved brand."
Owens' view was echoed by industry observers. "Triarc knows this market well and has a good track record of managing brands in it," said Sicher. "They have the resources to invest in Snapple and bring it back to life."
The acquisition of Snapple is not the first time that Triarc has swooped in to pick up a struggling beverage brand. In 1997, they purchased Mistic, which had experienced a similar decline in sales and public interest. Triarc revamped the brand and focused on a younger demographic, using social media and influencer marketing to build buzz. The strategy paid off, and Mistic's sales and visibility soared in the following years. Triarc is hoping to repeat that success with Snapple.
Triarc's purchase of Snapple also sets up a potential showdown with other beverage industry giants, like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. These companies have dominated the fruit juice and tea market for decades, and are likely to view Triarc's acquisition of Snapple as a challenge. But Triarc is not intimidated.
"We are confident in our ability to compete in this space," Owens said. "We believe that Snapple is an excellent addition to our portfolio and will help us continue to grow and innovate."
Whether Triarc can deliver on its promise to revive Snapple remains to be seen. But for Quaker Oats, the sale marks the end of a frustrating chapter in their history. The company can now focus on its core business, including its lucrative oatmeal and cereal brands, without having to worry about the struggles of Snapple.
"Quaker Oats made the right decision to sell Snapple," said Sicher. "It was clear that the brand was not a good fit for them. Now they can focus on what they do best, which is making breakfast food."
