In recent years, the North American waste and recycling industry has witnessed a major restructuring and consolidation. This has led to increased competition among the major players, and several small and mid-sized companies are being acquired by larger firms. As a result, many garbage companies are continuing the asset pick over, as they try to expand their footprint and gain a competitive edge in the market.
The consolidation in the waste management industry began to take shape in the early 2010s with several large companies acquiring smaller players. The trend has continued to gather momentum over the years, with companies deploying extensive resources to buy out and merge with their competitors.
Currently, several major players dominate the waste management sector in North America, including Waste Management, Republic Services, and Waste Connections. These firms, along with a few others, control more than two-thirds of the market, leaving a handful of smaller companies to compete for the remaining share.
The reason behind this consolidation is clear: it allows the larger firms to spread their offerings and capabilities over a broader range of territories. The larger companies can extend networks and achieve economies of scale, which results in more efficient operation and a larger customer base. Additionally, some experts believe that consolidation might help the industry to invest more effectively in technology and infrastructure.
However, as larger firms continue to acquire smaller ones, the result is a higher concentration of market power, which could create challenges for small-scale waste management firms. Critics and industry experts have raised concerns over how it may affect pricing and innovation in the sector over the long term. Some worry that it could lead to less competition, increase prices for the customers, and inhibit innovation and development.
To secure a better foothold in the market, several large garbage companies have embarked on an asset-pick over in recent years. Asset pick over is a strategy where a large company targets particular assets or operations in a smaller firm that complements or expands upon its own services.
Waste Management, for example, has been pursuing the strategy for some time and has notably focused on businesses with strong recycling capabilities. The firm has acquired several smaller recycling companies across the United States in recent years to bolster its recycling business.
Republic Services, another major player in the waste management industry, has also been active in pursuing an asset pick over strategy. However, the company has concentrated on buying up independent haulers to extend and strengthen its services to commercial and industrial clients.
This asset pick over and consolidation has expanded way beyond landfill management and waste collection services, with a predictable increase in mergers and acquisitions of providers in the energy and sustainability services sector.
Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the waste management industry in significant ways. While there are long-term impacts of the pandemic on the industry that remain unknown, one immediate impact it has had is that millions of Americans are producing more trash than ever in history. With so many people spending more time at home, there has been a surge in household waste as they generate more waste because of home deliveries and takeout containers.
The ongoing restructuring and consolidation in the waste management industry is undoubtedly creating a new competitive landscape. However, the question is whether it will ultimately lead to better service delivery and lower costs for the customers or have the opposite effect by reducing competition in the market. Despite this uncertainty, it is clear that garbage companies will continue to pursue an asset pick over their smaller peers as they try to consolidate and expand their customer base.
