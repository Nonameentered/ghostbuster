Biogen Inc, a biotech company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, has announced the launch of its Avonex multiple sclerosis (MS) drug in Europe within the next 30 days. The company expects the sales of Avonex in Europe to match those of the United States, where the drug has been marketed since 1996. 
Avonex is a type of interferon beta-1a that is used to treat MS, a disease in which the immune system attacks and damages the protective covering of nerve cells, leading to a range of symptoms including muscle weakness, vision problems, and difficulty with coordination and balance. The drug is administered by injection and is designed to reduce the frequency and severity of MS relapses.
According to Biogen's Chief Operating Officer (COO) James Tobin, the launch of Avonex in Europe is an important step for the company as it seeks to expand its presence in the global MS market. Tobin stated that "We believe there's a large unmet need for MS treatment in Europe, and we're pleased to be able to offer Avonex as a proven and trusted therapy." 
The European launch of Avonex comes amid increasing competition in the MS market, with a number of new therapies being developed by rival companies. However, Tobin expressed confidence that Avonex would remain a key player in the market, stating that "We're confident that Avonex will continue to be an important option for people with MS, and that its proven efficacy, safety, and convenience will help it to remain a leading treatment." 
Biogen also announced that it had received regulatory approval for a new MS drug, Vumerity, in Europe. Vumerity, a type of dimethyl fumarate, is designed to reduce both the frequency and severity of MS relapses and is expected to be available in Europe before the end of the year. 
The launch of Avonex and the approval of Vumerity in Europe provide a boost for Biogen as it seeks to maintain its position in the global MS market. With an estimated 2.3 million people worldwide living with MS, the market for MS treatments is a significant and growing one, and Biogen will be hoping that its latest products will help it to remain a key player in this important field.
