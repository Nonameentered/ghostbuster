Thomson-CSF, the French electronics and defense company, has returned to profitability after years of losses, aided in part by a government privatization plan.
The company, which changed its name to Thales in 2000, announced on Wednesday that it expects to post a profit of 700 million euros ($824 million) this year, up from a loss of 112 million euros in 2020. This marks a significant turnaround for the company after years of struggling with stagnant growth and financial difficulties.
Thales, which specializes in aerospace, defense, and security technologies, has undergone a major transformation in recent years, shedding underperforming businesses and shifting its focus to higher-growth areas like cybersecurity and autonomous systems. The company has also focused on expanding its presence in key markets, including the United States and China.
The government's privatization plan has also played a role in Thales' resurgence. In 2019, the French government announced that it would sell a 35% stake in the company, with the proceeds to be used to fund investments in innovation and technological development. The sale is expected to be completed later this year.
Thales CEO Patrice Caine credited the company's success to its focus on innovation and digital transformation. "We have continued to invest in cutting-edge technologies and solutions, and our efforts are starting to pay off," he said. "We are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in our markets."
The company's strong financial performance has been reflected in its stock price, which has risen by more than 40% this year, outpacing gains in the broader market. Thales' shares were up 2% on Wednesday following the announcement of the company's expected profits.
Thales' success is also good news for the French government, which has been pushing to modernize and streamline its defense sector. In addition to the Thales privatization, the government has also sold stakes in other defense companies, including Naval Group and Safran.
"The French defense industry is a key sector for our economy, and we are committed to ensuring that it remains competitive and innovative," said French President Emmanuel Macron. "Thales' success is a testament to the strength of our defense industry and to the hard work and dedication of its employees."
