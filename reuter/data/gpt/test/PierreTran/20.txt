The French government has announced the conditions for the privatization of Thomson-CSF Defense Electronics Company. According to the government's decision, the privatization of the company can only be carried out under certain conditions. These conditions have been put in place in order to protect the interests of both the company and the French state.
The first condition is that the company must maintain its technological capabilities as well as its ability to innovate. This is important because the company's technology is crucial for France's national security. The government has stressed that the privatization should not compromise the company's ability to provide essential services to the country's military and intelligence agencies. In addition, the company should be able to retain its research and development capabilities and continue to innovate.
Another key condition is that the company must remain a French company. This means that the majority of the shares must be owned by French investors. However, the government has indicated that it is open to non-French investors holding a minority stake in the company, under certain conditions. It is important to note that the company's strategic activities, such as research and development, should remain under French control.
The French government has also stated that the privatization process needs to be transparent and fair. The process must be conducted in a way that ensures that all potential investors are given the same opportunity to bid for the company. The government has indicated that it will be closely monitoring the process to ensure that it is conducted in a transparent and fair manner.

The privatization of Thomson-CSF Defense Electronics Company is a major event in the defense industry.
