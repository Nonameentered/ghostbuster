Airbus, the European aerospace giant, has criticized Delta Airlines over the airline's decision to sign an exclusive deal with Boeing for their next 25 years of aircraft purchases. The move from Delta has left Airbus disappointed and questioning the airline’s commitment to fair competition.
The exclusive deal between Delta and Boeing was announced last month and comes as a shock to Airbus, who has been a long-time supplier to Delta. Under the terms of the agreement, Boeing will provide Delta with 75 firm orders and 50 options for new jets, including the 737 MAX and the larger 787 Dreamliner.
In a statement issued on Monday, Airbus said it was “disappointed” by Delta's decision and expressed concerns over what it perceived to be a lack of competition. The statement read, "This is a missed opportunity for Delta, and more importantly for US consumers, as the decision reduces competition in the aviation market."
Airbus has been competing with Boeing for many years, with both manufacturers locked in fierce competition for market share. The European manufacturer has been a key player in Delta's fleet, supplying the airline with various planes, including the popular A320 family. The two companies have worked closely together since 1993, with Airbus supplying Delta with more than 200 planes.
Airbus has criticized the deal as being anti-competitive, noting that it will negatively impact the airline industry and ultimately harm consumers. They argue that the deal will result in higher prices and reduced choice for customers, with Delta now being bound to Boeing planes for over two decades.
Delta, however, defended its decision and stated that the exclusive deal would provide cost savings and critical product and supply chain efficiencies. The airline believes the agreement will provide significant benefits for its passengers and investors, including improved operational efficiency, fleet optimization, and an enhanced customer experience.
Airbus has indicated that it intends to take up the matter with the U.S. Department of Justice over concerns of anti-competitive behavior. However, the Department of Justice has not yet commented on the issue.
The deal between Delta and Boeing marks a significant victory for the U.S. aircraft manufacturer in its ongoing competition with Airbus. The exclusivity of the deal means that Airbus will miss out on a significant portion of the airline's future business.
In conclusion, the exclusivity deal between Delta and Boeing has raised concerns about competition in the aviation market and the impact it will have on consumers. While Delta has defended its decision, Airbus has criticized the move, threatening action with the U.S. Department of Justice. Only time will tell what the impact of this deal will be on the airline industry as a whole and whether it will result in reduced competition and higher prices for consumers.
