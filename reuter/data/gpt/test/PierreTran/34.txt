In a big move to provide customers more options for travel, Air France has announced that they will be partnering up with Delta Air Lines and Continental to create a transatlantic alliance.
The partnership is primarily aimed to compete with competitors such as British Airways and American Airlines. The announcement was made on New York's Wall Street Exchange earlier this week. Air France will be the anchor member of the alliance which is set to begin operations in April 2020.
Franck Terner, CEO of Air France said in a press release, "We are excited to join hands with Delta Air Lines and Continental in this partnership. This collaboration enhances our ability to compete effectively against larger airline groups."
The alliance between Air France, Delta Air Lines, and Continental will provide the customers of these airlines access to a joint network of over 300 daily transatlantic flights, covering North America and Europe. Furthermore, the alliance will also enable customers of these airlines to enjoy better connectivity, convenient flight schedules, and a higher quality passenger experience.
As part of the alliance, Air France plans to launch a route between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Newark Liberty, New Jersey, which will operate daily from 31 March. The route will be operated by an Airbus A350-900 aircraft with 324 seats, offering its customers a choice of business, premium economy or economy classes.
Delta Air Lines intends to enhance the connection between its European hubs and Air France’s home base at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. As well as route expansion, the airlines will jointly offer access to each airline’s premium lounges at airports. 
Continental, one of the biggest airlines in the United States, will round out the transatlantic offering with its own extensive network to the Americas. 
The partnership is also expected to provide greater access to customers to the transatlantic joint venture, which offers almost 400 daily non-stop flights and carries more than 50 million passengers annually on its routes between North America and Europe.
In addition to the expansion of the number of routes offered by the three airlines, the partnership will also offer improved customer services such as faster security checks at more European airports, better baggage tracking, and coordinated flight schedules.
Delta CEO, Ed Bastian, commented that the partnership was a winning coalition that would improve customer experience across the Atlantic. “The partnership will allow us to continue to offer customers more choice, including more than 300 daily transatlantic frequencies and access to the highest-quality lounges in the region.”
This partnership will have Air France, Delta Air Lines, and Continental competing in an increasingly competitive airline market. These three airlines join the race against some of the largest airline alliances of the world such as OneWorld, SkyTeam, and Star Alliance.
The alliance between Air France, Delta Air Lines, and Continental is also expected to have a significant impact on the global airline industry. By pooling their resources, the three airlines will be able to offer customers better value for their money, as well as improved services.
The three airlines will contribute their unique brand values and expertise to the partnership. By doing so, they hope the alliance will be more attractive to customers in an increasingly competitive airline market.
The partnership is set to begin in April 2020, with Delta, Continental, and Air France promising to deliver a world-class experience and impressive value to their growing base of global customers.
