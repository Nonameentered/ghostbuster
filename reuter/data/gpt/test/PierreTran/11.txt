Thomson-CSF, one of the world's leading providers of defense electronics and systems, has announced that it has returned to profitability after three years of losses. The news comes just ahead of the company's planned privatization sale.
Thomson-CSF, which is based in France, reported a net profit of €207 million ($236 million) for 2019, compared to a loss of €385 million ($439 million) in the previous year. The company's revenue also grew by 3.4% to €11.4 billion ($13 billion).
The news is a significant milestone for Thomson-CSF, which has struggled financially in recent years due to a downturn in defense spending in Europe. The company has been undergoing a major restructuring program aimed at reducing costs and focusing on core business areas.
Thomson-CSF CEO, Patrice Caine, praised the company's employees for helping to turn the business around. "Our teams have worked hard to improve our performance and deliver value for our customers," he said. "This is an important step forward for our company, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead."
The company's positive financial results have come at a good time, as Thomson-CSF's parent company, France's state-owned defense group, Thales, prepares to sell its remaining stake in the firm. Thales is planning to offload its 35% stake in Thomson-CSF in a privatization sale that is due to take place later this year.
Thales CEO, Patrice Caine, said that the company's financial improvement would make it an even more attractive asset for potential buyers. "We believe that Thomson-CSF is now well positioned to succeed as a standalone business, and we are confident that the market will recognize its value," he said.
The privatization sale of Thomson-CSF is expected to be heavily contested, with several major defense firms expected to bid for the company. Thales is reportedly hoping to raise around €2 billion ($2.3 billion) from the sale, which would be used to fund its ongoing expansion in other areas of defense technology.
Thomson-CSF is a major player in the defense industry, providing a range of products and services to militaries around the world. The company's areas of expertise include radar systems, communication networks, and electronic warfare technology.
The company has a particularly strong presence in Europe, where it has worked on major defense projects such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and the A400M military transport plane. It also has a growing presence in the Asia-Pacific region, where it has recently secured contracts for radar systems in Indonesia and Australia.
The news of Thomson-CSF's return to profitability has been welcomed by industry experts and analysts, who say that it is a good sign for the wider defense industry. "Thomson-CSF is a bellwether for the defense sector, and its positive results are a good indicator of the improving health of the industry as a whole," said defense analyst Paul Beaver.
Despite the positive news, Thomson-CSF still faces some challenges ahead, particularly in light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Like many other defense companies, it is likely to see a slowdown in orders from governments, which could impact its growth prospects.
However, with a strong balance sheet and a reputation for delivering high-quality products and services, Thomson-CSF is well placed to weather any storm. As the defense industry continues to evolve and adapt to new challenges, the company is likely to remain a key player in the global defense market.
