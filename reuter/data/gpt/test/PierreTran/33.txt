PARIS - The French government has expressed concerns about national industrial sovereignty and the protection of jobs after rejecting General Electric Co Plc’s bid to merge its nuclear power unit with French state-owned rival Areva SA for the second time. The move represents a blow to GE’s long-standing efforts to expand its nuclear energy arm.
France is keen to protect its energy independence and maintain control over strategic industries. The country is heavily reliant on nuclear power, which accounts for more than 70% of its electricity, making it both a major exporter of nuclear technology and a consumer of nuclear fuel. The government believes that the merger could have handed a foreign company too much control over its energy sector.
"France is not opposed to partnerships, but we are particularly vigilant when it comes to the strategic sectors that are essential to our independence and security, and that includes nuclear energy," said French economy minister Bruno Le Maire.
This is not the first time that GE has tried to buy part of Areva’s nuclear business. In 2015, the company made an offer for Areva’s reactor unit, but the deal fell through due to disagreements over valuation. Areva has since been restructured into three separate entities, one of which is a nuclear fuel company, while the reactor unit is now part of state-owned energy company EDF.
The latest proposal included GE’s nuclear power unit, which is valued at around 3.7 billion euros, but failed to satisfy French government concerns about maintaining control over strategic industries. The French government has a stake in EDF, Areva’s former reactor unit, and has said that any future mergers or partnerships must be made in the interests of French national security.
The French state has a history of intervening in corporate affairs to protect national interests, such as when it prevented Danone from being taken over by PepsiCo in 2005. The government has also taken a tough stance on foreign takeovers of French companies in recent years, notably blocking Italian firm Fincantieri’s bid for French shipyard STX last year.
Observers have noted that the French government’s position could make it difficult for GE to sell its nuclear power unit to another European company. The company has been looking to expand its nuclear business in Europe, and had previously considered partnering with France’s EDF.
The global nuclear industry has been under pressure in recent years due to competition from renewable energy sources and tighter regulations following the Fukushima disaster in 2011. However, some countries, including China and India, are still investing heavily in nuclear power.
GE has previously said that it is committed to a long-term strategy in the nuclear energy sector, and that the proposed merger with Areva would have created a strong global player with a comprehensive offer. However, the company has yet to comment on this latest development.
The rejection of the GE-Areva merger is a reminder that national interests and industrial strategy must be taken into account in corporate mergers and acquisitions. The French government’s concerns over its energy independence and the preservation of strategic industries illustrate the delicate balance that must be struck in international deals.
