Two rival bidders are in a race to acquire Thomson-CSF, a French defence electronics firm. However, analysts believe that the bidders will need to woo state-owned Aerospatiale to secure the deal. 
The first bidder is an American company, Raytheon. They have offered €7.2 billion for Thomson-CSF, which specializes in radars, electronic warfare equipment, and missiles. The second bidder is a European consortium consisting of Thales, a French defense firm, and German industrial conglomerate, Siemens. They have offered €6.5 billion. 
While both bids are impressive, it is believed that Aerospatiale’s support will be crucial to clinch the deal. For one, Aerospatiale is Thomson-CSF’s largest customer, accounting for 30% of the company’s revenue. Secondly, as a state-owned company, Aerospatiale’s backing will carry significant weight and send a strong message to French regulators. 
“Thomson-CSF is a jewel in the French defense industry, and the government is unlikely to let it fall into foreign hands without a fight,” said Antoine Hardy, an analyst at AXA Investment Managers. 
Raytheon has already started wooing Aerospatiale by offering to create a joint venture with the company. The venture would specialize in building missile systems for the French military. Raytheon has also hinted that they would allow Aerospatiale to take a minority stake in the new company. 
However, the European consortium has a strong advantage in the sense that they are a homegrown solution. Thales is a French firm, and Siemens has a strong presence in the country employing over 9,000 people. The consortium has also pledged to keep Thomson-CSF’s workforce in France and to continue investing in the company. 
“The consortium’s bid may have more political appeal since it’s a Franco-German partnership,” said Hardy. 
French regulators have already indicated that they prefer a European solution to the Thomson-CSF deal. However, they have not explicitly ruled out Raytheon. The US company is already a significant player in the French defense industry, supplying missile systems to the country’s military. 
It is not yet clear which bidder Aerospatiale will support, but analysts believe that the company’s decision will be significant. Thomson-CSF is a vital part of the French defense industry, and the government will want to ensure that the deal does not have any negative consequences. 
“The winner of the Thomson-CSF auction will need to show that they can add value to the French defense industry and provide jobs,” said Hardy. “The acquisition must benefit France in the long run.” 
The Thomson-CSF auction is expected to conclude in the next few weeks. Both bidders are eager to clinch the deal and will likely do everything in their power to get Aerospatiale on board. It remains to be seen which bidder will emerge victorious.
