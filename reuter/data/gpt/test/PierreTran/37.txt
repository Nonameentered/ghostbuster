Two of the largest French utility companies, Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux, have announced their intention to merge in a deal worth over €20 billion ($23.5 billion). The merger is expected to bring two companies together to create one of the largest environmental services providers in the world. The deal marks the end of an era for Cie de Suez in particular, which has been an independent force in the world of canal building for over 150 years.
The merger is set to create a new company that would be valued at €50 billion, including debt, with the combined entity focused on delivering sustainable, innovative and integrated solutions to the world's major environmental issues. The deal marks one of the biggest mergers in French corporate history and has the potential to revolutionize the utility industry.
"Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux are two world-renowned companies that complement each other perfectly," said Gerard Mestrallet, chairman and CEO of Cie de Suez. "Together, they will be able to deliver a comprehensive range of environmental services to customers all over the world. We believe that this merger will help accelerate the companies' growth and enable them to expand their reach."
The merger will see Cie de Suez's shareholders receiving Lyonnaise des Eaux shares, resulting in the French Government's stake in Cie de Suez being diluted to around 24 percent. The French Government has previously indicated that it supports the merger as it sees the companies as complementary, and in the long term, deliver a wider range of environmental solutions.
Cie de Suez, which was founded in 1858, has a rich history dating back to the industrial revolution. The company was first established to build the Suez Canal, which connected Europe with Asia via the Mediterranean Sea, and was a significant achievement in its time. Over the years, the company has diversified into other areas, including waste management, water, and energy, and is now recognized as one of the world's leading environmental services providers.
Lyonnaise des Eaux, meanwhile, was established in 1880 and is also recognized as a major player in the utility industry. The company provides water and wastewater services to homes and businesses across France and has been a significant contributor to the development of modern-day infrastructure in France.
The deal between Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux is expected to close by the end of 2017 and will require regulatory approval before it is completed. However, if the deal goes through, it could create a new and exciting era for the two companies, one that focuses on the delivery of sustainable, innovative environmental services to customers all over the world.
