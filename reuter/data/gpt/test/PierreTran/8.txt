Renault workers in France, Belgium and Spain have called for a one-hour strike to protest against the carmaker's plans to cut up to 15,000 jobs worldwide, including around 4,600 in France.
The French carmaker announced earlier this month that it planned to cut 8% of its global workforce and "improve efficiency" in a bid to cut costs, as the automotive industry is hit by an unprecedented crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The announcement was met with anger and dismay by workers and unions, who accused the company of betraying its commitment to its employees and called for a "social dialogue" to find a solution that does not involve job cuts.
In response to the announcement, the Renault plant in Flins, France, which employs around 2,600 people, went on strike on Friday, May 29, calling on the company to "negotiate" with the unions and find a way to secure jobs.
"We have decided to go on strike today because we want to show our determination and solidarity with our colleagues who are affected by the restructuring plan," a union representative told reporters.
The strike was also supported by the CGT, France's biggest trade union, which called for a "general assembly" of all Renault workers to voice their concerns and demand that the company "honors its commitments to its employees."
The union also called for a "national demonstration" in Paris on June 6, to protest against the "brutal and unfair" job cuts, which it said would have a devastating impact on the local economy and the wider community.
The call for a one-hour strike was echoed by workers in Belgium and Spain, who joined the protest against the job cuts and the lack of consultation with unions and employees.
In Spain, where Renault has three plants employing around 11,000 people, workers at the Valladolid plant staged a demonstration on Friday, May 29, to demand that the company "reconsiders" its plans and finds a way to protect jobs.
"We are not against change, but we want to be part of the discussion and decision-making process," said a union representative. "We cannot accept that the company makes decisions that affect the lives of thousands of workers and their families without any consultation or negotiation."
In Belgium, where Renault has a plant in Maubeuge employing around 2,000 people, workers also joined the call for a one-hour strike and demanded that the company "respects" its employees and their rights.
"We want to send a strong message to the management that we will not accept any job cuts without a fair and transparent process that takes into account the interests of all stakeholders," said a union representative.
The call for a one-hour strike comes as Renault faces mounting pressure from its employees and unions, who are demanding that the company "backs down" on its plans and finds a way to "reinvent itself" without sacrificing jobs and workers' rights.
"We are at a critical juncture in the history of our company, and we need to make tough decisions to secure our future," said Renault CEO Clotilde Delbos. "But we also need to show respect for our employees and their contributions to our success, and we will continue to work with them and the unions to find a solution that is fair and sustainable for everyone."
