Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen have reported slight sales gains despite a sharp fall in the domestic market. The French car manufacturers have managed to hold steady in the face of economic challenges, boosting their sales figures by tapping into international markets.
Despite a 25% drop in French auto sales last month due to the coronavirus crisis, Renault recorded a 3.3% increase in global sales in the first quarter of 2020. The company credits its success to a strong presence in China, where it saw a 19.9% sales increase, as well as strong sales in Russia and Brazil.
PSA Peugeot Citroen, too, managed to hold its own in the face of adverse economic conditions. The automaker reported a 17.7% increase in sales outside of its home market. Its worldwide sales were up 0.7% for the first quarter, despite a 34% drop in French sales.
Both companies have weathered the economic storm by focusing on global sales expansion and diversification. Renault CEO Luca de Meo stated that the company is “seeing positive signs of recovery in Asia” and that “the Group’s early focus on China has allowed us to benefit from the recovery in this market.”
Similarly, PSA Peugeot Citroen CEO Carlos Tavares has noted the company’s success in expanding to new markets, including the Middle East and Southeast Asia. He notes that “our brands’ popularity continues to rise, with new models including the Peugeot 208 and the DS 7 Crossback driving strong sales growth internationally.”
Despite their success in the face of adversity, both companies are aware of the challenges that lie ahead. With the coronavirus pandemic continuing to impact the global economy, the stability of the automotive industry remains uncertain. As such, Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen are focusing on streamlining their operations to be more efficient and agile, as well as investing in electric vehicle technology to better prepare for the future.
Overall, the slight sales gains reported by Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen are an encouraging sign in a difficult economic climate. By focusing on expanding their reach beyond their domestic market, the companies have been able to maintain momentum and prepare for a more sustainable future.
