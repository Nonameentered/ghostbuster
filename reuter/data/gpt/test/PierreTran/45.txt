The move comes as part of a broader push by the company to expand its footprint in key markets across the globe. Pratt & Whitney's management believes that the new office will help them tap into the rich pool of talent in the region and also help them to connect with local partners.
"The European market is an increasingly important one for us as we seek to grow our business globally," said Dario Deste, senior vice president at Pratt & Whitney. "France, in particular, is home to some of the world's most innovative aerospace companies, so we are excited to be expanding our presence here and working closely with local partners to develop new products and services."
The Paris office will be responsible for a range of activities, from sales and marketing to product development and engineering. The company also plans to use the office as a base for research and development activities.

The opening of the new office in Paris has been well received by the local business community, with many expressing enthusiasm for the company's plans and eager to work with them. Several key industry players attended the launch ceremony, including executives from Airbus, Safran, and Dassault Aviation.
The Paris office is just the latest move by Pratt & Whitney to expand its global footprint. The company has also been building partnerships with companies and research institutions across Asia and the Middle East, with a particular focus on China.
