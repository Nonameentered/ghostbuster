After months of speculation, it has been confirmed that Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux will merge to create a global utilities heavyweight. The new entity will have a combined market value of €40 billion and a presence in more than 70 countries.
The merger will see Suez shareholders receive 21 shares in the new company for each Suez share they hold, while Lyonnaise des Eaux shareholders will receive one share for each of their holdings.
The deal is expected to create significant cost synergies, with estimates suggesting that the new entity could save as much as €600 million annually by 2024. The merged company will also have a stronger balance sheet, which will enable it to invest more in growth opportunities in its core markets.
Both Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux have acknowledged that the merger will create significant benefits for their respective stakeholders. Suez CEO Bertrand Camus stated that the merger "creates a unique opportunity to build a global utilities champion committed to accelerating the energy and ecological transition, and to be a key player in the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals."
Meanwhile, Lyonnaise des Eaux CEO Laurent Michel stated that the merger "will create a world-leading company with a strong focus on innovation and sustainability, capable of tackling some of the biggest challenges facing our planet."
The merger has also been endorsed by the French government, which currently holds a 23.3% stake in Suez. In a statement, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire described the merger as "a great opportunity for France to create a European champion in the water and waste sector."
The new entity will have a diverse portfolio of businesses, including water and waste management, as well as energy and industrial services. It will also have a significant presence in emerging markets such as Latin America and Southeast Asia.
The merger is expected to be completed by the end of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals. The new company will be headquartered in Paris and will trade on the Euronext stock exchange.
The announcement of the merger has been met with mixed reactions from industry analysts. While some have praised the strategic rationale behind the deal, others have expressed concerns about the potential antitrust implications of creating such a large player in the global utilities market.
Furthermore, some analysts have suggested that the merger could trigger a wave of consolidation in the utilities sector, as companies look to create scale and improve their competitive positions.
Overall, the merger between Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux is set to create a new global player in the utilities sector, with significant potential for growth and value creation. It remains to be seen how the new entity will navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, but the future looks bright for this new utilities heavyweight.
