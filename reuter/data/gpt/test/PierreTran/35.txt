France's Aerospatiale has unveiled its plans to consolidate its defence sector, which has added to the complications in the ongoing restructuring of the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. The move is in line with the country's larger effort of developing a robust defence industry and comes in the wake of the global pandemic that has halted the growth of the commercial aviation sector.
Aerospatiale, a subsidiary of the Airbus Group, has announced its intention to merge its three defence units – Airbus Defence and Space, Airbus Helicopters, and Airbus Cybersecurity – into a single entity called Airbus Defence and Space. The move will reportedly result in the elimination of roughly 15% of the jobs in the consolidated unit, which amounts to around 2,300 positions.
The announcement has triggered criticism from labour unions, who have accused the company of exploiting the current crisis to push through job cuts. According to a statement from the French National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions (UNSA), the consolidation plan is "too quick, too brutal, and under-equipped when it comes to the social dimension."
The union has called for talks with the company management to explore alternative solutions that would mitigate the impact on jobs and ensure the sustainability of the company's operations. They have also urged the French government, which has a significant stake in both Aerospatiale and Airbus, to intervene and protect the interests of the workers.
The defence sector consolidation could further complicate the ongoing restructuring of Airbus, which has been grappling with the fallout of the pandemic-induced slowdown in the aviation industry. The company has announced plans to cut 15,000 jobs globally, including 5,000 in France, as it looks to reduce costs and streamline operations.
The restructuring also involves a significant overhaul of the company's commercial aircraft production, which includes the phasing out of the A380 superjumbo and the scaling back of the A350 production. This has led to tensions between different subsidiaries of the Airbus Group, with the Spanish and German wings voicing concerns over the potential impact on their operations.
The French government has been a key player in the negotiations, as it holds a 11.1% stake in the company and has economic and political interests in the company's future. The government has already extended loans and grants to Airbus to help it weather the pandemic crisis, and has urged the company to preserve the domestic jobs as part of the restructuring.
The consolidation of the Aerospatiale defence units could potentially divert resources and attention away from the critical commercial aircraft production, adding to the complexities of the restructuring process. It could also exacerbate the tensions between the various national interests within the Airbus Group, which has operations and stakeholders spread across France, Germany, Spain, and the UK.
Some analysts view the consolidation of the defence units as a necessary move for Aerospatiale to strengthen its position in the global defence market, which has remained relatively resilient in the face of the pandemic. The new entity will reportedly focus on developing innovative technologies for the defence sector, including unmanned systems and new satellite capabilities.
However, others have raised concerns about the potential impact on the company's commercial aviation operations, which generate the bulk of the Airbus Group's revenue and provide employment to thousands of workers across Europe. The consolidation could lead to a drain of talent and resources from the commercial unit, which is already struggling to cope with the reduced demand for air travel.
The restructuring of Airbus is seen as a critical test of the EU's industrial policy and a reflection of the ongoing debates over the role of the state in the economy. The pandemic has added to the urgency of the need to revitalise the European aviation industry and to chart a path towards greener and more sustainable aviation.
The French government has reiterated its commitment to supporting the aerospace industry, including both the defence and commercial segments. However, there are concerns that the consolidation of the defence sector may undermine the government's efforts to preserve jobs in the commercial unit and to secure the long-term viability of the company.
The European Commission has also been closely monitoring the restructuring of Airbus, as it seeks to ensure compliance with EU state aid rules and safeguard the interests of European companies and consumers. The Commission has already launched an investigation into the loans and grants provided by the French and Spanish governments to Airbus, which could potentially result in a legal challenge to the restructuring plan.
In conclusion, the consolidation of Aerospatiale's defence sector may add to the complications in the ongoing restructuring of Airbus, which has significant implications for the European aerospace industry and the wider economy. While the move could strengthen the company's position in the global defence market, it raises concerns about the potential impact on the commercial aviation unit and the workers employed there. The restructuring highlights the challenges of balancing national interests, industrial policy, and EU rules in a rapidly changing economic environment.
