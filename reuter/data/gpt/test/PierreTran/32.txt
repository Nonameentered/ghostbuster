France has rejected General Electric's proposed acquisition of defence electronics group Thomson-CSF due to national security concerns.
The decision was announced by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Friday, who said that the government had decided to block the deal because it "presented risks" for the country's strategic interests.
Thomson-CSF is a major player in the French defence industry and supplies critical defence equipment to the country's armed forces, such as radars and electronic warfare systems. The company's technology is also used in other countries' military equipment, including the United States' F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.
General Electric had been seeking to acquire Thomson-CSF's parent company, Alstom, in a deal worth $17 billion. The acquisition would have included Alstom's energy business, as well as its transport unit, which is known for producing high-speed trains such as the TGV.
The French government had previously approved the acquisition of Alstom's energy business, but had raised concerns about the impact of the deal on the country's defence industry.
Le Maire said that the government had carefully considered the potential risks and benefits of the acquisition, and had determined that it was not in France's national interest.
"We have decided to exercise our right of veto," he told reporters.
The decision is a blow to General Electric, which has been seeking to expand its presence in Europe and develop its industrial capabilities.
In a statement, the company said that it was "disappointed" by the decision and would explore its options.
"GE believes the acquisition of Alstom would have been good for France, for the French economy, and for GE," the statement said.
"France is a critical market for GE, and we will continue to invest and grow in the country."
The decision is also a setback for Alstom, which had been looking to sell its energy business to reduce its debt.
In a statement, the company said that it understood the French government's decision and thanked General Electric for its efforts to acquire the business.
"We remain focused on the future and confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic plan," the statement said.
The decision has been welcomed by some French politicians and industry experts, who have raised concerns about the potential impact of the deal on the country's defence capabilities.
"This is a good decision for France," said Emilien Hoet, an expert on the French defence industry.
"Thomson-CSF is a strategic asset for the country, and the government was right to exercise its right of veto."
The decision also reflects a growing trend of European governments taking a more active role in guarding against foreign investment in key industries, particularly in strategic sectors such as defence.
In recent years, a number of European countries have introduced laws and regulations designed to protect against foreign takeovers, citing concerns about national security and economic sovereignty.
France's decision to reject General Electric's bid is likely to fuel further debate about the role of government in regulating foreign investment, and the balance between economic growth and national security.
Overall, this decision sends a clear message that while France is open to foreign investment, it will not compromise on its national interests, particularly when it comes to strategic industries such as defence.
