The French government has announced the terms and conditions for the privatization of state-owned defense and electronics company Thomson-CSF. The move is part of President Emmanuel Macron's efforts to revitalize the French economy and reduce the state's involvement in business.
Thomson-CSF, which was renamed Thales in 2000, is a major supplier of defense equipment to the French armed forces and also has a significant presence in the civilian electronics market. The government owns a 26.4% stake in the company, which it plans to sell off to private investors.
Under the terms of the privatization, the government will retain a "golden share" in Thales, which will give it the right to veto any attempt by a foreign investor to take control of the company. This is seen as a nod to concerns about national security, given Thales' involvement in defense technology.
The government has also set a floor price of €92 per share for the sale, which is slightly above Thales' current share price. This is intended to ensure that the government gets a fair price for its stake in the company and also to discourage speculators from buying up shares with a view to making a quick profit.
In addition, the government has stipulated that the new owners of Thales must commit to maintaining the company's French headquarters and research and development activities in the country. There are concerns that a foreign owner could seek to move these functions abroad, which could have a negative impact on French jobs and expertise.
The privatization of Thales has been widely anticipated for some time, as the government has been seeking to reduce its stake in the company and generate funds for other investment priorities. However, the announcement of the terms and conditions has been met with mixed reactions.
On the one hand, some business leaders have welcomed the move as a positive step towards greater economic liberalization and an opportunity for Thales to compete more effectively in global markets. They argue that private sector ownership will give the company greater flexibility and agility to adapt to changing market conditions and invest in new areas of growth.
On the other hand, unions and some politicians have expressed concern about the impact of privatization on Thales' workforce and the risk of job losses. Thales employs around 80,000 people globally, with a significant proportion based in France. There are fears that a new owner could seek to cut costs by reducing headcount or moving jobs to countries with lower labor costs.
There are also wider questions about the role of the state in the French economy and the balance between public ownership and private enterprise. The government's decision to retain a golden share in Thales suggests that it is keen to maintain some degree of influence over the company and prevent it from falling into foreign hands. However, critics argue that this approach could deter overseas investors and limit the potential for Thales to expand internationally.
For now, the government is pressing ahead with the privatization process and expects to complete the sale of its stake in Thales by the end of the year. The sale is expected to raise up to €3.9 billion for the state, which will be reinvested in other areas of the economy.
It remains to be seen how Thales will fare under private ownership and whether the government's conditions will be enough to protect French jobs and expertise. However, the privatization of Thales is a significant development in France's ongoing efforts to modernize its economy and reduce state intervention in business.
