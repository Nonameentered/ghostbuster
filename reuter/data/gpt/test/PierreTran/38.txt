In a move that marks the end of an era for one of the most storied construction firms in history, Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux have announced plans to merge. The deal will see the companies combine to form one of the largest players in the global utilities industry, with a market value of over $18 billion.
Suez has a long and storied history, dating back to the construction of the Suez Canal in the mid-19th century. The company was founded in 1858 by the French diplomat and engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps, who oversaw the construction of the canal between 1859 and 1869. Since then, Suez has expanded to become a major player in the global water and waste management industries, with operations in over 70 countries.
Lyonnaise des Eaux has a similarly long and distinguished history, dating back to the early 19th century. The company was founded in 1860 by the French industrialist François Barthélemy Arago, who initially focused on the production of gas and electricity. Over the years, the company has diversified into a wide range of utility services, including water and waste management, energy transmission and distribution, and telecommunications.
The merger, which was announced on Friday, has been in the works for months, and is set to create a company with a combined workforce of over 300,000 employees and a presence in more than 70 countries around the world. Under the terms of the deal, Suez will acquire Lyonnaise des Eaux for a reported $9.8 billion, with the new company to be headquartered in Paris.
In a joint statement announcing the merger, the two companies said that the deal would create a "world-class player" in the utilities industry, with the scale and resources to "pioneer sustainable solutions and create value for our stakeholders around the world". The companies also said that the merger would enable them to "capture significant synergies" and accelerate their growth in key markets.
The move comes amid a wave of consolidation in the global utilities industry, as companies seek to bulk up and gain greater efficiencies in the face of mounting competition and regulatory pressures. Last year, Spanish utility giant Iberdrola acquired Brazilian firm Neoenergia for $3.3 billion, while French energy giant Total acquired solar panel maker SunPower for $1.3 billion.
The announcement has been met with a mixed response from industry analysts, with some lauding the move as a necessary step to create a stronger, more competitive player in the sector, while others expressed concerns about the potential impact on jobs and the environment. Some observers also raised eyebrows at the high price tag for the deal, which represents a premium of more than 30% on Lyonnaise des Eaux's market value.
For Suez, the merger represents a significant step towards transforming itself into a more diversified and sustainable company, better equipped to face the challenges of a rapidly changing global economy. For Lyonnaise des Eaux, the deal represents an opportunity to secure its future in a competitive and rapidly changing industry. Together, the two companies will have the scale, resources, and expertise to compete on a global scale, and to shape the future of the utilities and waste management industries for years to come.
