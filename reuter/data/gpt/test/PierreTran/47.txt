Paris – The takeover battle for France’s defense and electronics giant Thomson-CSF continues to heat up, with two French companies submitting their final offers amidst potential investment from British Aerospace and GEC.
Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere have been in the running for several months to acquire Thomson-CSF, a company valued at over $10 billion and renowned for producing top-of-the-line radar systems and rocket launchers. However, the entry of two British firms into the fray has added further complexity to the auction process.
Alcatel Alsthom, the Franco-German telecommunications conglomerate, has been seen as a favorite to acquire Thomson-CSF due to its extensive experience in the electronics industry. The company is offering a deal that would merge Thomson-CSF with its own defense subsidiary, Thomson-CSF would hold a 40% stake in the merged entity. This would allow Thomson-CSF to remain a French company, despite having a reduced ownership stake.
Meanwhile, Lagardere, the media and publishing company, has taken a more aggressive approach, proposing a complete takeover of Thomson-CSF as an independent company. Lagardere, which owns a 15% stake in Airbus, is positioning itself as a player in the defense industry and has been vocal about its ambitions to diversify into other sectors. An acquisition of Thomson-CSF would be a significant step in this direction.
Sources close to the auction suggest that both companies have submitted offers in excess of the current market valuation of Thomson-CSF, reflecting the intense competition to acquire the company. Analysts believe that the final price for Thomson-CSF could reach up to $15 billion, given the strong interest from potential buyers.
However, the entry of British Aerospace and GEC into the auction process has further complicated matters. British Aerospace, the UK’s largest defense contractor, has expressed an interest in acquiring a stake in Thomson-CSF as part of a broader strategy to expand its presence in Europe. The company has made no secret of its ambitions to become a major player in the European defense market and has been steadily acquiring companies in recent months to achieve this goal.
GEC, another British engineering giant, has also entered the race for Thomson-CSF. The company has had notable success in the past with its acquisitions of Marconi and Racal Electronics, both major players in the defense industry. With Thomson-CSF currently holding a leading position in the radar systems market, GEC sees an acquisition as a potential opportunity to cement itself as one of the dominant players in the industry.
Despite their respective interests in Thomson-CSF, both British companies face significant obstacles in acquiring the French firm. First and foremost, there is the issue of national security. Thomson-CSF is heavily involved in the production of military equipment for the French armed forces, and any acquisition by a foreign company would require approval from the French government. Given the sensitive nature of the defense industry, it is unlikely that the French government would approve a takeover by a foreign company.
Furthermore, British Aerospace and GEC may struggle to match the financial firepower of the French companies. Both Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere are valued at over $10 billion, while British Aerospace and GEC have market valuations of just $3.5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. This could put them at a disadvantage when it comes to submitting a final offer for Thomson-CSF.
Despite the challenges, the auction for Thomson-CSF remains fiercely competitive, with all parties eager to emerge as the victor. In recent years, there has been a considerable consolidation in the defense industry, with major players such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing rapidly expanding their operations through acquisitions. With governments around the world increasing their defense budgets in response to global security threats, there is likely to be continued interest in acquisitions in the sector.
The winner of the Thomson-CSF auction will be well placed to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the defense industry. However, with the presence of British competitors and the high price tag attached to the company, it remains to be seen who will ultimately emerge victorious. The final decision is expected to be made by the end of the year, with both French and British companies closely monitoring developments.
