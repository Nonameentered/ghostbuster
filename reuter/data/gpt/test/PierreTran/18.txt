Paris, France - The French government has announced the terms for the privatisation of Thomson-CSF, a state-run defence and electronics company, igniting a battle for control among rival firms. The move has opened up a bidding process that is expected to attract domestic and international interest.
Thomson-CSF has been a major player in the defence market in France for decades. The French government had a 27% stake in the company until recently. The government has now decided to sell its shares in the company to the private sector, allowing the company to be fully privatised. The decision was announced by Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who stated that the move was part of the government's efforts to "modernise the French economy" and "restructure its holdings in accordance with its priorities".
Mr Le Maire also revealed that the government is seeking a minimum of â‚¬2 billion ($2.4 billion) for its stake in the company. The remaining shares in the company are privately owned, with the majority of the stake held by Dassault Aviation, the French aerospace company. The privatisation of Thomson-CSF marks a significant shift in the French government's stance on the ownership of key national assets. The decision has been welcomed by business leaders and investors, who see it as a sign of the government's commitment to economic reform.
The move has also sparked a fierce bidding war among rival companies. The most high-profile of these is French arms manufacturer Thales, which has publicly declared its interest in acquiring Thomson-CSF. Thales is currently the biggest player in the French defence market and sees the purchase of Thomson-CSF as an opportunity to expand its reach and diversify its product line.
However, the company faces stiff competition from other rivals, including French defence contractor Safran, who also have their eyes set on Thomson-CSF. The company has stated that it is looking to increase its involvement in the defence sector and sees Thomson-CSF as the key to doing that. In addition, a number of international companies, including the US defence giants Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, are believed to be considering making a bid for the company.
The announcement of the privatisation of Thomson-CSF has not been without controversy. Opposition politicians have criticised the move, accusing the government of "selling off" key national assets to the private sector. They have also expressed concerns about the impact of the privatisation on the country's defence industry and the security of key national assets.
The French government has sought to address these concerns, stating that any new owner would have to maintain the company's French identity and workforce. The government has also stated that it will retain a "golden share" in the company, giving it the power to veto any decision that could have serious repercussions for national security.
Despite these assurances, the privatisation of Thomson-CSF remains a hotly contested issue. The battle for control of the company is likely to be fierce, with companies fighting tooth and nail to secure the valuable asset for themselves. It remains to be seen who the eventual winner of the bidding process will be. However, one thing is clear: the privatisation of Thomson-CSF marks a significant turning point in the French government's approach to the ownership of key national assets. The outcome of the bidding process will have far-reaching implications for the country's economy and defence industry.
