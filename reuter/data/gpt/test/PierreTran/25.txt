The market is speculating that Gerard Mestrallet might lead the new Suez-Lyonnaise utilities group in a potential merger. The proposed merger between Suez and Lyonnaise is generating a lot of buzz and anticipation among investors. If the merger takes place, it will be a significant change in the utility sector landscape in France. The combined entity will have a market capitalization of around â‚¬21.3 billion and employ around 220,000 people. 
The potential merger comes after months of rumors and speculation. The two entities have been in talks for a while, and it is believed that the merger talks have gained momentum in recent weeks. Suez, a leading utility company in France, has been facing struggling times. The company has been going through a restructuring process, which has made it vulnerable to a takeover. Lyonnaise, on the other hand, is a smaller player in the utility sector, but it has a strong presence in the water business. 
The merger is expected to create synergies in the operational and financial aspects of the business, allowing the combined entity to generate significant cost savings. The two companies have complementary businesses, with Suez having a strong presence in waste management and energy, while Lyonnaise is more focused on water management. The merger would create a diversified utility group that would be able to face the challenges of an increasingly complex and competitive market.
The market has been closely watching the potential merger and speculating on who might lead the combined entity. The name that keeps coming up is Gerard Mestrallet, the former CEO of Engie (formerly GDF Suez). Mestrallet is a seasoned executive with extensive experience in the energy and utility sectors. He led Engie from 2005 to 2016 and oversaw the company's transformation into a leading player in the energy sector. Mestrallet's appointment as the head of the new Suez-Lyonnaise entity would signal the company's intention to become a major player in the utility sector.
Mestrallet is seen as a strong leader who has a track record of leading successful mergers. He oversaw the merger of Suez and Gaz de France in 2008 and transformed the company into a European leader in energy and environmental services. Mestrallet is highly respected in the industry and is known for his strategic vision, strong management skills, and ability to navigate complex regulatory environments. 
Mestrallet's appointment would also be a significant boost for Suez-Lyonnaise in their efforts to attract investors. The utility sector is highly capital intensive, and the combined entity will need to raise significant funds to finance its growth plans. Mestrallet's reputation and track record would give investors confidence that the new entity is led by a competent and experienced executive team.
However, it is important to note that nothing has been announced officially, and there is no confirmation on whether Mestrallet will be appointed as the CEO of the new Suez-Lyonnaise entity. The market is speculating based on rumors and speculation, and an official announcement would need to be made before anything is confirmed.
In conclusion, the potential merger between Suez and Lyonnaise is generating significant interest and excitement in the utility sector. The combined entity would be a major force in the industry, with a diverse portfolio of businesses and a strong presence in key markets. The market speculations on Gerard Mestrallet's appointment as the new CEO of the company would signal the company's intentions to become a major player in the utility sector, and it would give investors confidence in the company's leadership team. We will have to wait and see what the future holds for Suez-Lyonnaise, and if the merger goes through, how the new entity will shape up under Mestrallet's leadership.
