Paris, France â€“ The French government is preparing to relaunch the privatisation of defence and electronics company Thomson-CSF, after a previous attempt was put on hold due to political and financial considerations. The move comes as the government recently announced the appointment of two key executives to lead the transition towards privatisation.
Thomson-CSF, which has been renamed Thales Group, is one of France's largest defence and electronics companies, with a workforce of over 80,000. The company has a history of producing defence technologies and systems, avionics, and other electronics for military and civilian use.
The French government initially announced its plans to privatise the state-owned Thales Group in 2017 as part of its broader economic reforms programme. However, the move was put on hold following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and disagreements between various stakeholders over the valuation of the company.
Now, in a fresh attempt to privatise the company, the government has appointed two veteran executives, Pascale Sourisse and Philippe Duhamel, to lead the privatisation effort. Sourisse, who has held senior positions at companies such as Alcatel-Lucent and Orange, has been appointed as the chair of the Thales Group's board of directors. Meanwhile, Duhamel, who has held similar positions at companies such as GE and Alstom, has been appointed as the CEO of Thales Group.
In a statement, the French Minister of Economy, Bruno Le Maire, welcomed the key executive appointments, stating that "Sourisse and Duhamel bring years of experience and expertise to the Thales Group. We are confident that their leadership will help steer the company towards a successful privatisation process."
The French government's decision to privatise Thales Group has been met with mixed reactions. While some experts welcome the move, arguing that it will increase the company's efficiency and competitiveness, others warn that it could lead to job losses and undermine the country's defence capabilities.
For its part, the Thales Group has expressed its support for the privatisation process, stating that it "welcomes the French government's decision to move forward with the privatisation of Thales Group. We are committed to working with the government and our stakeholders to ensure a smooth and successful transition towards a fully privatized Thales."
