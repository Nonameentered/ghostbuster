Paris, France- Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom are locked in intense competition for the acquisition of French defence contractor Thomson-CSF, as the cutthroat naval combat systems industry continues to thrive.
Thomson-CSF, which ranks as the world's tenth-largest military electronics manufacturer, builds naval systems and equipment, including radar, sensors, and defence electronics. The company also provides command-and-control systems and consulting services to military clients worldwide.
Following France's decision to increase defence spending to 2% of its GDP, the country's defence industry has seen a surge in demand for naval combat systems. This has led to a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.
Lagardere, one of the top aerospace, defence, and media conglomerates in Europe, has been eyeing Thomson-CSF for some time now. The company has a long history of providing military technologies and defence systems, and adding Thomson-CSF to its portfolio would unquestionably strengthen its position in the defence market.
Alcatel Alsthom, on the other hand, is a multinational telecommunications equipment and services company headquartered in France. It has made a recent foray into defence manufacturing, with its focus primarily on naval combat systems.
Thomson-CSF is presently owned by the French Government, which holds a 25.8% stake in the firm. The government is expected to cash out its entire stake by 2023. However, the government's divestment mandate in Thomson-CSF has enabled both Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom to enter the fray, with each seeing an opportunity to secure a controlling interest in the company.
One industry expert who requested anonymity noted, "Thomson-CSF has a very competitive and focused portfolio in the maritime defence industry. Given the massive demand uptick for naval combat systems, it is a lucrative proposition for both Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom."
The competition between Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom has been intense, with both companies jostling to outdo one another. Lagardere made the first move in April when it made an unsolicited takeover offer of €2.5 billion ($2.8 billion) for Thomson-CSF. Lagardere's offer included a 30% premium on Thomson-CSF's closing share price the previous day.
Alcatel Alsthom responded with its own offer of €2.7 billion ($3 billion), which also came with a 30% premium on Thomson-CSF's share price. The offer was enough to entice the Government of France to support Alcatel Alsthom's bid – a significant boon for the firm.
Despite the French Government's support, Lagardere has vowed to fight till the very end. The two firms have been locked in a head-to-head bidding war above the original price range suggested by banks valuating Thomson-CSF.
As the deadline approaches and the decision between Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom becomes eminent, industry experts predict that the price of Thomson-CSF could further increase to levels beyond €3 billion ($3.4 billion).
The entry of foreign companies into this bidding war cannot be ruled out either, given the high stakes of the naval combat systems industry. Competition comes not only from foreign defence firms like Raytheon and Saab but also potential suitors like Thales and BEL, both of whom have a significant interest in acquiring Thomson-CSF.
Nevertheless, this acquisition is not just about acquiring a homegrown defence player – both Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom also see it as an opportunity to expand their global footprint. By acquiring Thomson-CSF, they hope to build on France's legacy in maritime technology and leverage the firm's technological expertise to dominate the global naval combat systems market.
In conclusion, the competition between Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom over the acquisition of Thomson-CSF is a testament to the cutthroat nature of the naval combat systems industry. As France increases its defence spending, the demand for naval combat systems has skyrocketed, leading to mergers and acquisitions that have set off a bidding war. With everything from the French Government's divestment mandate to the global importance of Thomson-CSF at stake, there is no surprise that the two firms are competing fiercely to acquire this critical asset. The industry watchers will be keenly observing the events, which promise to affect the defence landscape in France and beyond.
