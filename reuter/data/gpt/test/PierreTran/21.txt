Boeing, one of the largest aerospace companies in the world, is eyeing the expansion of its services division with foreign partners, according to CEO Phil Condit.
Condit made the announcement at the Farnborough International Airshow, saying that Boeing's expansion plans are aimed at capturing a larger share of the growing global market for aviation services. The company's aerospace services division provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul services for its airline customers.
"We're looking to expand our services business with partners around the world," Condit said. "As airlines continue to seek more efficient and cost-effective ways to maintain their aircraft, we want to be their first choice for service."
Boeing's move into the services business is part of its broader effort to diversify its revenue stream and reduce its reliance on its commercial aircraft business. The company is facing stiff competition from European rival Airbus, which has been gaining ground in the global aircraft market with its fuel-efficient A320neo and A350 aircraft.
Boeing also faces challenges from upstart rivals like China's COMAC and Russia's UAC, which are seeking to enter the global market with their own aircraft. By expanding into the services business, Boeing hopes to maintain its dominance in the market by providing comprehensive solutions to airlines that include both aircraft and service.
"We see this as a growth opportunity, not just for ourselves, but for our partners as well," Condit said. "Our services division is focused on providing the best possible support for our customers, and we believe that by partnering with companies around the world, we can better serve their needs."
Boeing's expansion plans are already underway, with the company announcing several partnerships in recent months. In February, the company signed a deal with Emirates Airlines to provide maintenance services for its new fleet of 777X aircraft. Boeing also announced a joint venture with French aircraft engine maker Safran to provide maintenance services for new aircraft engines.
The company is also seeking to expand its services business in Asia, where demand for airline maintenance services is growing rapidly. In June, Boeing announced a strategic alliance with Chinese aircraft manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) to provide support for the C919, China's newest aircraft.
"We see great potential in the Asian market for our services business," Condit said. "As the region continues to grow, we want to be a partner to the airlines that are driving that growth."
Boeing's push into the services business has received a positive response from industry analysts, who say it could help the company maintain its market share in the face of increasing competition.
"We believe that Boeing's expansion into the services business is a smart move," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group. "As airlines seek to reduce costs and increase efficiency, a comprehensive services offering could be a key differentiator for Boeing."
