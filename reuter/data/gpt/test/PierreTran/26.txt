PARIS - In an effort to further consolidate the French aerospace and defence industries, media and technology conglomerate Lagardere has confirmed its bid to acquire a controlling stake in Paris-based defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF. The deal, worth an estimated â‚¬8 billion, would make Lagardere a major player in the lucrative defence market, which has been growing in recent years as governments around the world invest heavily in military technology.
The move comes after a series of mergers and acquisitions in the French defence industry over the past few years. Last year saw the merger of two major French defence companies, Thales and Gemalto, while the year before saw the purchase of Zodiac Aerospace by Safran. These moves have helped to consolidate the industry and make it more competitive on the global stage.
According to sources close to the deal, Lagardere is looking to acquire a controlling stake in Thomson-CSF in order to gain access to its cutting-edge defence electronics technology. The company is a leading supplier of electronic equipment and systems for the aerospace and defence industries, with a particularly strong presence in the naval sector. Its products include sonar and radar systems, electronic warfare systems, and communications equipment.
Lagardere, which has a longstanding relationship with Thomson-CSF, is said to be particularly interested in the company's expertise in the development of military drones. The French government has been investing heavily in the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and Lagardere believes that Thomson-CSF's expertise in this area could be valuable in securing future contracts.
The deal would also give Lagardere access to Thomson-CSF's extensive network of international customers. The company has a strong presence in Europe, as well as in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. The acquisition would make Lagardere one of the largest defence companies in France, alongside Thales, Safran, and Dassault Aviation.
The move has been welcomed by French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron, who has been pushing for greater consolidation in the country's defence industry. Speaking to reporters, Macron said that he believed the deal would help to strengthen France's strategic capabilities in the defence sector.
However, the acquisition is likely to face some opposition. In particular, labour unions at Thomson-CSF have expressed concern about the potential impact of the deal on jobs. The company employs over 25,000 people, many of whom are based in France. Lagardere has sought to reassure employees, insisting that the acquisition would be a positive development for the company.
The bid is still subject to approvals from regulators and shareholders, and there is no guarantee that it will go ahead. However, if the deal does go through, it would mark another significant step in the consolidation of the French defence industry, and could help to make the country a major player on the international stage.
