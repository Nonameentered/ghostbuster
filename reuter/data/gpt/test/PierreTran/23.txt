Airbus, one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in the world, has condemned Delta's exclusive deal with Boeing, calling it "anti-competitive." Delta announced last week that it had reached an agreement with Boeing to purchase up to 200 737 MAX airplanes, ending its long-standing relationship with Airbus. The deal is worth an estimated $25 billion.
In a strongly-worded statement, Airbus accused Delta of ignoring the "competitive landscape" and choosing a "less efficient" aircraft in the 737 MAX. According to Airbus, Delta's decision was driven by factors other than economics, such as political pressure and a desire to maintain relations with Boeing.
"Delta's decision to exclude Airbus from its fleet is disappointing and anti-competitive," said Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer. "We believe that customers should have the freedom to choose the best aircraft for their needs, based on performance, efficiency, and value. Delta's decision flies in the face of that principle."
Airbus also accused Delta of not conducting a "fair and transparent" competition between Airbus and Boeing airplanes. This is not the first time Airbus has raised concerns about exclusive deals in the aviation industry. Earlier this year, the company complained to the European Union about a similar agreement between United Airlines and Boeing.
Delta responded to Airbus' accusations by stating that the airline "engaged in a robust competitive process" before choosing the 737 MAX. According to Delta, the airline evaluated proposals from both Airbus and Boeing and determined that the 737 MAX was the best option for its needs. Delta also said that the decision was based on several factors, including operational efficiency, passenger comfort, and environmental sustainability.
"We are confident in our decision to purchase the 737 MAX and look forward to adding these airplanes to our fleet," said Delta CEO Ed Bastian. "We believe that this deal will create value for our customers, employees, and shareholders."
The controversy surrounding Delta's exclusive deal with Boeing highlights the ongoing competition in the aircraft manufacturing industry. Airbus and Boeing are the two dominant players in the market, with each company seeking to gain an edge over the other. This competition has led to innovations in aircraft design and technology, but it has also resulted in disputes over trade practices and intellectual property.
As the aviation industry continues to grow and evolve, the rivalry between Airbus and Boeing is likely to remain heated. However, it is important that both companies and their customers prioritize fair competition and transparency to ensure that the best aircraft are chosen based on their merits rather than external factors.
