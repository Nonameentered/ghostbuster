Paris, France - In a historic merger deal worth $4.3 billion, two of France's largest companies Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux SA have agreed to come together to create one of the largest water and waste management companies in the world.
Suez Canal Company, which is part of Cie de Suez, has been one of the most successful companies in France for more than 150 years. It played a vital role in the development of the Suez Canal which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, as well as the expansion of water and waste management systems across the globe.
Lyonnaise des Eaux SA has been a driving force in the water and wastewater management sector in France for over a century. It has operations in over 50 countries and employs more than 80,000 people.
The merger, announced on Wednesday, will see the combination of the two companies into a larger entity that will be dubbed as Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux. The new company will be headquartered in Paris and will be listed on the French stock exchange.
Both companies have signed a merger agreement that will result in Cie de Suez shareholders holding 65% of the shares of the new entity while Lyonnaise des Eaux SA shareholders will own 35%. The merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year and is subject to approvals from regulatory authorities.
Jean-Louis Chaussade, the CEO of Suez, said that the merger is a strategic move which would allow both companies to combine forces and expand into new areas of business. He said: "We will be able to offer our customers a wider range of services and expand into new regions and markets. This is an exciting time for both our companies and we look forward to working together to create a world-class water and waste management company."
Antoine Fr√©rot, the CEO of Veolia, a major rival to Suez, expressed his surprise at the announcement. He said his company was "watching the situation closely".
The merger could herald a new phase in France's industrial policy, with reports suggesting that it could lead to the creation of a national champion in the sector, with France positioning itself as a major force in the global water and waste management industry.
However, some analysts have expressed caution over the deal, suggesting that both companies will have to overcome a number of challenges in order to make the merger a success. They point out that there could be significant integration costs and uncertainty around how the two companies' cultures will merge.
Suez's share price rose by more than 5% following the announcement of the merger, while shares in Lyonnaise des Eaux SA were up by over 4%. Investors appear bullish on the deal, signalling their confidence in the two companies' ability to create a new global powerhouse in the water and waste management sector.
The merger has also raised questions about the future of the Suez Canal Company and its historical significance. Some commentators have suggested that the merger could spell the end of the company's independence and its status as a French national treasure. However, the Suez Canal Company has not yet commented on the merger and it is unclear what impact it will have on the future of the iconic waterway.
Overall, the merger promises to create a new chapter in the history of two of France's most important companies. It will be watched closely by the industry, investors, and policymakers around the world.
