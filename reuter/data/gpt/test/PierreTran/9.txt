Labour unions at Renault have called for a one-hour strike at all its plants in France, Belgium, and Spain in protest of the job cuts announced by the carmaker. The move is expected to affect production and logistics across the company.
The strike will last for an hour, from 11.30am to 12.30pm, local time. Workers at Renault plants are expected to participate in the strike, including those in Flins, Douai, Maubeuge, Dieppe, and Sandouville in France, as well as the factories in Valladolid and Palencia in Spain and Vilvoorde in Belgium.
The call for the strike by the unions comes after Renault announced that it would cut 15,000 jobs worldwide, including 4,600 in France, over the next three years. The plan is part of the company's efforts to save €2 billion ($2.3 billion) in costs and increase profitability.
Renault said in a statement that the job cuts would be "spread over three years and will concern all staff, managers, and executives, in all entities and in all countries." The company said it would offer voluntary departures and early retirement packages to achieve the workforce reduction.
The cuts have been met with opposition from unions, who have criticized the move as unfair and said it would lead to increased job insecurity and social hardship.
"Renault's current plans are totally inconsistent with the socially responsible approach it has been claiming since its foundation," a joint statement from five unions said. "The job cuts are unjustified and harmful to workers, and we will not accept them."
The unions have called on Renault to review its plan and consider alternatives that would allow the company to achieve its cost-saving targets without resorting to job cuts. They have also demanded that Renault maintain its commitment to invest €1 billion ($1.1 billion) in France in the coming years.
"This strike action is a reminder to Renault management that they must listen to their workers and the unions they have put in place to protect their rights," said Laurent Berger, secretary-general of the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT).
The strike comes amid growing unrest among French workers as the country faces a deepening economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The French government has launched a €100 billion ($110 billion) stimulus package to help the economy recover, but critics say it is insufficient to address the scale of the problem.
Renault, which is 15% owned by the French government, has been hit hard by the pandemic, which has disrupted global supply chains and led to a sharp drop in demand for cars. The company reported a net loss of €141 million ($160 million) for the first half of the year and has warned that the second half will be even tougher.
The job cuts are part of a wider restructuring plan announced by Renault in May, which also includes the phasing out of some models and the consolidation of its manufacturing operations. The company said it would focus on electric and hybrid vehicles, and reduce its production capacity by about 20%.
The plan has been welcomed by investors, who have pushed up Renault's share price since it was announced. But workers and unions have expressed concern that the restructuring is too focused on cost-cutting and not enough on securing the long-term future of the company.
The one-hour strike on Thursday is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Renault's operations, but it is a sign of the growing tension between the company and its workforce. It remains to be seen whether Renault will be able to find a compromise with the unions, or whether the protests will escalate into a more serious confrontation.
