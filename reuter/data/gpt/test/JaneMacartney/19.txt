China has accused the United States of interfering in its internal affairs after the US State Department released its annual human rights report.
The report by the US State Department noted that China’s human rights record had worsened significantly over the past year. The report also criticized China for its harsh repression of political dissent, intolerance of freedom of religion, mistreatment of minority groups, and abuses of human rights in prisons.
In response, China's foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said on Wednesday that the report "maliciously attacks China’s political system, social stability, and human rights situation" and "interferes in China's internal affairs, and China firmly opposes it."
The spokesman also accused the US of being hypocritical in its approach to human rights, pointing out that the US itself has failed to address its own human rights issues and claiming that the US has no right to judge other countries.
He further stated that the Chinese government is committed to protecting human rights and promoting social justice and that China's human rights situation "shows a clear trend of continuous improvement."
The US report highlighted a range of human rights issues in China, including the continued detention of political prisoners, restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly, and the suppression of religious and ethnic minorities such as Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.
The report also criticized China’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, stating that the Chinese government's initial response to the outbreak was marred by secrecy and lack of transparency, which contributed to the spread of the virus.
The report also highlighted the issue of Hong Kong, stating that "Beijing's imposition of the National Security Law on Hong Kong in 2020 sharply reduced the autonomy of Hong Kong and infringed on the civil and political rights of the people of Hong Kong."
The United States has been strongly critical of China's actions in Hong Kong, where Beijing has cracked down on pro-democracy protesters and tightened its grip on the city's political and legal systems.
Tensions between the US and China have been high for some time, and the issue of human rights has been a major point of contention between the two countries.
The US government has imposed a range of sanctions on Chinese officials and companies over human rights abuses in China, including the treatment of Uighur Muslims, while China has retaliated with its own sanctions on US officials.
The Chinese government has consistently denied allegations of human rights abuses, and has accused the US of spreading false information about China in an attempt to undermine the country's political system.
The US State Department report is expected to further strain relations between the two countries, which have already been marked by tensions over trade and technology, as well as geopolitical issues such as Taiwan and the South China Sea.
The international community has been closely following the situation in China, including the treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, and many human rights organizations have called for greater action to be taken to address the situation.
Despite the heated rhetoric between the US and China, it is hoped that both sides can work together to address human rights issues in China and find a way to move forward in a constructive manner.
