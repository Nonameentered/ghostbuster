In a move to tighten control on the media, China has issued new guidelines for journalists to promote patriotism and socialism while cracking down on straying from the party line. The guidelines, which were released by the Communist Party's central propaganda department and state media regulator on Monday, are the latest salvo in the government's ongoing effort to ensure news and information in the country are tightly controlled.
The guidelines require journalists to "take the people's standpoint" and "have a high degree of ideological consciousness," and to be guided by the principles of Marxism and socialism when reporting the news. They also call on journalists to "resolutely oppose and criticize mistaken opinions," and to "actively promote mainstream values."
Additionally, the guidelines call for enhanced supervision of journalists, stating that "media outlets should strengthen the management of their personnel, strictly investigate the political convictions of new employees and firmly prevent people who do not meet political standards from entering the media."
The move is seen as part of China's push to strengthen its information control regime, which has tightened under President Xi Jinping's tenure. The government has increased censorship and clamped down on dissent, both online and offline, under the guise of maintaining social stability.
In recent years, there have been several high-profile examples of media outlets straying from the party line, including a news anchor on state broadcaster CCTV who criticized Xi Jinping's speech on the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party and an editor at a state-run newspaper who wrote a scathing commentary on Xi's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The new guidelines are seen as an attempt to prevent such incidents from happening again, and to reinforce the party's control over the media.
Critics argue that the guidelines will further erode press freedom in the country and make it even more difficult for journalists to report on sensitive issues. China is already ranked 177th out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, and the new guidelines are likely to worsen its standing.
"This is just the latest attempt to further constrain the already limited space for press freedom in China," said CÃ©dric Alviani, East Asia bureau chief of Reporters Without Borders. "The move comes at a time when China's government is already engaged in a broad crackdown on dissenting voices, and it is likely to further undermine press freedom in the country."
Despite the criticism, the Chinese government has defended the guidelines, saying they are necessary to maintain stability and promote the "correct" socialist values.
"The guidelines are designed to further strengthen the party's leadership over the media, promote socialist core values, and maintain social stability," said Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The guidelines also call on journalists to "actively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," which is a key objective of Xi's administration. Under Xi's leadership, China has sought to bolster its global influence and promote its own model of governance, which combines authoritarian rule with economic growth.
The move to tighten control over the media is part of this effort to project China's influence abroad and promote its own narrative on key issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and human rights.
However, the guidelines are likely to face opposition from within the media industry, with some journalists already expressing concerns about the impact on their work.
"It's definitely going to have a chilling effect on what we can report," said one journalist who works for a state-run media outlet, speaking on condition of anonymity. "We already have to deal with a lot of censorship and self-censorship, and this is only going to make it more difficult."
The guidelines are also likely to exacerbate the tensions between China and the United States, which have been escalating in recent years over issues such as trade, technology, and human rights.
In recent months, the US government has taken a tougher stance on China's information control regime, sanctioning companies and individuals involved in internet censorship and launching a campaign to counter China's "disinformation and propaganda" efforts.
The new guidelines are likely to add fuel to the fire and increase scrutiny of China's media practices. However, it remains to be seen whether they will be effective in ensuring tighter control over the media or only further undermine press freedom in the country.
