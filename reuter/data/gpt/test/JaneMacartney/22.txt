In a move that has sent shockwaves across the literary world, China's most prominent living author, Yan Lianke, has become the latest target of the Communist Party's ongoing power struggle.
Yan Lianke, the author of numerous books and recipient of a plethora of literary awards, including the Franz Kafka Prize and the Mao Dun Literature Prize, is widely regarded as one of China's most influential writers. However, his recent work has put him at odds with the ruling Communist Party, which has accused him of promoting "Western liberalism" and "unpatriotic" values.
The beginning of Yan's troubles can be traced back to the publication of his novel "The Day the Sun Died" in 2017. The book, which tells the story of a young man's encounter with a mysterious underworld where people relinquish their memories, was banned by Chinese authorities for its "inappropriate and vulgar language."
Despite the ban, Yan continued to speak out against censorship and state control over the arts. In a scathing essay published in The New York Times in October, Yan accused the Communist Party of suppressing creative expression. "The arts and literature in China have been silenced and subjugated to serve the state," he wrote.
In response, the Chinese government increased its efforts to silence Yan and other intellectuals who criticized its policies. In November, Yan's latest book, "Three Brothers," was pulled from the shelves of major bookstores in Shanghai and Beijing. The move sparked an outcry from literary circles, with many denouncing it as an attempt to stifle free speech.
Now, Yan's troubles have escalated further, with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism announcing that it has revoked his publishing license. The ministry accused Yan of "smearing the image of the country" and "violating publishing regulations."
The announcement has been met with condemnation from human rights groups and literary organizations around the world. PEN America, which advocates for freedom of expression and supports writers at risk, released a statement denouncing the decision. "This bans sets a dangerous precedent for Chinese writers and publishers, who will now fear that they too can be censored or punished for exercising their right to free expression," the statement read.
The move against Yan is the latest in a series of crackdowns against intellectuals and activists in China. Earlier this year, prominent human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng was sentenced to four years in prison for "inciting subversion of state power." And in March, the government announced the elimination of presidential term limits, effectively making President Xi Jinping president for life.
Critics argue that President Xi's consolidation of power has come at the expense of civil liberties and human rights. Under his leadership, the government has cracked down on dissent, tightened control over the media, and increased its surveillance of citizens.
The targeting of Yan Lianke is seen as a continuation of this trend, with analysts suggesting that it is an attempt by the Communist Party to further cement its control over the arts and culture. "Yan is a threat to the party because he challenges its authority and undermines its propaganda," says Qiao Mu, a former journalism professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University. "By silencing him, they are sending a message to other writers and intellectuals that they too should toe the party line."
Despite the government's efforts to silence him, Yan remains committed to writing and speaking out against censorship and repression. In a recent interview with The Guardian, he declared: "I will continue writing as long as I have a breath in my body. I will keep telling the truth, however difficult it may be."
Yan's resolute stance has inspired other writers and activists to speak out against the government's censorship and suppression of free speech. "Yan Lianke is a beacon of hope for everyone who believes in freedom of expression," says Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese writer and Nobel Peace Prize laureate currently in exile in Germany. "His bravery in the face of adversity is an inspiration to us all."
