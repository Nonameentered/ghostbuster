Thirty-eight years ago, Deng Xiaoping made a bold move that would change the course of China's history - he embarked on what came to be known as the Southern Tour.
In 1992, China was still reeling from the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution and was struggling to uplift its economy. Deng Xiaoping, who was now an octogenarian retired politician, saw the need for a drastic change in the country's economic policies.
Deng held a series of meetings with Chinese officials during the Southern Tour, where he advocated for economic reform, urging the country to embrace a market economy. This trip, which covered Guangdong, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai, acted as a turning point for China, kickstarting its economic boom.
The Southern Tour was not just a trip but also a powerful message to the entire nation. Deng Xiaoping knew how important his message was, and he was about to change the course of history. It was only after Mao's passing in 1976 and the end of the Cultural Revolution that Deng Xiaoping could start fully revealing his economic vision.
The Southern Tour started in January 1992, and it is considered to be the most significant trip in the history of modern China. For ten days, Deng made a series of speeches and visits to factories and farms. He praised the people of Guangdong for their work and urged them to embrace economic reforms.
During the tour, Deng emphasized the importance of "economic zones" — special localities with higher autonomy and faster approvals for private companies. These regions would follow a market-oriented economic system instead of a centrally planned one, allowing the private sector to flourish.
The leadership's endorsement of zones and "opening up" had far-reaching implications. It replaced mixed ownership with a clearer separation between public and private sectors. It channeled capital, both foreign and domestic, towards more productive uses.
Deng's southern tour had several objectives. He sought to advance the reforms that had begun in the late 1970s, enhance the cohesiveness of the central leadership, promote political stability, and underwrite social order while reinforcing his vital role as China's "paramount leader."
Deng wanted to showcase not only his support for reform but also his control over it. While he made clear his commitment to economic reform, Deng also reaffirmed that the Communist party's political control would remain unchallenged.
This trip marked a new era in China's history with the creation of the first economic zone - Shenzhen, which later became China's first Special Economic Zone (SEZ), sparking industries such as electronics, garments, and furniture. Deng Xiaoping's 'open-door' policy allowed access to global markets, and foreign direct investment flowed into the targeted SEZs. As a result, China's economy grew exponentially from that point onwards.
The markets began to be gradually liberalized, and an export-oriented regime was set up, with the government allowing foreign investments in wholesale markets, and real estate, as well as exports. Deng also established policies to promote technology development and innovation in the country.
When people who were not aligned with Deng's beliefs tried to interfere with the Southern Tour — including the country's then-paramount leader, Yang Shangkun — Deng stood his ground and fought to maintain his vision of China's economic future. His opposition did not deter him.
Following Deng's southern tour, a series of legal and regulatory reforms were initiated, paving the way for economic liberalization. These changes allowed China to become more integrated with the global economy, and over time, China transformed itself into the world's second-biggest economy.
The success of the Southern Tour and Xi Jinping's current administration have led to a renewed focus on Deng's economic philosophy. The current Chinese leadership continues to emphasize the importance of maintaining economic stability while promoting economic growth through innovation and investment. Jinping's administration seeks to re-energize economic reform while maintaining a strong degree of central control.
In conclusion, Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour set the stage for China's remarkable economic growth, transforming it into the economic powerhouse that it is today. Deng's vision of economic reform and his push towards market-oriented policies is a testament to his unwavering belief in China's economic potential and has provided the country with the foundation for its continued development. His legacy has shaped China's economic policies that continue to drive the country's prosperity, and his vision will continue to guide China towards a prosperous future.
