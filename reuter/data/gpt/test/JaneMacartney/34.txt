BEIJING, CHINA - China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping passed away on February 19, at the age of 93 in Beijing. Deng was widely considered to be one of the most influential politicians and leaders of China, having served as the country's Chairman of the Central Military Commission and as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.
Born in 1904 in Guang'an, Sichuan Province, Deng joined the Communist Party of China in 1927 and was part of the legendary Long March led by Mao Zedong. Deng was a devoted follower of Mao, but his relationship with him was rocky, as he was purged from the party during the Cultural Revolution. Deng later emerged as a key supporter of market-oriented economic reforms, which transformed the Chinese economy into the global behemoth that it is today.
Deng is credited with ushering in a slew of economic reforms that transformed China's economy from a planned, agriculture-based market into one of the world's major manufacturing hubs. Deng had a relentless focus on modernizing China and building its economy through reform and opening up to international trade. He is famous for his adage "It doesn't matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice," which supporters say captures his pragmatic approach to economic development.
Deng's market-oriented reforms pushed China towards a more capitalist, free-market economy, which served as a model for other developing nations. Foreign investment flooded into China, and the country quickly became a hub for low-cost manufacturing of products ranging from shoes to electronics. Deng's economic policies transformed China from a poor, underdeveloped nation into a global superpower, with the world's second-largest economy and a dominant player in international trade.
However, Deng's legacy is not without controversy. His reforms led to growing inequality within China, with a significant gap appearing between the urban and rural areas. The country also faced criticism for its treatment of political dissidents, as well as ethnic and religious minorities.
Deng's legacy continues to shape China's economy and politics today. The current leadership of China remains committed to economic liberalization, although they continue to control dissent and maintain a firm grip on political power. Deng's pragmatic approach to economic development remains widely celebrated, but critics say his legacy is tarnished by authoritarianism and human rights abuses.
Deng was a towering figure in Chinese history and his death marks the end of an era. Flags across China flew at half-mast, and millions of citizens mourned the passing of the authoritarian leader. A state funeral was held in Beijing, attended by senior leaders from across China and the world. Xi Jinping, China's current leader, delivered a eulogy, lauding Deng's contributions to the country's development and hailing him as a great strategist.
"He was the chief architect of China's reform and opening-up," said Xi. "His contributions will never be forgotten, and his spirit will always guide us forward."
Deng's passing has sent shockwaves across China's political landscape. His influence was felt throughout the country's politics, economics and society, and his passing marks the end of an era. Deng will be remembered as a visionary, forward-thinking leader who pushed China towards economic modernization and prosperity. But his legacy is also complicated by his support for authoritarianism and his role in human rights abuses. As China continues to grapple with its complicated history and push towards further economic and political development, Deng's legacy remains both a source of inspiration and a subject of criticism.
