Beijing - In the heart of the city's Xicheng District, a young Living Buddha spends his days studying and playing, while carrying the weight of expectations and tradition on his shoulders.
Born in the Tibetan Autonomous Region in 2006, the young boy was identified as a reincarnation of a revered Tibetan Buddhist Lama by the Chinese Government, who then saw to his training as a Living Buddha. Famously known as Gyaincain Norbu, the chosen Living Buddha is now said to be "flourishing" as he continues to carry out his spiritual duties in Beijing.
Despite this, Gyaincain Norbu still retains his childlike innocence and love for playfulness, with his caretakers reporting that he spends his free time playing table tennis, reading, and watching cartoons. Despite the fact that his work as a Living Buddha can be demanding at times, his caretakers have emphasized the boy's joyous temperament and eagerness to learn.
As one of only six Chinese government-recognized Living Buddhas in the world, Gyaincain Norbu is expected to act as an ambassador of Tibetan Buddhism in China, traveling to account for the faith's presence in the country. His role, from accounts, has been crucial in building bridges between China and Tibet, a historically fractious relationship.
The Chinese Government's selection of Gyaincain Norbu has been a polarizing decision, with some Tibetan activists accusing the authorities of meddling in religious affairs and questioning the legitimacy of his selection. But the young Living Buddha seems undeterred, stating that he is "honored" to have been chosen and that he will do his best to fulfill his role.
The Chinese Government has justified its involvement in the selection of a Living Buddha by citing the tradition of "Golden Urns," where the names of potential reincarnating Lamas are placed in a golden urn and selected by a child, who is said to be a manifestation of the Buddha. Critics, however, have characterized this practice as one of Beijing's many tactics to extend its control over Tibet and sideline traditional Tibetan Buddhism.
Regardless, Gyaincain Norbu's selection appears to have provided some respite for tensions between China and Tibet. The young boy's caretakers have emphasized his peaceful nature and his commitment to promoting the tenets of Tibetan Buddhism in China.
With the Chinese Government's plans to revamp the religion as part of its larger crackdown on faith and ethnicity, the selection of a Living Buddha has been seen by some as a way to burnish China's credentials as a protector and promoter of religious diversity. Whether the decision will be accepted by the larger Tibetan community, however, remains to be seen.
For now, Gyaincain Norbu spends his days in Beijing, studying, playing, and spreading the message of peace and harmony that is central to Tibetan Buddhism. Whether his role as Living Buddha will help bring about a greater understanding between China and Tibet is still uncertain, but his presence is, at the very least, a hopeful signal that young and innocent minds can lead the way towards a more tolerant and understanding future.
