The funeral of the legendary Chinese statesman and Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping took place in Beijing earlier this morning, but one notable figure was conspicuously absent from the proceedings. Zhao Ziyang, the former general secretary of the Communist Party and a close ally of Deng's during the 1980s, was not granted permission to attend the ceremony by the Chinese government.
Zhao, who has been under house arrest since the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, remains a controversial figure in China. Despite being a key architect of the country's economic reforms and modernization during the 1980s, he fell out of favor with the government after publicly advocating for greater political liberalization. He was dismissed from his position as general secretary in 1989 by hardline Communist Party leaders who opposed his more reformist agenda.
Since his removal from power, Zhao has remained largely out of the public eye, although he has occasionally resurfaced to criticize the Communist government's policies. In recent years, however, authorities have tightened their control over Zhao, placing him under strict house arrest and limiting his access to the outside world.
In light of Deng Xiaoping's passing, many political observers had hoped that Zhao would be granted permission to attend the funeral as a gesture of reconciliation and respect. However, these hopes were quashed when it was announced that Zhao had been denied permission to travel to Beijing.
The Chinese government has not commented on the decision to exclude Zhao from the funeral, but many analysts speculate that it reflects the Communist Party's continued unease with his legacy. Despite being rehabilitated by the government in the early 2000s, Zhao remains a controversial figure in Chinese politics, with many hardline officials viewing him as a symbol of the more liberal and reformist elements that they oppose.
The decision to exclude Zhao from the funeral has sparked criticism from both domestic and international observers. Many Chinese citizens have taken to social media to express their disappointment, with some calling the move "petty" and "vindictive." International human rights groups have also decried the decision as a violation of Zhao's basic human rights.
"This is a sad and shameful day for China," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "Denying a former leader the right to pay his respects at the funeral of a former colleague is a petty and vindictive act, and one that reveals the Communist Party's continued intolerance of dissenting voices."
Despite this criticism, it remains unclear whether the Chinese government will change its position and allow Zhao to attend the funeral in the future. For now, it seems that the Communist Party's unease with his legacy will continue to influence its decisions regarding his treatment and status.
With Deng Xiaoping's death marking the end of an era in Chinese politics, many are left wondering what the future holds for the country as it continues to grapple with issues of political and economic reform. The exclusion of Zhao Ziyang from the funeral is a stark reminder of the challenges and complexities that lie ahead.
