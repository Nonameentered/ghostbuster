In a startling admission that is sure to raise eyebrows both in China and abroad, China's President Jiang Zemin has promised to surpass former leader Deng Xiaoping in capitalist-style reforms. Speaking in Beijing on Monday to a group of business leaders, Zemin pledged to extend the market-oriented economic reforms that have transformed China into a global powerhouse over the past three decades.
"Under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping, China achieved great success in its capitalist-style economic reform, but we must not rest on our laurels," Zemin declared. "We must continue to deepen our reforms and surpass Deng Xiaoping's achievements."
The statement marks a significant shift in tone for the Chinese government, which has traditionally been reluctant to openly discuss its embrace of capitalist practices. For years, the ruling Communist Party has promoted a more nationalist, state-centric approach to economic development, emphasizing the importance of state-owned enterprises and centralized planning.
But Zemin's comments suggest that the government is now willing to embrace a more market-oriented approach, as it seeks to keep pace with the fast-changing global economy. In recent years, China has faced growing competition from other emerging economies, particularly India and Brazil, which have implemented their own liberalization policies.
"China needs to continue to adapt to the changing global economic conditions," Zemin told reporters. "We must be bold in our reforms and unafraid to take risks."
While Zemin did not offer specifics on what new reforms he might pursue, the speech was seen as a signal that the government will be more open to foreign investment and more willing to privatize state-owned enterprises. It could also mean a push to open up China's financial sector, which has been tightly controlled for years.
Indeed, many economists have long argued that China's state-owned enterprises represent a drag on the country's economic growth, as they are often inefficient and corrupt. Privatization, they argue, could help to inject more competition and efficiency into the sector.
"State-owned enterprises have long been a source of inefficiency in China," says Xinhua Wang, an economist at the London School of Economics. "By opening up to the private sector, China can help to unleash a more dynamic, innovative economy."
At the same time, Zemin's comments reflect a growing recognition among China's leaders that the country's economic model must evolve if it is to continue to thrive in the coming years. With slowing growth rates and mounting social tensions, the government faces increasing pressure to deliver reforms that benefit ordinary citizens.
In recent years, Chinese officials have taken steps to address some of the country's more vexing economic challenges, such as pollution and corruption. But many observers say that more needs to be done to address the root causes of China's economic challenges, such as the lack of a robust social safety net and the growing wealth gap between urban and rural residents.
"China's economic reforms have yielded tremendous benefits for the Chinese people, but there are still many challenges to be addressed," says Yi Zheng, a senior economist at the World Bank. "If China can continue to push forward with bold, market-oriented reforms, it can help to build a more inclusive, prosperous society."
Whether Zemin can deliver on his promise to surpass Deng Xiaoping remains to be seen. While the former leader is widely credited with kick-starting China's economic transformation, he was also a shrewd political strategist who carefully balanced the country's competing interests. Zemin, by contrast, has been criticized for his lack of vision and overreliance on bureaucratic processes.
Nonetheless, Zemin's pledge to take on Deng Xiaoping's mantle is a bold and potentially transformative move. If he can follow through with meaningful reforms, he could set China on a new path that could help it to navigate the challenges of the 21st century.
