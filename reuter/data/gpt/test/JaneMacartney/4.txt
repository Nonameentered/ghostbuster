In the midst of rising tensions between China and the United States, China has urged the U.S. to grant permanent Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status, despite doubts over its promises regarding Hong Kong's autonomy.
MFN status, which was granted to China in 2001, allows China to enjoy the lowest possible tariff rates on exports to the United States. The status is granted on an annual basis and is subject to renewal each year by the U.S. government.
China has been pushing for permanent MFN status for several years, arguing that it would help create a stable and predictable business environment for Chinese companies operating in the United States. However, the issue has become increasingly controversial in light of China’s recent actions in Hong Kong, where Beijing’s imposition of a national security law has significantly eroded the region’s freedom and autonomy.
The U.S. government has expressed concerns over China’s actions in Hong Kong, with President Joe Biden stating that the U.S. would respond if China continued to undermine Hong Kong’s freedom and autonomy. Some lawmakers in the U.S. have also called for a review of China’s MFN status in light of Beijing’s actions in Hong Kong.
In response to these concerns, China has urged the U.S. to maintain its commitment to international trade rules and grant permanent MFN status. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian stated on Monday that "Chinese and American trade will bring benefits to both countries. It is in everyone's interest to maintain healthy and stable trade relations. We hope the US can maintain its commitment to international trade rules and create a predictable and stable business environment for Chinese companies operating in the US."
China has also sought to reassure the U.S. that its actions in Hong Kong do not violate its promises to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy under the "one country, two systems" framework. However, the U.S. has remained skeptical of China's claims, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken stating that "We will continue to stand up for human rights and democratic values, including in Hong Kong."
Despite these doubts, China remains optimistic that it will be able to maintain its MFN status with the United States. Analysts point out that while the U.S. may express concern over China's actions in Hong Kong, it is unlikely to take any significant action that would jeopardize its trade relationship with China.
"Trade with China is simply too important for the United States," said John Smith, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. "While the U.S. may express concerns over China's actions in Hong Kong, it is unlikely to take any steps that would significantly impact its economic relationship with China. Ultimately, the U.S. will likely renew China's MFN status, but with some conditions attached."
As the debate over China's MFN status continues, both sides are likely to remain engaged in a delicate balancing act. On the one hand, the U.S. will want to maintain pressure on China to respect human rights and democratic values. On the other hand, China will want to maintain its access to the U.S. market and avoid any actions that would threaten its economic interests.
