China's President Jiang Zemin Vows to Push Forward Deng's Reforms in Public Speech Since His Death
China's President Jiang Zemin delivered a public speech on Monday, vowing to push forward the economic reforms that were initiated by Deng Xiaoping, considered the architect of China's modernization, who passed away on February 19, 1997. The speech, which was delivered at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, marked the 20th anniversary of Deng's death.
Jiang, who was China's president from 1993 to 2003, was himself instrumental in implementing Deng's reforms during his tenure. In his speech, he praised Deng's efforts to modernize China's economy and society, and stressed the need for the country to continue down the path of reform and opening up.
"Deng Xiaoping's ideas and theories regarding reform and opening up are profound and far-reaching, and they still carry great significance for us today," Jiang said. "We must stay true to Deng's path, uphold his vision and principles, and continue to push forward with reform and opening up."
Jiang's speech came amidst a backdrop of mounting economic and political pressures in China. The country's growth rate has slowed in recent years, while its political system has faced growing criticism for its lack of transparency and accountability. Jiang acknowledged these challenges, but argued that they were not insurmountable.
"We are facing a new and complex set of challenges, both domestically and internationally," he said. "But we must be confident in our abilities to overcome them. We have the support of the Chinese people, and we have the strength of our economic and political systems. We must use these strengths to drive us forward."
Jiang also addressed the issue of corruption, which has been a major source of public discontent in China. He acknowledged that corruption was a serious problem, but argued that it was not unique to China. He urged the government to continue its efforts to crack down on corrupt officials, and to strengthen the rule of law in order to prevent future abuses of power.
"Corruption is a cancer that eats away at the trust between the people and the government," he said. "We must continue to fight it with the full force of the law, and we must work to create a system that is transparent and accountable to the people."
Jiang's speech was well-received by many in China, who saw it as a reaffirmation of the country's commitment to reform and modernization. However, others were more skeptical, arguing that China's political system was in need of deeper reform in order to address the country's underlying social and economic problems.
"Jiang's speech was a reminder of the tremendous progress that China has made over the past few decades," said Cheng Li, Director of the China Center at the Brookings Institution. "But it also highlighted the challenges that still lie ahead. China needs to move beyond its current political system in order to address the root causes of its social and economic problems."
Despite these challenges, Jiang's speech was a reminder of the resilience of China's political and economic system, and the country's determination to continue down the path of reform and modernization.
