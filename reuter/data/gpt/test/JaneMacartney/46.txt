Beijing, China - Former Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, has made a bold statement, asserting that he will surpass his mentor, Deng Xiaoping, in terms of political reform and economic development in China.
In a rare public appearance, Jiang made the statement at a seminar on the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up, which marked the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's era of modernization and economic liberalization.
"Although I am Deng Xiaoping's student and have always regarded him as my mentor, I am determined to outperform him," Jiang said.
The statement comes amidst speculation about Jiang's influence and role in current Chinese politics. Jiang, who is now 92 years old, has been out of power for over 15 years, but his shadowy presence is still felt in the Chinese political landscape. Some analysts believe that Jiang still has a significant influence on Chinaâ€™s current leadership, including President Xi Jinping.
The statement could also be seen as a move to counter Xi Jinping's efforts to promote himself as the new leader of China's economic reform. Xi has been stressing the importance of "deepening reform" and "winning the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" in recent months, which has led some experts to speculate that he is trying to take credit for China's economic achievements.
Jiang's statement, therefore, seems to be aimed at re-establishing his own legacy as a key figure in China's economic and political development.
Jiang's tenure, which lasted from 1989 to 2002, was marked by significant economic growth and political stability. During his time in office, Jiang oversaw major reforms that transformed China's economy into the world's second-largest.
Jiang's statement, therefore, is likely to be welcomed by those who believe that he played a key role in China's development. However, it has also been met with criticism from those who question his legacy.
Some analysts have pointed out that Jiang's time in power was also marked by political repression and human rights abuses. During his tenure, Jiang oversaw the crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement and the imposition of strict censorship controls on the media.
Critics have accused Jiang of trying to whitewash his legacy and overlook his authoritarian tendencies. They argue that his statement is an attempt to deflect attention away from the darker aspects of his leadership and portray himself as a hero of China's economic rise.
Despite the controversy surrounding Jiang's statement, it has raised important questions about the legacy of China's leaders and the direction of its economic and political future.
With Xi Jinping firmly in control of China's government, it remains to be seen how Jiang's statement and legacy will shape the country's future course. Some experts believe that Jiang's influence could be an obstacle to Xi's vision of reform, while others argue that his role is overstated and that Xi is more focused on his own agenda.
Regardless of its impact, Jiang's statement is a reminder of the power and legacy of China's past leaders, and the lasting impact they have on the country's future.
As China celebrates 40 years of economic liberalization and reform, the debate over which leader deserves credit for its success will continue to shape China's political and social landscape. Jiang's statement is unlikely to settle the argument, but it will certainly ensure that the legacy of Deng Xiaoping and his successors remains a topic of discussion for years to come.
