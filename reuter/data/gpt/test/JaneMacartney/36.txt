The health condition of China’s late paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, has become a topic of secrecy among the Chinese Communist Party leaders, who are concerned that any disclosure of the ailments of the leader who transformed China economically for almost two decades could cause a power struggle.
Deng Xiaoping, who led China between 1978 and 1992, is regarded as the country's most successful leader after Mao Zedong. His economic liberalization reforms lifted millions of Chinese from poverty and made China the world's second-largest economy. Deng passed away in 1997 at the age of 92.
Since then, Deng has remained a beloved figure in China. But his health condition has become a topic of discussion in recent years. The ruling party is reluctant to discuss his ill-health over fears that the news could spark a power struggle and instability within the party, which has never experienced a leadership transfer.
Reports indicate that Deng Xiaoping’s health has become a topic of concern for the ruling party, particularly since President Xi Jinping became China's leader in 2012. Deng’s political ideas were instrumental in the rise of China’s market economy, but his philosophy of "reform and opening up" is believed to be at odds with Xi's “China Dream” policy, which emphasizes the country's great power status.
The Chinese Communist Party leaders are shrouding Deng’s health condition in secrecy, and there hasn’t been any update about the health of the late paramount leader. Some analysts believe that the Chinese leader’s condition could be indicative of a power struggle between Xi's administration and those loyal to Deng's ideas.
According to some reports, Deng Xiaoping has been unwell since 1994 when he was last seen in public. Since then, there have been reports of Deng undergoing medical treatment in hospitals. However, the details of his health condition remain unknown.
Despite the secrecy, some officials have hinted that Deng Xiaoping's health is worsening, and they fear that this could destabilize China's leadership. Deng’s legacy is highly revered among the Communist Party as he is the architect of China’s modernization and economic success.
However, tensions are believed to be simmering between those who support Xi Jinping’s administration and those who adhere to the Deng's "reform and opening up" ideology. Analysts believe that the power struggle has been unfolding behind closed doors for some time now.
China's economic reforms have been the subject of much debate in recent years. Some believe Xi Jinping's "China Dream" policy is a way of consolidating power while stifling economic liberalization. Nevertheless, Deng's approach to economic reforms still resonates with many Chinese people.
The Communist Party has always been cautious about the sensitive issue of leadership succession, but the lack of information about Deng's health raises more questions than answers. There are concerns that the silence could heighten the power struggle and lead to political instability in China.
In conclusion, the health condition of Deng Xiaoping, the great Chinese revolutionary leader, remains shrouded in secrecy. The Communist Party is wary of disclosing the health condition of the late supreme leader for fear of a power struggle. There are concerns that Deng's health could cause instability in the party, leading to political turbulence. Nevertheless, Deng's legacy still resonates with many Chinese people.
