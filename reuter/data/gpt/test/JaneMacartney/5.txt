China has urged the United States to grant it permanent Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) trading status, despite concerns over the ongoing political and human rights issues in Hong Kong.
The call for permanent MFN status was made by China’s Foreign Ministry in response to recent comments by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who reiterated concerns over the Chinese government’s crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.
“The United States urges China to respect the human rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, and to fulfill its obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law,” Pompeo said in a statement.
The U.S. Secretary also warned that new U.S. trade negotiations with China would be contingent on China’s response to these issues.
China, however, has called the urgency of permanent MFN status for these negotiations, claiming that the status is vital to the stability of global trade, and that any disruption to trade relations would have a negative impact on both the U.S. and China.
According to a statement by China’s Foreign Ministry, the U.S. is “blatantly interfering in China’s internal affairs and trying to damage China’s core interests.”
The statement also accused the U.S. of “ignoring the facts and turning a blind eye to the violent crimes committed by the radical separatist forces in Hong Kong.”
China has been criticized for its handling of the protests in Hong Kong, which began in June 2019 in response to an extradition bill that would have allowed China to extradite Hong Kong citizens accused of crimes to the mainland.
Protestors have called for greater political freedom and democratic autonomy for the island city-state, which has been under Chinese rule since 1997 but has a separate legal system and government.
The Chinese government has responded with a heavy-handed approach, including the deployment of police and military forces, mass arrests, censorship, and the passing of new security laws that criminalize dissent and opposition to Chinese rule.
The United States has condemned China’s actions in Hong Kong, and has imposed economic sanctions on Chinese officials and companies involved in the crackdown.
China has responded with retaliatory measures, including the suspension of U.S. military aid to Hong Kong, and restrictions on U.S. journalists.
Despite the tensions, trade relations between the U.S. and China have continued, with the signing of a Phase One trade agreement in January 2020 that called for increased Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and services.
However, the COVID-19 pandemic has added new strains to the relationship, with President Trump blaming China for the spread of the virus and threatening to impose new tariffs.
China has denied responsibility for the virus, and accused the U.S. of politicizing the issue for political gain.
Experts say that granting China permanent MFN trading status would have significant benefits for both countries, including increased trade, investment, and economic growth.
However, some also point out that the U.S. may be hesitant to grant the status given China’s human rights record and its actions in Hong Kong, and that any agreement could be interdependent on progress in these areas.
“There is a tradeoff between economic considerations and political and security concerns,” said Zhu Feng, a professor at Nanjing University. “If the U.S. decides to act to link human rights to trade, that would be a major shift.”
Despite the challenges, China remains hopeful that it can secure the status, which would make it a permanent member of the World Trade Organization and eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade.
“This is a matter of principle and justice,” said Wang Wenbin, spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry. “We hope that the U.S. will respect China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests.”
