Beijing, China - As the health of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping deteriorates, top leaders of China have rushed back to Beijing, in what sources say is a clear indication that political tensions in the country could be rising.
Officials in Beijing have been closely monitoring the condition of Deng Xiaoping, the architect of modern China's economic rise, whose ailing health has sparked fears of political uncertainty. Deng, who died in 1997, is hailed as one of China's greatest leaders, credited with implementing economic reforms that helped lift the country out of poverty.
According to sources, a number of top officials, including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, have abruptly canceled their trips out of Beijing, signaling an increasing sense of urgency.
"Leaders are rushing back to Beijing because they do not want to be caught off-guard," said Chang Ping, a political commentator.
"Any deterioration in Deng Xiaoping's health could shake up the political scene in China, and officials are taking no chances."
Deng has been a figurehead in Chinese politics for decades, serving as China's top leader from 1978 until his retirement in 1992. He is credited with spearheading economic reforms that transformed China into a global economic powerhouse and laid the foundation for its rise as a superpower.
But his health has been in decline for some time, and reports suggest that he has been battling a range of illnesses in recent years. The government has refused to provide any official updates on his health, fueling speculation about his condition.
Rumors about Deng's health first began circulating in the media in late October when he failed to attend a key meeting of the Communist Party. Officials have since been tight-lipped about his whereabouts, sparking concerns that his condition has taken a turn for the worse.
The sudden flurry of activity in Beijing comes as China is grappling with a range of political and economic challenges. The country is grappling with slowing growth and rising debt levels, while ongoing tensions with the US have sparked concerns about a new Cold War.
"China is facing a lot of economic and political turbulence, and the health of Deng Xiaoping is just one more thing to add to the mix," said Jiang Yuan, a political analyst.
"Officials are preparing for the worst-case scenario, which could include rising political tensions and instability in the country."
Some experts suggest that Deng's health battles could spark a leadership crisis in China, as officials struggle to manage the political fallout of his passing.
"China is facing a period of intense uncertainty, and the death of Deng Xiaoping could lead to a political vacuum," said Tom Orlik, a Bloomberg economist.
"Officials will be hoping to shore up support and consolidate power ahead of what could be a challenging period for the Chinese economy and its political system."
Despite the concerns, officials in Beijing have sought to downplay any speculation about Deng's health, insisting that he is still alive and receiving medical care.
But with little information available about his condition, officials are continuing to monitor the situation closely, readying themselves for any eventuality.
"The mood in Beijing is tense," said Ping.
"China's top leaders know that they have to be prepared for anything, and they're not taking any chances."
