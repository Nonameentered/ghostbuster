First Leisure Corp Plc, the UK-based leisure and entertainment company, has reported a 5% decline in profits in the first half of the year, due to poor performance in its bingo division. The company, which operates a chain of bingo halls across the UK, saw a drop in attendance and revenue in the face of increased competition from online gaming.
In its interim financial report released on Tuesday, First Leisure Corp Plc reported pretax profits of £25.5m for the six months to the end of June, down from £26.9m in the same period last year. The decline was attributed to a 10% fall in revenue from its bingo halls, which generated £79.8m compared to £88.6m in H1 2019.
The company said that the decline was driven by a fall in attendance at its bingo halls, which was down by 7% compared to last year. It also cited increased competition from online gaming and the proliferation of alternative leisure activities as contributing factors.
"Despite the challenging environment, we delivered a solid performance in the first half of the year, with growth in other areas of our business offsetting the decline in our bingo operations," said First Leisure Corp Plc CEO, John Smith. "We remain committed to our strategy of diversification and innovation, and are confident that we can continue to grow our business in the face of the changing leisure landscape."
The company said that it had taken steps to address the decline in its bingo division, including investing in new technology and improving the customer experience. It also signaled its intention to continue to diversify its business, citing its recent acquisition of a chain of escape rooms as an example of its commitment to exploring new opportunities.
"We are constantly looking for new ways to engage with our customers and provide them with exciting and innovative leisure experiences," said Smith. "Our acquisition of the escape room chain is just one example of the steps we are taking to diversify our business and stay ahead of the curve."
Despite the decline in profits, First Leisure Corp Plc's overall revenue for the first half of the year was up by 2% to £305.6m, compared to £299.7m in the same period last year. The company's other divisions, which include a chain of cinemas, a fitness center, and a gaming center, all saw growth in revenue.
The company's gaming center division, which includes slot machines and other electronic games, was the standout performer, with revenue growth of 8% compared to last year. The fitness center division also saw growth, with revenue up by 5%, while the cinema division saw a more modest increase of 2%.
"The growth in our other divisions demonstrates the strength and diversity of our business," said Smith. "We are proud of the progress we have made in the first half of the year, and remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth."
Despite the company's overall performance, investors reacted negatively to the news of the decline in profits, with First Leisure Corp Plc's share price falling by 4% in early trading on Wednesday. However, some analysts remained bullish on the company's prospects, citing its commitment to diversification and innovation as key strengths.
"While the decline in profits is certainly a setback, we believe that First Leisure Corp Plc remains well-positioned to navigate the challenges facing the leisure industry," said analyst Maria Rodriguez. "The company's focus on innovation and diversification should help to mitigate the impact of increased competition from online gaming and other leisure alternatives."
