Cable & Wireless Communications (CWC) has announced plans to float its 14.7% stake in London and New York. The decision has come after the company was acquired by Liberty Global in March 2016. CWC, one of the biggest cable and telecom operators in the Caribbean and Latin America, will sell 457.8 million shares priced at 45p each, or $571m, to institutional investors.
CWC has been building its business in the Caribbean and the Americas for more than a century, with a presence in 42 countries. They operate under the banner of Liberty Latin America, which has an extensive fibre-optic network running undersea cables from Florida to Brazil, as well as up through the Caribbean islands. The company serves around 5.4 million video, broadband, voice, and mobile customers. They also provide B2B services to corporate clients.
The decision to float the stake comes as CWC looks to raise funds to invest in its business. This is in line with Liberty Global's strategy, to create leading communications companies in the Americas and Europe, by investing in high-growth markets and ensuring customer loyalty through continuous innovation and improving customer service.
Under the deal, CWC has agreed to pay 85% of the net proceeds to regional subsidiaries, which will use the funds to invest in new technologies and infrastructure to strengthen their local operations. The remaining 15% will be kept at the holding company level to invest in other growth opportunities.
The flotation is part of an ongoing series of strategic moves by Liberty Global since the acquisition of CWC. In May, they merged their European operations with Vodafone, in a â‚¬19bn deal, creating what Liberty Global's CEO, Mike Fries, called "the ultimate converged communications provider." The merger brought together Vodafone's mobile and fixed broadband networks and Liberty's extensive cable network, which operates in 11 European countries.
The share sale is also a boon for institutional investors looking to invest in emerging markets with strong growth potential. The IPO has already attracted interest from a variety of global investors, including Nomura Securities, and Morgan Stanley.
"Investing in CWC can provide an excellent opportunity to participate in the growth story of one of the largest telecommunications players in the Caribbean and Latin America region," said Jamie Smith, Head of Equity Capital Markets for EMEA for Goldman Sachs, one of the banks which will be facilitating the share sale.
The deal is expected to close on July 6, 2021. Meanwhile, CWC will continue to prepare for the IPO, working closely with the underwriters to ensure a smooth and successful launch.
However, some experts have warned that the overall economic situation in the region, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, could pose challenges for the company.
"There is significant political, social, and economic volatility in the region, which has led to some companies operating on a very tight budget," said Joe Tidd, Professor at Sheffield University's Business School. "This means that any potential investment in the region must be carefully considered, and there are certainly risks."
Despite these concerns, there are indications that the Caribbean and Latin American markets remain attractive for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to emerging markets with solid growth prospects.
"The IPO of CWC is an exciting development for investors, and we expect strong demand for the shares," said Tim Mercer, Managing Director of Financial Markets Research at AGF Investments, a Toronto-based investment firm. "The company has a strong market position in the region, solid financials, and a highly experienced management team. And with the expected growth in the region over the next few years, we feel that CWC is well positioned to benefit from this."
