The BBC has announced exciting plans that are set to revolutionize the commercial television market. The British broadcasting institution is partnering with Flextech, a subsidiary of Telewest, to launch innovative subscription-based digital channels. The collaboration will see the creation of four major channels, catering for a wide range of interests and demographics.
The channels that the partnership will launch include BBC Style, BBC People, BBC Knowledge and BBC Entertainment. Each channel has been designed to be highly appealing to different segments of the market, with its own strong identity, programming and roster of presenters.
BBC Style is a lifestyle and popular culture channel, aimed at young adults. With shows covering fashion, beauty, music and contemporary issues, the channel is set to be a hit amongst this demographic. BBC People is focused on issues such as health, parenting, relationships and personal finance, aimed at those approaching middle age. The channel will offer expert advice, guidance and even some light-hearted entertainment. BBC Knowledge is focused on documentaries, and will cover history, science and politics to name just a few topics. Finally, BBC Entertainment will offer sitcoms, dramas and chat shows to viewers of all ages.
The partnership with Flextech is a significant move for the BBC, as it marks the broadcaster's first foray into commercial television in over forty years. For some time now, there has been criticism of the BBC's dominance in the television industry, due to its funding through the license fee, which has put other players at a disadvantage. However, with this new venture, the company will be able to generate revenue beyond the license fee, while continuing to hold true to its public service ethos.
The partnership between the two companies is a symmetrical one, with the BBC contribution being the content while Flextech provides the technical know-how, digital platforms and distribution networks. This means that viewers can gain access to the channels either through their pay-TV subscription, as part of a bundle deal, or by purchasing a standalone subscription.
The partnership decision is reflective of the current marketplace, which has seen a shift towards digital media with changing viewer habits. The move will allow the BBC to maintain its competitive edge and continue to remain at the forefront of television broadcasting, offering a range of digital services that will appeal to a range of demographics.
Director-General of the BBC, Tony Hall, said that the collaboration with Flextech marks an exciting milestone in the broadcaster’s history. “We want to offer our audiences the very best in creative content, and through our partnership with Flextech, we will bring to market some fantastic channels that will cater to a range of interests. These channels will be distinct and engaging, while offering something for everyone.”
Darren Childs, Chief Executive of Flextech, agreed that the partnership will be a game-changer in the commercial television sector in the UK. “We believe our channels can compete with the best of what’s out there, and with the BBC Content partnership, we’re looking to bring a dynamic, engaging and varied selection of channels, through various distribution models that will deliver for audiences, advertisers, and platforms alike,” said Childs.
The launch of the four channels scheduled for Autumn 2007 is expected to create a significant buzz and attract high advertiser interest, given the BBC's reputation for producing high-quality content. The move will undoubtedly change the landscape of commercial television in the UK, with this collaboration between the BBC and Flextech opening the door for other broadcasters to explore similar partnerships.
In summary, the announcment by the BBC to partner up with Flextech highlights the broadcaster’s commitment to diversifying its offering through the launch of innovative channels. The partnership is set to change the commercial television market's landscape in the UK, attracting new viewers and competing products, delivering value and quality for audiences, advertisers, and platforms alike. The BBC has been known for producing excellent content, and this partnership only further validates its position as a leader in the industry.
