Cable and Wireless Communications (CWC) is exploring further acquisition opportunities after its formation and partial flotation on the London Stock Exchange.
The telecommunications company, which provides services in the Caribbean and Latin America, announced earlier this month that it had completed its combination with Liberty Latin America (LLA), following clearance from the regulatory authorities.
As part of the deal, LLA acquired a 49.9% stake in CWC, which was previously controlled by UK-based telecoms firm John Malone's Liberty Global.
CWC's chief executive, Inge Smidts, said: "This is a very exciting day for us. We have achieved a significant milestone in our journey as a company, becoming the leading telecoms operator in the region."
"By combining our businesses with Liberty Latin America's, we are now well-positioned to deliver on our strategic ambitions and growth plans, and to create value for all of our stakeholders," she added.
The newly formed company operates in 20 countries across the Caribbean and Latin America, providing services such as broadband, mobile, and pay-television to over 6 million customers.
Following the merger, CWC announced its intention to focus on organic growth opportunities, as well as selectively pursuing potential acquisition targets to drive further expansion.
"We have a clear strategy to grow our footprint in our existing markets and to look at opportunities to expand into new ones," Smidts said.
"We will pursue these opportunities in a disciplined way, adhering to our strict financial criteria and focusing on delivering long-term value for our shareholders," she added.
CWC has previously made a number of acquisitions to expand its operations in the region. In 2016, the company acquired Caribbean Cable Communications Holdings, a leading cable operator in the Caribbean, for $1.85 billion.
The company also acquired Columbus International, a broadband and telecoms provider in the region, in a $3.7 billion deal in 2015.
The merger with LLA is expected to provide CWC with further opportunities for expansion, with the combined company having a larger presence in the region and more resources to invest in new markets and services.
The deal also comes at a time of increasing competition in the telecommunications industry in the Caribbean and Latin America, with companies jostling for position in a fast-growing market.
According to a report by research firm Ovum, the telecommunications market in the Caribbean and Latin America is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 2.4% between 2020 and 2025, driven by increasing demand for data services and higher broadband penetration.
CWC's focus on expansion through acquisitions comes as other telecoms firms in the region are also pursuing mergers and acquisitions to expand their operations and market share.
In February, Mexican telecoms company América Móvil announced plans to acquire Telefónica's operations in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama, for $648 million.
Meanwhile, in 2019, US-based Liberty Global completed the sale of its operations in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands to Liberty Latin America, in a deal worth $1.95 billion.
Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, CWC is confident that it can continue to pursue its growth ambitions and further expansion in the region.
"Although there have been some near-term impacts from Covid-19, we believe that the underlying demand for our services remains strong and that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our markets," Smidts said.
"With our strong balance sheet and the resources of Liberty Latin America behind us, we are confident in our ability to execute on our strategic priorities and to deliver value for our shareholders," she added.
As the company looks to the future, its focus on acquisitions is likely to remain a key part of its growth strategy. With its larger presence in the region and a stronger financial position, CWC is well-positioned to pursue further opportunities for expansion and to create value for its stakeholders in the years ahead.
