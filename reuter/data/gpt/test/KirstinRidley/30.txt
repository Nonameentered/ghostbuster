Margaret Thatcher's flagship economic policy of privatisation has been deemed a success as British Telecoms (BT) has fully been privatised. The move, which commenced in 1984, saw the government transfer ownership of BT gradually from public to private hands in three stages: in 1984, 1991, and 1993. The last stage of privatisation was completed in 1993 and saw the government sell its remaining shares in the company.
The process of privatisation was a significant departure from the traditional government-run businesses that had been a part of the UK's economic structure. Many saw it as a way to reduce the government's economic footprint, promote efficiency, and encourage innovation through competition. The opposition, however, argued that it was selling off state assets at a time when they were undervalued and that the proceeds would go towards short-term spending, for which it was criticised.
Despite the debate, the privatisation process proved to be successful, with BT leading the way. According to the government's estimate, the privatisation generated £22.5bn for the treasury, which was used to pay off national debt and invest in other parts of the economy. BT shares were sold at 135p in 1984, in 1991 they were 300p, and in 1993, the final tranche of shares sold at £4.00 each.
The privatisation of BT also marked a new era for the telecoms industry. Previously, government-run businesses had monopolised the market, stifling new entrants and reserving competitive advantage for themselves. However, the privatisation of BT created new opportunities for innovation, as private businesses were encouraged to compete against each other. The move was a significant factor in driving a surge of new technology and services into the market, which in turn, resulted in increased competition and customer choice.
BT's privatisation also enabled the company to grow its offerings and expand globally. During the privatisation process, BT was split into various businesses, including mobile phone provider O2, which was sold to Telefonica in 2006 for £17.7bn. The group also acquired a range of international companies, including the US telecoms provider MCI, which it bought for $20bn in 1998, making it the world's third-largest telecoms firm.
Furthermore, one of the essential outcomes of BT's privatisation was the introduction of Openreach, their independent business responsible for managing the UK's telecoms infrastructure. Previously, the infrastructure was owned entirely by BT, and other companies had to lease access to it. However, Openreach ensured that other telecoms providers could access BT's infrastructure more easily, leading to increased competition and better service for customers.
The legacy of BT's privatisation process can still be felt today, with telecoms providers enjoying greater operational flexibility and access to capital than they previously did when under government control. This increased level of competition has also given consumers in the UK access to a wider range of telecoms services, including fixed-line and mobile telephony and internet access.
Of course, not everyone has agreed with the privatisation of BT.  Critics argue that the sale of BT's assets was short-sighted and that the government should have held on to one of British industry's most important firms. However, trade unions that once opposed government privatization plans have changed their tune, appreciating that the sale of state-owned assets opened up opportunities for employees to own shares in the businesses and allowed them to work in new roles and markets.
In conclusion, the successful privatisation of BT is a significant turning point in the UK's economic history and a key plank of the policies of Margaret Thatcher's government. The privatisation has created opportunities in the telecoms industry, increased competition and innovation, and allowed the UK to become a world leader in this area. While the debate will continue about whether it was right or wrong to sell off one of Britain's largest industries, there is no denying the impact that BT's privatisation had on the UK's economy. It stands as a testament to the power of public-private partnerships and the benefits that can come from working together towards a common goal.
