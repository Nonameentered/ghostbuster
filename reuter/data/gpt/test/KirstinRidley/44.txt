B.A.T to pay $1.7bn in landmark tobacco deal, warns it may withdraw support if significantly changed
British American Tobacco (B.A.T) has agreed to pay a $1.7bn settlement to resolve a landmark lawsuit accusing the tobacco industry of concealing the dangers of smoking for decades. The settlement puts an end to a 15-year legal battle waged by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) against the tobacco industry and could pave the way for similar lawsuits in other countries.
However, the company warned that it may withdraw its support for the settlement if it is significantly changed. B.A.T, the world's second-largest cigarette maker by sales after Philip Morris, said that the settlement was fair and that it had always been willing to settle the case. But it said that any changes to the agreement could be difficult for the company to accept.
The lawsuit dates back to 1999, when the US government sued the nation's largest cigarette makers, including B.A.T, for allegedly concealing the risks of smoking and making false claims about the safety of their products. The case was largely based on the 1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, which was designed to combat organized crime but has been used more recently against tobacco companies.
Under the terms of the settlement, B.A.T will pay $1.7bn over 25 years to fund public health programs aimed at reducing smoking and preventing young people from starting. The settlement also requires the company to make public documents that show what it knew about the risks of smoking and when it knew them.
B.A.T said that it was pleased to have resolved the case and that it was committed to working with governments and public health organizations to reduce the harm caused by smoking. But the company warned that it would withdraw its support for the settlement if it is significantly changed, saying that any changes could result in "protracted litigation and uncertainty for all parties".
The settlement still needs to be approved by a federal judge, and it is unclear whether other tobacco companies will also settle with the DoJ. Philip Morris, for example, has said that it is open to settling the case but that any agreement needs to be fair and reasonable.
The settlement is seen as a significant victory for the US government and anti-smoking advocates, who have long accused the tobacco industry of hiding the risks of smoking and misleading the public about the safety of its products. The agreement could also encourage other countries to pursue similar lawsuits, particularly in Europe, where smoking rates are still high and tobacco companies are under increasing pressure to disclose what they knew about the harms of smoking.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has praised the settlement as a "landmark decision" that could "significantly impact the tobacco industry and help prevent millions of smoking-related deaths worldwide". WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement that "tobacco kills more than 8 million people every year, and the industry that profits from it has a duty to be transparent and accountable about the harms of its products".
Anti-smoking groups also welcomed the settlement, but some criticized it for not going far enough. John Banzhaf, a public interest lawyer who has fought against tobacco companies for decades, said that the settlement should have required B.A.T to admit wrongdoing and other tobacco companies to pay more in damages.
Others said that the settlement was a reminder of the dangers of smoking and the need for stronger regulations to protect public health. Matthew Myers, the president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said that "tobacco companies have a long history of deception and manipulation, and this settlement should be a wake-up call for governments around the world to strengthen their tobacco control policies".
Overall, the settlement is a significant step towards holding tobacco companies accountable for the harm caused by their products and could serve as a model for similar legal actions in other countries. However, the ongoing threat of litigation and the possibility of further lawsuits may make it difficult for the tobacco industry to fully absorb the costs of settlement and could encourage governments to take even stronger action to reduce smoking and protect public health.
