BT threatens legal challenge against windfall tax on profits
BT has threatened to launch a legal challenge against the windfall tax on profits proposed by the UK government. In a statement released today, the telecommunications company said that it was “deeply concerned” by the proposal, which it described as “unfair and arbitrary”.
The windfall tax, which was announced as part of Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Budget on 3 March, would target companies that have made “excess profits” during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is aimed at businesses that have benefited from the crisis while many others have struggled, such as tech firms and online retailers.
BT said that it did not believe that it had made “excess profits” and that it had “done everything we can to support our customers and frontline workers during the pandemic”. The company also pointed out that it had invested heavily in upgrading its infrastructure and services to meet the increased demand for remote working.
“This proposed tax is discriminatory and would unfairly penalize companies like ours that have worked hard to adapt and innovate during a challenging time,” said BT Group CEO Philip Jansen. “We believe that it is fundamentally unfair to impose a tax on businesses that have been successful, while many others are struggling to keep their doors open.”
Jansen also warned that the windfall tax could have negative consequences for investment in the UK, particularly in the telecommunications sector. “A tax on innovation and investment will only serve to deter companies from investing in the UK, which would be a serious blow to our economy,” he said.
BT is not the only company to object to the windfall tax. Tech giants Amazon and Google have also raised concerns, with Amazon saying that it was “disappointed” by the proposal. However, both companies have said that they will comply with any tax laws introduced by the UK government.
The windfall tax has also been criticised by some economists, who say that it is a blunt instrument that could have unintended consequences. “This tax risks punishing companies that have adapted to changing circumstances and invested in new ways of working, while rewarding those that have been slow to respond,” said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation.
However, supporters of the windfall tax say that it is a necessary measure to ensure that companies contribute their fair share to the economic recovery. “The pandemic has exposed the inequalities in our society and the profits that some companies have made while others have suffered,” said Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. “It is only right that those who have benefited contribute to the rebuilding of our economy.”
The UK government has yet to provide details of how the windfall tax would work in practice. However, it is expected to target the profits made by companies during the pandemic that exceeded their pre-crisis levels. The government has estimated that the tax could raise up to £5bn.
The windfall tax is one of several measures aimed at raising revenue to pay for the economic costs of the Covid-19 pandemic. Other proposals include increasing the corporation tax rate and freezing income tax thresholds.
The government has also faced criticism for its handling of the pandemic, particularly its controversial decision to delay the introduction of a second lockdown last year. The UK has recorded one of the highest death tolls from Covid-19 in the world, and its economy has suffered a severe contraction as a result of the crisis.
BT’s threat of legal action comes as the company faces renewed pressure over its proposed sale of its Openreach division. Earlier this week, regulator Ofcom called for BT to accelerate its plans to separate Openreach, which owns and operates much of the UK’s broadband network, from the rest of the company.
Ofcom has been pushing for the separation of Openreach for several years, arguing that it would promote greater competition and investment in the UK’s digital infrastructure. BT has resisted the move, saying that it would be too costly and would undermine its ability to invest in new technologies.
The windfall tax on profits is just the latest controversy to hit BT, which has been struggling to adapt to the rapid changes in the telecommunications industry. The company has faced mounting competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, as well as from new players such as Gigaclear and Hyperoptic.
Despite these challenges, BT remains one of the UK’s largest and most important companies, with a workforce of over 100,000 and annual revenues of more than £20bn. Its threat of legal action against the windfall tax is likely to be closely watched, both by its shareholders and by other companies that could be affected by the measure.
