Cable and Wireless Communications, a UK-based telecommunications company, revealed on Monday that it plans to expand its business through further acquisitions as it prepares for a partial flotation. The firm, which is owned by Liberty Global, will explore opportunities to buy companies and strengthen its presence in the international market.
The announcement followed the company's decision to spin off its Latin American operations into a separate entity, Liberty Latin America, which was completed on January 1st. Cable and Wireless retains its businesses in the Caribbean and Panama, as well as its submarine cable operations.
The move to acquire new businesses comes as Liberty Global looks to exit the Latin American market altogether. Cable and Wireless Communications has said it is committed to further investment in the Caribbean and Panama, as well as exploring opportunities for growth in other regions.
"Since our acquisition by Liberty Global in 2016, we have focused on strengthening our operations and delivering superior customer experience,” said John Reid, CEO of Cable and Wireless Communications. “Now, as we embark on the next phase of our journey, we are excited to explore opportunities for growth through further acquisitions.”
One possible target for the company could be Digicel, a multinational telecommunications firm that operates in the Caribbean, Central America, and Asia Pacific. Digicel recently announced plans to sell a minority stake in its business and reduce its debt levels.
However, securing a deal with Digicel would not be easy, as the company is owned by Irish entrepreneur Denis O'Brien, who has previously rejected offers for the business. Another possible target for Cable and Wireless Communications could be Millicom, a telecommunications company that operates in Latin America and Africa and is currently in the process of divesting its African assets.
The expansion plans of Cable and Wireless Communications also come ahead of a planned partial flotation of the company on the London Stock Exchange. Liberty Global has previously confirmed that it plans to sell a minority stake in the business in order to raise funds to pay off debts and invest in other areas of the company.
The flotation is expected to take place in the first half of this year, with Cable and Wireless Communications expecting to raise between $500m and $1bn from the sale of a 20-30% stake in the company. The proceeds will be used to reduce its debt burden, which currently stands at around $6bn.
"The proceeds from the partial flotation will strengthen our balance sheet and allow us to continue investing in our operations to deliver growth and enhanced shareholder value,” said Reid.
The company has been making steady progress in recent years, with its customer base increasing by around 10% in the last year alone. Its recent expansion into the submarine cable market has also been successful, with the launch of a new cable connecting Jamaica and Florida.
However, the company faces stiff competition from other telecommunications firms in the region, including Digicel and America Movil, which operates under the Claro brand.
Despite the challenges, Cable and Wireless Communications is confident in its ability to grow and expand its business. The company's focus on customer service and investment in new technologies has made it a strong player in the Caribbean and Panama, and by looking for new acquisition opportunities, it is eager to build on its success and become a major player in other regions as well.
The partial flotation, along with the company's expansion plans, will undoubtedly attract attention from investors. The telecommunications sector has been booming in recent years, and Cable and Wireless Communications is well-positioned to take advantage of this growth by investing in new technologies and expanding its customer base.
As the company prepares for its partial flotation and looks to acquire new businesses, it is clear that Cable and Wireless Communications is focused on delivering growth and value to its shareholders, while also building on its reputation as a leading telecommunications provider in the Caribbean and beyond.
