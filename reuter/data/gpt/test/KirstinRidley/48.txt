The Independent Television Commission (ITC) is standing by its decision to award five digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences despite possible legal challenges. The ITC believes that the benefits of digital television outweigh any possible legal challenges and that digital terrestrial television represents the future of television broadcasting.
The ITC awarded the five licences to a consortium of broadcasters including the BBC, Carlton Communications, Granada Media, Channel 4 and BSkyB. The consortium plans to launch the DTT service in the United Kingdom in the autumn of 1998.
The ITC has said that the decision to award the licences was based on a rigorous assessment of the bids received. The ITC received 16 bids for the DTT licences and evaluated each proposal based on a set of criteria that included technical quality, programme content, business plans and financial viability.
The ITC has said that the consortium’s bid was the most compelling and met all of the required criteria. The consortium has said that the DTT service will offer viewers more choice, better quality and greater interactivity than the current analogue television service.
Despite the ITC’s decision, there have been some concerns about the legality of the award. A group of existing television broadcasters, including Anglia Television, Scottish Television, Ulster Television, and Welsh broadcaster HTV, have expressed their disappointment that their bids were not successful and have indicated that they may challenge the decision in the courts.
The broadcasters have raised concerns that the consortium's bid may not be in compliance with the European Union's competition rules as BSkyB, which is partly owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, is a member of the consortium. BSkyB also has a significant share of the pay television market in the United Kingdom.
The ITC has said that it is confident that the consortium’s bid is in compliance with all relevant legislation and that the decision to award the licences was based on a transparent and fair process.
“The ITC is confident that the decision to award the licences was taken in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down by Parliament and in the interests of the public,” said ITC Chief Executive, Peter Rogers.
“Digital terrestrial television represents the future of television broadcasting and the benefits that it will bring to viewers in terms of choice, quality and interactivity are clear. The ITC is committed to ensuring that the digital television market is as competitive as possible and we believe that our decision to award the licences to the consortium has achieved this aim,” he added.
The ITC’s decision has been welcomed by the broadcasting industry and consumer groups who believe that it will increase competition and lead to better quality and more diverse programmes.
“We welcome the ITC’s decision to award the DTT licences to the consortium and we believe that it will bring significant benefits to viewers in terms of choice, quality and interactivity,” said Tony Close, Director of Content Standards at the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (BARB).
“We believe that the DTT service will increase competition in the television market and lead to better quality and more diverse programmes. We are looking forward to the launch of the service later this year,” he added.
In conclusion, the ITC remains confident in its decision to award the digital terrestrial television licences to the consortium despite possible legal challenges. The ITC believes that the decision was made in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down by Parliament and in the interests of the public. The ITC is committed to ensuring that the digital television market is as competitive as possible and believes that the launch of the DTT service will bring significant benefits to viewers.
