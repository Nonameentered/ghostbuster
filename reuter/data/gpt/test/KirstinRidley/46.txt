Carlton Communications and Granada have been awarded three critical licenses to operate multi-channel digital terrestrial TV in the UK. The new services will offer viewers more choice and better quality programming, as well as providing an opportunity for these companies to grow their businesses.
The licenses were awarded by the Office of Communications (Ofcom), the UK's independent regulator for the communications industry. The decision was made following a competitive process, which saw both companies put forward their proposals for the new services.
The first license will allow Carlton Communications to launch a new service called Carlton Select, which will feature a mix of programming from the company's existing channels, such as Carlton and Central. The service will also offer new programming, including exclusive shows and movies.
The second license will allow Granada to launch its own new service, entitled Granada Plus. This channel will feature classic programming from the Granada archives, as well as new shows and movies. The service is aimed at an older audience, who are looking for quality programming that they may have missed when it was first broadcast.
The third license will allow Carlton and Granada to launch a joint service called ONdigital. This service will feature a range of programming, including movies, sports, and news, as well as interactive features such as online shopping and gaming. The joint venture is expected to be a major player in the UK's digital TV market.
Shares in both Carlton Communications and Granada surged following the announcement, with investors clearly bullish on the potential of these new services. Carlton shares were up 6.9% in early trading, while Granada's shares rose by 7.2%. The companies are now expected to invest significant resources in marketing and promoting the new services, in order to gain market share and establish themselves as leaders in the digital TV space.
Commenting on the decision to award the licenses, Ofcom CEO Ed Richards said: "We are delighted to have awarded these licenses to Carlton Communications and Granada. These companies have a strong track record of delivering quality programming to UK viewers, and we are confident that their new services will be a significant addition to the UK's digital TV landscape."
He added: "The UK's digital TV market is growing rapidly, and we are committed to ensuring that viewers have access to a wide range of high-quality programming. These new services will help to meet that demand, and we look forward to working with Carlton Communications and Granada as they bring these services to market."
Industry analysts have also been quick to praise the decision to award the licenses to Carlton Communications and Granada.

The UK's digital TV market is growing rapidly, with more and more viewers choosing to watch TV via digital platforms. According to a recent report by Ofcom, nearly 50% of UK households now have digital TV, while viewers aged 16-34 are spending over three hours per day watching TV on their mobiles or tablets.
This trend is expected to continue, as consumers become more comfortable with digital technology and its advantages over traditional broadcasting methods.
