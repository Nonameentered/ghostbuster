Air Canada is bolstering its presence in Asia with the addition of new routes to Tokyo, Japan and Singapore. The airline announced plans to launch direct flights from Toronto to Tokyo's Haneda Airport in spring 2020, followed by flights from Vancouver to Singapore later that same summer.
The addition of these two key destinations will create new opportunities for Canadian travelers and businesses, while also connecting Asia to Canada's growing economy. Air Canada says it aims to capitalize on the strong demand for travel between Canada and Asia, which has grown significantly in recent years.
"With a growing economy and vibrant business community, Japan and Singapore are key markets for us," said Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada's CEO. "We are confident these new routes will be well-received by both leisure and business travelers, and will help strengthen ties between Canada and Asia."
The airline plans to operate daily flights between Toronto and Haneda using its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, which features Air Canada's signature Business Class, Premium Economy, and Economy amenities. The Vancouver-Singapore route will be served three times a week, also using the Dreamliner aircraft.
Air Canada is already one of the largest airlines serving Asia from North America, with existing routes to Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul and Tokyo's Narita Airport. The addition of these two new destinations will further solidify the airline's position in Asia and provide more options for travelers looking to explore the region.
"We are committed to investing in our network and providing our customers with a best-in-class travel experience," said Rovinescu. "These new routes represent a significant milestone in our growth strategy and will help Air Canada continue to expand its global reach."
