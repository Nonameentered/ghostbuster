Taiwan Ranks Second in Air Cargo Traffic Handled by Hong Kong Airport, with Growth of 33.55%
Hong Kong International Airport has released its air cargo statistics for the month of July, which showed impressive growth in cargo traffic handled. Among all the regions, Taiwan stands out as the second largest, with a total handling volume of 67,000 tonnes, representing an increase of 33.55% compared to the same period last year.
According to the data, the growth of air cargo traffic from Taiwan is driven by increasing demand for electronic components and personal protective equipment (PPE). The rise in demand for electronic components is fueled by the growing use of smart devices and the advancement of the 5G technology. Meanwhile, PPE is increasingly becoming a necessity amid the pandemic outbreak, which has created a global shortage of face masks, gloves, and other protective gear.
The latest cargo data also reflects Taiwan’s resilient economic performance amid the Covid-19 pandemic. While many countries have suffered from economic disruptions, Taiwan has been able to continue its manufacturing plus and digital transformation strategy, benefitting from the pandemic’s impact on the global supply chain and accelerating the growth of the high-tech industry.
The strong performance of Taiwan’s air cargo traffic has also helped reinforce Hong Kong’s position as Asia’s premier aviation hub. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Hong Kong saw a 7.8% year-on-year increase in cargo volume in July, with total cargo throughput reaching nearly 400,000 tonnes.
Taiwan’s continued growth of air cargo traffic is expected to drive more cooperation between Taiwan and Hong Kong in the aviation and logistics sectors. With the signing of the Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic Cooperation Agreement in 2010, the two sides have increased collaboration in many areas, including aviation services, trade, and investment.
Moving forward, Taiwan is poised to continue its strong growth trajectory in air cargo traffic, buoyed by the rapid development of the country’s high-tech industry and the implementation of the government’s New Southbound Policy, aimed at strengthening economic ties with countries in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Australia. In the face of global uncertainties, Taiwan’s adaptability and resilience will likely continue to help the country maintain economic growth and international competitiveness.
