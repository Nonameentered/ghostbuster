Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific has increased its cargo rates by 3 percent due to rising fuel costs. This move comes as freight carriers around the world face pressure from volatile fuel prices and increased competition.
The new rates will come into effect in early August and will be applicable to all destinations. The company said in a statement that it had tried to minimize the impact of the fuel costs on its customers, but had to increase the rates eventually to keep up with the rising expenses.
The move follows a similar price increase by the airline in April, when it announced a 4.8 percent hike in cargo rates due to increases in fuel and terminal costs.
Cathay Pacific has been reporting losses due to low passenger demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic and has been exploring different avenues to drive revenue. The airline has been focusing on its cargo operations, which have remained profitable during the pandemic, due to a surge in e-commerce, especially for personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical supplies.
The airline has also been using its grounded passenger planes to transport cargo by removing seats in the cabin and utilizing the bellyhold space. The carrier plans to operate over 1,300 cargo flights in August, a 40 percent increase over the previous month.
Cathay Pacific is not the only airline to increase its cargo rates due to rising fuel costs. Other airlines around the world have also taken similar measures to keep up with the expenses.
