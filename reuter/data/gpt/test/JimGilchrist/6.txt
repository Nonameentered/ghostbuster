Hong Kong's new Airport Freight Forwarding Centre hits 80% occupancy
Hong Kong's new Airport Freight Forwarding Centre has reached an 80% occupancy level since its opening in September 2021. The new centre, located in the Asia Airfreight Terminal at Hong Kong International Airport, serves as a one-stop-shop for freight forwarding services, providing a range of value-added services to enhance the efficiency of international trade.
The centre's services include cargo screening, customs clearance, inspection, and documentation handling. It also offers cold-storage facilities for perishable goods, cross-border trucking services, and light manufacturing and assembly services, aiming to provide a more comprehensive and convenient service for businesses.
The high occupancy rate demonstrates the demand for such integrated logistics services. Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL), which operates the centre, has gained positive feedback from its customers and looks forward to expanding its services in the future.
David Kerr, CEO of HACTL, stated, "We are delighted to see strong demand for our one-stop-shop cargo services, which enable our customers to streamline their operations and reduce transit times. The success of the Airport Freight Forwarding Centre reflects a strong demand for value-added services beyond just airline cargo handling."
The Hong Kong government has been investing heavily in logistics infrastructure to support Hong Kong's position as a global logistics hub. The new Freight Forwarding Centre, alongside the third runway of Hong Kong International Airport, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, and the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, illustrate the government's commitment to boosting the logistics industry.
As the pandemic situation and the global supply chain disruptions have reshaped the logistics industry's landscape, Hong Kong's strategic location and highly efficient transport network have become increasingly important for businesses seeking to maintain their global supply chains.
The new Airport Freight Forwarding Centre has recognized this and positioned itself to provide diversified services, catering to the changing demands of the market. The centre's high occupancy rate proves its success in offering a comprehensive and efficient logistics support system for businesses in Hong Kong and beyond.
Overall, the new Airport Freight Forwarding Centre's high occupancy rate is a positive indication of Hong Kong's growing logistics industry and its ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving global supply chain landscape. Hong Kong's investment in logistics infrastructure will undoubtedly further strengthen its position as a global logistics hub, and the Airport Freight Forwarding Centre's services will play a crucial role in facilitating trade worldwide.
