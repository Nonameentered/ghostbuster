Hong Kong's Air Cargo Handling Sees 10.35% Growth in October Compared to Last Year
Hong Kong's air cargo handling industry continued to show resilience in October this year, with a growth of 10.35%, in comparison with the same month last year. This statistic comes after a report published by the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), a month-on-month increment of 6.9%, which is a massive achievement, given the current economic climate.
While the aviation industry has certainly been hit hard due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong appears to be faring better than its counterparts. The growth of air cargo handling in the region can be attributed to the continued demand for goods during the pandemic, particularly in the e-commerce sector, given the trend of online shopping.
Furthermore, Hong Kong's role as a global trading hub, strategic location and efficient handling capabilities have played a vital role in keeping the air cargo handling industry up and running. The HKIA has also been taking measures such as investing in new technologies and upgrading its cargo facilities to ensure smoother operations, which has contributed to the growth of the industry.
Last year, air cargo handling at the HKIA reached 4.8 million tonnes, with exports and transshipments accounting for 76% of the total cargo volume. The airport also handled over 100 airlines, connecting Hong Kong to over 220 destinations worldwide.
The growth of air cargo handling is a positive sign for Hong Kong's economic recovery and the aviation industry as a whole. However, the ongoing pandemic continues to pose uncertainties and challenges for the industry, and it is essential to take measures to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all employees and cargo handling operations.
Overall, the increase in air cargo handling at HKIA during the month of October is a great sign of recovery and progress for the region, and industry experts look forward to continued growth and success in the upcoming months.
