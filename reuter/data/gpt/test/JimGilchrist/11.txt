Lufthansa Cargo, one of the world's leading air freight operators, is experiencing an unprecedented surge in demand for its services. The sudden spike in business is due to new import tax changes that are soon to be implemented in China. 
According to Lufthansa Cargo's senior executives, the company has been inundated with orders from Chinese businesses that are frantically trying to import goods before the new regulations come into effect. The changes will see a significant increase in taxes on various imported items, including luxury goods and electronic devices, which have become an important part of China's growing middle class consumer market.
This sudden demand for air freight services has forced Lufthansa Cargo to find innovative ways to keep up with the demand. The company has been forced to add additional flights and increase its cargo capacity to meet its customers' needs. It has also been working closely with its partners across the supply chain to ensure that goods are transported quickly and efficiently from one end of the world to the other. 
Lufthansa's executives believe that this increase in demand is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. They believe that as the Chinese market continues to grow, more and more businesses will start looking towards the international markets to source their goods. This can only mean good news for the air freight industry, which has seen a significant downturn since the pandemic began. 
In conclusion, the impending import tax changes in China have caused a surge in demand for air freight services. Lufthansa Cargo has been at the forefront of this surge in demand, and it will continue to do so as international trade continues to grow. As competition for air freight continues to intensify, Lufthansa Cargo is in a good position to maximize its opportunities in this burgeoning market.
