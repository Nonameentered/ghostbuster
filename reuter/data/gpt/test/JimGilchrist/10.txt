Air Canada frustrated by Canadian government's denial of daily flights to Hong Kong
Air Canada has expressed frustration over the Canadian government's decision to deny the airline's request for daily flights to Hong Kong. The airline had hoped to increase its frequency to the Chinese city to meet growing demand from travellers.
In a statement, Air Canada said that it was disappointed by the federal government's decision to deny its request for daily flights to Hong Kong. The airline cited the strong demand for travel to the city as the reason for its request.
"We are frustrated and disappointed by this decision," said Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu. "We believe that daily flights to Hong Kong are necessary to meet the growing demand from travellers, and we had hoped that the government would recognize this and grant our request."
Air Canada currently operates three flights per week to Hong Kong from Vancouver and Toronto. The airline had sought approval to increase its frequency to seven flights per week, which it said would allow it to better serve the needs of travellers.
The Canadian government has not commented on its decision to deny Air Canada's request. However, industry analysts speculate that the decision may be related to Canada's strained relations with China.
The two countries have been locked in a diplomatic dispute since December 2018, when Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the request of the United States. China has since detained two Canadian citizens and restricted Canadian imports.
Air Canada is not the only Canadian airline that has been affected by the dispute. Earlier this year, Chinese authorities denied permission for Air Canada's rival, WestJet, to start operating flights to China.
Despite the setback, Air Canada said that it remained committed to serving its customers in Hong Kong. The airline has pledged to work with the Canadian government to address any concerns that may have led to the denial of its request.
