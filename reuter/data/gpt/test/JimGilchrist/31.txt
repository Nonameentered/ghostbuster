Hong Kong - Cathay Pacific, the flag carrier of Hong Kong, has clashed with the local government over the cause of recent delays at Kai Tak Airport. The airline has stated that the government's mismanagement of the airport's facilities and air traffic control systems is to blame for the prolonged waiting times and cancellations, whereas the government has accused Cathay Pacific of poor fleet management.
The spat began after passengers experienced significant delays at Kai Tak Airport in recent weeks, with some flights being delayed for hours and others being cancelled altogether. Cathay Pacific claims that the delays and cancellations are due to insufficient personnel and outdated equipment at the airport, which are making it difficult to manage the growing volume of air traffic.
"The Hong Kong government needs to take responsibility for the current situation at Kai Tak Airport, where we have been experiencing significant delays and cancellations in recent weeks," said a Cathay Pacific spokesperson, who declined to be named. "Our fleet is managed efficiently, and we do our utmost to ensure that our passengers experience minimal inconvenience. However, the government's lack of investment in infrastructure and personnel is making it difficult for us to provide the service that we want to."
The Hong Kong government has rejected the airline's claims, pointing to recent reports that suggest that Cathay Pacific's fleet management is at fault for the delays. "The Hong Kong government is committed to ensuring that Kai Tak Airport provides a safe, secure and efficient service to passengers," said a government spokesperson. "We have invested heavily in new facilities and air traffic control systems, but we cannot be held responsible for the poor fleet management of Cathay Pacific."
It remains to be seen how the dispute will be resolved, but both Cathay Pacific and the government have indicated that they are willing to work together to find a solution. "We are committed to resolving this situation in a constructive and collaborative manner," said the Cathay Pacific spokesperson. "We recognise the importance of Kai Tak Airport to Hong Kong's economy and its people, and we will do our part to ensure that it operates smoothly and efficiently."
