Cathay Pacific Airways has welcomed the recent approval for a second runway at Manchester airport, saying it will help improve the airline's connectivity to the UK. The airline, which operates a daily flight between Hong Kong and Manchester, said the new runway would provide more opportunities for growth and expansion, allowing it to offer a better service to its customers. Manchester airport, the third-busiest airport in the UK, is already home to more than 70 airlines and serves over 29 million passengers annually. The new runway, scheduled to open in 2023, is expected to create over 16,000 new jobs in the region.
