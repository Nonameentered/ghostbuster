Hong Kong has successfully maintained its position as the top spot for air cargo exports in North America, according to the latest data released by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).
In 2019, Hong Kong's air cargo exports to North America amounted to USD 53.8 billion, accounting for 32.6% of the region's total air cargo exports. This represents a 1.1% increase from the previous year.
The HKTDC attributed Hong Kong's continued success in air cargo exports to several factors, including its strategic location as a gateway to mainland China and the rest of Asia, its world-class infrastructure and logistics facilities, and its efficient customs clearance procedures.
In addition, Hong Kong's world-renowned reputation as an international financial and business hub has also played a significant role in attracting top-tier businesses and investors to the region.
Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruptions to global trade and supply chains, Hong Kong has remained resilient and adaptable in maintaining its position as an air cargo export powerhouse.
As the world gradually recovers from the pandemic and continues to navigate the challenges posed by the ongoing global economic downturn, Hong Kong remains well-positioned to capitalize on its strengths and drive continued growth in the air cargo sector.
"With our strategic location, modern infrastructure, and efficient customs procedures, Hong Kong will continue to be the preferred hub for air cargo exports to and from North America," said Mr. Peter Wong, Chairman of the HKTDC.
As Hong Kong continues to lead the way in air cargo exports, the region remains committed to innovation and sustainability to further enhance the competitiveness of its logistics sector.
