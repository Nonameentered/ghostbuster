Hong Kong’s Air Cargo Industry Booms During Peak Season, Especially for Europe-Bound Flights
Hong Kong’s air cargo industry has been booming during the peak season, with a particular increase in demand for Europe-bound flights. This surge in demand has been attributed to the upcoming winter season, along with the rise of e-commerce and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) has been a key player in the air cargo industry, being one of the world’s busiest cargo airports. According to the Airport Authority of Hong Kong, the airport handled 444,000 tonnes of cargo in September 2021, a 12.4% increase compared to the same period in 2019. Additionally, HKIA’s air cargo volume for the first nine months of 2021 has reached 3.4 million tonnes, a 16.6% increase compared to the same period in 2020.
The boom in air cargo demand has been partly driven by the upcoming winter season, which generates a demand for seasonal goods such as winter clothing, festive decorations, and gifts. This demand is further supported by the rise of e-commerce, as more consumers are shopping online and having their purchased goods delivered via air cargo. The pandemic has also contributed to the increase in air cargo demand, as many countries have imposed restrictions on sea and land transportation, relying on air cargo to transport essential goods.
Europe-bound flights have seen a particular increase in demand, with exports to Europe accounting for a significant share of Hong Kong’s air cargo industry. According to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), Europe is Hong Kong’s second-largest trading partner, with exports amounting to HKD 911 billion (USD 117 billion) in 2020. In particular, the top five export items to Europe were semiconductor devices, telecom equipment, computers, precious metal jewelry, and watches.
To cater to the increase in demand, airlines have been adding extra flights, utilizing larger aircraft, and providing cargo-only flights. For example, Cathay Pacific has added extra cargo flights to Europe from October to December 2021, with flights departing to Amsterdam, Paris, London, Frankfurt, and Milan.
The cargo industry has also been investing in digitalization to improve efficiency and transparency. Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL), the cargo terminal operator at HKIA, has implemented an electronic air waybill (e-AWB) system to streamline cargo handling processes. The e-AWB system enables air waybills to be processed electronically, reducing paperwork and improving efficiency.
Moreover, HACTL has implemented a blockchain-based platform, called “HacChain,” to provide end-to-end cargo tracking and enhance cargo security. The platform allows cargo stakeholders to access real-time cargo status updates and verify the authenticity of cargo documents, improving transparency and reducing the risk of cargo fraud.
However, the air cargo industry is not without its challenges. One of the major challenges is the shortage of air cargo capacity, resulting in increased costs and longer transit times. The pandemic has disrupted the supply chain, leading to a shortage of cargo space as passenger planes are being used for cargo. Additionally, the increase in demand for cargo has led to a shortage of containers and trucking capacity.
Another challenge is the cybersecurity risks associated with digitalization. With the rise of digitalization in the air cargo industry, cybersecurity risks have also increased. Cybersecurity threats such as data breaches, ransomware attacks, and phishing attacks can disrupt cargo operations and cause financial losses.
Despite the challenges, Hong Kong’s air cargo industry is set to continue its growth trajectory. The industry has been a key contributor to Hong Kong’s economy, generating employment and providing a vital link for the global supply chain. The Hong Kong government has also been supportive of the industry, investing in infrastructure and promoting air cargo development.
In conclusion, the peak season has brought about a surge in demand for Hong Kong’s air cargo industry, particularly for Europe-bound flights. The increasing demand is driven by the upcoming winter season, the rise of e-commerce, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Airlines and cargo industry stakeholders have been investing in digitalization to improve efficiency and transparency, while also facing challenges such as the shortage of air cargo capacity and cybersecurity risks. However, the industry is poised for growth, being a vital component of Hong Kong’s economy and the global supply chain.
