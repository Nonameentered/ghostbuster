EVA Air, the Taiwanese airline, has announced plans to launch a new freight service linking Taipei and Brussels. The new service will commence operations in November and will use the airline’s Boeing 777 freighters to transport goods between the two cities.
The move is part of EVA Air’s plans to expand its cargo fleet and boost its global cargo offering. The airline currently operates a fleet of 27 freighters, which are used to move a variety of goods around the world.
According to EVA Air, the new freight service will offer a range of benefits to businesses in Taiwan and Europe. These benefits include faster and more efficient transportation of goods, reduced shipping costs, and improved access to new markets.
The airline also believes that the new service will help to strengthen ties between Taiwan and Europe, both of which are important markets for the global economy.
EVA Air’s expansion plans are part of a wider trend in the air cargo industry, which has seen a surge in demand in recent years. The growth in e-commerce and the rise of global trade means that more goods are being shipped by air than ever before.
In response to this trend, airlines around the world are investing in their cargo fleets, expanding their networks, and offering new services to meet the needs of businesses and consumers.
EVA Air is no exception to this trend. Over the past few years, the airline has made significant investments in its cargo operations, including the purchase of new freighters and the expansion of its cargo hub at Taipei’s Taoyuan International Airport.
The airline’s efforts have already paid off, with cargo revenue growing by 5% in the first half of 2021. The launch of the new freight service to Brussels is expected to further boost the airline’s cargo business, as well as its overall revenue.
Overall, EVA Air’s expansion plans demonstrate the airline’s commitment to its cargo operations and its goal of becoming a leading player in the air cargo industry. With the launch of the new freight service to Brussels and the expansion of its cargo fleet, the airline is poised for continued growth in the years to come.
