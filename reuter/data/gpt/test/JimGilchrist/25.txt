Hong Kong air cargo handling saw a 10.35% rise in October compared to the same month last year, according to data from the Airport Authority Hong Kong.
The airport handled a total of 445,000 tonnes of cargo in October, marking the second consecutive month of year-on-year growth.
The double-digit growth was attributed to strong demand for air cargo services, particularly in the electronics and medical sectors.
The electronics sector saw a significant increase in demand for products such as smartphones, tablets, and computer equipment, while the medical sector experienced a surge in demand for personal protective equipment and COVID-19 test kits.
The airport added that there was also an increase in demand for e-commerce deliveries, as consumers continued to shift towards online shopping in the wake of the pandemic.
The growth in cargo volumes is expected to continue into the coming months, as Hong Kong prepares for the peak holiday season.
However, the aviation industry continues to face challenges due to the ongoing pandemic, including flight cancellations and reduced passenger demand.
Despite these challenges, Hong Kong International Airport has implemented various measures to ensure the safety of passengers and cargo handlers, including increased cleaning and disinfection, social distancing protocols, and mandatory testing for arriving passengers.
Overall, the growth in air cargo handling volumes is a positive sign for Hong Kong's economy, as the city looks to recover from the impact of the pandemic.
