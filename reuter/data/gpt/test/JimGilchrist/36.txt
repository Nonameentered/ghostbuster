as the city's flagship cargo terminal operator has raised their fee once again.
Cathay Pacific Airways, the operator of Hong Kong's main cargo terminal, announced that it would increase its fees by 5.9% from January 1, 2021. The hike is the latest in a series of fee increases that have taken place since the opening of Cathay Pacific's new terminal at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) in 2013.
The move has raised concerns among cargo airlines operating in Hong Kong, with some considering cheaper alternatives to the city's new airport. "The cost of doing business in Hong Kong is becoming increasingly unaffordable," said a representative from a leading cargo airline. "We are exploring other options, such as using airports in nearby countries, to save costs and remain competitive."
According to industry experts, the high fees charged by Cathay Pacific are a major factor in Hong Kong's declining competitiveness as a cargo hub. In recent years, the city's share of the global air cargo market has declined from 6.8% in 2013 to 5.7% in 2019, while the volume of cargo handled by HKIA has stagnated.
The decline in Hong Kong's cargo industry has been attributed to a number of factors, including the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, as well as the rise of competing airports in the region. However, many in the industry believe that the high fees charged by Cathay Pacific are the primary driver of the decline.
"The high fees charged by Cathay Pacific are putting off cargo airlines from using Hong Kong as a hub," said a spokesperson for the Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL), the city's other major cargo terminal operator. "We need to find a way to bring down these costs and make Hong Kong a more attractive destination for cargo airlines."
Despite the challenges facing the industry, officials at HKIA remain optimistic about the future of Hong Kong's cargo industry. "We are committed to working with our partners to maintain Hong Kong's position as a leading aviation hub and cargo gateway," said Wilson Fung, Executive Director of the Airport Authority Hong Kong. "We will continue to invest in infrastructure, services, and technologies to enhance the competitiveness of HKIA."
