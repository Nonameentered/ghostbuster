Polar Air Cargo, a leading cargo airline, has announced a reduction in its freighter flights from Hong Kong to the United States during the end-of-year lull. The airline confirmed that it would be cutting down the number of flights in response to the traditionally slower demand for air cargo at this time of the year.
According to Polar Air Cargo, the reduced schedule would take effect from next week, with fewer flights operating between Hong Kong and the US over the Christmas and New Year period. The company stated that the reduction was a necessary measure to align their services with market demand while maintaining route network flexibility and a reliable service for their customers.
The airline, which has a global network that connects Asia, Europe, and North America, has been operating regular freighter flights from Hong Kong to cities across the United States, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. However, with the end-of-year lull expected to affect air cargo demand across the region, the company has decided to adjust its services to match market requirements.
Despite the reduction in flights, Polar Air Cargo has emphasized that it remains committed to providing world-class air cargo services throughout the year. The company has assured its customers that it will continue to monitor market demand closely and make appropriate adjustments to its flight schedules to maintain its service standards.
The move comes as the air cargo industry faces ongoing disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, limited capacity, and other market challenges that have impacted the supply chain. With the end-of-year lull adding to the mix, industry players are bracing for a challenging season.
