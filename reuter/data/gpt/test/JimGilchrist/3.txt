Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific has been advised to make design changes to its planes after an emergency evacuation incident resulted in several injuries. According to a report by the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department (CAD), the evacuation slide on a Cathay Pacific aircraft was not deployed correctly during an emergency drill, leading to the injuries of 11 cabin crew members.
The incident occurred during an evacuation training exercise at Hong Kong International Airport in 2019. According to the CAD report, the Airbus A330 was being used for a routine emergency drill when the slide suddenly inflated and caused the crew members to be thrown onto the tarmac.
The report also found that the design of the slide was not suitable for the location of the aircraft's doors. The slide was located at an angle, making it difficult to deploy properly. The CAD recommended that Cathay Pacific should take steps to improve the design layout of the slide to make it simpler for crew members to deploy it easily in the event of an emergency.
The report further recommended that Cathay Pacific should conduct additional training for its cabin crew to ensure they are able to correctly and safely deploy the slide during an emergency. The airline should also review its emergency procedures to ensure all crew members are aware of the necessary steps to be taken during an evacuation and are adequately prepared for any scenario.
Cathay Pacific has responded to the CAD's recommendations, stating that it takes the safety of its passengers and crew seriously and will be working to implement the design changes and additional training. The airline also noted that it has already begun training its cabin crew to ensure they are equipped to handle emergencies and will continue to do so to improve their skills and knowledge.
In a statement, the airline said, "Cathay Pacific is committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our customers and crew. We take any incidents seriously and will continue to work closely with the CAD to implement the recommended changes to our design and training procedures."
The CAD's report and recommendations come at a time when the aviation industry is facing increased scrutiny over safety following several high-profile emergency incidents in recent years. The report serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring proper training and equipment is in place to protect the safety of passengers and crew members during critical situations.
The incident also highlights the need for airlines to regularly review and assess their safety procedures and systems to identify areas that require improvement. By doing so, airlines can ensure they are providing the highest level of safety and protection to their passengers and crew members.
