Airline and Freight Forwarders Expect Mini-Boom Before Chinese New Year, Despite Firm Rates: Reuters Survey Shows
With the Chinese New Year just around the corner, the airline and freight forwarders' industries have been optimistic about a "mini-boom" in their businesses. A Reuters survey covering leading airlines, freight forwarders, and shippers has revealed that most of these businesses expect an increase in air and sea traffic before Chinese New Year, despite persistently firm rates.
The survey revealed that 83% of airline companies and 75% of freight forwarders believe that their businesses would experience an increase in demand for air and sea cargo services before the Chinese New Year. The Chinese New Year, which falls on February 12 this year, is one of the most important traditional festivals in China, and it is accompanied by a balancing act between the increase in demand and the challenges of working around the holiday.
On the other hand, almost 60% of airline carriers and over 40% of freight forwarders think that rates would remain the same or slightly increase before the Chinese New Year, while only about 20% think that the rates would decrease. This suggests that despite the expectations of a mini-boom, businesses would still be met with challenges such as managing high rates and the limited capacity that is typical around the season.
The anticipated mini-boom has been attributed to a surge in demand for products and services prior to the onset of the holiday period, with the domestic retail sector being the most significant contributor. Businesses also expect significant growth in e-commerce activities, with Alibaba reporting a 31% increase in total transaction value during the 2020 Chinese New Year.
Robert Van de Weg, the Global Head of Sales and Marketing at AirBridgeCargo Airlines, stated that "There is no trade without transportation, and before Chinese New Year, there is a lot of trade." Robert went on to explain, "The three weeks leading up to Chinese New Year are always the busiest, with a broad range of goods shipped, from fresh seafood such as salmon and shrimp, to automotive parts and other consumer durables."
Considering how the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted various industries including airlines and freight forwarding in 2020, the respondents to the Reuters survey also expressed their thoughts on how the pandemic could affect their businesses this year. Interestingly, the majority of respondents believe that the pandemic would have a positive effect, such as increasing demand for their services. Over 40% of airline carriers said that the pandemic could lead to a surge in demand, while 70% of freight forwarders said that the pandemic could bring structural changes to the logistics industry.
One reason for this optimism among these businesses is the acceleration of digital transformation that has been brought on by the pandemic. Remote work has become more normalized, and technologies such as automation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have played a significant role in helping businesses adapt to new modes of work. For example, digitalization has enabled freight forwarders and airlines to offer contactless cargo handling and more efficient customs clearance processes, thereby streamlining operations and improving turn-around times.
However, while many businesses see the pandemic as an opportunity to drive expansion, others are wary of the long-term impacts and believe that the pandemic could bring about a slow economic recovery. Over 40% of airline carriers and 60% of freight forwarders surveyed said that the pandemic could slow the rate of economic recovery. As such, many businesses are still committed to capacity control and prioritizing essential goods until the global situation stabilizes.
Another challenge for airlines and freight forwarders approaching Chinese New Year is the inevitable tightening of cargo capacity. As airlines begin to adjust their capacities in anticipation of the holiday season, there is likely to be a decline in available space, leading to higher rates. With most of these businesses expecting airfreight rates to remain firm or increase, it falls on logistics managers to work closely with their airline carriers and find innovative solutions to the challenge of limited capacity.
In conclusion, while the upcoming Chinese New Year season holds much promise for airlines and freight forwarding businesses, this is coupled with the challenges of high rates and limited capacity. Despite this, businesses remain optimistic, helped in no small part by the accelerated transformation brought about by the pandemic. What remains undisputable is that businesses have to continually adapt to changes, whether they be seasonal or pandemic-related, so as to stay competitive in the always-evolving landscape of logistics.
