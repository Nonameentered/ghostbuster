Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) is currently developing a computerised memory system to avoid costly delays in the cargo operations. The new system aims to streamline the handling of information related to cargo and increase the efficiency of cargo handling processes by reducing the time spent on manual data entry and retrieval.
The development of the computerised memory system comes as a response to the growing demand for air cargo services in Hong Kong. HACTL, one of the world's leading air cargo terminals, operates a 24-hour cargo terminal at Hong Kong International Airport, handling about 80% of the air cargo traffic in the region. The company hopes that the new system will enhance its competitiveness and improve its service to customers.
According to HACTL, the computerised memory system will include a centralised database that will collect and store information on cargo shipments. The database will be accessible by all employees involved in cargo handling, including security personnel, customs officers, and airline staff. The system will use advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence to process the information and generate alerts for potential errors or discrepancies.
One of the key benefits of the new system is that it will enable HACTL to improve its compliance with regulatory requirements. Hong Kong has recently introduced new regulations on air cargo security, which require cargo terminals to maintain accurate records of all cargo shipments and provide real-time information to customs authorities. The computerised memory system will help HACTL meet these requirements by providing a fast and reliable way to retrieve and share information with relevant parties.
HACTL expects the new system to be fully operational by the end of 2021. The company has already started training its staff on how to use the system and plans to conduct a series of tests to ensure its reliability and accuracy. The development of the computerised memory system is a significant investment for HACTL, but the company believes that it will bring long-term benefits in terms of operational efficiency, cost savings, and customer satisfaction.
