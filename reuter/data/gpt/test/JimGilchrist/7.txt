Hong Kong's New Airport Could Have World's Highest Landing Fees, IATA Expresses Concerns
Hong Kong is all set to welcome its new airport, known as the Third Runway System (TDS), but one of its features – high landing fees – has raised concerns among the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
According to reports, the TDS project is expected to cost about HK$141.5 billion ($18.2 billion), and is aimed at addressing issues related to air traffic congestion and accommodating the growing number of passengers, which was about 75 million in 2019.
While the expansion of the airport is expected to boost tourism and trade for the city, IATA is worried that the high landing and parking fees could lead to fewer flights and negatively impact the local economy.
"The IATA is concerned about the high costs that will be associated with the new Hong Kong Third Runway," stated a press release by the association. "These costs will be felt by the airlines, ultimately leading to fewer flights and reduced connectivity. This could hamper the growth of Hong Kong as a hub for trade and commerce, and negatively impact the wider economy."
IATA further stated that Hong Kong already has relatively high airport fees, which combined with the expected increase in landing fees, could potentially make it one of the most expensive airports in the world to operate in.
"The world's airlines are very cost-sensitive, and make their decisions based on the competitiveness of the airports they operate from," said IATA Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac.
Hong Kong's airport is one of the busiest and most important airports in the region, serving as a hub connecting Asia with the rest of the world. It is also a vital cargo hub, accounting for over 40% of all air cargo that passes through Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong Airport Authority has defended the high landing fees by stating that it is necessary to offset the costs of the TDS project, which will help the airport become more efficient and accommodate the increase in passengers.
"We have been working closely with all our airline partners to ensure a smooth transition to the new TDS airport, which will provide more capacity to meet future demand," said a spokesperson for Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department. "The cost of running the airport is high, but it is necessary to ensure that the new TDS project is successful and that the airport remains a world-class facility."
However, some experts argue that the high landing fees could discourage airlines from operating in Hong Kong, especially in today's economic climate, where airlines are struggling to stay afloat due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Hong Kong should strike a balance between cost and competitiveness," said Winnie Cheung, an aviation analyst at Hang Seng Management College. "If airlines are hit with higher landing fees, they will likely look to reduce their operations, which could lead to a drop in passenger numbers and negatively impact the wider economy."
The expansion of Hong Kong's airport has been under discussion for over a decade and was approved by the government in 2016. The TDS project is expected to be completed by 2024 and will include a new runway, a new passenger terminal and other related infrastructure.
While the concerns expressed by IATA are valid, it remains to be seen how the high landing fees will impact Hong Kong's position as an aviation hub. The city has weathered numerous storms in the past and has emerged as one of the most important aviation hubs in the region, and it is hoped that the new TDS airport will further boost its position.
