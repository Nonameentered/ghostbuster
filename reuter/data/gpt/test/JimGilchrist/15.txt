Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminal's SuperTerminal 1, the largest air cargo handling facility in the world, will only be 50% operational when the city's new airport opens in April 1998. This announcement was made by Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) on Wednesday.
The decision was made due to the fact that the cargo handling facility is yet to receive the necessary approvals and licenses from the government. This means that the cargo terminal will not be able to operate at full capacity when the new airport at Chek Lap Kok officially opens.
"SuperTerminal 1 is an intricate facility with a complex operating environment. It requires various licenses and approvals before it can be fully operational," said HACTL's Managing Director, Andrew Tse.
Tse, however, assured that the terminal will still be able to handle the expected volumes of air cargo despite the partial operational status. "Our team has been working tirelessly to prepare for the opening of the new airport. While we may not be operating at full capacity, our team is ready to handle the increasing demand for air cargo services in Hong Kong," he added.
SuperTerminal 1 spans an area of 105,000 square meters and was built at a cost of HKD 2.5 billion. It was designed to handle a wide range of cargo, from perishables to dangerous goods, and has state-of-the-art facilities such as a fully automated storage and retrieval system.
The new airport at Chek Lap Kok is set to replace the current Hong Kong International Airport at Kai Tak, which has been operating since 1925. The new airport is located on reclaimed land and has been built to accommodate the increasing demand for air travel in the region.
The partial operational status of SuperTerminal 1 will not only impact HACTL but also the airlines and shippers who rely on the terminal for their cargo handling needs. The Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics (HAFFA) has expressed concern over the situation, calling for swift action from the government to resolve the issue.
"We urge the government to expedite the necessary approvals and licenses for SuperTerminal 1. The smooth operation of the cargo terminal is critical to the success of Hong Kong's logistics industry," said Brian Wu, Chairman of HAFFA.
The Hong Kong government has acknowledged the concerns and has promised to work towards a solution. "We understand the importance of SuperTerminal 1 to Hong Kong's logistics industry and will do everything we can to ensure that the cargo terminal is fully operational as soon as possible," said a spokesperson from the Transport and Housing Bureau.
The partial operational status of SuperTerminal 1 may cause some initial inconvenience, but it is expected that the issues will be resolved in due course. The new airport is set to open on April 6, 1998, and is a key milestone in Hong Kong's development as a global transportation hub.
