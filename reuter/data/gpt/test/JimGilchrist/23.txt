Effective January 1st, the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents (HAFFA) will increase some of their freight charges. The association includes over 1,000 logistics companies and freight forwarders in Hong Kong.
According to HAFFA, the increase is due to rising operating costs, particularly in labor and transportation. The association also cited the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, which has caused disruptions in the global supply chain.
The freight charges that will be increased include delivery, handling, and documentation fees for certain goods. The cost of importing and exporting some types of goods, such as electronics and machinery, may also be affected.
HAFFA has assured customers that the increases will be kept to a minimum, and that the association will continue to provide efficient and high-quality services. The association has advised its members to notify their customers of the changes as soon as possible, so that pricing adjustments can be made.
“We understand that this may cause some inconvenience, but we believe that this is necessary in order to maintain the sustainability of our operations,” said a spokesperson for HAFFA.
The increase in freight charges by HAFFA is part of a larger trend in the logistics industry, as companies around the world struggle to keep up with rising costs and increasing complexity in global trade.
