Air Foyle, a UK-based aviation company, announced early this week that it will deploy flight simulators into China as a strategic move to expand its business in the country. Installation of the flight simulator will allow Air Foyle to train pilots and provide maintenance services to Chinese aviation companies.
The move comes as the Chinese economy bounces back after the Covid-19 pandemic, and the aviation sector is set to grow in this period. As China's aviation industry expands, the demand for skilled personnel and maintenance is also expected to increase, and Air Foyle has positioned itself to take advantage of these opportunities.
"Air Foyle has been in the aviation industry for almost four decades, and our experience can be utilised to train nascent pilots and to provide maintenance expertise," said the CEO of Air Foyle, Steven Harris.
The company plans to deploy two types of simulators into China, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, which will allow pilots to train in both narrow and wide-body aircraft types.
"Our two simulators will enable pilots to conduct full-flight simulations, providing an accurate and realistic training environment that simulates flight scenarios safely and effectively," said Harris.
The simulators have been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority and meet the regulatory requirements set by the Chinese aviation authority.
Air Foyle will collaborate with local Chinese companies to provide comprehensive and targeted training programs that will meet the demand of Chinese aviation businesses. Apart from pilot training, Air Foyle will also offer programs for technicians and engineers to help maintain the simulators and aircraft.
"Training and maintenance do not only benefit the airlines but also ultimately improve safety for air travellers," noted Harris.
The agreement between Air Foyle and its Chinese partners is expected to foster closer cooperation between organisations. Air Foyle will also share its aviation experience and know-how with its Chinese partners.
The development is great news for Air Foyle as it seeks to expand its business beyond the UK and compete in the global aviation market. The move will offer the company a new revenue stream as China keeps on rising as a global economic powerhouse.
"We believe this collaboration will significantly contribute to the growth of the aviation industry in China and beyond and present opportunities for further business development for Air Foyle," stated Harris.
The flight simulators are expected to be installed before the end of the year and will begin operating immediately, with the aim of training the first group of Chinese pilots by the first quarter of next year. 
In conclusion, Air Foyle's decision to deploy flight simulators in China is a strategic move aimed at expanding its business and positioning itself in the global aviation market. The move will also help address the pilot and maintenance training gap in China and give Air Foyle a strategic advantage in the growing aviation industry.
