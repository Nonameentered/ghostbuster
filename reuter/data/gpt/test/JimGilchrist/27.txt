KLM Cargo, the air cargo division of the Dutch airline KLM, has announced that it plans to increase air cargo rates in Northern Asia by 5-10%. The increase in rates is expected to take effect from the beginning of next quarter. The move comes as part of KLM Cargo's efforts to improve its profitability in the region.
The announcement was made in response to the increasing demand for air cargo services in Northern Asia. According to KLM Cargo, the increase in rates is necessary to cover the cost of additional investments that the company has made in the region. This includes the expansion of its cargo facilities, the hiring of additional staff, and the acquisition of new aircraft.
While the news of the rate increase may be unwelcome for some customers, KLM Cargo has emphasized that it remains committed to providing high-quality services at competitive prices. The company has said that it will continue to work closely with its customers to ensure that their needs are met and to explore new ways to add value to their businesses.
The move comes at a time when air cargo demand is beginning to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air cargo volumes in Asia-Pacific grew by 9.5% in January 2021 compared to the same period last year. The increase in demand has been driven by the growth of e-commerce and the need for medical supplies and vaccines.
KLM Cargo is not the only airline that has announced an increase in air cargo rates. Other airlines including Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Lufthansa Cargo have also raised their rates in response to increasing demand for air cargo services. However, KLM Cargo's rate increase is likely to have the greatest impact in Northern Asia where the airline is one of the largest carriers.
In conclusion, KLM Cargo's decision to increase air cargo rates in Northern Asia reflects the growing demand for air cargo services in the region. While the rate increase may be unwelcome news for some customers, KLM Cargo has emphasized that it remains committed to providing high-quality services at competitive prices.
