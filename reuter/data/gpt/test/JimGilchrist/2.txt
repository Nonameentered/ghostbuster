Cathay Pacific Airways, one of the world's leading airlines, has announced the successful testing of a new, innovative coating on its aircraft that could revolutionize air travel and reduce fuel costs. The coating, inspired by the skin of sharks, is designed to lower air resistance and improve fuel efficiency by up to 1%. 
Developed by the aviation company, Shark Solutions, the coating mimics the natural denticles on the skin of sharks, which reduce drag and increase speed when swimming through water. The coating is made up of thousands of tiny, tooth-like structures that are only a few micrometers in size and arranged in a way that minimizes turbulence. 
Cathay Pacific Airways conducted a series of wind-tunnel tests on a scale model of the Airbus A350-1000, currently the airline's flagship aircraft. The results showed that the shark skin coating reduced drag by approximately 5%, resulting in a fuel consumption reduction of up to 1%. This not only saves fuel, but it also reduces greenhouse gas emissions and makes air travel more environmentally friendly. 
"We are always on the lookout for innovative technologies that can help us reduce our carbon footprint and provide a better experience for our passengers," said Mark Hoey, Cathay Pacific's General Manager of Engineering. "By testing the shark skin coating, we are exploring new ways to make our aircraft more fuel-efficient and sustainable."
Shark Solutions, the company behind the technology, says their product is more durable and longer-lasting than traditional coatings and would require less maintenance and repair. The company states that the coating can be applied to any commercial aircraft, including new and existing ones, which could potentially save millions of dollars in fuel costs for airlines around the world. 
The successful testing of the shark skin coating is a promising development for the aviation industry, which is facing mounting pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. If the coating is approved for commercial use, it could transform air travel by making it more eco-friendly, cost-effective and efficient. Cathay Pacific Airways plans to continue the research and development of the technology with hopes of implementing it on its aircraft fleet in the near future.
