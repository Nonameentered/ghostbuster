Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminal Sets New Record Handling 5,700 Tonnes in One Day
The Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminal (HACTL) has set a new record for handling air cargo in a single day by processing 5,700 tonnes on 14 October 2021. The accomplishment is an indication of the tremendous agility and determination of Hong Kong's cargo industry amid the pandemic.
The record-breaking day was fueled by a massive growth in demand for pandemic-related products, such as medical and protective equipment. To meet the robust cargo demands, HACTL expanded its handling capacity by adding more staff, equipment, and infrastructure.
The Hong Kong airport's air cargo sector has played an indispensable role during the pandemic. Hong Kong's strategic location and world-class infrastructure have helped the city become a gateway for the world's air cargo sector, contributing to its status as a global logistics hub.
Despite the pandemic, Hong Kong has been able to maintain a high degree of efficiency by implementing comprehensive health and safety measures to ensure the safety of the cargo handlers and to minimize disruptions to the supply chain.
HACTL's latest accomplishment underscores Hong Kong's solid commitment to maintaining its status as a leading air cargo industry hub in the region, even during challenging times.
