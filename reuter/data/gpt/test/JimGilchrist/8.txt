The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has expressed support for a new plan aimed at creating a unified air traffic control system in China's Pearl River delta region.
The plan, which was recently proposed by China's civil aviation authority, aims to improve safety and efficiency in the region's airspace by integrating air traffic control services across the cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Hong Kong.
According to the IATA, the move towards a unified air traffic control system in the Pearl River delta region could bring major benefits to airlines, passengers, and the wider aviation industry.
By streamlining airspace management and reducing congestion and delays, the plan could help to increase airspace capacity and improve operational efficiency, as well as enhancing safety and security.
Furthermore, the IATA noted that the integration of air traffic control services across different jurisdictions could help to reduce costs and increase competitiveness in the region, which is home to some of China's major aviation hubs and is a key gateway to the rest of Asia.
In a statement, IATA Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac welcomed the proposed plan, saying that it "demonstrates China's commitment to enhancing safety and efficiency in its aviation industry, as well as its willingness to collaborate with the wider international aviation community to achieve these goals".
The IATA's support for the plan comes as part of a wider effort to improve air traffic control and airspace management across the Asia-Pacific region, which remains one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets but faces significant challenges in managing air traffic growth and enhancing safety and efficiency.
In recent years, the IATA has worked closely with governments and industry stakeholders across the region to promote regulatory harmonization, infrastructure development, and operational best practices, with the aim of ensuring that the Asia-Pacific region remains a key driver of global aviation growth and innovation in the years to come.
