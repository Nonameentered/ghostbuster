British Airways World Cargo, one of the leading air freight carriers, has announced an increase in the ex-Hong Kong market rates to account for the rising fuel prices. The carrier has reportedly raised the rates by HK$1.50 per kilogram, effective immediately. The move comes in response to the rising fuel costs in the aviation sector, driven by the recent surge in oil prices.
According to the company, the increase in rates will help them offset the additional fuel costs and maintain the level of service quality and reliability that their customers expect. The increase in rates is expected to impact all destinations served by the carrier from Hong Kong.
The move by British Airways World Cargo is in line with the industry trend, as several other airlines and air freight carriers have also announced similar increases in recent weeks. The rising fuel prices have put pressure on the aviation sector, which is already grappling with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel and cargo demand.
Despite the challenges, British Airways World Cargo remains optimistic about the future of the air freight industry, citing the positive growth prospects in emerging markets and the potential for innovation and digitalization in logistics. The carrier is committed to supporting its customers and partners through the current challenges and maintaining a sustainable business model for the long term.
