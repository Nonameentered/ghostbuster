British Airways World Cargo has announced its plans to increase the number of freighter services between Hong Kong and London in 2022. The move aims to meet the growing demand for air cargo transportation services and enhance the airline's position as a leading player in the global air cargo market.
Starting in January 2022, British Airways World Cargo will operate four weekly flights between Hong Kong and London, up from the current three flights per week. The airline also plans to increase the cargo capacity of its Boeing 747-8F aircraft, which will be used on the route, by 16%.
The expanded service will provide customers with a faster, more frequent, and reliable transportation option for their air freight needs. It will also enable British Airways World Cargo to better serve the thriving Hong Kong market, which is a hub for trade between Asia and Europe.
Commenting on the announcement, British Airways World Cargo's Managing Director, Tom Mackenzie, said: "We are excited to be increasing our freighter services between Hong Kong and London in 2022. This investment underpins our commitment to meet our customers' needs by providing the highest level of service, frequency, and capacity on this important trade route."
The airline's expansion plans come amidst growing demand for reliable air cargo services amid the COVID-19 pandemic. With the global e-commerce market continuing to grow rapidly, the air cargo industry has seen significant growth in recent years. British Airways World Cargo's investment in its cargo operations is, therefore, a strategic move to capture this market growth and establish itself as a leader in the industry.
