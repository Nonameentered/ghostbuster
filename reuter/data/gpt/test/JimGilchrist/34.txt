Dutch cargo airline Martinair has launched a new freighter service between Guangzhou and Amsterdam, marking a historic moment for the company.
The first flight carrying goods departed from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport on Monday, marking the start of what Martinair calls "a game-changer" for its business.
The service will operate twice a week, with a stopover in Singapore. It will offer customers a new route for shipping products between Asia and Europe, with a transit time of just two to three days.
"The launch of this service is truly historic for our company," said Pieter Elbers, CEO of Martinair.
"We have been serving the Chinese market for over 25 years, but this new freighter service takes our business to a new level.
"The Guangzhou-Amsterdam route is of huge importance to our customers, and we are thrilled to be offering them a faster and more efficient way to transport their goods."
The new service will be operated using a Boeing 747-400ERF aircraft, with a maximum payload capacity of 110 tonnes.
Martinair says the aircraft is ideally suited to the needs of customers shipping high-value, time-sensitive cargo, such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, and perishable goods.
The launch of the new service comes at a time of growing demand for air cargo services, driven in part by the rise of online shopping and the pandemic-fueled shift away from sea-based shipping.
Martinair said it expects the Guangzhou-Amsterdam route to be a major driver of its growth over the next few years, as it seeks to expand its footprint in key markets across Asia and beyond.
