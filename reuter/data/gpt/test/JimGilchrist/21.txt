Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL) has proudly announced its ability to handle dangerous live snake cargoes for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). HACTL is the first company in Hong Kong to be given the green light to handle such high-risk cargoes.
The live snakes are used in various TCM treatments that have been passed down for generations. These include remedies for rheumatism, arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions. The demand for these treatments has been rising in recent years, leading to an increase in the amount of live snakes transported through Hong Kong.
HACTL has met strict safety and security requirements to handle the dangerous cargo. Its state-of-the-art facilities and professional staff ensure that these live animals are transported safely and humanely. HACTL even provides exclusive air conditioning and ventilation systems to ensure the snakes are kept in the optimal conditions for their well-being.
“HACTL is proud to have been selected by the TCM industry to handle such important and sensitive cargo. We understand the need for safe and effective transport of live animals, and we are confident that our capabilities will offer the highest level of care during transit,” said HACTL's CEO, Wilson Kwong.
The TCM industry has expressed its gratitude towards HACTL for its ability to handle the dangerous live snake cargoes. “We are impressed with HACTL's ability to meet our strict safety and security requirements. We value our relationship with HACTL and look forward to continued successful partnerships in the future,” said a TCM spokesperson.
HACTL's ability to handle these cargoes highlights the company's commitment to providing the highest level of service and safety to all its customers.
