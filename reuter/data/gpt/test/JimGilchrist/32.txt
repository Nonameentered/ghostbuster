Hong Kong's air cargo industry is set to experience a significant boost in efficiency with the introduction of a first-of-its-kind computerised rota system. The system is being pioneered by a group of workers in the industry in partnership with logistic software company, CargoSmart.
The computerised system is designed to replace the existing manual rota system that is currently in use across the industry. The new system has been created to streamline the process of assigning shifts and duties for cargo workers, resulting in improved efficiency and a reduction in errors.
The introduction of this innovative technology comes as the industry has experienced a significant increase in demand for air freight cargo services across Asia, with Hong Kong being one of the key hubs in the region. The increased demand has put pressure on the industry to improve its operations and ensure maximum efficiency.
Speaking on the new development, Mr. Leonard Chan, Operations Manager at CargoSmart, said: "This is a unique system that will revolutionize how the cargo industry operates. We are proud to be working with industry workers to create a tailor-made system that will improve the overall efficiency in this important sector."
The new system will allow workers to easily view their schedules and duties, sign up for shifts and manage their working hours. It will also enable managers to better allocate resources and assign duties, ensuring that the right person is in the right place at the right time.
The system is set to be launched later this year, with workers undergoing training to ensure a smooth transition to the new platform. This latest development is expected to improve the overall efficiency of the air cargo industry in Hong Kong, cementing its position as a leading hub for air freight in the region.
