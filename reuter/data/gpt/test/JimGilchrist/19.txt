Hong Kong officials have launched a new campaign aimed at recruiting workers for the city's new airport at Chek Lap Kok. The airport, which is set to open later this year, will be a major hub for international flights and is expected to generate thousands of jobs.
According to sources, the recruitment drive will target individuals from a range of backgrounds, including recent graduates, seasoned professionals, and individuals looking for a career change. The campaign is expected to run for several months and will involve outreach efforts to local communities, career fairs, and online advertisements.
Officials have said that the recruitment campaign is a critical part of the airport's preparations for its launch later this year. The airport is expected to handle a significant amount of cargo and passenger traffic, which will require a large workforce to manage efficiently.
Hong Kong officials have also emphasized the importance of building a diverse and skilled workforce for the airport to ensure its success. This includes hiring people from different backgrounds, including women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities.
"We want to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to be a part of this exciting project," said a spokesperson for the Hong Kong government. "We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce that can adapt to the needs of the airport and meet the demands of the global aviation industry."
The new airport at Chek Lap Kok will replace Hong Kong's existing airport, which has been in operation for over two decades. The new facility will feature state-of-the-art technology and infrastructure, including smart systems for luggage handling and advanced security measures.
Officials are confident that the new airport will put Hong Kong back on the map as a major player in the global aviation industry. They have also stressed that the airport will play a critical role in the city's economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic.
"We see the new airport as a symbol of resilience and progress for Hong Kong," said the spokesperson. "It's a major investment in our future and a source of pride for our city."
