The Canadian Trade Minister is under immense pressure to promote the importance of free trade at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting, scheduled to take place next month. The stakes are high as the meeting will lay the groundwork for future trade negotiations, directly impacting Canada's economic growth and competitiveness on a global scale.
The Canadian Government, under Justin Trudeau, has long advocated for free trade and the benefits it brings. However, recent trade negotiations have been fraught with challenges, and Canada's stance on free trade has been weakened by growing protectionism in some countries, most notably the United States.
With the global pandemic impacting the world's economies, trade ministers at the APEC meeting are expected to focus on areas of cooperation that can bolster recovery efforts. The Canadian Trade Minister, Mary Ng, has been urged to use this platform to push for a renewed commitment to free trade in the region.
The stakes are particularly high for Canada, with the Asia-Pacific region being one of its most significant trading partners. According to the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service, the region accounted for nearly half of the country's global exports in 2020, worth over $149 billion. In the same year, almost 60% of Canada's imports came from the region, worth over $220 billion.
The APEC meeting will provide an opportunity for Canada to strengthen its relationships with key partners, including Japan, South Korea, and China. However, tensions between Canada and China may pose a challenge, given ongoing trade disputes and the ongoing detention of two Canadians in China. Ng will need to carefully navigate these challenges to ensure Canada's interests are protected.
In addition to free trade, the APEC meeting will also focus on digital trade, another area where Canada has a keen interest. The world has increasingly moved to digital platforms, especially with the ongoing pandemic disrupting physical trade. In 2017, APEC members launched the Digital Economy Roadmap, which seeks to promote digital trade and integration in the region. Canada played an active role in shaping this roadmap, and Ng is expected to push for further progress on this front.
As the meeting approaches, the pressure on Mary Ng continues to mount. Her success in promoting free trade and securing favourable trade deals for Canada will have far-reaching consequences for the country's economy. If she succeeds, Canada will continue to reap the benefits of open trade, fueling economic growth and development for years to come.
