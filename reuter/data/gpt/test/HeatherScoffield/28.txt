Mudslinging Begins Ahead of Canadian Federal Election
As the Canadian federal election draws near, political parties have already begun mudslinging at each other. With just a few weeks left until the polls, it seems like nothing is off-limits in trying to gain an advantage over the opposition.
Starting with the ruling Liberal party, which has consistently topped the polls for months, opposition parties are intent on finding any weakness in their campaign. Criticizing the Liberal’s decision to call for an election in the middle of a pandemic has been the opposition’s main argument. The Conservatives especially have been ruthlessly attacking the Liberals, claiming that they could have put Canadians in danger because of the potential risks of voting in person.
The Conservatives have been pushing this argument hard on their social media platforms. The party’s leader, Erin O’Toole, has consistently accused the Liberals of calling an unnecessary election, which they believe Canadians don’t want. “Canadians are concerned with healthcare, the economy, and the future of our country,” O’Toole claims, “Not with going to the polls during a pandemic.”
On the other hand, the Liberal Party’s leader, Justin Trudeau, has maintained that the election call was done to ensure that the government gets a fresh mandate for the current challenging times. He claims that the Liberals have taken the right steps in combating the pandemic, and now it's time for Canadians to decide on the next government.
For their part, the New Democrats, who have been in third place in the polls, are focusing their attack on the Liberals. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, in a recent statement, criticized the Liberals for not doing enough to help Canadians face the pandemic's economic effects. Singh’s attack highlights the need for better social programs, affordable housing, and an increase in the minimum wage.
The Green Party, which is also contesting for seats in the parliament, is focusing on environmental policies. Their leader, Annamie Paul, claims that the Green Party is the only party that has a clear and powerful plan on how to tackle climate change. Paul argues that the Greens have the most comprehensive plan related to adapting to a low-carbon economy.
In conclusion, as the Canadian voter approaches the polling booths, the mudslinging campaign continues. It is expected that the coming weeks will only get more intense. It is also expected that all political parties in Canada will not miss any chance to provide ammunition to one another. At this point, it's up to voters to decide who they want to hear winning arguments from, by looking at the bigger picture related to healthcare, economy, and the future of their country.
