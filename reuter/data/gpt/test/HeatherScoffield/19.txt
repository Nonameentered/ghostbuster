Ottawa, Canada â€“ Amidst growing speculations of a potential interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada, Governor Tiff Macklem gave no clear indication on whether such a move would take place anytime soon.
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with the Senate's banking committee, Macklem said that the central bank was closely monitoring the economic recovery and inflation trends but refrained from commenting on a timeline for raising the interest rates.
"The recovery is underway, but we are still dealing with the pandemic, and we have to be cautious and data-dependent on when it's appropriate to withdraw monetary stimulus," Macklem said.
When asked about the impact of potential rate hikes in the United States on Canada's monetary policy, the Governor emphasized that the Bank of Canada would make decisions based on its domestic mandate and not follow the actions of other central banks.
"We understand the spillovers from the US economy, but our mandate is to target inflation and stabilize the economy in Canada, and we will do so in a way that is consistent with our mandate," Macklem added.
The Bank of Canada has kept its key interest rate at a record low of 0.25% since March 2020 to support the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with inflation rates hitting a decade-high of 4.1% in August, many experts predict that interest rates might have to go up earlier than initially anticipated.
Despite significant progress on the vaccination front and an uptick in economic activity, Macklem reiterated his cautious stance, citing the uncertainty surrounding the possible resurgence of COVID-19 due to new variants and other geopolitical risks.
He pointed out that the Bank of Canada would need to see a more sustained and robust economic recovery, with employment levels returning to pre-crisis levels and inflation moderating before it could consider lifting interest rates.
Macklem's comments have both reassured and disappointed investors, with some analysts arguing that the Bank of Canada should be more transparent about its future plans to prevent market volatility.
The Canadian dollar remained relatively stable after Macklem's announcement, trading around 0.7923 USD, reflecting the general market sentiment that the Bank of Canada would likely maintain its current monetary policy in the short term.
Overall, Macklem's speech has indicated that the Bank of Canada is closely monitoring economic trends and is willing to adapt policies if necessary. However, it remains unclear when the central bank will decide to impose an interest rate hike.
