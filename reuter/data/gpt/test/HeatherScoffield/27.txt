As Canadian citizens gear up for the federal election on October 21, mudslinging between candidates has already begun, with accusations of racism and sexism dominating the conversation.
The allegations of racism were sparked by a tweet from the Conservative Party, featuring a photo of Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau wearing brownface during a school event in 2001. The tweet labeled Trudeau as "not who he pretends to be" and accused him of "mocking people who don't look like him." The photo, which was published by Time Magazine just weeks before the election, has caused stir throughout the country and even sparked calls for Trudeau to resign as Prime Minister.
In response, Trudeau apologized for the "insensitive" photo and for his actions, stating that he "should have known better" but maintained that he was committed to "fighting racism and discrimination in all its forms." However, the controversy has given fuel to Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and his supporters, who have attacked the Prime Minister on all sides.
The Liberal Party, on the other hand, has been quick to accuse Scheer of being sexist, pointing to controversial comments he's made in the past regarding LGBTQ+ rights, women's reproductive choices, and other issues affecting marginalized groups. In one instance, Scheer stated that he was "pro-life" and would vote to overturn abortion laws if given the chance. The comments have led to widespread criticism, with many accusing Scheer of being out of touch with modern Canadian values.
Despite the accusations, both leaders have maintained that their campaigns are centered on the issues that matter most to Canadians, such as healthcare, education, and the economy. However, the mudslinging has led many voters to feel disillusioned with the political process and worried about the future direction of the country.
"It's really disappointing to see both sides stooping so low," said Toronto resident Sarah Jenkins. "I want to hear about policies and plans, not personal attacks and mudslinging. It's just not helpful."
As the election draws closer, many are worried that the accusations of racism and sexism will continue to dominate the campaign, overshadowing the real issues facing Canadians. However, some experts believe that the controversy could also lead to a broader conversation about racism and discrimination in Canada, and the need for more transparency and accountability among political leaders.
"At the end of the day, we need leaders who are committed to building a better, more inclusive Canada," said political analyst Jessica McKay. "That means challenging racism and sexism wherever it exists, and not shying away from difficult conversations. It may not always be comfortable, but it's necessary if we want to move forward as a country."
