Canada's Youth Unemployment Rate Threatens Re-Election for Liberal Party
The Canadian job market has been going through a rough patch, especially for young people. The latest data shows that the unemployment rate for Canadians aged between 15 and 24 is 15.7%, which is much higher than the national average of 8.1%. High unemployment rates among the youth population can have serious implications for society and the economy, and it could also threaten the Liberal Party's chances of re-election.
The numbers reveal that almost 600,000 Canadians aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed as of June 2021. This is not an unusual trend as even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world, youth unemployment in Canada was much higher than the overall national rate.
Experts are warning that high youth unemployment rates could hamper Canada's economic growth and lead to social unrest. Unemployment rates are higher among marginalized groups, including women and Indigenous peoples, further exacerbating income inequality.
But the issue of youth unemployment has a significant political dimension as well. According to a recent poll, almost 40% of Canadian youth believe that their job prospects are worse because of the pandemic, and they are blaming the current government for not doing enough to support them.
The Liberal Party led by Justin Trudeau won the last federal election with a slogan that promised to prioritize the welfare of Canadians, especially the youth. The party offered many campaign promises, including increasing work placements and on-the-job training opportunities for young people.
But three years later, the youth unemployment rate is still high, and the pandemic has only made things worse. The government has been criticized for not doing enough to create jobs or investment in education and training for young people.
If this trend continues, it could have disastrous political consequences for the Liberal Party. According to a poll, the issues of youth unemployment and underemployment are among the top five issues that Canadians care about in the upcoming federal election. If the Liberal Party fails to address these concerns, it could hurt its chances of re-election.
The Opposition parties see the high youth unemployment rate as a political opportunity. The Conservative Party has promised to create one million jobs in the next four years if they come to power. The New Democratic Party (NDP) wants to provide free post-secondary education and create a Clean Jobs Program that will create jobs in the renewable energy sector.
To address this issue, the Liberal Party has launched a Youth Employment Strategy, which aims to create new job opportunities by investing $5.7 billion over the next five years. The strategy includes several measures such as creating 766,000 work-integrated learning opportunities, providing wage subsidies, and offering tax credits to employers who hire young Canadians.
The government has also invested $2 billion in the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) to support students who have lost income or job opportunities because of the pandemic. The CESB has been extended until September 2021 as the government attempts to aid those affected by the pandemic.
In conclusion, youth unemployment poses a significant challenge for the Canadian government and the Liberal Party. With the fall federal election round the corner, Youth's issue has become a political hot potato. The failure to address this issue could have disastrous consequences for the party's re-election chances. The government needs to create more job opportunities and investment in education and training for young people to keep them working and voting.
