Montreal, Canada - The French-language debate in Canada's federal election came to an abrupt end on Wednesday after the moderator collapsed during the live broadcast. The incident caused immediate concern among the panelists and viewers, and the moderator was rushed to the hospital.
The debate was being broadcast from the Place des Arts theater in Montreal and was being moderated by Patrice Roy, a well-known journalist who anchors the evening news on Quebec's Radio-Canada. Roy was asking a question to one of the panelists when he suddenly fell forward and collapsed on the stage.
The panelists and the audience were visibly shaken by the incident, and the broadcast was immediately cut short. The debate was in its final stages, with only a few questions left before the end.
The Quebec health ministry confirmed that Roy was transported to a nearby hospital and that his condition is stable. The cause of his collapse is still unknown at this time.
The cancellation of the French-language debate came as a shock to many Canadians who were eagerly awaiting the final televised debate before the federal election on September 20. The debate was seen as a critical opportunity for the leaders of Canada's major political parties to make their final pitches to voters before election day.
The leaders of the major political parties expressed their concern for Roy in statements posted on social media.
"I'm sending my thoughts to Patrice Roy and his family, and I hope he recovers soon," tweeted Justin Trudeau, the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada and current Prime Minister of Canada.
Erin O'Toole, leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, tweeted: "Thinking of Patrice Roy tonight and wishing him a speedy recovery. My gratitude goes out to the first responders and medical professionals who are attending to him."
Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada, also tweeted his concern: "I'm very sorry to hear about the news of Patrice Roy's collapse during tonight's debate. My thoughts are with him and his family."
The organizers of the debate have not yet announced whether they will reschedule the French-language debate or if the other scheduled debates will proceed as planned.
