Bank of Canada Governor Gives No Hint on Possible Interest Rate Hike in Response to U.S. Actions.
Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said on Wednesday that there is no reason to change interest rates now, but that rates will eventually have to rise as the economy recovers.
"We're not there yet," Macklem said during a speech at the Toronto Region Board of Trade, referring to the timing of a rate hike.
Macklem also dismissed the idea that the Bank of Canada would make policy decisions based on what the U.S. Federal Reserve does. He said that policymakers in Canada would take into account economic conditions in Canada, rather than those in the U.S.
"We need to focus on what's happening in our own country," Macklem said.
The Bank of Canada has kept interest rates near zero since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The central bank has made it clear that it will keep rates low until the economy is back on track and inflation is closer to its target of 2%.
However, with the U.S. economy recovering at a faster pace than Canada's, some market watchers have speculated that the Bank of Canada may have to raise rates sooner than anticipated to prevent inflation from getting out of control.
Macklem acknowledged that the Bank of Canada is closely monitoring inflation, but insisted that any increase in rates would be guided by economic data from Canada, not the U.S.
"We expect inflation to be elevated over the coming months, but we anticipate that they will be transitory," Macklem said. "We will be watching carefully, but it's premature to talk about changes to interest rates."
The U.S. Federal Reserve has signaled that it may raise interest rates sooner than expected to combat inflation, but Macklem said that the Bank of Canada is not necessarily bound to follow suit.
"We'll make our own decisions based on Canadian data and Canadian circumstances," he said.
Macklem's remarks came as the Canadian dollar hit a six-year high against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, fueled by rising oil prices and a weaker U.S. currency.
The Bank of Canada is set to release its next interest rate decision on July 14.
