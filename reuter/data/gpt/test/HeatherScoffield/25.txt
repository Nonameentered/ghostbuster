Canada has taken a strong stance on the ongoing civil war in Zaire, calling for an African-led solution rather than Western intervention. The country’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Marc Garneau, made the statement during a virtual meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday.
The civil war in Zaire has been ongoing since August 1998, when rebel forces attempted to oust President Laurent-Désiré Kabila. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people and the displacement of millions. Both rebel groups and the government have been accused of human rights violations during the conflict.
Garneau stated that Canada “believes the resolution to the conflict must come from the African continent, as the region most affected by the conflict.” He further emphasized that Western nations should not intervene without the consent of African countries, arguing that such intervention could perpetuate colonialist attitudes and do more harm than good.
“We must be conscious of our past mistakes and learn from them,” Garneau said. “We cannot impose our will on the people of Zaire. We must work with African leaders and communities to find a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict.”
Canada’s position has been welcomed by several African countries, including South Africa, which has been involved in efforts to broker a peace agreement in Zaire. The United States and some European countries, however, have criticized Canada’s stance, arguing that the situation in Zaire requires urgent action.
“The situation in Zaire is dire and demands immediate intervention,” said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield during the Security Council meeting. “We cannot stand by and watch as innocent civilians suffer.”
Garneau rejected this argument, stating that Western intervention could exacerbate the conflict and lead to further instability. He called on the international community to support African-led initiatives, such as the ongoing peace talks being held in South Africa.
“Canada remains committed to working with our African partners to find a solution to the conflict in Zaire,” Garneau said. “We will continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of the people of Zaire above all else.”
