Leaders from Canada joined other representatives from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in pushing for trade liberalization in environmental goods and services during a recent meeting. The leaders discussed efforts to bolster sustainable and cleaner growth across the region and to increase global trade in environmentally friendly technologies and services.
Canada's commitment to environmental sustainability is no secret, and the country is keen on making global trade more sustainable. Experts believe that lowering trade barriers for environmental goods and services could have far-reaching benefits for clean growth and climate change mitigation across the Asia-Pacific region. It is in line with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's pledge to make Canada a leader in clean technology, renewable energy, and innovation.
During the meeting, Canada called on other APEC economies to reduce tariffs, trade barriers, and other restrictions on environmental goods and services. The country believes that removing such restrictions could generate significant economic benefits and help address global climate change issues effectively.
Currently, the APEC region generates over 60% of the world's GDP and accounts for around half of global trade. If environmental goods and services are traded more freely, it could potentially generate billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of economic growth and job creation opportunities.
Trade liberalization can also help tackle global issues such as pollution and climate change by making it more accessible for companies to acquire innovative solutions and services like renewable energy technology, low emission vehicles, and green infrastructure. This would aid in creating more low emission, sustainable, and resilient economies across the globe.
Ensuring growth, jobs, and opportunities are more sustainable in the future is also part of Canada's continuing commitment under the Paris Agreement. The country is working tirelessly towards meeting and strengthening its climate commitments and aims to have net-zero emissions by 2050. The transition to a low-carbon economy and a green recovery post COVID-19 stand as top priorities for Canada and its cohort of partners.
The Canadian government is aggressively pushing to develop and diversify its economy through environmental innovations and low emissions solutions. These efforts align perfectly with the country's active participation in international trade agreements, including its engagement in discussions surrounding the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). As part of the CPTPP, Canada is increasing trade with Asia-Pacific countries, including the United States, Mexico, Japan, and Vietnam, among others.
Canada is also committed to working through other international forums to promote the importance of liberalizing trade in goods and services that help the environment. The country aims to increase collaboration with other countries to promote free trade, promote transparency, and to strengthen multilateralism.
In conclusion, Canada believes that trade liberalization in environmental goods and services is an excellent way to promote long-term sustainability. With COVID-19 having a massive impact on global trade and a new emphasis on sustainable production, the time is ripe for countries to work together to promote free trade and open borders for environmentally friendly products.
The benefits of free trade widely benefit citizens within Canada and around the world. By seeking to liberalize trade in environmental goods and services, Canada believes that it can promote a cleaner, more sustainable, and prosperous future for all. Its commitment to cleaner and more sustainable growth is a reflection of the country's values and underscores the importance of working together towards a greener, more prosperous future. As APEC and other international organizations strive towards a cleaner, more sustainable world, Canada's relentless pursuit of sustainable innovation and clean growth is certainly worth emulating.
