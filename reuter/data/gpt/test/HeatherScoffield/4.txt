Bre-X Minerals Ltd., a Canadian mining company, has appointed J.P. Morgan as its financial adviser to search for a partner to develop its gold deposit in Indonesia. The Toronto-based company confirmed the agreement yesterday, noting that J.P. Morgan’s experience in the mining sector made it an ideal partner for the deal.
The gold deposit at Busang in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, was discovered in 1993 and came to international attention when Bre-X claimed it contained upwards of 70 million ounces of gold, making it the largest deposit in the world at the time. The company's shares rocketed, with investors keen to get in on the ground floor of what they imagined would be an incredible money-making venture. However, the deposit ended up being a dud, with fraud charges levied against Bre-X's key employees. Bre-X ultimately declared bankruptcy in 1997, sinking billions of dollars in investment.
Despite the well-documented failure of the Busang deposit, Bre-X’s current management believes that it still has value. CEO Mike de Guzman said in a statement that the company welcomes J.P. Morgan’s “expertise and resources” as it tries to attract a partner to develop Busang. Bre-X has a 60% stake in the Busang deposit, with the remainder controlled by Indonesia’s PT Freeport Indonesia.
The appointment of J.P. Morgan is the culmination of a long search for a financial adviser. Bre-X had previously retained BMO Nesbitt Burns, but the bank stepped down in 2020. J.P. Morgan was reportedly chosen for its experience in the mining sector as well as its global reach.
“We are excited to work with J.P. Morgan to explore potential partnerships that could enable the development of the Busang gold deposit in East Kalimantan, Indonesia,” Mr. de Guzman said. “J.P. Morgan’s strong reputation and expertise within the mining industry will provide valuable support as we continue to explore this opportunity and maximize the potential of our mining assets.”
The deposit at Busang has been described as epithermal, meaning it lies near the Earth’s surface. This makes it cheaper and easier to mine compared to other deposits that are buried deep underground. The location of the deposit, in a politically stable country, is also a positive factor in attracting a partner. Indonesia has a well-established mining industry, which contributes significantly to the country's economy.
Bre-X will likely be hoping that lightning strikes twice, despite the fact that the circumstances around the Busang deposit have left many skeptical of the company's claims. If the deposit contains even a fraction of the gold that Bre-X estimates, a partnership to develop the mine would be a lucrative opportunity for all involved. The company understands that it will need to work hard to convince potential partners that it is trustworthy, and that it has a viable plan for developing the deposit that can address lingering issues of trust and transparency.
J.P. Morgan will be tasked with helping Bre-X navigate the complex world of mine development partnerships. The bank will advise the company on issues related to partnering with another mining company, financing the deal, and all other aspects of the development process. The bank has a wealth of experience in this area; it recently advised Newmont Mining Corp. on a $10 billion deal that resulted in the creation of the world’s largest gold mining company.
Despite Bre-X’s checkered history, the company's management is convinced that it has a viable mining asset in the Busang deposit. The appointment of J.P. Morgan as its financial adviser is the latest step in the company’s efforts to find a partner to develop the mine. While it will be an arduous task, given the history of the deposit, many investors will be watching closely as the company looks to move forward. If it is successful, a partnership to develop Busang would be a huge opportunity for any mining company that is able to come on board.
