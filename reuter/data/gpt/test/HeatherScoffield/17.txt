Canada Raises Investment Requirements for Prospective Immigrants
The Canadian government has recently announced an increase in investment requirements for prospective immigrants. This new change will be applied to those who wish to apply for the Immigrant Investor Venture Capital (IIVC) program, a scheme that allows foreign nationals to become permanent residents of Canada through investing in and supporting innovative Canadian startups.
According to the new directives released by the government, applicants must invest a minimum of CAD 2 million (USD 1.53 million) into the IIVC fund, up from the previous minimum requirement of CAD 1.2 million (USD 920,000). In addition, investors must provide a net worth of at least CAD 10 million (USD 7.66 million), up from CAD 6 million (USD 4.6 million) under the previous rules.
The Canadian Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, Ahmed Hussen, says that this move will attract high-net-worth individuals who will make significant investments in the Canadian economy, thus creating jobs and driving innovation.
"Our new guidelines are designed to ensure that Canada continues to attract global investors who can make a significant investment in the Canadian economy and create good, well-paying jobs for middle-class Canadians. This also ensures that we continue to promote innovative Canadian startups and entrepreneurs," said Hussen.
The program first launched in 2015 and has since then brought CAD 1.4 billion (USD 1.07 billion) of investment into Canada. However, the approval rate for applicants has been relatively low, with only a small percentage of applicants being approved each year.
This change is said to be part of the Canadian government's efforts to streamline the IIVC program, making it more efficient and effective in attracting more foreign investors who will contribute to the country's economic growth.
Experts predict that this move will also encourage investors from other countries, particularly from Asia, to consider Canada as a viable option for investment and migration.
Applicants who meet the new investment requirements will be able to apply for the IIVC program starting on May 20, 2021.
