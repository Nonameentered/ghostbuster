Barrick Gold Corp., the world's largest gold mining company, has lost its bid to control the Busang gold deposit in Indonesia. The archipelago's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources announced on Monday that the concession would be awarded to PT. Bumi Resource Minerals Tbk, a domestic miner.
The decision marks a defeat for Barrick Gold's CEO, Mark Bristow, who had hoped to expand the Canadian company's footprint in Southeast Asia. Bristow, however, maintained a dignified tone in his response to the news.
"Obviously, we're disappointed," he said in a statement. "But we respect the decision of the Indonesian government, and we wish PT. Bumi Resource Minerals every success in their efforts to develop Busang for the benefit of all stakeholders."
Barrick Gold had been competing with several other bidders for the right to mine Busang, which is located in the central province of Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. The deposit has been estimated to contain up to 40 million ounces of gold.
Bristow had personally flown to Jakarta to meet with Indonesian officials to make the case for Barrick Gold's bid. He had pledged to invest $1.5 billion in the project and create thousands of jobs.
But the Indonesian government ultimately chose PT. Bumi Resource Minerals, which had partnered with local miner PT. Antam. The two companies had promised to invest $2 billion in the project and build a smelter to process the gold.
Indonesia has been trying to boost its domestic mining industry, which has been hampered by a lack of investment and outdated regulations. The country is one of the world's largest producers of nickel, but its gold reserves have been largely untapped.
The decision to award Busang to PT. Bumi Resource Minerals represents a step forward for the Indonesian government's efforts to attract foreign investment. The government had recently passed a law allowing foreign miners to control up to 100% of a mining project.
Bristow's response to the news was seen as a sign of his professionalism and respect for Indonesia's sovereignty.
"Mr. Bristow's statement shows his willingness to respect the decision of the Indonesian government, which is a good thing," said Ignasius Jonan, Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources.
The decision to award Busang to a domestic miner also represents a win for Indonesia's nationalist factions. Some groups had argued that allowing foreign miners to control the country's natural resources was a form of economic colonization.
The decision also reflects a trend of rising resource nationalism around the world, particularly in emerging economies like Indonesia. Governments are increasingly seeking to exert greater control over their resources and capture more of the profits generated by mining projects.
Bristow, however, expressed a more optimistic view of the future of mining in Indonesia.
"We remain committed to investing in this wonderful country and the people of Indonesia," he said. "We believe there are many other opportunities for our industry to contribute to the development of Indonesia's economy and society in a responsible and sustainable manner."
Bristow's gracious response to defeat has won him plaudits from the mining industry and the wider business community. It is also seen as a signal of Barrick Gold's commitment to responsible and sustainable mining practices.
The decision to award Busang to PT. Bumi Resource Minerals is likely to be seen as a victory for the Indonesian government, but it remains to be seen whether the domestic miner can deliver on its promises to develop the project. The country's mining industry is still grappling with a host of regulatory and environmental challenges, but the government's efforts to attract investment are a step in the right direction.
