Inco's Voisey's Bay project faces a "tight" deadline to meet its 1998 production start date, says new president
After years of planning and preparation, Inco's Voisey's Bay project is facing a tight deadline to meet its 1998 production start date. According to the new president of Inco, Alex Shaben, the project is at risk of being delayed due to a lack of infrastructure and support services needed for the nickel-cobalt-copper mine located in northeastern Canada.
Shaben, who took over as president of Inco earlier this year, spoke to reporters about the challenges facing the Voisey's Bay project. "We are facing a very tight deadline to get this mine up and running by 1998," he said. "There are a number of infrastructure projects that need to be completed, as well as support services that need to be in place for us to be able to meet that deadline."
One of the biggest challenges facing the project is the lack of an all-weather road connecting the mine site to the nearest town, Goose Bay. Inco has been working with the government of Newfoundland and Labrador to secure funding for the construction of the road, but as of now, no funding has been approved.
"We are hopeful that the government will come through with the funding that we need to build this road," said Shaben. "Without it, we will not be able to transport the materials and equipment needed to get this mine up and running."
In addition to the road, the project also needs a new power transmission line to be built, as well as upgrades to the local airport to accommodate the increased traffic. "These are not small projects," said Shaben. "They require a lot of time, resources, and coordination to get done."
Despite these challenges, Shaben remains optimistic about the project's future. "The potential of the Voisey's Bay mine is enormous," he said. "It is a world-class deposit that has the potential to be one of the largest and most profitable mines in the world."
Inco has invested over $1 billion in the project so far, and expects to spend another $1 billion before the mine is fully operational. The mine is expected to produce 40,000 tonnes of nickel, 2,600 tonnes of copper, and 1,600 tonnes of cobalt per year for at least 20 years.
The project has been controversial from the start, with some local residents and environmental groups raising concerns about the potential impact of mining on the fragile ecosystem of the region. Inco has taken steps to address these concerns, including setting up an independent environmental monitoring program and partnering with local Indigenous communities to ensure that their interests and concerns are taken into account.
Despite these efforts, some people remain skeptical about the project's impact. "We are concerned about the long-term impact of mining on the environment and on our way of life," said Mary Simon, head of the Inuit Sivaqti Inuksuk Land Claims Organization. "We need to ensure that the benefits of this project are shared fairly and that the environment is protected for future generations."
Inco has said that it is committed to working with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that the project is developed in a responsible and sustainable manner. "We understand the concerns that people have, and we are taking steps to address them," said Shaben. "We believe that this project can be a win-win for everyone, but we need to work together to make it happen."
With the clock ticking down to the 1998 production start date, Inco and its partners will need to work quickly and diligently to overcome the challenges facing the Voisey's Bay project. If successful, the project has the potential to bring significant economic benefits to the region and to establish Canada as a major player in the global mining industry.
