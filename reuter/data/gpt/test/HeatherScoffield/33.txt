New Delhi: The leaders of the Quad â€“ an informal strategic alliance comprising the United States, Japan, India, and Australia, have recently expressed their eagerness to strike a deal on opening up financial services markets in their respective countries.
The Quad leaders have reportedly been discussing ways to deepen their economic ties and increase collaboration in key sectors, such as trade, investment, and finance. Opening up the financial services sector is seen as one way to boost economic growth and increase access to capital for businesses.
The Quad is already moving forward on a proposed infrastructure investment plan that seeks to promote sustainable development in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as on joint efforts to tackle climate change.
"A deepening of our economic ties can, in turn, be a bulwark against external economic coercion," said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking at a virtual Quad summit on Friday.
According to analysts, the Quad's focus on financial services is significant given the growing importance of digital finance and the need for financial inclusion in many developing countries.
"Financial services can help create jobs and increase economic growth, but it can also help address inequality and improve access to financial services for underserved populations," said Nitin Kumar, an economist at London-based consultancy InvestIndia.
Currently, some of the Quad's member countries have strict regulations on foreign investment in their financial services markets. For example, India requires foreign banks to have a minimum of $20 billion in assets to open a subsidiary in the country. Japan and Australia also have restrictions on foreign ownership of certain financial assets.
The Quad leaders hope that by easing these regulations and facilitating cross-border investment in financial services, they can increase competition, boost innovation, and reduce costs for consumers.
"We are optimistic that Quad countries will collaborate on developing a common platform for cross-border trade in financial services, as well as work on harmonizing regulatory frameworks," said Yoshihide Suga, the Prime Minister of Japan, at the summit.
The Quad's push for greater collaboration in financial services comes amid growing geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. The United States and China, in particular, have engaged in a bitter trade war over the past few years, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods and services.
The Quad has sought to position itself as a counterweight to China's increasing influence in the region, with all four member states expressing concern over China's territorial claims in the South China Sea.
However, the Quad leaders have emphasized that their alliance is not intended to be a military bloc, but rather a grouping of like-minded countries committed to upholding democratic and international norms.
"We are well aware that this Quad initiative has raised concerns in certain quarters. We have no intention of putting anyone in a tight spot, much less confronting anyone," said Modi.
The Quad's focus on financial services is also seen as a means of countering China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has financed billions of dollars' worth of infrastructure projects in developing countries across Asia, Africa, and Europe.
The BRI has been criticized by many countries, including the United States, for promoting what they see as China's strategic interests and creating debt traps for developing countries.
The Quad's proposed infrastructure investment plan, known as the Blue Dot Network, is seen as a more transparent and sustainable alternative to the BRI.
"We welcome the Blue Dot Network as a tool for promoting sustainable development and addressing some of the criticisms leveled against the BRI," said Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
The Quad leaders have pledged to continue working towards a deal on opening up financial services markets, with a view to finalizing an agreement in the near future.
