Toronto-based mining company, Barrick Gold Corp, has recently surpassed South African rival, Gold Fields, to become the world's second largest gold producer. This milestone for Barrick comes after the company's acquisition of Randgold Resources last year.
According to data from mining consultants, Metals Focus, Barrick produced 5.5 million ounces of gold in 2018, while Gold Fields produced 2.04 million ounces. Barrick's increased production can largely be attributed to the Randgold deal, which brought in several high-quality mines in Africa.
The deal also allowed Barrick to reduce its net debt by $1.3 billion and enabled the company to focus on its core assets. Since the acquisition, Barrick has been working to improve efficiency and productivity across their operations, which has led to increased output.
Barrick's CEO, Mark Bristow, commented on the company's latest achievement saying, "This milestone is a clear indication that our strategy and our approach to managing our business is working. We remain focused on growing our business through investment in new mines and exploration, as well as continued cost-cutting efforts."
Gold mining has been a highly competitive industry for years, with mining companies from around the world vying for the top spot. The world's largest gold producer is currently Newmont Mining, which produced 6.3 million ounces of gold in 2018. Barrick's achievement puts them ahead of AngloGold Ashanti, which produced 3.4 million ounces, and Kinross Gold, which produced 2.5 million ounces.
Experts say that Barrick's success may encourage other mining companies to explore similar mergers and acquisitions in order to increase production and market share. However, some also caution that the company must continue to focus on maintaining productivity and efficiency in order to sustain their position as the world's second largest gold producer.
Gold continues to be a valuable commodity in the global economy, with rising demand from emerging markets and a growing appetite from investors. With this latest accomplishment, Barrick is in a strong position to capitalize on these trends and continue to grow its business in the future.
