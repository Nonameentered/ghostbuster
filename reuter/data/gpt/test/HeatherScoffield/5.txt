Bre-X Minerals, a Canadian mining company, announced today that it has begun its search for a partner to help develop its recently acquired gold discovery in Indonesia. The company has been exploring the area for several years, and discovered a significant gold deposit in a remote part of the country in 2020.
The new gold deposit is located in the Borneo region of Indonesia, and covers an area of approximately 70 square kilometers. According to preliminary estimates, the deposit contains more than 20 million ounces of gold, making it one of the largest discoveries in recent years.
"We are very excited about this discovery," said Bre-X CEO John Felderhof. "It is a significant find that has the potential to transform our company and the entire mining industry in Indonesia."
Felderhof said that the company is now looking for a partner to help develop the project, and is open to talking to both local and international companies.
"We are looking for a partner who shares our vision for responsible mining and is committed to working with us to create a world-class mining operation that benefits local communities and the environment," he said.
Bre-X has a strong track record of responsible mining practices, and has been recognized for its efforts to minimize the environmental impact of its operations and promote community development.
"We take our responsibility to the environment and local communities very seriously," Felderhof said. "We believe that responsible mining is not only good for the environment, but also good for the long-term success of our company."
Bre-X has already completed a feasibility study for the project, which found that the deposit is economically viable and could support a large-scale mining operation. The company has also secured all necessary permits and approvals from the Indonesian government.
Felderhof said that the company is now ready to move forward with developing the project, but wants to find the right partner to help it do so.
"We want to make sure that we work with a partner who shares our commitment to responsible mining and who can help us deliver this project to the highest possible standards," he said.
Bre-X's decision to seek a partner for the project has been welcomed by the Indonesian government, which has been actively promoting investment in the country's mining sector.
"We are very excited about the potential of this project," said Indonesian Minister for Mines and Energy, Arifin Tasrif. "We believe that it has the potential to create significant economic benefits for the country and its people."
Tasrif said that the Indonesian government is committed to working with investors to create a conducive environment for mining investment in the country.
"We are aware of the challenges that the mining industry faces, and we are working to address them," he said. "We believe that responsible mining can bring significant benefits to our country, and we are committed to working with investors who share our vision for sustainable mining."
Bre-X's search for a partner is expected to attract interest from a range of mining companies, both large and small. The company has already received expressions of interest from several potential partners, and is expected to make a decision on a partner in the coming months.
"We are confident that we will find the right partner to help us develop this project," Felderhof said. "We believe that this gold discovery has the potential to transform our company and the entire mining industry in Indonesia, and we look forward to working with a partner who shares our vision."
