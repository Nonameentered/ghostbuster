In a stunning turn of events, Barrick Gold Corp. has secured the upper hand in the fight for control of the coveted Busang gold find in Indonesia. The Canadian mining giant has overcome a bitter dispute with local partner, PT Antam (Persero) Tbk, which had threatened to derail the project altogether.
The Busang mine is estimated to hold a massive 28 million ounces of gold, worth as much as $40 billion at current prices. The find was first discovered in 1990 by Australian miner, Canadian gold mining magnate John Felderhof, and was later purchased by Bre-X Minerals. However, in 1997, a scandal erupted when it was discovered that the find was a fake and that many of the sampled had been salted with gold by Bre-X employees.
Despite the scandal, the Busang region continued to be highly prospective and has attracted numerous mining companies over the years. Barrick, which is the world's largest gold mining company, initially entered the fray in 2016, when it acquired a 75% stake in PT Indo Rak Resources, a Singapore-based company that controlled the Busang project. The remaining 25% stake was held by PT Antam.
However, the relationship between Barrick and Antam quickly deteriorated, with both sides accusing the other of financial mismanagement. The dispute escalated when Antam took legal action against Barrick, seeking to terminate their joint venture agreement and take control of the Busang project.
The legal battle continued for several years, with both sides incurring significant legal costs and the project remaining in limbo. However, in a surprise turn of events, the dispute was settled out of court, with Barrick agreeing to pay Antam $100 million in exchange for its 25% stake in the project.
Barrick CEO, Mark Bristow, hailed the settlement as a positive outcome for all parties involved. "This settlement removes the uncertainty and risk associated with the legal dispute and allows us to move forward with our plans to develop the Busang mine," he said. Bristow added that the company planned to invest over $400 million in the project over the next few years.
The news of Barrick's victory has been greeted with mixed reactions in Indonesia. On the one hand, the country has long been eager to attract foreign investment into its mining sector, and the Busang mine is seen as a significant opportunity to do so. However, there are also concerns about the environmental impact of the project, with opposition groups warning of the potential for pollution and damage to local ecosystems.
Barrick has sought to allay these concerns, pledging to comply with all environmental regulations and work closely with local communities. The company has also announced plans to partner with Indonesian non-profit, Yayasan Tambuhak Sinta, to support sustainable development initiatives in the Busang region.
Despite the challenges that lie ahead, Barrick's victory in the Busang dispute is a significant milestone for the company and the mining industry as a whole. The project is one of the largest and most lucrative undeveloped gold deposits in the world and is expected to produce tens of billions of dollars in revenue over its lifetime. With a renewed sense of confidence and resolve, Barrick is now poised to capitalize on this exciting opportunity and cement its position as a leader in the global mining sector.
