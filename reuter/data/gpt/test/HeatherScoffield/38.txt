Pressure is mounting on trade ministers from Asia-Pacific nations to restart discussions on free and open financial services. The plea comes from a number of organizations, including the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, who say that the talks could help to increase trade flows and boost economic growth across the region.
The proposed talks were first initiated in 2012, when 21 countries including Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and the United States agreed to begin discussions on opening up the financial services sector. The aim was to simplify regulations, reduce barriers to entry, and increase competition, which could lead to a more open and transparent financial environment.
However, the talks stalled in 2015, and little progress has been made since then. This has led to frustration among industry leaders, who say that the lack of progress is preventing the industry from reaching its full potential.
Trade ministers are now being urged to revive the talks and work towards creating a level playing field for financial services companies across the region. According to the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, this would require countries to commit to greater transparency and regulatory cooperation, as well as the removal of unnecessary barriers to entry.
The organization also stated that the talks could have a positive impact on the wider economy, citing a study conducted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics which suggested that a successful agreement could increase trade flows between participating countries by up to 9%.
Other groups have also backed the call for renewed discussions on financial services, including the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. They say that creating a more open and transparent financial environment could help to attract investment to the region, which in turn would lead to greater economic growth.
With the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to be felt across the region, trade ministers may be more willing to consider new measures to stimulate growth. However, any agreement would require a delicate balancing act between national interests and the need for greater cooperation across borders.
Despite the challenges, industry leaders are hopeful that the renewed interest in free and open financial services talks will lead to progress in the near future.
