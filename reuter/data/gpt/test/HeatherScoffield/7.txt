Jakarta, Indonesia - The battle for control of the Busang gold deposit in Indonesia is heating up as two mining companies, PT Bumi Resources Tbk and PT Indo Breitling Mineral Investama, are fighting it out in a public relations battle to win the hearts and minds of the local community.
The gold deposit, located in the remote jungle of central Kalimantan, has been the subject of controversy since it was first discovered in 1995. The deposit was famously over-hyped by Canadian mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd, which claimed that it had found a gold deposit containing up to 200 million ounces of gold. The claims proved to be false, and Bre-X eventually collapsed in one of the biggest mining scandals of all time.
Despite the scandal, interest in the Busang gold deposit has remained high, and both PT Bumi Resources Tbk and PT Indo Breitling Mineral Investama are now vying for control of the deposit.
PT Bumi Resources Tbk, which is Indonesia's largest coal producer, has been promoting its plan to develop the gold deposit in a responsible and sustainable manner. The company has pledged to work closely with the local community and to respect the environment.
PT Indo Breitling Mineral Investama, on the other hand, has been promoting its credentials as a joint venture between an Indonesian and a British company, and has been highlighting its commitment to corporate social responsibility.
The two companies have been engaging in a public relations battle in the local media, with each one trying to position itself as the best choice to develop the gold deposit.
"We are committed to developing the Busang deposit in a way that benefits the local community and respects the environment," said PT Bumi Resources Tbk CEO, Arifin Panigoro. "We believe that our experience as a responsible mining company means that we are best placed to develop the deposit."
PT Indo Breitling Mineral Investama CEO, John Edwards, countered by saying, "We are committed to working closely with the local community and ensuring that the benefits of mining are felt by all. Our joint venture structure means that we can bring the best of British and Indonesian expertise to the table, and we believe that we are the best choice to develop the Busang deposit."
The battle for control of the Busang gold deposit is set to continue, with both companies preparing to submit their proposals to the Indonesian government for approval. The government will ultimately decide which company is awarded the rights to develop the deposit, based on a number of factors, including their track record, their environmental and social impact assessments, and their financial capacity to undertake the project.
Despite the controversy surrounding the Busang gold deposit, many in the mining industry believe that it has the potential to become one of the largest and most profitable gold deposits in the world. The decision of the Indonesian government on which company is awarded the rights to develop the deposit will therefore be watched closely by investors and industry analysts alike.
