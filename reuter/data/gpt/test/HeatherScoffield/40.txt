The World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General has called on member countries to be flexible and show understanding in China's efforts to join the organization.
At a recent meeting of the WTO General Council, Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala addressed the issue of China's accession to the organization. The country has been negotiating for membership for over 20 years and has made significant progress towards meeting the requirements for membership.
"China is the world's second-largest economy and has made significant progress in reforming its economic system over the past few decades," said Okonjo-Iweala. "While there are still some outstanding issues to be resolved, it is important that we approach these discussions with flexibility and understanding, in the interest of promoting free and fair trade for all."
The Director-General also acknowledged that there are concerns among some member countries about China's compliance with WTO rules and its impact on other members' economies. She urged China to continue to work towards meeting the requirements for membership and to address these concerns through dialogue and cooperation.
In response, China's Ambassador to the WTO, Zhang Xiangchen, reaffirmed the country's commitment to joining the organization and meeting its obligations under WTO rules. He also emphasized the importance of international cooperation and dialogue in addressing any concerns that countries may have about China's accession.
"We believe that China's accession to the WTO will bring significant benefits to both our country and the wider international community," said Zhang. "We are committed to working with all WTO members to ensure a smooth and successful accession process."
China first applied for WTO membership in 1986, but negotiations stalled for many years due to concerns about its economic system and human rights record. In 2001, the country finally joined the organization after agreeing to a series of reforms and commitments.
Since then, China's economy has continued to grow rapidly, becoming a major player in global trade. However, there have also been concerns about its adherence to WTO rules and its impact on other members' economies.
As China continues to work towards full compliance with WTO rules and obligations, the Director-General's call for flexibility and understanding is likely to be welcomed by many member countries. It remains to be seen what specific issues will need to be resolved before China can join the organization, but there is little doubt that its accession would be a significant milestone for both the country and the global trading system.
