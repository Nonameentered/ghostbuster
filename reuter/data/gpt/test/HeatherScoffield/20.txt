Softwood Lumber Prices May Rise as Canada-U.S. Quota System Enters Second Year
The softwood lumber industry has been a key factor in the Canada-U.S. trade relationship for decades. However, it has been riddled with disputes, tariffs, and trade wars before both countries agreed in 2020 to a quota system for the export of softwood lumber. As this regime enters its second year, experts predict that lumber prices may rise, and the industry may see a major shift in the way it operates.
The U.S. border with Canada remains a critical juncture in the softwood lumber trade. The United States consumes about one-third of Canada's total softwood lumber production. The regulations surrounding the trade of softwood lumber are complex and vary depending on the agreement in place between the two countries.
For decades, the primary regulations governing Canadian softwood lumber's export to the U.S. have been the Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) version one to five. These agreements were meant to limit the amount of Canadian softwood lumber entering the U.S. market. However, the agreements had lapsed by 2015 and the U.S. imposed a 20-percent tariff on Canadian softwood lumber, arguing that Canada's government-controlled forest industry was unfairly subsidizing the country's lumber and giving it an unfair advantage over U.S. producers.
Last year, the two countries agreed on an updated quota system, hoping to end the dispute over subsidization. The U.S. offered Canada a quota system that would limit Canadian softwood lumber's export to the U.S. If Canada exceeds the imposed quota, it will face a tax rate or a duty of up to 20%, the same rate that existed between 2018 and 2020.
The U.S. has historically criticized Canada's logging subsidies, claiming that they create an uneven playing field that disadvantages American lumber mills. The Canadian industry counters that the subsidies compensate for the significantly higher land costs associated with logging in Canada and that they are necessary to sustain the country's forestry sector.
The U.S. and Canadian lumber sectors have substantially different operating environments. Canada's forestry industry is largely controlled by the government, while U.S. companies are mostly privately owned. As a result, Canadian companies' access to timber is more consistent, allowing them to produce more finished products. However, U.S. companies enjoy lower transportation costs, which makes their product more competitive in U.S. markets.
The quota system's implementation means that Canadian lumber companies must be very careful about their wood exports' volume, as exceeding the imposed cap can have significant financial implications. However, a quota system likewise presents several uncertainties and challenges, particularly for the Canadian lumber industry. Exporters have to determine weekly volumes while keeping the quota system in mind, limiting their flexibility and efficiency.
Lumber prices could also rise during the quota system's second year. If the U.S. experiences a prolonged standstill in production, particularly in the wake of the inevitable labor shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lumber prices may increase for retailers. Many lumber vendors are reportedly building up stock in anticipation of increased demand in the coming months, which will add to the industry's complexity.
The U.S.'s recent buy-American executive order will likely complicate the arrangement further, as it stipulates that American-made materials should make up at least 75% of certain products' components. While this is not specifically aimed at softwood lumber, it could impact the Canadian forestry industry as a whole.
A lot will depend on how lumber exporters navigate the system in the coming years. Industry leaders have expressed hope that the quota system will bring stability to the trade relationship. Still, they are wary of government regulation that could disrupt the free market.
Overall, there are reasons for optimism in the softwood lumber industry's future, even if it is not entirely clear how the quota system will play out. Companies may be able to increase their productivity and profitability by investing in innovative technologies that allow them to reduce their environmental impact and cut costs.
However, the U.S.-Canada softwood lumber trade relationship remains one of the most crucial and complicated in North America, and the quota system's successful implementation will require both countries to work together to find stable solutions.
