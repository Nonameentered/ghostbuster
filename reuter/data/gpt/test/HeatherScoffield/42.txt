As the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers meet in Malaysia, a call has been made for them to focus on reducing customs red tape and investing in Asia's infrastructure.
The Chairman of the APEC Business Advisory Council, Peter Grey, has stated that the region's businesses are being held back by the high costs and lengthy waiting times associated with customs procedures. He has urged the ministers to prioritize simplifying and streamlining these procedures, which would result in increased trade and investment flows, and, ultimately, economic growth.
Mr. Grey has also stressed the importance of investing in critical infrastructure, such as transportation systems, ports, and telecommunications networks. He has pointed out that many developing economies in the region lack the infrastructure required to fully participate in the global economy. Without adequate roads, railways, airports, and ports, it is difficult for businesses to efficiently transport goods and connect with customers and suppliers.
To address this issue, Mr. Grey has called for increased public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects, and for greater investment in research and development to drive innovation and improve the efficiency of infrastructure systems. He has emphasized that these investments will not only help to boost economic growth, but also address pressing social and environmental issues, such as reducing carbon emissions and increasing access to education and healthcare.
The call for customs reform and infrastructure investment has been echoed by many trade experts and government officials. Deputy Trade Minister of Malaysia, Y. Bhg. Datuk Seri J. Jayasiri, has stated that customs procedures are often viewed by businesses as a significant barrier to trade, and that efforts should be made to simplify and harmonize these procedures across the region. He has also noted the importance of investing in infrastructure, particularly in rural and remote areas, to ensure that no communities are left behind in the region's development.
Similarly, Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry, Chan Chun Sing, has emphasized the need for greater investment in digital infrastructure, including 5G networks and e-commerce platforms, to enable businesses to take advantage of the growing digital economy in the region.
The push for customs reform and infrastructure investment comes at a critical time for the region, which is facing a challenging economic environment marked by rising protectionism and geopolitical tensions. The World Trade Organization has recently downgraded its forecast for global trade growth, citing weaker economic activity and increased trade tensions. Against this backdrop, APEC ministers have a vital role to play in ensuring that the region's businesses remain competitive and that its economies continue to grow.
As the ministers meet in Malaysia, it is hoped that they will take concrete steps towards reducing customs red tape and investing in critical infrastructure. These policies will not only benefit businesses and drive economic growth, but also contribute to the sustainable development of the region. By working together, APEC members can create a more dynamic, inclusive, and resilient Asia-Pacific economy.
