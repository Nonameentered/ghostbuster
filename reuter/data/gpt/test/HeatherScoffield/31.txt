Canadian mining company TVX Gold Inc. has announced its strategic plan to become a million-ounce-a-year gold producer, which includes hiring a new team of executives. The company aims to increase its gold production by expanding existing mines and acquiring new projects in Canada and internationally.
TVX Gold Inc. has recently appointed Michael Thompson as the new President and CEO of the company. Thompson, who previously held senior roles at Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold, brings over 30 years of experience in the mining industry to his new role. In a press release, Thompson stated, “I am excited to join TVX Gold Inc. and lead the company in achieving its vision of becoming a million-ounce-a-year gold producer. Our team is committed to driving growth and creating value for our shareholders.”
In addition to Thompson, TVX Gold Inc. has also brought on several executives with extensive expertise in mining operations, finance, and investor relations. The new team includes:
- Dr. Robert Hunter, Chief Operating Officer: Hunter has over 35 years of experience in the mining industry, including roles at BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Xstrata Copper. He will be responsible for overseeing TVX Gold Inc.’s mining operations and ensuring optimal production at all sites.
- Karen Wong, Chief Financial Officer: Wong has over 20 years of experience in finance and accounting, including roles at Ernst & Young and Barrick Gold.

The new executives will work alongside existing team members to execute TVX Gold Inc.’s strategic plan, which includes increasing gold production to one million ounces per year by 2024. The company currently produces around 300,000 ounces of gold per year from its two operating mines: the Troilus Mine in Quebec, Canada, and the Cariboo Mine in British Columbia, Canada.
To achieve its growth targets, TVX Gold Inc. plans to invest in exploration, development, and acquisition initiatives.

Our plan is to invest in exploration and development to increase production from our existing assets, while also pursuing exciting new opportunities in mining-friendly jurisdictions around the world. With the support of our talented team and committed shareholders, we believe we can achieve our goal of becoming a million-ounce-a-year gold producer.”
Investors have responded positively to TVX Gold Inc.’s growth plans, with shares in the company rising by 10% on the Toronto Stock Exchange following the announcement of the new executive team. The company’s market capitalization has also increased to over $500 million, reflecting the confidence investors have in its future growth prospects.
Overall, TVX Gold Inc.’s hiring of a new team of executives represents a significant step towards achieving its goal of becoming a million-ounce-a-year gold producer.
