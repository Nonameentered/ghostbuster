Brussels, Belgium - The European Union's trade commissioner has slammed Canada for not taking any action against the United States' controversial Helms-Burton Law. In a recent statement, Cecilia Malmstrom said that Canada's lack of action on the matter was a "missed opportunity."
The Helms-Burton Law, enacted by the US Congress in 1996, punishes foreign companies who do business with Cuba, targeting both the companies themselves and their executives. The law has been widely criticized and condemned by the international community. In response, the EU has enacted a series of measures to protect European companies doing business with Cuba.
However, despite the EU's actions, Canada has remained largely silent on the matter. Malmstrom said that this was disappointing and that Canada should be doing more to push back against the Helms-Burton Law.
"The EU has taken a strong stance against the Helms-Burton Law, and we have put in place measures to protect our companies from its effects," Malmstrom said. "It is disappointing that Canada has not done the same. We would like to see more action from Canada on this issue."
Malmstrom's comments come amid growing tensions between the US and Canada, particularly over trade. In recent months, the US has imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, and the two countries have been engaged in a contentious renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Helms-Burton Law is just one of the issues that the US and Canada are at odds over. Malmstrom's statement is likely to put even more pressure on Canada, which has been criticized by some in the international community for not doing more to stand up to the US.
Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has yet to comment on Malmstrom's statement. However, the Canadian government has previously stated that it does not recognize the Helms-Burton Law and that it will not enforce it within its borders.
Despite Canada's opposition to the law, Malmstrom said that more needed to be done to prevent it from having an impact on European companies.
"We have put in place measures to protect our companies from the Helms-Burton Law, but we would like to see more done internationally to prevent this law from being used as a tool to harm companies doing business in Cuba," she said.
Malmstrom's comments are likely to be seen as a warning to both Canada and the US. The EU has made it clear that it will not stand idly by while its companies are targeted by the Helms-Burton Law, and it is likely that the issue will continue to be a source of contention between the EU, Canada, and the US in the coming months.
