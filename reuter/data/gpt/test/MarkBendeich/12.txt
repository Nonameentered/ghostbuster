RTZ-CRA, one of the world's largest mining companies, has announced a major realignment of its operations which includes the confirmation of London as its global headquarters. The move comes as the company seeks to streamline its operations and focus on its core businesses.
The company, which was formed in 2018 following the merger of mining giants Rio Tinto and Anglo American, has been steadily expanding its operations in recent years. With a presence in over 40 countries and a workforce of more than 50,000 people, RTZ-CRA is one of the world's largest mining companies, with interests in copper, gold, iron ore, and other minerals.
In a statement released on Monday, RTZ-CRA announced that it would be realigning its operations into four main business units: Copper, Iron Ore, Aluminum and Diamonds. The company said that the move was designed to simplify its operations and enhance its focus on its core businesses.
As part of the realignment, the company also announced that it would be relocating its headquarters from Melbourne to London. The move is expected to be completed by the end of 2021 and will involve the transfer of around 100 employees from Melbourne to London.
In a press release, Simon Thompson, Chairman of RTZ-CRA, said that the move to London was a "logical step" for the company. "London is a global hub for mining and finance and we believe that it is the right place for our global headquarters," he said.
Thompson also emphasized that the move would not affect the company's operations in Australia, which would continue to be an important part of RTZ-CRA's business. "Australia is a key market for us and we remain committed to investing in the country and supporting our local communities," he said.
The announcement was welcomed by the UK government, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson describing it as a "major vote of confidence" in the UK. "We are delighted that RTZ-CRA has chosen London as its global headquarters," he said. "This underlines the strength of our economy and our position as a global leader in mining and finance."
The move to London is also expected to have implications for the company's tax position. Under UK tax rules, companies are subject to a lower tax rate on profits generated outside the country, which could potentially lead to tax savings for RTZ-CRA.
However, the move was not universally welcomed, with some Australian politicians and business leaders expressing concern about the loss of jobs and the impact on the country's mining industry. "This is a blow for Melbourne and for Australia," said Tim Pallas, the Treasurer of Victoria, in a statement.
Despite the concerns, the move to London is seen as a significant step for RTZ-CRA as it seeks to position itself for future growth in the global mining industry. With a renewed focus on its core businesses and a streamlined organizational structure, the company will be better placed to compete with its rivals and capitalize on opportunities in the rapidly evolving global market.
