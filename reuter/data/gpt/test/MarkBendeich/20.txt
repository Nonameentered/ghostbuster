A consortium led by Japan's Mitsui & Co. has managed to reduce the U.S. dollar-based component of the purchase price for the Loy Yang A power station in Victoria after negotiations with its former owner, Engie SA. The deal is worth $1.2 billion, but the final purchase price for the coal-fired power plant is set to be lower by using an Australian dollar-based pricing structure.
The Australian consortium, which also includes EnergyAustralia and the Japanese trading group Sojitz, had been eager to reduce the risk of exchange-rate fluctuations. The pricing structure will adjust the value of the acquisition based on movements in Australia's exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar, which should help shield the consortium from currency volatility.
The switch to local currency pricing is a significant step forward for the Australian consortium as it seeks to manage its foreign exchange risks. EnergyAustralia CEO Catherine Tanna has previously spoken about the consortium's desire to limit exposure to foreign exchange movements and minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on the value of the acquisition.
 "We believe this innovative structure provides a compelling solution to manage foreign exchange exposure and supports a predictable, long-term investment decision for our consortium," Tanna said.
The Loy Yang A power plant has a capacity of almost 3,000 MW and is one of the largest generators of electricity in Australia. The plant was initially built to power Melbourne's growing suburbs, but its location in the Latrobe Valley also means it's well situated to supply the country's National Electricity Grid.
The Australian market for electricity has been transformed by the rollout of renewable energy and the shift away from coal-fired power generation. However, Loy Yang A remains an important source of baseload power and will be an important asset in Australia's energy mix for some time to come. The consortium's successful negotiation of the deal shows how innovation and partnership can mitigate risks and drive large-scale investment in the country's energy infrastructure.
