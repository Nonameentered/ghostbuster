An Australian biotech firm has successfully created a unique vaccine to combat the spread of salmonella in chickens. The potential benefits of this achievement have already prompted the company, Vaccine Innovations Pty Ltd, to eye the cattle market.
Salmonella is a foodborne illness that spreads through contaminated food or water, causing symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Chickens and other poultry are known carriers of the bacteria, which frequently cross-contaminates with human food sources. The successful development of a vaccine to address salmonella in chickens is a significant boon for the food industry, which has long been grappling with ways to improve food safety.
According to Andrew Johnson, Managing Director of Vaxxas, "The impact of salmonella on food safety is significant, and we are confident that our vaccine solution will provide long-term benefits to the food industry." Vaxxas uses a novel patch-based technology to deliver the vaccine, allowing for enhanced protection against disease and the potential to improve animal welfare.
Apart from being a game-changer in the chicken industry, the team at Vaxxas is also looking to leverage their technology and expand their offering to the cattle market. While salmonella is not as big a problem with cattle as with poultry, the vaccine can help prevent the spread of other diseases that are more prevalent in cattle such as E. coli and bovine respiratory disease.
The vaccine utilizes a novel technology called the high-density micro-array patch (HD-MAP), developed by the University of Queensland's Biotechnology Centre. The HD-MAP functions like a mobile delivery platform that uses thousands of tiny needles to administer the vaccine into the skin, making it more effective and efficient than traditional methods.
Vaxxas has worked in close collaboration with leading animal welfare groups to ensure the patch technology delivers a pain-free method of administering vaccines. The HD-MAP ensures the right amount of vaccine is delivered into the skin so that the animals can easily tolerate the inoculation.
Food safety continues to be a pressing concern for the agriculture industry, and the Vaxxas initiative may just be the much-needed solution for farmers seeking to improve animal welfare and ensure their livestock remains healthy, reducing the risk of food contamination and decrease antibiotics usage.
Dr. Kate Gordon, a veterinarian and CEO of Australian Farm Institute, said: "This is a significant development that will have far-reaching benefits for the food industry, improving food safety and reducing the spread of diseases. The development of a vaccine that works on patients in a pain-free manner is an important step forward." 
In conclusion, the biotechnology market continues to evolve, and Vaxxas' innovation offers an opportunity to tackle food safety and antibiotic usage, as well as providing farmers with a new and more efficient method of inoculating their livestock. While the company is still in the early stages in terms of product rollout, the announcement of the Vaxxas' salmonella vaccine is a potential game-changer for the agriculture sector.
