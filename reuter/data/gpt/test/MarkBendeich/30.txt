The spiritual leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, has called on Australia to urge China to open a dialogue regarding the future of Tibet. The Dalai Lama made the appeal in a video message to a virtual event hosted by the Australia Tibet Council.
“In Australia, I think it is very important to appeal to the government and also to the public, and explain to them the situation in Tibet,” the Dalai Lama said. “Therefore, I appeal to you [Australia] as a friend of Tibet, please press China to start talks on Tibet’s future.”
The event was held to mark the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan Uprising against China’s rule, which the Dalai Lama commemorated by praising the resilience and courage of the Tibetan people. The uprising led to the Dalai Lama’s flight into exile in India, where he has been living ever since.
China has long claimed sovereignty over Tibet and has been accused of human rights abuses against the Tibetan people. The Dalai Lama has repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution to the Tibet issue through dialogue with the Chinese government.
The Australian government has faced criticism in recent years for not doing enough to support Tibet’s autonomy and human rights. In response to the Dalai Lama’s appeal, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that Australia’s position on Tibet has not changed.
“Australia remains concerned about human rights in Tibet and continues to urge China to respect the rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people,” the spokesperson said. “We support the right of the Tibetan people to determine their own future in accordance with their wishes.”
The spokesperson added that Australia had raised concerns about Tibet with China at various levels, including at the United Nations.
However, Tibet advocates argue that Australia should be doing more to pressure China on the issue. Kelsang Pema, the national director of the Australia Tibet Council, called on the Australian government to take a stronger stance on Tibet.
“We urge the Australian government to show leadership by calling for a genuine dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama or his representatives,” Pema said.
Pema also called for Australia to support Tibet at the United Nations Human Rights Council, where China has faced criticism for its treatment of the Tibetan people.
The Dalai Lama’s appeal comes at a time of tension between China and Australia over a range of issues, including Australia’s call for an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and its criticism of China’s actions in the South China Sea. Recently, China imposed tariffs on Australian barley and suspended meat imports from several Australian suppliers.
Despite the recent tensions, the Australian government has said that it will continue to engage with China on issues of mutual interest, including trade, security, and regional stability.
The Dalai Lama’s message to Australia is a reminder that the issue of Tibet remains an important one in the eyes of international human rights advocates. It also highlights the ongoing challenge for governments to balance their economic and political relationships with China with their obligations to support human rights and democracy around the world.
