French insurance giant Axa-UAP has announced plans to sell life insurance products to China's emerging middle class market, as part of the company's expansion into Asia's largest economy.
The move comes after Axa-UAP received approval from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission to establish a wholly owned life insurance subsidiary in China. The company hopes to tap into the increasing demand for insurance products among China's growing middle class, which is expected to reach 500 million people by 2020.
"We are very excited to be entering the Chinese life insurance market, which is one of the fastest growing in the world," said Thomas Buberl, CEO of Axa-UAP. "We believe that our expertise in life insurance will allow us to offer high-quality products and services to middle-class Chinese customers who are seeking comprehensive financial protection for themselves and their families."
China's middle class is rapidly growing, and with it, the demand for insurance products is also increasing. According to a report by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, the country's life insurance market grew by 23.74% year-on-year in 2020, reaching a total premium income of RMB 4.72 trillion (US$740 billion). This growth is expected to continue as more Chinese consumers seek ways to protect their families and assets.
To capitalize on this trend, Axa-UAP plans to offer a range of life insurance products that cater to the unique needs of Chinese consumers. These products will include term life insurance, whole life insurance, and endowment insurance, as well as a range of optional riders that will allow customers to tailor their coverage to meet their specific needs.
"We understand that Chinese consumers have unique financial needs, and we are committed to developing products that provide comprehensive protection and peace of mind," said Buberl.
Axa-UAP is not the only foreign insurer looking to capitalize on China's growing middle class. Several other international insurance companies, including Allianz and Prudential, have also announced plans to expand their operations in the country in recent months.
However, Axa-UAP believes that its expertise in life insurance and its commitment to customer service will set it apart from its competitors.
"We have a long history of providing high-quality insurance products and services to customers around the world," said Buberl. "We are confident that our experience and expertise will enable us to succeed in the highly competitive Chinese market."
Axa-UAP plans to launch its life insurance products in China in the coming months, and is currently in the process of hiring staff and establishing its operations in the country. The company is also exploring opportunities to expand its business beyond life insurance, including property and casualty insurance and asset management.
