Colonial Ltd, one of Australia's biggest banking and insurance companies, has reported a major loss of A$38 million for the year 1996. The company's financial turmoil has been primarily attributed to significant costs associated with the restructuring of its business operations. The loss is in striking contrast to the A$186 million profit reported by the firm in 1995. Colonial Ltd management, however, has expressed confidence that the restructure measures implemented over the last year will lead to significant future growth and financial stability for the company.
