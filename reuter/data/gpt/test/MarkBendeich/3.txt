Woodside Petroleum has announced that it will increase its exploration spending in 1997 as part of its strategy to diversify away from the North West Shelf gas fields. The Australian energy company is planning to spend $700 million on exploration and appraisal work this year, up from $500 million in 1996.
The move comes as Woodside looks to decrease its reliance on the North West Shelf project, which currently provides the majority of the company's revenue. concerns have been raised over the gas fields' future profitability as well as the company's ability to meet the increasing demand of the Asian market.
Woodside's CEO, John Akehurst, stated that the company's focus will be on exploration in "targeted areas that have the potential to provide material growth opportunities, including our existing portfolio, as well as new growth areas outside Australia."
The company has already secured exploration licenses in offshore New Zealand and is in the process of applying for licenses in Myanmar, Vietnam, and other parts of Southeast Asia. Woodside has been actively seeking these opportunities to diversify its operations.
Akehurst stated that "the expected growth in Asian energy demand presents a significant opportunity for Woodside and we are committed to identifying and delivering opportunities that benefit our shareholders and host communities."
The CEO also noted that there are currently over 20 prospects in the company's portfolio that have the potential for commercial volumes of oil and gas.
The increased investment in exploration and appraisal work is a welcome development for the Australian energy sector, which has been suffering from a lack of investment and sluggish growth in recent years.
The announcement has been touted by many as a sign of positive growth for the industry. The President of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, Andrew Dureau, stated that "this increase in exploration spend by Woodside is very good news for the industry and for Australia. It demonstrates that there is still significant interest and potential in exploring for oil and gas here in Australia."
Woodside Petroleum is Australia's largest independent oil and gas company, with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the USA. The company's main focus is on the development of liquefied natural gas projects, with a strong interest in the Asian market.
The announcement of increased exploration spending is a sign of Woodside's commitment to diversifying its operations and securing its future in the ever-changing energy market. It is a move that is sure to have positive implications for the company and the wider industry.
