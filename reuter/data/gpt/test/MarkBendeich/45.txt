The Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) has launched a series of bans on Indonesian shipping in response to human rights violations in the country. The move comes after a report by the United Nations found that Indonesia's security forces have carried out extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture in the provinces of Papua and West Papua.
The MUA has stated that it will not handle cargoes from Indonesian vessels that are involved in the trade of goods produced in West Papua, or from companies that have links to the Indonesian military. The union has also urged other maritime unions around the world to take similar steps in protest against human rights abuses in Indonesia.
Indonesia is a major trading partner for Australia, with almost $10 billion in bilateral trade in 2020. The bans by the MUA are expected to have a significant impact on Indonesia's export industry, particularly in the pulp and paper, palm oil, and coal sectors.
The MUA's national secretary, Paddy Crumlin, said in a statement that the bans were a "peaceful and legitimate means of protest against human rights abuses, and that they were designed to put pressure on the Indonesian government to take action to improve the situation in Papua and West Papua".
"The MUA has a long and proud history of campaigning for human rights and social justice, and we will not stand idly by while our trading partners are involved in such serious human rights violations," he added.
The situation in Papua and West Papua has been a long-standing issue of concern for international human rights groups. The provinces have been embroiled in a separatist conflict for decades, with indigenous Papuans seeking independence from Indonesia.
Indonesia has repeatedly denied allegations of human rights abuses in the region, and has accused separatist groups of carrying out acts of violence and terrorism. The country's president, Joko Widodo, has promised to improve the human rights situation in Papua and has pledged to increase development in the region.
However, critics say that the Indonesian government has done little to address the root causes of the conflict, which include discrimination against indigenous Papuans, and the exploitation of the region's natural resources by multinational companies.
The MUA bans have been welcomed by human rights groups, who say that international pressure is needed to bring about change in Papua and West Papua.
Sophie McNeill, a researcher at Human Rights Watch who has reported extensively on human rights abuses in the region, said in a statement: "The MUA's ban on Indonesian shipping is the latest example of how civil society is mobilizing to pressure Indonesia to end human rights violations in Papua. It's time for the Indonesian government to halt the abuses and engage in a meaningful dialogue with Papuan leaders to find a peaceful solution to the conflict."
The bans on Indonesian shipping are set to continue indefinitely, pending improvements in the human rights situation in Papua and West Papua. The MUA has called on the Australian government to take a stronger stance on the issue, and to use its economic ties with Indonesia to push for reforms.
The Australian government has so far been cautious in its approach to the Papua conflict, citing concerns over the country's territorial integrity and the importance of its trade relationship with Indonesia.
However, pressure is mounting on the government to take a stronger stance, with several members of parliament calling for sanctions against Indonesian officials implicated in human rights abuses in Papua.
As the bans take effect, it remains to be seen whether they will help to bring about change in the region, or if they will simply create new economic and political tensions between Australia and Indonesia.
