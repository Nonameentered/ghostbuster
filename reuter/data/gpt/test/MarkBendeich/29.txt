Australian mining company Pasminco is planning a major share issue to fund its $1 billion Century zinc project in Queensland. The company’s management announced that they plan to issue 500 million new shares at $2 per share, raising $1 billion in total.
Pasminco expects the new funds will be enough to support the development of the Century zinc mine, which is one of the largest zinc mines in the world. The company has been working on this project for years and expects the mine to produce millions of tonnes of zinc concentrate each year, which will be sold both locally and overseas.
The Century zinc project is a major undertaking for Pasminco, and it will require significant investments in infrastructure, machinery, and personnel. The project aims to increase Australia’s role as a major zinc exporter, as the demand for zinc continues to grow globally. According to reports, the company has already secured financing worth $600 million, however, the share issue will help it secure the remaining funds to complete the project.
The announcement was met with positive reactions from investors, as Pasminco’s share price rose by 5.4% immediately after the announcement. The company expects the share issue to be completed by the end of the year, with the Century zinc mine expected to be fully operational by 2023.
