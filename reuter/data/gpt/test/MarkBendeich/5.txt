Amcor Ltd, one of the worldâ€™s largest packaging manufacturers, has reported a significant decrease in its half-yearly profit due to lower paper prices and an uncertain outlook. The Australian-based company, which provides packaging solutions to various industries such as food, healthcare, and beverage, has seen its net profit fall by 11.2% to $329.5 million in the second half of 2019.
According to Amcor, the decrease in profit is due to lower pricing for recycled paper, which impacted its reported selling prices for paper packaging. CEO Ron Delia also cited other issues affecting the company's performance, including a volatile geopolitical climate and global trade tensions.
Despite the challenges, the company remains optimistic about its future outlook. Delia stated that Amcor is continuing to execute its strategy to become a global leader in flexible and rigid packaging, adding that the company is investing in innovation and sustainable packaging solutions to meet changing customer needs.
The company also confirmed that it will push ahead with its acquisition of US-based rival Bemis Company, which it announced last August and expects to complete by mid-2019. Amcor believes the merger will create significant cost synergies, bolster its position as a leader in the packaging industry and drive shareholder value in the long run.
