Comalco's smelting division turns a profit, major expansion work pays off
Comalco's smelting division has announced that it has turned a profit for the year 2020. The news comes as the company completes a major expansion project to increase the processing capacity of its smelting plant.
The company reported a net profit of US$50 million for the year, up from a loss of US$10 million in the previous year. The smelting division was a key contributor to this positive financial result.
Comalco credited the expansion work for the improved profitability of the smelting division. The company invested US$100 million to increase the capacity of its smelting plant, which has enabled it to process a greater volume of aluminium ore.
The expansion project involved the construction of a new furnace and upgrading of existing equipment. The work was carried out over 18 months and was completed on schedule and within budget.
Comalco CEO, John Smith, said the company's investment in the smelting division had paid off.
"We made a strategic decision to invest in our smelting plant to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase processing capacity. The expansion work has delivered on all fronts, and we are now seeing the benefits through improved profitability."
Smith added that the company's focus on sustainability was also a key factor in the success of the smelting division.
"We have implemented measures to reduce our environmental footprint, including the use of renewable energy and the recycling of waste materials. Our customers value a sustainable supply chain, and we are committed to meeting their expectations."
The company's smelting division plays a crucial role in supplying aluminium to a range of industries, including transport, construction, and packaging.
"Our smelting plant is a key pillar of our business, and we are proud of the role it plays in contributing to the global economy. We will continue to invest in our infrastructure to ensure that we remain competitive in an ever-changing market," said Smith.
The announcement of Comalco's improved profitability has been welcomed by industry analysts. The company's share price has increased by 5% since the news was announced.
Analysts say that the smelting division is likely to continue to be a strong performer in the years ahead, given the growing demand for aluminium in a range of applications.
Comalco is currently exploring further expansion opportunities in its smelting division, including the development of new processing technologies and the acquisition of additional assets.
The company is also investing in research and development to improve the quality and performance of its products. This includes the development of new alloys and the use of advanced manufacturing techniques.
Comalco's success in the smelting division is a testament to the company's commitment to excellence and innovation. As the global demand for aluminium continues to grow, Comalco is well positioned to benefit from this trend and deliver sustainable value for its stakeholders.
