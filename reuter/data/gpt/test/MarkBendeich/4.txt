Melbourne, Australia - The world's largest packaging company, Amcor Ltd, is expected to report a significant decline in profits in the first half of the year as it grapples with soaring paper prices.
Analysts had previously forecast a net profit of AUD 362 million ($263 million) for the six months to the end of December. However, based on recent evaluations of the performance of the Australian multinational packaging company, it is now expected to be substantially lower than initially expected.
The price of paper, the main raw material for its packaging products, surged to a four-year high in the third quarter of last year, due to disruptions in global supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and surging demand for e-commerce packaging.
Along with the increases in paper prices, Amcor also had to contend with shortages of raw materials, logistic bottlenecks and rising production costs that impacted its margins.
Amcor, which manufacturers packaging materials for a wide range of clients including food, beverages, healthcare, and home and personal care products, slashed its earnings forecast last October in response to the sharp rise in paper prices.
The company had been able to offset some of the higher costs by passing them onto its customers, but this strategy only goes so far.
In the period under review, the company's net income might have come under further pressure as a result of currency fluctuations and the impact of hedge losses.
Amcor is not alone in facing pressure from rising commodity prices. Many companies around the world have been grappling with similar issues, especially due to the pandemic's disruptions.
According to market analysts, Amcor's performance in the past six months is not a fair reflection of its long-term potential, as the company has the capability to adjust to changing market conditions and ensure that its profits remain protected.
The packaging firm is expected to overcome the harsh operating environment by continuously optimizing its manufacturing processes and strategically managing its costs. Amcor's commitment to sustainability and innovation will gain traction in its long-term growth path, reflecting its goodwill and reputation among customers.
Analysts are hopeful that Amcor's financial performance may rebound in the near-term, but acknowledge that this would be subject to the trajectory of commodity prices going forward.
