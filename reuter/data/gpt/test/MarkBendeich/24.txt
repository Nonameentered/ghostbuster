Australia's oldest and largest steel-making plant, located in Port Kembla, New South Wales, is set to shut down, causing the loss of 2,500 jobs at BHP mill. The decision to close the plant comes after almost a century of operation due to deteriorating global demand for steel and the increased competition from overseas rivals.
The BHP mill in Port Kembla, which dates back to 1928, has been an important industrial landmark for the region and has supported thousands of Australian jobs. The closure is a devastating blow to the workforce and the local community, which has relied on the steel plant as a major employer and economic driver for many years.
In a statement released by BHP, the company acknowledged the impact the decision would have on employees and the community. The statement reads, "The decision to close the mill was not taken lightly and we understand how difficult this will be for our employees, their families, and the broader community. We are committed to supporting our employees during this difficult time and will work closely with them to provide assistance and support."
The company also mentioned in the statement that the global steel industry has been struggling with overcapacity and weak demand, leading to low steel prices and fierce competition from low-cost producers.
The closure of the BHP mill is expected to have a ripple effect across the economy, with many local businesses likely to suffer from the loss of jobs and economic activity. It is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the Australian manufacturing sector and the need for ongoing support from policymakers to ensure the survival of the industry.
