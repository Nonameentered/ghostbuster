The ongoing conflict over mining in Bougainville has taken a new turn, with the rebel leader of the autonomous region expressing concern that continued affiliation with Papua New Guinea will lead to the destruction of the island.
Speaking to reporters, Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) leader Ishmael Toroama warned that the push to reopen the Panguna copper and gold mine on the island could have devastating consequences.
"For years, we have fought for our independence from Papua New Guinea, because we believe that mining will destroy our land, our environment, and our culture," he said. "If we remain part of PNG, we will be at their mercy, and they will do whatever they want with our resources."
Toroama's words come amid growing tension over plans to revive mining operations in Bougainville, which were halted in 1989 following a decade-long civil war that claimed over 15,000 lives.
Many Bougainvilleans blame the Panguna mine – which was operated by Australian mining giant Rio Tinto – for both the conflict and the environmental damage that followed. The mine was closed in the wake of the war, but various proposals have been made to revive it in recent years.
The latest plan is being spearheaded by Australian company Bougainville Copper Limited, which hopes to reopen the mine with the support of the PNG government and the Bougainville leadership.
But Toroama and other rebel leaders remain opposed, arguing that the risks of mining outweigh the benefits. They fear that reopening Panguna will lead to further environmental damage, displacement of communities, and social unrest.
"Our position is clear: we need to protect our land and our people, and mining is not the answer," Toroama said. "We want to work towards alternative economic models that will allow us to thrive without sacrificing our natural resources."
However, PNG's Prime Minister, James Marape has maintained that mining will benefit Bougainville. PM Marape told reporters that he aims to make Bougainville the "Switzerland of the Pacific" by inviting investment and economic opportunities on the island.
The dispute over mining is just one of many challenges facing Bougainville as it continues its bid for independence from PNG. A referendum held in 2019 showed overwhelming support for independence, but negotiations with the PNG government have stalled over issues such as the transfer of powers and the distribution of resources.
Both sides have expressed a desire for a peaceful resolution, but Toroama's comments suggest that there is still a long way to go before Bougainville's future is secured. The world continues to watch and wait for the next steps in this unfolding story.
