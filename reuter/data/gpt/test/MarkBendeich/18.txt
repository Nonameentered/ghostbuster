Pacific Dunlop Ltd, the Australian multinational corporation, has announced a staggering A$132 million loss in their financial year 2020 due to the restructuring of the company and the sell-off of their medical equipment unit.
The company revealed that the loss was due to a significant decline in revenue, which was primarily caused by the sale of the R&R medical equipment unit in 2019. Pacific Dunlop had earlier indicated their intentions to dispose of the medical equipment unit to focus on their core businesses. The restructuring costs incurred in the process also contributed significantly to the loss.
The company's revenue dropped to A$128.8 million, down from A$332 million in 2019, a significant decrease of almost 61%. According to Pacific Dunlop's CEO, John Smith, the loss was expected, and the company has been working towards right-sizing the business to ensure long-term solvency. He assured stakeholders that the measures taken would eventually result in a leaner, more efficient, and profitable Pacific Dunlop.
Despite the significant loss, Pacific Dunlop has continued to fund various research projects aimed at improving the wellbeing of the Australian populace. The company has been a significant supporter of cancer research in Australia, and their philanthropic pursuits will not be affected by the loss.
Pacific Dunlop Ltd is a holding company for several subsidiaries that produce and sell products ranging from industrial rubber products, foam, and bedding products, to automotive components. The company was founded in 1895 and has operations in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and Europe.
