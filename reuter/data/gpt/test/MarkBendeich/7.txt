Sydney, Australia â€“ Crown Ltd., one of Australia's largest entertainment and gambling companies, faces mounting concerns over rising costs and delayed openings, sparking fears of financial instability and loss of investor confidence.
Crown Ltd., which operates several casinos and resorts across Australia, has experienced significant setbacks in recent years. The company was embroiled in a highly publicized corruption scandal that led to the arrests of several employees in China, resulting in the closure of its flagship casino in Macau. The scandal significantly affected Crown's revenue and damaged its reputation.
Moreover, the company's ambitious plan to expand its flagship property, Crown Sydney, has faced numerous delays and rising costs. Crown Sydney, a luxury resort and casino located in Barangaroo, Sydney, was originally scheduled to open in 2019. However, due to construction delays and regulatory hurdles, its opening has been postponed several times.
The most recent setback occurred in August 2021 when the New South Wales Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority rejected the company's proposal to open the casino portion of the resort. The authority cited concerns over the company's links to Chinese high rollers known as "junkets," who are responsible for bringing in millions of dollars in revenue but have been linked to money laundering and organized crime.
The rejection of Crown's proposal represents a significant blow to the company, as the casino portion is expected to generate a substantial amount of revenue. The delay in opening the casino and the rising costs of construction have further eroded confidence in Crown's ability to deliver on its promises.
The company's financial performance has been equally discouraging. Crown recently reported an annual loss of $261 million, and its revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, fell by 69 percent. The company also announced that it would not pay any dividends to its shareholders for the current fiscal year, citing the impact of COVID-19 and regulatory issues on its operations.
The company's troubles have prompted investors to flee, with Crown's share price down more than 20 percent since the start of the year. The company's market capitalization has also declined by more than $2 billion, alarming investors who fear that Crown may not be able to recover from its current difficulties.
Several analysts have expressed concern over Crown's precarious financial position and warned that the company may face further difficulties in the coming months.
"Given the delays in opening Crown Sydney and the ongoing regulatory issues, it's difficult to see how the company can improve its financial prospects in the short term," said John Smith, an analyst at Macquarie Group.
Others have criticized Crown's lack of transparency and accountability, citing the company's failure to address its regulatory and operational issues in a timely and effective manner.
"Crown needs to be more transparent and accountable for its actions," said Greg Costello, CEO of the Alliance for Gambling Reform. "The company's disregard for regulatory rules and failure to act responsibly has put its reputation and financial stability at risk."
Despite the mounting challenges, Crown's management has vowed to address the company's issues and improve its financial situation. The company has announced plans to review its operations, reduce costs, and focus on its core business. However, given the scale of the company's problems, many investors remain skeptical about Crown's ability to turn things around.
For now, the company's future remains uncertain, with investors and analysts closely monitoring its performance in the coming months.
