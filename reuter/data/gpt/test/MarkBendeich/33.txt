Global packaging company Amcor Ltd has predicted a recovery in the 1996/97 financial year, after reporting a drop in profits in the previous year. The Melbourne-based company, which supplies packaging products for industries such as food, beverage, and healthcare, reported a net profit of AUD $126.7 million in the 1995/96 financial year, down from AUD $143.7 million the previous year.
However, Amcor CEO Peter Willmott remains optimistic about the company's future growth prospects. In a statement to shareholders, he credited the drop in profits to adverse currency movements and restructuring costs, and noted that Amcor had continued to invest in product innovation and capacity expansion.
Willmott also highlighted Amcor's strong position in key markets, including Europe, Latin America, and Asia. "We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from growth trends in these regions," he said.
Amcor has already made moves to capitalize on these growth opportunities, recently acquiring Spanish flexible packaging firm Envelo and expanding its presence in India through a joint venture with packaging manufacturer Uflex Ltd.
