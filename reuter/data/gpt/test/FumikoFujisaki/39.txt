Nomura Securities Co, a Japanese Investment bank that provides securities underwriting, brokerage, and other financial services, has announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended March 2021. The company reported a net loss of JPY 155.7 billion ($1.43 billion) for the year, compared to a net loss of JPY 82.7 billion ($754 million) the previous year. However, the company reported healthy current profit year-on-year, bolstered by its overseas business.
Nomura’s net loss was primarily due to the fallout from the Archegos Capital Management scandal, which caused the company to book losses of approximately JPY 245 billion ($2.2 billion). The loss was caused by the implosion of Archegos, the family office of Bill Hwang, which had borrowed tens of billions of dollars to amass large stock positions through derivatives, which it then either held or sold.
Nomura was one of the banks that provided financing to Archegos in the form of margin loans, which allowed the fund to build its enormous positions. When the fund couldn’t meet its margin calls, the banks began to sell the positions. Nomura was one of the banks hit hardest by the implosion of Archegos, and it has led to the resignation of the company's CEO, Kentaro Okuda.
Despite the loss, Nomura's overseas business has performed well, offsetting some of the fallout from the scandal. The overseas business, which includes its investment banking and sales and trading operations in the Americas and Europe, reported a current profit of JPY 245.5 billion ($2.2 billion) for the fiscal year 2020-21, up 277% from a year earlier.
Nomura’s domestic business, however, struggled due to the pandemic, as rising coronavirus infections and restrictions on movement took their toll on the economy. Compared to the previous fiscal year, the domestic business' revenue fell by 9.1%, and its net loss more than doubled to JPY 168.5 billion ($1.5 billion), due to the impact of Archegos and the pandemic.
In a statement, Nomura's incoming CEO, Hideo Kondo, stated that the company was taking steps to prevent a recurrence of the Archegos scandal. One such action was the formation of a new oversight committee for risk management, which will be staffed by executives outside of the company's trading divisions.
Kondo stated that the committee would have the necessary authority to "act with autonomy and independence" and would have "full access to relevant information and be responsible for monitoring, assessing and providing recommendations on all aspects of risk management."
Going forward, Nomura's management is committed to improving the company's profitability and restoring investor confidence after the Archegos scandal. However, the company is likely to face more fallout from the scandal, including regulatory investigations and lawsuits from clients who lost money due to the bank's involvement with Archegos.
Nomura Securities Co’s net loss for the fiscal year ended March 2021 was undoubtedly disappointing for the company, its shareholders, and its employees. However, the healthy current profit reported from its overseas business has demonstrated the scale of the potential that the company has and its ability to manage risks. It remains to be seen if the reforms put in place by Kondo and his team will be enough to prevent a recurrence of the Archegos scandal. Still, they should go some way to restoring the bank's reputation and ensuring it is better equipped to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the future.
