Japan's securities industry expressed its disappointment with the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) "Big Bang" reform proposals on Tuesday. The LDP's proposed legislative changes included allowing brokerages to extend credit to their clients and also loosened ownership restrictions on financial firms. However, the securities industry was not impressed with the proposed changes and expressed concerns about potential risks.
The proposed reforms included amending the Banking Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act to allow brokerages to extend credit to their clients. The aim was to stimulate more investment activity and to try and loosen the hold of the country's dominant banks. The proposed reforms would allow brokerages to lend up to 50% of their clients' assets. However, the securities industry expressed concerns about potential risks associated with the proposed changes. 
Critics of the proposed changes argue that brokerages could face risks similar to those faced by Japanese banks during the late 1980s bubble economy. In addition, critics argue that loosening regulation on the financial industry could create a variety of unintended consequences, including market volatility and increased risk of investment fraud. 
The LDP's proposed reforms also included changes to ownership rules of financial firms, which could lead to more consolidation in Japan's financial sector. Under the current laws, firms are required to have a single shareholder that owns more than one-third of the company. The proposed changes would allow firms to have multiple shareholders owning one-third of the company, which could lead to more mergers and acquisitions in the sector. 
However, representatives from the securities industry expressed their disappointment with the proposed changes, calling them "insufficient" and "disappointing." They expressed that the proposed changes did not address the structural issues that exist within the securities industry, such as the lack of transparency and the high fees charged to individual investors. 
One concern expressed by the securities industry is that the proposed loan scheme could lead to a similar situation seen with the "omoiyari" system in the late 1980s. The "omoiyari" system allowed large companies to lend money to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) without proper credit checks, leading to a massive increase in non-performing loans and subsequent financial crisis. Critics argue that the proposed loan scheme could lead to similar risks and could harm investor confidence in the securities industry. 
The LDP's proposed changes come at a time when there is growing demand for financial reform in Japan. The country has been struggling with deflation, an ageing population, and a large national debt, and many believe that a stronger financial industry is key to long-term economic growth. 
However, the securities industry is calling for more significant changes to the laws governing the industry, in addition to the proposed reforms. Some have called for the introduction of a fiduciary duty for financial advisors, who are currently not required to act in the best interest of their clients. Others have called for the introduction of lower fees for individual investors to make investing more accessible to the general public. 
In conclusion, while the LDP's proposed reforms were intended to stimulate investment activity and loosen the grip of Japan's dominant banks, the securities industry has expressed disappointment with the changes. Critics argue that the proposed changes could lead to unintended consequences and create further risks for the industry. Despite this, there is growing demand for financial reform in Japan, and it remains to be seen whether additional changes will be introduced in the future.
