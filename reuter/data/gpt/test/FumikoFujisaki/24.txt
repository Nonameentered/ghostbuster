Japan's financial deregulation in the 1990s, known as the "Big Bang," was supposed to bring a new era of growth for the country's banks. However, recent reports suggest that the fallout from that era is still being felt today as mergers and restructurings fall short of their intended goals.
The problems for Japan's banks began in the late 1980s when the country's economy was booming. Banks were encouraged to lend money aggressively, and they did so, often to companies that were less than creditworthy. When the bubble burst in the early 1990s, many of these loans became uncollectible, leaving banks with a significant amount of bad debt on their books.
To help deal with the crisis, the Japanese government introduced a series of reforms in the mid-1990s, including financial deregulation. The goal was to make the country's financial sector more efficient and create a more competitive banking environment. However, the reforms did not have the intended effect, and Japan's banks are still feeling the effects of the changes today.
One of the primary issues facing Japan's banks is their size. Most of them are large and unwieldy, with sprawling corporate structures that make it difficult to make swift decisions. The government has pushed them to merge in an attempt to create larger and more efficient institutions. While several mergers have taken place in recent years, they have not been as successful as many had hoped. 
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, for example, was created in 2005 through the merger of Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group and UFJ Holdings. The new entity was supposed to be a giant in the banking world, but it has struggled to achieve the expected efficiencies. Similarly, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group was created through a merger in 2002, and while it has performed better than Mitsubishi UFJ, it has not been the resounding success that many had hoped for.
Restructuring has also been a go-to solution for Japan's troubled banks. They have attempted to shed non-core businesses, cut costs, and become more streamlined. However, that approach has not always been successful either. 
For example, Nomura Holdings has spent the better part of a decade trying to restructure, but it still struggles with bloated costs and weak profitability. Meanwhile, Mizuho Financial Group has been attempting to improve its internal controls after a series of high-profile scandals. While the bank claims progress, there are still doubts about whether its restructuring efforts will be enough to improve its bottom line.
The challenges facing Japan's banks undoubtedly reflect the broader challenges of the country's economy. While Japan might be the world's third-largest economy by GDP, it has struggled with long-term economic growth, and the banks are no exception.
Despite the struggles of the banking sector, there are signs of hope. The Bank of Japan has kept interest rates low and has been pumping liquidity into the banking system, helping to keep the banks afloat. Additionally, Japan's economy is undergoing a gradual recovery, which could help give the banks a boost.
In response to the challenges, many of Japan's banks are trying to adapt to the changing environment. They are investing in new technology and digitization, as well as expanding overseas to offset the sluggish growth at home. For example, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is pushing into Southeast Asia, while Nomura Holdings is looking at expanding its asset management business in Europe. These changes could help the banks find new sources of growth and stay competitive in the years to come.
The banking industry in Japan has faced its fair share of troubles in recent years, and the fallout from the "Big Bang" financial deregulation of the 1990s is still being felt. However, there are reasons for optimism. The government has taken steps to help keep the banks afloat, and the banks themselves are adapting to a changing environment, investing in new technologies, and pushing into new markets. It will be interesting to see how the industry continues to evolve in the years to come.
