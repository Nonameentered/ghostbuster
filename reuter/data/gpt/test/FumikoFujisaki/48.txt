Tokyo-based investment bank Nomura Securities Co Ltd has been accused of making illegal payments to a client in connection with a foreign investment deal. According to sources familiar with the matter, the bank allegedly transferred a significant amount of money to an intermediary company earlier this year, which was then passed on to a foreign official to secure a deal between Nomura and a government agency.
The payments, which were made during the first quarter of this year, are said to have violated Japan's foreign bribery laws, which forbid companies from paying or offering anything of value to foreign officials in order to obtain business or gain a competitive advantage. The bank is now under investigation by both Japanese and foreign authorities, who are looking into the matter to determine if any wrongdoing has occurred.
Nomura Securities has denied any wrongdoing, stating that it has strict anti-corruption policies and procedures in place to prevent bribery and corruption. "We take these allegations very seriously and will fully cooperate with the authorities in their investigation," said a spokesperson for the bank.
The case comes at a time when Japanese companies are increasingly facing scrutiny over their business practices, with the government cracking down on corruption and fraud in the wake of several high-profile scandals in recent years. In 2017, Toshiba Corp was fined for deliberately overstating its profits, while Mitsubishi Materials Corp was also found to have falsified quality data.
Nomura Securities has faced its own share of scandals in the past, including a case in 2012 when it was fined $26 million by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors in mortgage-backed securities. In 2018, the bank was also fined $480 million by US authorities for its involvement in a bribery scandal involving the Malaysian state fund 1MDB.
The latest allegations against Nomura Securities have raised questions about the bank's compliance procedures and the effectiveness of its anti-corruption policies. Critics say that Nomura should have been more diligent in vetting the intermediary company and the foreign official involved in the deal, and that it should have taken a more proactive approach to preventing bribery and corruption.
The case may also have wider implications for the Japanese financial industry, which has been criticized in the past for its lax approach to regulatory compliance. "The Nomura case is a warning shot for the entire industry that they need to do more to ensure that they are operating within the bounds of the law," said an industry analyst who did not wish to be named.
The news comes as Nomura Securities is undergoing a major restructuring, following a series of losses and executive departures. The bank has recently announced plans to cut back on its overseas operations and focus more on its core businesses in Japan. The scandal could further damage the bank's reputation and slow down its plans for growth.
In order to restore trust and confidence in the financial sector, experts say that companies need to take a more proactive approach to compliance and risk management, and be more transparent about their business practices. "Companies need to take a hard look at their policies and procedures and make sure that they are doing everything they can to prevent corruption and fraud," said an anti-corruption expert.
The investigation into Nomura Securities is ongoing, and the bank faces the possibility of severe penalties and sanctions if it is found to have violated Japan's anti-bribery laws. The case is also likely to lead to a renewed focus on regulatory compliance in the Japanese financial industry, which could have far-reaching consequences for the future of the sector.
