Japanese investment bank, Nomura, has announced a major executive reshuffle in an effort to revamp its corporate culture and regain investor confidence. As part of the overhaul, the company will replace its current CEO, Koji Nagai, with Kentaro Okuda, who currently heads Nomura's wholesale division.
The move comes after the bank suffered a series of high-profile scandals in recent years, including its involvement in a major insider trading case in the US. The bank's reputation was further tarnished by the arrest of a senior executive in Tokyo on suspicion of market manipulation.
The executive reshuffle is part of a broader effort by Nomura to regain the trust of investors and improve its bottom line. In a statement, the bank said that the move was designed to "strengthen the company's management structure and improve its corporate culture, while also promoting diversity and inclusion."
In addition to the leadership changes, Nomura also announced a series of other organizational changes, including the creation of a new board-level committee to oversee risk management and the establishment of a new global office to coordinate the bank's international operations.
The reshuffle marks a significant shift for Nomura, which has struggled in recent years to adapt to a rapidly changing global financial landscape. However, analysts say that the new leadership team and organizational structure could help the bank turn things around and regain its position as a key player in the global financial industry.
