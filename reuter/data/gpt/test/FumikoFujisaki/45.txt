In a move expected to shake up the Japanese securities industry, regulators have proposed the liberalisation of brokerage fees. The new policy, still in the planning stages, could see the elimination of fixed commission rates on stock trades, creating more competition in the market. While the full impact of the proposal remains unclear, industry insiders predict that the new policy could lead to widespread closures of Japanese securities houses, particularly smaller firms who would struggle to compete in a more open market.
The proposed liberalisation of brokerage fees, put forth earlier this year by the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA), would allow securities firms to set their own commission rates on stock trades. The current system, which sets commission rates at a fixed percentage of the trade’s value, has been in place since 1999. The JSDA argues that the proposal would increase competition in the market, potentially leading to lower fees for investors.
However, the move has been met with resistance from smaller securities houses, who fear that they will be unable to compete with larger players who can afford to lower their commission rates. In a statement to the Financial Times, the CEO of one such firm warned that “the proposed liberalisation of brokerage fees is like a tsunami approaching”. Many smaller firms have long relied on fixed commission rates to compete with larger firms that have deeper pockets and greater resources.
On the other hand, larger firms are more likely to welcome the change. They argue that the current system was created at a time when the industry was monopolised by a handful of large firms and that a more open system would allow for greater competition and innovation. The Japanese securities industry is largely dominated by a few giant firms, such as Nomura and Daiwa Securities, but the new policy could allow for a more level playing field.
While the new policy is still in the planning stages, it has already had an impact on the industry. According to the Nikkei Asian Review, smaller securities houses have seen a decline in business as investors hold off on making trades until the future of brokerage fees is clearer. Many analysts predict that smaller firms will be forced to either merge with larger firms or close their doors altogether if the policy is implemented.
One concern is that the elimination of fixed commission rates could lead to a race to the bottom, with securities firms competing to offer the lowest possible commissions. This, in turn, could lead to a decline in the quality of services provided by these firms. The JSDA has attempted to address this concern by requiring that firms disclose their commission rates prior to executing trades, allowing investors to make informed decisions.
Another concern is that the liberalisation of brokerage fees could lead to increased risk-taking by securities firms. Lower fees could provide firms with greater incentive to take on riskier investments in order to generate higher profits. In response, regulators have proposed measures to increase oversight of securities firms, including more frequent audits and increased reporting requirements.
The liberalisation of brokerage fees is part of a larger push by regulators to liberalise the Japanese economy. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made structural reforms, such as increasing competition and reducing regulation, a key part of his economic agenda. The move to liberalise brokerage fees is seen as a sign that Japan is serious about creating a more open and competitive economy.
However, the potential closures of smaller securities firms could have a negative impact on the Japanese economy. The brokerage industry is a significant employer in Japan, particularly in Tokyo. The loss of jobs resulting from the closures of smaller firms could lead to increased unemployment and reduced economic growth.
In conclusion, the proposed liberalisation of brokerage fees in Japan could have a significant impact on the securities industry. While the move is intended to increase competition and reduce fees for investors, it could lead to the closure of many smaller securities houses. The full impact of the policy remains to be seen, but it is clear that the Japanese securities industry is facing a period of uncertainty and potential upheaval.
