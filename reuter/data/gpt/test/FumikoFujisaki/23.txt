The Japanese banking industry is making moves to tackle financial problems and improve stability in anticipation of the upcoming Big Bang era of deregulation. The industry has been plagued by low profitability, a shrinking population, and the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.
The Big Bang era, set to begin in April 2021, will see the removal of regulations governing the banking industry. This will facilitate increased competition and variation in services, with the hope that it will spur rapid growth and encourage investment across the industry.
To prepare for this, Japanese banks have been shaking up their business models, shifting away from traditional lending to embrace new digital business opportunities.
One example of this shift is the recent joint venture between Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) and SBI Holdings, which will see the two companies work together to develop new digital payment services targeting individuals and small businesses.
The venture aims to tap into the growing need for cashless payment solutions, particularly after the Japanese government's push to increase the use of electronic payments to contain the spread of COVID-19.
"SMFG and SBI will work together to increase the convenience of digital payments in the Japanese market, promoting cashless payments and the uptake of a range of digital currencies," said SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has been driving forward with its digital yen project, which aims to introduce a digital currency to support non-cash payments.
In a speech in October 2020, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the bank would conduct experiments with a view to "commencing proof of concept (PoC) experiments in the fiscal year 2021, to test the basic functions and features required for CBDC (central bank digital currency)," adding that no decision had been made on whether to launch such a currency.
This is part of a global trend towards central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which represent a new layer of the financial system that is separate from the traditional banking system. CBDCs are viewed as a way to increase financial inclusion, particularly in developing countries where a large proportion of the population is unbanked.
Banking giant MUFG has also been adapting to the changing landscape, launching a new business structure in April 2020. The bank now operates as a holding company with four core subsidiaries: MUFG Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Holdings, and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
The restructuring was designed to improve the bank's efficiency and profitability by streamlining operations and removing duplication, and shifting focus towards digital business opportunities.
"The business environment surrounding the banking industry is undergoing dramatic changes, such as the introduction of cutting-edge technologies and the arrival of new entrants," said MUFG President and Group CEO Kanetsugu Mike at a press conference in March 2020.
MUFG has also announced plans to invest 1 trillion yen ($9.6 billion) in digital business transformation, with a focus on blockchain technology, data analytics, and artificial intelligence.
Other Japanese banks have been taking similar steps to position themselves for the Big Bang era of deregulation. Mizuho Financial Group launched its first digital-only bank in 2019, while Resona Holdings announced plans to overhaul its business model in January 2020, aiming to focus on digital solutions and reduce its dependence on traditional lending.
However, there are concerns that the speed of digital transformation could exacerbate existing problems, particularly around cybersecurity.
"The rapid increase in data held by financial institutions creates new risks associated with cybersecurity and data protection," warned Kuroda in his October 2020 speech. "Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the resilience of the financial system to cyber-attacks, including by improving the cyber-risk management of financial institutions."
Despite these challenges, many experts believe that the Big Bang era presents a significant opportunity for the Japanese banking industry to innovate and expand, in line with the needs of consumers and the wider economy.
"The deregulation of the banking industry creates a huge opportunity for Japan's banks to drive innovation and capture new business opportunities," said McKinsey analyst Kazunori Yamada in an interview with Bloomberg in October 2020.
However, Yamada warned that success would depend on the banks' ability to redefine their core business model, and to "innovate at a level that differentiates them from competitors and harnesses the vast amounts of data they have collected." 
Overall, the Japanese banking industry is making proactive moves to address longstanding issues and prepare for the Big Bang era of deregulation. The focus on digital transformation and innovation will be crucial for the industry to stay competitive and capture new business opportunities, while ensuring that cybersecurity remains a top priority.
