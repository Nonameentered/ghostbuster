Two of Japan’s troubled banks, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, have recently announced restructuring and merger plans respectively in a bid to end their financial woes.
Mizuho Financial Group, Japan’s third-largest bank by assets, revealed its plan to restructure its business divisions on Wednesday. The bank will merge its retail banking and corporate banking units into a new arm named the Domestic Business Group. Meanwhile, the bank’s global corporate banking will be rebuilt under the Global Business Group. The changes are expected to be implemented in April 2022.
The restructuring plan is seen as a way for the bank to streamline its operations and boost profitability after years of lackluster performance. Mizuho has been grappling with low interest rates and an ultra-competitive market in Japan. The bank has also faced criticism for violations of anti-money laundering regulations and weak governance.
The bank’s CEO, Tatsufumi Sakai, said in a statement that the restructuring will enable the bank to better serve its customers and increase its global competitiveness. “We are committed to further growth and stability of the Mizuho Group” he added.
Meanwhile, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), Japan’s second-largest bank by market value, announced plans to merge with its smaller affiliate Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings in a deal worth $23 billion. The merger will create Japan’s second-biggest bank by assets, after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.
The deal, which is expected to be completed by April 2022, will involve SMFG issuing new shares to Sumitomo Mitsui Trust shareholders in exchange for their shares. The new entity will be named Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and will take over the role of SMFG as the main listed company.
The merger is aimed at improving the profitability of SMFG, which has been struggling with low interest rates and a shrinking domestic market. The bank has also been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to a surge in bad loans.
In a statement, SMFG said that the merger will create a “new business model” that will enable it to “deliver better value to customers”. The bank added that it expects the deal to result in cost savings of around $1.2 billion per year and a boost to its balance sheet.
The merger has been welcomed by analysts, who say that it will enable the new entity to compete more effectively with rival banks. “This is a good move for both banks. They have complementary businesses and the merger will create a more diversified and stronger entity” said Kota Hirayama, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The news of the restructuring and merger plans comes as Japan’s banking sector faces increasing pressure from low interest rates and a sluggish economy. The country’s three largest banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group, have all reported lower profits in recent months.
Analysts say that the sector’s challenges are unlikely to ease anytime soon, citing the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and a possible slowdown in the global economy. They warn that Japanese banks will need to continue to adapt their business models and explore new revenue streams in order to survive.
Despite the challenges, Mizuho’s Tatsufumi Sakai said that he was optimistic about the future of the banking sector in Japan. “We are confident that we can navigate these challenging times and emerge stronger than ever” he said.
