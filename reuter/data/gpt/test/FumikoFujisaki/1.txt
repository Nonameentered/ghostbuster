Japan, once known for its lifetime employment system and generous salaries, is now struggling with stagnant wages and job insecurity as traditional pay systems give way to flexibility. Many workers face an uncertain future as companies prioritize profits over employee welfare.
The problem stems from Japan's unique system of seniority-based pay, which has been in place for decades. Under this system, employees are given automatic raises based on their years of service, regardless of their performance or the company's financial success. This system created a sense of security among workers, who knew they could count on a steady salary and job security for as long as they worked for the company.
However, as the Japanese economy has struggled in recent years, many companies have had to cut costs, and one of the first places they look to do so is in labor costs. The seniority-based pay system has become a target, as it is seen as inflexible and expensive. As a result, many companies have turned to more flexible pay systems, such as performance-based pay, to save money.
This shift has left many workers feeling vulnerable and insecure, as they may no longer be guaranteed a steady salary or job. According to a 2019 survey by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, nearly half of all Japanese workers are now classified as "non-regular" or "irregular" workers, meaning they are not full-time employees and do not enjoy the same benefits or job security as regular employees. The survey also found that the number of workers who feel their job is secure has fallen from 49% in 1997 to just 33% in 2019.
The problem is particularly acute for younger workers, who are entering the workforce at a time of great uncertainty. Many are forced to work multiple part-time jobs just to make ends meet, and face a lifetime of insecurity and low pay. In addition, many companies are reluctant to invest in their younger workers, knowing that they may leave after a few years in search of better opportunities.
The government has been slow to address the issue, and has instead focused on promoting "work-style reform", which seeks to improve work-life balance and reduce overtime. While these reforms are important, they do not address the underlying issue of job insecurity and low pay.
Some companies have taken steps to address the problem on their own, by offering more flexible work arrangements and performance-based pay. However, these efforts are often limited in scope and do not address the systemic issues of Japan's labor market.
The problem is not just limited to Japan, but is a problem that is affecting workers around the world. Companies are increasingly focused on profits over employee welfare, and are more willing to cut costs than invest in their workers. The rise of the gig economy has only exacerbated this trend, with many workers now classified as independent contractors and deprived of basic labor protections.
Ultimately, the problem of stagnant wages and job insecurity is a complex one, with no easy solutions. It will require a concerted effort from the government, companies, and workers themselves to address the issue and ensure that all workers are treated fairly and with dignity. Until then, many Japanese workers will continue to face an uncertain future, with all the financial and emotional stress that entails.
