On Thursday morning, officials from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department conducted a raid on the offices of Nomura Securities Co Ltd. The raid is a part of an ongoing investigation into alleged racketeer payments made by the company to an adviser to the Japanese Ministry of Finance.
According to sources close to the investigation, the payments in question were made from 2015 to 2018 and were part of Nomura's efforts to win new business from the Ministry of Finance. The adviser in question, who has not been named publicly, is said to have connections to a group of individuals known for their ties to organized crime in Japan.
As part of the raid, officials seized documents and electronic devices from Nomura's headquarters and other offices in Tokyo. The company issued a statement saying that it is cooperating fully with the investigation and that it takes the allegations against it very seriously.
"For Nomura, compliance is a top priority, and we are committed to observing all laws and regulations," the statement read. "We are fully cooperating with the authorities in this matter, and we will take any necessary steps to ensure that our operations are conducted in accordance with the highest standards of ethics and integrity."
The investigation into Nomura is just the latest example of a crackdown on corruption and illegal payments in Japan's financial industry. In recent years, Japanese regulators and law enforcement officials have been working to stamp out a culture of bribery and collusion that has long been a part of the country's business environment.
Last year, the Japanese government passed a new law aimed at cracking down on corporate malfeasance, including bribery, money laundering, and other forms of financial crime. The law, which went into effect in February of this year, gives regulators more power to investigate and punish companies that engage in illegal activities.
The government has also stepped up its enforcement efforts, with the Financial Services Agency (FSA) and other agencies conducting a record number of inspections and audits last year. The FSA has been particularly active in cracking down on insider trading and other forms of market abuse, and it has imposed steep fines and other penalties on companies found to be in violation of the law.
Despite these efforts, however, corruption and financial crime remain serious problems in Japan's financial industry. According to a recent survey by the US-based law firm Morrison & Foerster, nearly one-third of Japanese companies believe that bribery and corruption are "commonplace" in the country's business environment.
The survey also found that Japanese companies are much more likely than their US and European counterparts to rely on intermediaries such as consultants and agents to win new business. These intermediaries are often used to make payments to government officials, politicians, and other decision-makers in order to secure contracts and other forms of business.
The use of intermediaries is a common practice in many countries, but in Japan it is often viewed as a way to circumvent anti-bribery laws and regulations. Critics say that the practice is a holdover from Japan's post-World War II era, when companies often relied on political connections and other forms of influence to win business.
"The use of intermediaries is a major red flag for regulators and law enforcement officials," said one Tokyo-based lawyer who specializes in anti-bribery law. "It's not necessarily illegal, but it raises questions about transparency and accountability. Companies need to be very careful when they're working with intermediaries, and they need to make sure that they're following all of the rules and regulations."
The investigation into Nomura is likely to heighten concerns about corruption and financial crime in Japan's financial industry. The company, which is one of the country's largest securities firms, has a reputation for being well-connected and influential, and it has been a major player in the Japanese market for many years.
Nomura's competitors are likely to seize on the investigation as evidence of the company's alleged wrongdoing, and they may use it as a way to gain a competitive advantage. Meanwhile, shareholders and other stakeholders will be watching closely to see how the company responds to the allegations against it, and whether it is able to maintain the trust and confidence of its clients and customers.
