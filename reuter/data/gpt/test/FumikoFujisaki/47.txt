Nomura Securities Co Ltd faces a wider pay-off scandal as former executives and general manager have been implicated. The Japanese investment bank is still reeling from the fallout of the previous scandal involving insider trades in 2018, and this new development is sure to rattle the firm even more.
The latest scandal came to light when the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office raided the Nomura's head office in late February. The authorities' raid was in search of evidence of the bank's alleged involvement in the Japanese Tax Agency's investigation into tax evasion.
Nomura Securities is accused of making illegal payments to government officials in exchange for information about tax audits. The payments were made between 2012 and 2016, and it is estimated that the amount paid was between $6 million and $8 million.
According to the Japanese Tax Agency, Nomura made the payments to officials in the regional tax bureau, including a general manager and several of his subordinates. The payments were made either directly or through a third party.
Nomura has already admitted to the allegation and released a statement on March 1st that read: "Nomura is cooperating fully with the investigation and will take appropriate measures as necessary."
In addition to the bank's admission of wrongdoing, several of its former executives and a general manager are now facing charges related to the scandal. The former executives and general manager are suspected of orchestrating the illegal payments.
The former executives include Harutaka Eguchi, a former director of Nomura's sales division, and Hideo Shijuku, a former managing executive officer. The general manager in question is not named in the press release.
The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office is now proceeding with its investigation, and it is believed that several more individuals may be implicated.
The scandal has already had an impact on Nomura's share price, which has fallen by over 12% since the news broke. The bank's reputation has also taken a hit, and it is unclear how long it will take for Nomura to recover from this latest scandal.
The Japanese government, which is keen to improve corporate governance in the country, has also weighed in on the scandal. The government has indicated that it will conduct a review of Nomura's corporate governance and compliance frameworks to ensure that they are robust enough to prevent similar scandals from occurring.
The government's review is part of a wider push to improve corporate governance in Japan, which has long been criticized for its traditional and insular business practices. The government's efforts include initiatives aimed at promoting transparency, increasing accountability, and ensuring that companies are more responsive to the needs of their stakeholders.
The Nomura scandal is just the latest in a string of corporate scandals that have rocked Japan in recent years. These include the Kobe Steel scandal in 2017, where the company was found to have falsified data on its products, and the Toshiba accounting scandal in 2015, where the company had overstated its profits for several years.
These scandals have prompted calls for Japan to adopt stricter corporate governance and accounting standards, which would bring it in line with international best practices.
The Nomura scandal is a significant setback for the bank, but it also highlights the need for Japanese companies to focus on improving their corporate governance and compliance frameworks. If Japan is to restore investor confidence and attract more foreign investment, it must demonstrate that it is serious about reforming its business practices and ensuring that companies are held accountable for any wrongdoing.
In conclusion, Nomura Securities' wider pay-off scandal is a severe blow to the bank's reputation, and it will take time for the company to recover from it. The scandal also highlights the need for Japan to improve its corporate governance and compliance frameworks, as well as to adopt stricter accounting standards. If Japan is to restore investor confidence and attract more foreign investment, it must demonstrate a commitment to reforming its business practices and holding companies accountable for any wrongdoing.
