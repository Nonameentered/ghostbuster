Nomura Securities, one of Japan's major investment banks, has been raided by prosecutors in relation to allegations of illegal payments to a client linked to organized crime.
On Thursday morning, a team of 110 investigators from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors' Office and the Metropolitan Police Department descended on Nomura Securities' headquarters in central Tokyo. The search and seizure operation reportedly lasted seven hours and involved the confiscation of documents and electronic devices.
According to sources familiar with the matter, the prosecutors are investigating the alleged payments made by Nomura Securities to a corporate client believed to be connected to a prominent criminal syndicate. The payments, which are said to have occurred over several years, were allegedly made in exchange for business favors and information.
The client in question has not been named, but reports suggest that it is a small to mid-sized firm in the real estate or construction industry. Sources say that the payments were disguised as consultancy fees or commissions, but that the bank's compliance department had raised concerns about their legitimacy.
Nomura Securities has not yet commented on the raid, but sources say that the bank has been cooperating with the authorities and conducting its own internal investigation since the allegations came to light. It is not yet clear whether any individuals within the bank will face charges.
The investigation into Nomura Securities' dealings with the alleged racketeers-linked client is the latest in a series of scandals to hit Japan's financial industry in recent years. In 2017, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities was fined for a similar violation, while in 2018, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation was penalized for its role in a money laundering scheme.
The news has sent shockwaves through Japan's financial sector, as Nomura Securities is one of the country's largest and most respected investment banks. The firm, which was established in 1925, has a global footprint and is known for its expertise in areas such as equities, fixed income, and M&A.
Nomura Securities has also been caught up in other controversies in recent years. In 2018, the bank admitted to falsifying inspection reports for client accounts, a practice that had been going on for more than a decade. The scandal led to the resignation of several senior executives and a pledge to overhaul the bank's compliance procedures.
The latest allegations against Nomura Securities have raised concerns about the state of corporate governance in Japan and the wider issue of links between organized crime and big business. Japan's government has been cracking down on this issue in recent years, with new legislation introduced in 2017 to outlaw transactions with criminal organizations.
The raid on Nomura Securities is likely to have wider implications for Japan's financial industry, as the country seeks to restore its reputation as a safe and reliable place to do business. Tokyo-based financial analyst, Katsuhiko Nakamura, told the BBC, "This kind of thing damages the trust in the financial industryâ€¦ it's a very serious matter."
The investigation into Nomura Securities' alleged payments to a racketeers-linked client is ongoing, and further details are expected to emerge in the coming days and weeks. In the meantime, the bank will be hoping that this latest scandal does not seriously damage its reputation or long-term prospects.
