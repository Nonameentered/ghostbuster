TOKYO - Two of Japan's most troubled banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), have announced plans to take action to end their financial problems and prepare for financial deregulation. The banks have suffered from years of low economic growth, low interest rates, and the slow pace of structural reforms in the country. These factors have led to significant financial pressure on the banks, which has prompted them to make changes to their business strategies.
MUFG, Japan's largest bank by assets, has revealed plans to cut more than 6,000 jobs and close around 30% of its domestic branches. This is part of a larger plan to reduce costs by ¥300 billion ($2.8 billion) by fiscal year 2023. The bank has struggled to generate profits due to the prolonged low interest rate environment in the country.
To offset the negative effects of low interest rates on its lending business, MUFG has also announced plans to invest in high-growth sectors such as fintech and digital banking. The bank aims to increase its mobile app users from 6 million to 10 million by 2023 and to expand its digital payment services globally.
In addition, MUFG plans to increase its lending activities in Southeast Asia and India, where economic growth rates are higher than in Japan. The bank plans to double its annual lending to these regions to ¥3 trillion ($28 billion) by 2023.
Meanwhile, SMFG, Japan's third-largest bank by assets, has announced plans to acquire Fullerton India Credit Company Ltd. for $2 billion. Fullerton India is a non-banking financial company that provides loans to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in India. The acquisition is part of SMFG's strategy to expand its operations in high-growth markets outside of Japan.
According to SMFG, India is an attractive market for the bank due to its growing SMB sector, which has a significant demand for financial services. The bank aims to use Fullerton India's platform to offer loans to SMBs in other emerging markets such as Southeast Asia and Africa.
SMFG will also use Fullerton India's digital platform to offer digital banking services to customers in Japan. The bank aims to leverage Fullerton India's experience in using digital tools to reach new customers and offer more services online.
These moves by MUFG and SMFG come as Japan prepares to deregulate its financial services industry. The government plans to promote competition in the industry by allowing new players to enter the market and by removing some of the regulatory barriers that have been in place for decades.
For the banks, this means they will face increased competition from new players, especially in areas such as digital banking and fintech. However, it also presents an opportunity for the banks to expand their businesses and to offer new services to customers.
Overall, the moves by MUFG and SMFG show that the banks are taking action to end their financial problems and to prepare for the changes that are coming to the industry. Both banks are focusing on reducing costs, expanding their businesses in high-growth markets, and investing in digital platforms to offer new services to customers.
The success of these strategies will depend on a number of factors, including the overall health of the global economy, the pace of technological change, and Japan's ability to enact meaningful structural reforms. However, by taking action now, MUFG and SMFG are positioning themselves to succeed in the fast-changing landscape of the financial services industry.
