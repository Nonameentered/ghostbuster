Japanâ€™s banks are gearing up for the financial market deregulation in April 2021 by taking action to tackle their long-standing financial woes. In recent years, Japanese banks have been plagued by declining interest rates, increased competition from fintech firms, and a shrinking domestic market, leading to decreased profitability and the need for significant restructuring.
To address these challenges, Japanese banks are taking various measures to enhance their competitiveness by diversifying their businesses, investing in fintech solutions, and exploring overseas opportunities.
One major step that Japanese banks are taking is diversification. Traditionally, Japanese banks have focused on lending to large companies and individuals. However, with the shrinking domestic market and declining interest rates, banks have started to diversify their businesses to capture growth opportunities in other areas such as asset management and investment banking.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, has been expanding its asset management business globally. MUFG recently acquired a 20% stake in the global asset management firm, Aflac Global Investments. This investment would give MUFG access to Aflac's expertise in real estate, infrastructure, and private equity, and enable it to expand its asset management capabilities globally.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), Japan's third largest bank, has also been exploring opportunities in investment banking. SMFG recently formed a joint venture with Standard Chartered to provide investment banking services to Japanese clients. The partnership will enable SMFG to leverage Standard Chartered's global network to offer a wider range of investment banking services to Japanese clients.
Another area where Japanese banks are investing is in fintech solutions. Banks have been partnering with fintech firms to develop innovative digital solutions to cater to changing customer needs. The collaboration would enable banks to offer personalized services to their customers, enhance operational efficiency, and reduce costs.
Mizuho Financial Group, Japan's second-largest bank, has been investing heavily in fintech for the past decade. The bank recently launched a digital bank subsidiary, Jibun Bank, which offers online banking services to individual customers. Jibun Bank has been successful with over 2 million downloads of its mobile app.
Meanwhile, other Japanese banks such as MUFG and SMFG have been partnering with fintech firms to develop innovative solutions. MUFG has formed a joint venture with Akamai Technologies to offer blockchain-based payment solutions to corporate customers. SMFG has partnered with Singapore-based fintech firm, BondEvalue, to launch a blockchain-based platform for bond trading.
In addition to diversification and investment in fintech, Japanese banks are also exploring opportunities overseas. With the shrinking domestic market, banks have been expanding their businesses globally to capture growth opportunities.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) has been actively pursuing overseas acquisitions and partnerships to expand its business globally. In 2018, MUFG acquired a 40% stake in Bank Danamon Indonesia, the country's fifth-largest bank. This acquisition would enable MUFG to expand its presence in the ASEAN region and capture growth opportunities.
Similarly, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) has been exploring opportunities in Southeast Asia. The bank has formed a joint venture with Singapore's DBS Bank to provide trade finance services to Japanese companies operating in the region. The partnership would enable SMFG to leverage DBS Bank's network and expertise to expand its presence in Southeast Asia.
In conclusion, Japanese banks are taking proactive steps to address their long-standing financial woes and prepare for the financial market deregulation in April 2021. Diversification, investment in fintech, and overseas expansion are some of the key measures being taken by Japanese banks to enhance their competitiveness and capture growth opportunities. It remains to be seen how these measures would impact the banking industry in Japan and their position in the global financial market.
