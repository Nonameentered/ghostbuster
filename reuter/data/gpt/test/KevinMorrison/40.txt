David Jones Ltd, the upscale Australian department store, has announced plans to search for a new Chief Executive Officer during what the company has called "challenging retail conditions". 
The decision comes as the department store faces increasing competition from online retailers and struggles to adapt to the changing retail landscape. David Jones has been struggling with falling sales, with the company recently reporting a 2.7% decline in total sales for the financial year ending July 2019.
In a statement, David Jones' Chairman, Mr. Peter Harmer, said the company was now seeking "a visionary and strategic leader, with a track record of delivering results in challenging retail environments".
"The retail industry is undergoing significant transformation and David Jones is not immune to these challenges," Mr. Harmer said in the statement. "We are seeking a leader who can navigate these changes and better position David Jones for the future."
David Jones' current CEO, Mr. David Thomas, has been in the role since June 2018. According to reports in the press, Mr. Thomas has been under pressure to turn around the department store's fortunes, with the company's financial performance continuing to deteriorate under his leadership. 
Mr. Thomas is expected to remain in the role until a new CEO is appointed, and will work with the Chairman and the Board to ensure a smooth transition.
The search for a new CEO comes as David Jones faces increased scrutiny from investors and shareholders. According to reports, the company's largest investor, South African retail conglomerate Woolworths Holdings Limited, has been pressuring David Jones to improve its financial performance and take steps to remain competitive in the changing retail landscape.
Woolworths Holdings acquired David Jones in 2014 for a reported A$2.1bn, with the expectation that the Australian department store would provide a foothold in the lucrative Australian market. However, the company has struggled to compete with online retailers such as Amazon and has faced increasing competition from local rivals such as Myer.
David Jones has been working to improve its operations in recent months, announcing a range of initiatives to drive sales and improve profitability. The company recently announced plans to ramp up its online offerings, with the launch of a new website designed to offer customers a more seamless shopping experience. 
David Jones has also been investing in its physical stores, with refurbishments and upgrades planned for a number of locations across Australia. The company has also been focusing on improving its product range, with a particular emphasis on high-end fashion and beauty products.
Despite these efforts, David Jones has continued to struggle in the face of challenging market conditions. In addition to increased competition from online retailers, the company is also navigating a difficult economic environment, with consumers increasingly cautious about spending amid concerns about the global economy and rising household debt levels.
Mr. Harmer said the Board was committed to finding a new CEO with the skills and experience to lead David Jones into the future.
"We will be looking for someone with a deep understanding of retail, strong leadership capabilities, and a track record of driving growth and innovation," he said.
The search for a new CEO is expected to begin immediately, with the Board aiming to have a new leader in place by early next year. In the meantime, Mr. Thomas will continue to lead the company and work to implement the company's strategic initiatives.
David Jones has a long and storied history in Australia, with the department store first established in Sydney in 1838. The company has grown to become one of the country's most iconic brands, known for its high-end fashion lines, luxury products, and unparalleled shopping experiences. 
However, as the retail industry continues to evolve and face new challenges, David Jones will need to find a new leader with the vision and skills necessary to navigate these changes and ensure the company remains competitive in the years ahead.
