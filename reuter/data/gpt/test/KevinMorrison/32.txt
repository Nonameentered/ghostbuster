Optus Communications, the Australian telecommunications firm, announced today that it expects strong results for the financial year ending 30 June 1997, despite delays caused by litigation against its former controlling shareholder, Cable & Wireless. The company also plans to float its shares on the Australian stock exchange in 1997.
Optus CEO Chris Anderson said the litigation against Cable & Wireless, which had delayed its ability to fully integrate with its new owner Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel), was now nearing resolution. "We expect to receive a settlement soon, which will allow us to move forward with our plans," he said.
Despite the delays, Anderson said the company was on track to achieve its earnings targets for the financial year, thanks to strong demand for its range of telecommunications services. "We're seeing solid growth in all our key markets, including mobile, data and internet services," he said.
The company's focus on innovative new products and services had also helped it to attract new customers and keep existing ones, Anderson said. "We continue to invest heavily in areas like broadband and mobile internet, which we believe will be the key drivers of growth in the years ahead."
In addition to its core telecommunications services, Optus has also expanded into new areas such as multimedia and pay television, which Anderson said were showing promising results. "We're seeing strong uptake of our multimedia and pay TV products, which are helping to drive revenue growth," he said.
Looking ahead to its planned sharemarket float, Anderson said the company was confident it could successfully raise capital from the public markets. "We believe there is strong investor demand for companies with a track record of growth and innovation, like Optus," he said.
The company's float on the Australian stock exchange is expected to take place in the second half of 1997, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals.
Optus was acquired by Singtel in 2001 for AUD $14 billion. The company is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Singtel and continues to operate as a leading provider of telecommunications services in Australia.
COMMENTARY
The announcement of strong results and a planned sharemarket float by Optus is welcome news for the company and its shareholders. Despite the challenges caused by the delays in resolving litigation against Cable & Wireless, Optus appears to be well positioned to prosper in an increasingly competitive telecommunications market.
The company's focus on innovation and investment in new services is particularly encouraging, as it suggests that Optus is committed to staying ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing industry. The strong growth in areas like mobile, data and internet services, as well as multimedia and pay television, is a testament to this approach.
The planned sharemarket float is also significant, as it indicates that Optus is confident it can attract public capital to support further growth and expansion. This will be an important milestone for the company and is likely to benefit both existing shareholders and potential new investors.
Overall, the news from Optus is a sign of a healthy and dynamic telecommunications market in Australia, with strong growth and innovation being driven by both established players like Optus and new entrants alike. The challenge for Optus will be to continue to build on its strengths and stay ahead of the curve in an increasingly competitive market.
