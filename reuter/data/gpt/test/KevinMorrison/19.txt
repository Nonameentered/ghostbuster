Qantas Airways, Australia's flag carrier, expects a flat result for the first half of the 1996/97 financial year due to higher currency and fuel costs, according to a statement by the airline on Thursday.
The airline said it expects its pre-tax profit for the first half to be around AUD 220 million ($164 million), the same level as in the previous year. The statement came as the airline prepares to report its financial results for the period on 21 February.
Higher currency and fuel costs have been cited as the main reasons behind the airline's flat result. Qantas said that while the Australian dollar has strengthened against the US dollar, the currency has weakened against other major currencies, which has impacted the airline's revenue.
The airline also highlighted the impact of higher fuel costs, which have risen by around 10% compared to the same period last year. Qantas said that while it has been able to offset some of these higher costs through increased revenue and cost-cutting measures, the impact on profitability has still been significant.
Despite the challenging operating environment, Qantas remains committed to delivering value to its customers and shareholders, the airline said.
"Qantas is continuing to focus on driving efficiency and productivity across all areas of the business, while also investing in new products and services to enhance the customer experience," the airline said in its statement.
The Australian airline industry has been under pressure in recent years due to intense competition from budget carriers and rising fuel costs. As a result, many airlines have been forced to cut costs and streamline their operations to remain competitive.
Earlier this year, Qantas announced a major restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and increasing efficiency. The plan includes the axing of 6,000 jobs, the closure of some international routes, and the sale of some of the airline's non-core assets.
The airline has also been focusing on growth opportunities in Asia, with plans to launch a new budget carrier called Jetstar Asia in mid-2017. The new carrier will be based in Singapore and will operate flights to various destinations in Asia.
Qantas has also been investing in its existing fleet, with plans to refurbish its A380 aircraft and introduce new Boeing 787 Dreamliners into its fleet. The airline has also been expanding its international network, with new flights to destinations such as Beijing, Tokyo, and San Francisco.
Despite the ongoing challenges in the industry, Qantas said it remains committed to its long-term growth strategy and is confident in its ability to deliver strong results in the future.
"We are focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth over the long term, and we believe we have the right strategy in place to achieve this," the airline said.
Industry analysts have mixed views on Qantas' prospects for the future. Some have expressed concern about the impact of rising fuel costs and intense competition on the airline's profitability, while others believe that the airline's long-term outlook is positive due to its diversified business model and focus on growth opportunities in Asia.
The airline's shares were up 1.6% to AUD 6.74 ($5) at the close of trading on Thursday.
