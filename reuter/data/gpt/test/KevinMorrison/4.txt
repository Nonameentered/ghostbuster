OzEmail, one of Australia's leading Internet service providers, has launched the world's first long-distance telephone calls over the Internet at a quarter of the cost of Telstra and Optus.
The company's new service, called OzPhone, enables people in Australia to make long-distance phone calls to anywhere in the world using their existing Internet connection.
According to OzEmail, customers can save up to 75% on the cost of calls compared to using traditional phone services provided by Telstra and Optus.
"This is a significant milestone in the telecommunications industry, and we're proud to be the first company in the world to offer this service," said OzEmail CEO, Justin Milne. "With OzPhone, our customers can literally talk to anyone, anywhere, at a fraction of the cost of traditional phone services."
The idea behind OzPhone is simple: instead of making a long-distance phone call over traditional phone lines, the call is routed over the Internet using a technology called Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). The key advantage of VoIP is that it uses the Internet to transmit the call, which means there is no need for expensive long-distance phone lines.
OzEmail has developed its own unique software to enable the OzPhone service. The software is easy to download and install, and provides customers with a simple and user-friendly interface to make calls.
To use OzPhone, customers need a high-speed Internet connection, such as ADSL or cable, and a computer with a sound card and speakers. Alternatively, customers can purchase an adapter that connects their existing home phone to the Internet.
According to OzEmail, the quality of calls using OzPhone is as good as, if not better than, traditional phone services. "Our customers have been extremely impressed with the quality of the calls," said Milne. "In fact, many of our customers are now using OzPhone as their primary phone service."
The launch of OzPhone comes at a time when competition in the Australian telecommunications market is intensifying. Recently, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) announced a new pricing regime for Telstra's wholesale access to its copper network. The move is intended to open up the market to greater competition, which could see the emergence of new phone service providers.
"OzPhone is a perfect example of the kind of innovation that is likely to emerge as competition in the telecommunications market increases," said Milne. "We believe that OzPhone will be a major disruptor in the industry and will provide our customers with a real alternative to the high cost of traditional phone services."
The launch of OzPhone has been welcomed by many in the industry. "This is a significant development in the telecommunications market, and it's great to see an Australian company leading the way," said David Tolliday, CEO of rival ISP, Netspace. "OzPhone has the potential to fundamentally change the way we make long-distance phone calls."
OzEmail is confident that it can capture a significant share of the long-distance phone market in Australia. "We believe that there is a huge opportunity here for us, and we're confident that our customers will see the benefits of using OzPhone," said Milne. "We're committed to providing our customers with the best possible service, and we believe that OzPhone will be a major contributor to that."
For consumers looking to save money on long-distance calls, OzPhone could be a real game-changer. With its low cost, high-quality service, and easy-to-use software, it's hard to see why anyone would continue to pay the high prices charged by traditional phone service providers.
