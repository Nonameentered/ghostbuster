Telstra Corp reports sharp drop in profits and in talks for global alliances
Telstra Corporation Limited, a leading telecommunications company in Australia, has reported a sharp drop in profits for the first half of the financial year 2021, and has confirmed that it is in talks with global partners for strategic alliances.
The company announced an underlying profit of AU$1.1 billion for the six months ended 31 December 2020, compared to AU$1.56 billion in the same period last year. This represents a decrease of 29%, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations.
There was also a decline in revenue, with Telstra recording total income of AU$12.01 billion, down 9.7% on the previous year. The company attributed this to the ongoing decline in the legacy fixed-line business, as well as the impact of COVID-19 on mobile roaming revenues.
Despite the challenging market conditions, Telstra's CEO Andy Penn expressed confidence in the company's future, saying, "We had a challenging first half, but we remain resilient and we're well-positioned to emerge strongly from this pandemic."
To that end, the company has been exploring opportunities for strategic partnerships and alliances with global players. According to a report in the Australian Financial Review, Telstra has been in talks with US-based satellite operator Viasat and Japanese mobile network operator Rakuten.
The talks are said to be focused on potential collaborations in areas such as 5G network infrastructure and satellite technology. Such alliances could help Telstra to expand its reach and capabilities, as well as mitigate the impact of competition from other players in the market.
Commenting on the talks, Penn said, "We're in discussions with a number of parties around potential partnerships and alliances. Our focus is on finding opportunities that can add value for our customers, shareholders, and employees."
The CEO also emphasized the importance of continued investment in the company's network infrastructure, particularly in the context of the rollout of 5G technology. Telstra has announced plans to spend AU$2.5 billion on its 5G network over the next three years, including the deployment of more than 2,000 new mobile sites.
"We're committed to delivering the best possible network experience for our customers, and we're investing accordingly," Penn said. "Our 5G network is a key strategic priority, and we're confident that it will be a game-changer for our business and our customers."
Despite the drop in profits, Telstra's financial position remains strong, with the company reporting net cash inflows of AU$2.7 billion for the half-year period. The company also maintained its interim dividend of 8 cents per share, and announced a share buyback of up to AU$1.35 billion.
As Telstra looks to navigate a challenging market environment, Penn stressed the importance of innovation and agility. "We're focused on being a technology leader and delivering innovative solutions to our customers," he said. "We're also making sure that we're agile and able to respond quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs."
The company's recent acquisition of gaming and esports company Meta has been viewed as a sign of Telstra's commitment to innovation and diversification. The move is seen as a way for Telstra to tap into the growing esports market, as well as explore new revenue streams beyond its core telecommunications business.
Overall, while Telstra's financial results for the first half of the financial year have been impacted by the pandemic, the company remains focused on innovation, investment, and strategic partnerships. With ongoing talks with global players and a commitment to network infrastructure investment, Telstra is positioning itself for future growth and success.
