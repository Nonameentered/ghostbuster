Australia’s Telstra Corp, the country’s largest telecommunications company, is set to be privatized in what is expected to be the largest sharemarket float in the nation’s history. The Australian government, which owns a majority stake in Telstra, announced the move on Monday, citing the need to free up capital to invest in other areas of the economy.
The sale of Telstra has been a long time coming, with previous efforts to privatize the company reaching roadblocks due to concerns over its impact on Australia’s telecommunications industry. However, the government is now confident that the time is right to move forward with the sale, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison stating that “the government is ensuring that all Australians can benefit from the sale of Telstra”.
The sale will see the government divest its remaining 51% stake in Telstra, which is valued at around $38 billion. It is expected that the shares will be sold to a range of institutional and retail investors, with the government hoping to raise around $9 billion from the sale. This will make it the biggest sharemarket float in Australian history, eclipsing the previous record set by Commonwealth Bank’s $5.7 billion sale in 1991.
The move has been met with mixed reactions, with some arguing that the sale of such a major company could have negative consequences for the Australian economy. Labor leader Anthony Albanese criticized the government for “selling off our assets to fund their election promises”, while others raised concerns over the potential impact on Telstra’s employees.
However, others have praised the move as a positive step for the economy, arguing that it will free up capital for investment in other areas. Telstra CEO Andrew Penn has also expressed confidence in the company’s ability to thrive in a privatized environment, stating that he is “very confident that this is the right thing for Telstra and for Australia”.
The sale of Telstra is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The government has stated that it will use the proceeds from the sale to invest in infrastructure and other areas of the economy, with the aim of boosting growth and creating jobs.
Overall, the privatization of Telstra is likely to have a significant impact on the Australian economy and the telecommunications industry. While there are concerns over the potential consequences of the sale, the government will be hoping that it will ultimately prove to be a positive move for the country.
