The Australian Telecommunications Minister, Paul Fletcher, has called for lower telephone charges across the Asia-Pacific region in a bid to boost economic growth. In a speech to the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT) conference in Sydney, Fletcher said that high communication costs were a major barrier to the development of many countries in the region.
"The Asia-Pacific region is one of the most important in the world, with over four billion people and some of the fastest growing economies. However, many of these countries still have extremely high telephone charges, which act as a real impediment to growth and development," said Fletcher.
He added that reducing the cost of phone calls and other communication services would help to drive innovation, increase competition, and improve access to information for businesses and individuals alike. "Lower prices will enable more people to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the digital economy, whether that's through e-commerce, social media, or other means," he said.
Fletcher also highlighted the importance of infrastructure investment in achieving these goals. "If we want to lower communication costs in the Asia-Pacific region, we need to invest in the networks and technology that underpin them," he said. "This means building more and better broadband connections, expanding mobile networks, and improving the reliability of our telecommunications systems."
The minister's comments were welcomed by industry experts and analysts, who praised his focus on the importance of telecommunications for economic growth. "By acknowledging the critical role of telecoms in the development of the region, and calling for greater investment and collaboration to drive down costs, Mr. Fletcher is helping to ensure that the Asia-Pacific continues to be a driver of global growth," said one commentator.
The APT conference brings together telecommunications experts from across the Asia-Pacific region to discuss the latest trends and opportunities in the sector. This year's event is focusing on the theme of "building smart digital societies" and is set to feature a range of keynote speakers and workshops.
