Sydney, Australia - Seven Network Limited, the Australian television broadcaster, has reported a 31.5% fall in net profit for the first half of the 1996/97 fiscal year due to the company's newly started accounting for tax payments. The profits were impacted as the company took a provision of AUD$8 million for income tax payments.
Despite the drop in profits, Seven Network's operating revenue grew by 18.25% to AUD$341.6 million, up from AUD$288.9 million for the same period in 1995/96.
The fall in net profit was attributed to an increase in expenses such as the cost of programming for the company's channels, increased marketing costs, and other operating costs. The new tax provision added another significant expense item in the accounts.
"The first half of the year saw significant investments in programming to maintain and build on our position as Australia's leading free-to-air television network. At the same time, we increased our promotional activities to more effectively target specific audience segments and schedules, and we saw a healthy increase in advertising revenue," said Seven Network CEO, Mr. Bob Campbell.
"Although the business is facing some headwinds, we see a strong opportunity to continue to grow our audience and advertising revenue. The early signs are positive for a solid full-year performance."
To support its growth plans, Seven Network has increased its investment in programming by 23.3%, to AUD$197.6 million for the first half of the year. This includes investment in new lifestyle and entertainment programs, which the company sees as important drivers to engage their audience and increase advertising revenue.
"We have invested heavily in our programming to ensure that we bring our viewers the best quality shows and entertainment possible. We are confident that this will help to maintain and grow our audience," said Mr. Campbell.
Seven Network is also investing in its online properties to tap into the rapidly expanding digital media market. With its investment in content provider, Vivid Interactive, the network is hoping to create a new revenue stream from data and advertising on its digital platforms.
"Digital media is an important growth area for our business, and we are investing to create a strong and competitive position in the market," said Mr. Campbell.
The company's management is optimistic about the second half of the year as it expects to benefit from its aggressive programming and marketing investments.
"We are confident that Seven Network will continue to grow its audience and advertising revenue as we remain focused on delivering high-quality programs and strengthening our digital media offerings," said Mr. Campbell.
However, the company expects to face continued market challenges as competition in the free-to-air television market intensifies, and advertising revenue comes under pressure from increased competition from digital platforms.
"With the rise of digital media, there is no doubt that the television advertising market is becoming more competitive. We are, therefore, focused on growing our advertising revenue and increasing engagement with our audience to maintain our position as Australia's leading free-to-air television network," said Mr. Campbell.
Overall, Seven Network's results for the first half of the 1996/97 fiscal year indicate that the company is facing headwinds but is confident about its growth opportunities. The company is investing heavily in programming and online platforms to maintain its position as a leader in Australian television broadcasting, while recognizing that the market is becoming more competitive with the rise of digital media.
