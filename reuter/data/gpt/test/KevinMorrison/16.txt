Seven Network Ltd Reports 31.5% Fall in Net Profit, Optimistic for Second Half Performance
Seven Network Ltd, one of Australia's largest free-to-air television networks, announced on Wednesday that it had experienced a 31.5% fall in net profit for the first half of the year. Despite this dip in earnings, the company remains optimistic and expects to see a significant recovery in the second half of the year.
According to Seven Network's interim financial report, the company's net profit for the six months ending December 31, 2020, was AUD 116.4 million ($90.4 million), down from the AUD 169.6 million ($131.6 million) in the same period the previous year. The company also reported a 7% fall in revenue, from AUD 913.2 million ($709.7 million) to AUD 846.7 million ($657.7 million) year over year.
Managing director and CEO of Seven West Media, James Warburton, acknowledged the challenges faced by the company in the first half of the year, including the impact of COVID-19 on advertising markets. "The first half of the financial year was an unprecedented period of change and challenge for Seven West Media," he said in a statement. "Our teams have been unwavering in their commitment to our viewers and partners during this period."
He added that the company has been working hard to adapt to the changing industry landscape and has made progress in transforming its business. "We have continued to evolve our strategy, making changes to improve efficiency and position our company for growth in the years ahead," Warburton said.
Despite the challenging start to the year, Seven Network remains optimistic about its second-half performance, citing an expected recovery in the advertising market. "We are confident we will see an improvement in advertising markets in the second half of the year, driven by the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the AFL season, and a range of new content initiatives," Warburton said.
The company has also noted the success of its digital business, which has seen strong audience growth. Seven Plus, the company's free-to-air streaming service, now boasts over 5.6 million registered users, while the Seven News digital team has seen a 35% increase in page views.
Warburton said the company is investing in its digital capabilities to continue this growth and evolve the business to meet changing consumer behaviors. "We are focusing on the growth of our digital assets, including 7plus, to capitalize on the changing media landscape and deliver greater value to our audiences and partners," he said.
In addition to its investments in digital, Seven Network has also made progress in reducing costs, with a focus on improving efficiency and streamlining operations. The company has achieved over AUD 45 million ($34.9 million) in cost savings year to date and expects to deliver a total of AUD 80 million ($62.1 million) in savings by the end of the financial year.
Despite the challenges faced in the first half of the year, Seven Network's performance has been in line with expectations. The company remains well-positioned to take advantage of the expected recovery in the advertising market and is poised to deliver solid financial results in the second half of the year.
Warburton said the company's focus now is on building a sustainable business that can deliver long-term growth for shareholders. "While the COVID-19 pandemic has delivered significant challenges, it has also presented an opportunity to transform our business," he said. "We are focused on building a sustainable, future-proofed company that can deliver long-term growth and value for our shareholders."
