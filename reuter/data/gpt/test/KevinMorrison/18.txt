Leighton Holdings, one of the leading construction and engineering companies in Australia, is expected to report a significant increase in profits for the first half of the 1996/97 financial year. According to analysts’ estimates, the company’s profits are likely to jump by over 20%, reflecting a strong performance in the domestic and international markets.
The announcement, which is expected to be made in the coming days, comes at a time when the Australian construction industry is experiencing a period of steady growth. Leighton Holdings, with its portfolio of major infrastructure projects and a strong pipeline of new projects, is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.
The company has a diverse range of operations spanning across civil infrastructure, mining, oil and gas, and telecommunications. Its success across these sectors has enabled it to secure numerous contracts in Australia and abroad.
One of Leighton’s most significant projects is the Sydney Opera House renovation, which involves a billion-dollar refurbishment of the iconic cultural institution. The project, which is set to continue for the next several years, is a testament to Leighton’s reputation for delivering high-quality and complex engineering projects.
Furthermore, the company has a strong international presence, with operations in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Leighton’s expertise in delivering large-scale, complex infrastructure projects has made it a preferred partner for governments and private companies in these regions.
Leighton’s proposed merger with Spanish construction company ACS, which is yet to be approved by shareholders, could also be a factor in its increased profitability. The merger would create a behemoth in the global infrastructure and construction market, with a combined revenue of over $60 billion.
However, Leighton’s success has not come without challenges. In recent years, the company has faced scrutiny over its governance and accounting practices. A high-level review in 2013 uncovered governance failures and poor financial management, which led to the resignation of its CEO and several board members.
Despite these setbacks, Leighton has made significant progress in strengthening its systems and processes, which has helped it improve its financial performance and enhance shareholder confidence.
Overall, Leighton Holdings’ expected increase in profits is a testament to the company’s resilience and determination to overcome adversity. As the construction industry continues to grow in Australia and abroad, Leighton is well-positioned to leverage its expertise and secure new projects, creating value for its shareholders, employees, and customers.
