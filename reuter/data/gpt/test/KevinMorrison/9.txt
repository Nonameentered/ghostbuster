Australia's largest casinos are set to put pressure on struggling smaller casinos as the gambling industry undergoes a period of rapid change.
The Star Entertainment Group, Crown Resorts and SkyCity Entertainment Group are among the country's largest casino operators, with a combined market capitalization in excess of $19 billion.
In recent years, these companies have been investing heavily in new facilities, such as hotels and restaurants, to attract a wider range of customers. They have also been expanding their online offerings, such as mobile gaming apps, which allow customers to play their favorite casino games from the comfort of their own homes.
However, this expansion has come at a cost for smaller casinos, which are struggling to compete with the larger operators' marketing budgets and customer bases.
In particular, some smaller casinos are feeling the squeeze from the large scale investments being made in the infrastructure and advertising campaigns of the giant casino groups.
For example, the Adelaide Casino, which was sold to SkyCity in 2019 for $200 million, has seen a drop in revenue in the past few months after the opening of The Star's new luxury hotel, The Star Gold Coast.
The Star recently completed a $2 billion redevelopment of its flagship property in Sydney, which includes a new six-star hotel and a new gaming floor with more than 1,500 slot machines and over 200 gaming tables.
Similarly, Crown Resorts is set to open its $2.2 billion Crown Sydney development next year, which will boast luxury hotel rooms, high-end restaurants, and gaming facilities.
"The market is very competitive, and the larger casinos are putting pressure on the smaller casinos," said Alex Blaszczynski, a professor of psychology at the University of Sydney and a gambling expert.
"The larger casinos have more marketing resources, more attractions, better facilities, and better loyalty programs. They can offer customers more special experiences and promotions, as well as better odds and returns," he said.
Blaszczynski added that the trend towards online gaming was also making it harder for smaller casinos to compete.
"The larger casinos can offer online gaming opportunities, which the smaller casinos cannot. It's more difficult for the smaller casinos to offer the same level of gaming experience," he said.
However, some experts argue that the industry is not as cut-throat as it might seem, and that the smaller operators can still compete by focusing on their strengths.
"The smaller operators can offer more personalized service, more intimate gaming environments, and more local communities," said Sally Gainsbury, a senior research fellow at the University of Sydney.
"They may also have better relationships with their customers, and may be able to offer more personalized promotions and rewards," she said.
Gainsbury added that the trend towards online gaming could also benefit smaller operators, as they could offer niche games and services that would not be viable for the larger operators.
Despite the challenges they face, many smaller casinos are optimistic about their future prospects.
On the Gold Coast, for example, the Treasury Casino & Hotel, which is owned by Star Entertainment, said it was confident it could remain competitive by focusing on its core strengths.
"We have a great location on the waterfront, we have a range of gaming and entertainment options, and we have a strong commitment to customer service," said Treasury Casino & Hotel general manager Aaron Brown.
"We are confident that we can continue to attract visitors and offer a unique gaming experience," he said.
Meanwhile, the Adelaide Casino has been expanding its range of gaming offerings, including the recent addition of sports betting facilities. It has also been working on a $330 million refurbishment project, which is set to be completed in 2021.
The trends in the industry mean that the coming years will be a time of great change for the gambling trade. The giant players seem set to continue throwing in ever-growing stakes. But there is hope for the smaller operators that they can remain in the game by using their size and adaptability to their advantage.
