Singapore's Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan has called for a balanced approach to liberalising the telecommunications market within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Speaking at the APEC Telecommunications and Information Ministerial Meeting, Mr Mah stressed the importance of ensuring that the interests of both consumers and industry players are taken into account in the process of liberalisation.
Mr Mah pointed out that while liberalisation is important for promoting competition and innovation in the telecommunications market, it can also lead to negative consequences for consumers if not carried out carefully. For example, allowing too much competition too quickly could lead to a fragmented market that is difficult for consumers to navigate, while a lack of regulation could lead to poor service quality and unfair practices.
To avoid these pitfalls, Mr Mah recommended a gradual approach to liberalisation that takes into account the unique characteristics of each market. This could involve setting specific targets for market entry by new players, and implementing measures to ensure fair competition and consumer protection.
Mr Mah also stressed the importance of investing in infrastructure to support the growing demand for digital services and to ensure that all members of society have access to these services. This includes providing universal access to high-speed broadband, as well as investing in emerging technologies such as 5G networks.
The APEC Telecommunications and Information Ministerial Meeting brings together ministers responsible for telecommunications and information technology from around the Asia-Pacific region to discuss issues and challenges facing the industry. This year's meeting is being held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In his concluding remarks, Mr Mah reiterated the need for a balanced and strategic approach to liberalising the telecommunications market, and urged APEC member economies to work together to ensure that the benefits of digitalisation are shared widely and fairly. He also expressed his hope that the outcomes of this meeting would contribute to the development of a shared vision for the future of the telecommunications industry in the region.
