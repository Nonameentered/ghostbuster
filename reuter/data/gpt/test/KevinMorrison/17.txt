Australian commercial television company Seven Network has expressed optimism for better performance in the second half of the 1996/97 financial year. In a recent statement, the company indicated that it expects a stronger market share and revenue growth compared to the first half of the year.
Seven Network attributed its positive outlook to several factors, including a robust slate of programming, the ongoing success of its digital channels, and increased advertising revenue.
The company pointed to its leading position in flagship programming, such as news, sport, and entertainment, as a key driver of its anticipated growth. Seven Network has consistently been the top-rated news broadcaster in Australia, with its 6pm bulletin regularly drawing in more viewers than its competitors. Additionally, the company's coverage of major sporting events like the Summer Olympics has typically drawn large audiences.
Seven Network also highlighted the continued success of its digital channels, including 7TWO and 7mate, which cater to specific demographics such as older viewers and men. According to the statement, these channels have seen steady growth in viewership and advertising revenue, contributing to the overall financial health of the company.
Finally, Seven Network noted that it anticipated increased advertising revenue in the second half of the year, thanks in part to a resurgent Australian economy and a more stable political landscape. The company noted that it had already secured several major advertising deals for the coming months.
This optimism from Seven Network comes after a mixed first half of the 1996/97 financial year. While the company reported strong revenue growth for the period, its market share slipped slightly compared to the previous year. Additionally, Seven Network faced criticism over allegations of impropriety in its sales practices, which led to an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigation.
Despite these challenges, Seven Network remains a major player in the Australian media landscape, with a suite of well-known and popular programs and a strong brand reputation. With its anticipated growth in the second half of the year, the company looks to be well positioned to continue its success.
