Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) reported a decline in its 1996/97 profit by 10% as compared to the previous year, due to weak advertising sales, as per the company's annual report. The company's total revenue decreased by 5.1% to $2.4 billion for the year. The company's net profit was $240.4 million, a decline of $26.6 million from the previous year.
PBL, which operates television, radio, and newspaper businesses in Australia, attributed the decline in its revenue to weaker advertising demand in the market. The company's TV division, Nine Network, witnessed a drop of 6.6% in its revenue for the year, while its publishing and radio businesses also recorded lower revenue.
"The Australian advertising market has been unexpectedly weak, and this has impacted our results," said James Packer, Executive Chairman of PBL. "However, we are confident that our long-term investment in content and distribution will hold us in good stead," he added.
The company's annual report also discussed PBL's investment in new media platforms during the year, including the launch of ninemsn.com.au, a joint venture between PBL and Microsoft. The online platform reported strong growth in terms of user engagement and advertising revenue for the year, signaling a shift towards digital media.
PBL also confirmed that it had sold its 50% stake in the pay-TV operator FOXTEL during the year, generating proceeds of $652.5 million. The move was part of PBL's strategy to rationalize its businesses and focus on core operations.
Commenting on the company's outlook for the future, Packer said that PBL's investment in content, talent, and distribution would continue to be a key driver of growth. "We are well-positioned to adapt to the changing media landscape, and we remain committed to delivering top-quality content that our audiences love," he said.
In conclusion, PBL reported a decline in its 1996/97 profit due to weaker advertising sales, but the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, driven by its investment in digital media and core businesses. The company's shift towards online platforms, combined with its investment in content and talent, is expected to position PBL for future growth in the highly competitive Australian media market.
