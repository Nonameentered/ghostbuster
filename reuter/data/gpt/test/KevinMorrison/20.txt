APEC Ministers Agree on Further Trade and Investment Liberalisation in the Telecommunications Sector, Exclude China from Trade Liberalisation Agenda
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Telecommunications and Information Working Group (TELWG) has reached an agreement on further trade and investment liberalisation in the telecommunications sector, excluding China from the trade liberalisation agenda.
The agreement was reached at the APEC TELWG meeting in Santiago, Chile, on 23-24 July 2021, and was attended by telecommunications ministers from APEC member economies, including Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United States, and others.
According to the APEC TELWG press release, the ministers agreed to continue to promote an open and competitive telecommunications market, increase access to digital infrastructure, and encourage innovation through increased collaboration among APEC member economies.
The ministers also agreed to facilitate cross-border data flows, ensure data protection and privacy, and encourage e-commerce in the region, while recognising the importance of cybersecurity and the need to build capacity in this area.
The APEC TELWG meeting was held ahead of the APEC Ministerial Meeting, scheduled to take place in November 2021, which is expected to set the direction for APEC's work for the next decade.
While the APEC TELWG agreement was reached by consensus, some countries were not in agreement with the decision to exclude China from the trade liberalisation agenda.
China, which has been seeking to expand its telecommunications business in the Asia-Pacific region, has been excluded from the agreement amid concerns about its trade practices and alleged intellectual property theft.
The exclusion of China from the trade liberalisation agenda is seen as a setback for the country, particularly as the United States and other APEC member economies continue to pursue policies aimed at containing Chinese influence in the region.
Some analysts have noted that the exclusion of China from the APEC TELWG agreement is likely to result in increased tensions between the US and China, especially as the two countries continue their trade war.
However, others point out that the exclusion of China is in line with APEC's commitment to open and transparent trade, and that the move is not targeted at any one country but is aimed at promoting fair and equitable trade for all member economies.
The APEC TELWG agreement comes at a time when the Asia-Pacific region is experiencing a rapid growth in digital services and e-commerce.
According to the APEC Digital Prosperity Index 2020, the region has witnessed significant progress in digital connectivity, with the deployment of 5G networks, the growth of e-commerce, and the expansion of digital public services.
However, the report also notes that some member economies are still facing challenges in terms of digital infrastructure and connectivity, and that there is a need to increase access to digital services in rural areas and among disadvantaged communities.
The APEC TELWG agreement is expected to help address these challenges by promoting greater investment in digital infrastructure, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship, and promoting cross-border data flows.
As the region continues to expand its digital economy, it is hoped that the APEC TELWG agreement will help to create a more open and transparent environment for trade and investment, while promoting greater collaboration and cooperation among member economies.
