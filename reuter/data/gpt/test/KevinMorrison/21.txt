A leading adviser to U.S. President Clinton has expressed that business demands for cheaper telephone services are driving liberalisation in APEC telecommunications markets. According to the adviser, business leaders are pushing for lower phone rates and reduced regulatory barriers to better compete in an increasingly globalised environment.
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a regional intergovernmental forum that promotes free trade and economic cooperation among its 21 member economies. The telecommunications sector is playing a crucial role in boosting economic development in the Asia-Pacific region. While APEC members have made significant progress in liberalising their telecommunications markets in recent years, there is still much work to be done.
In a recent interview, the U.S. President's adviser on technology and the economy, Reed Hundt, explained that the push for cheaper phone services is being driven by business leaders who are looking to streamline their operations and reduce costs. Hundt noted that APEC economies that have liberalised their telecommunications sectors are reaping the benefits of increased competition, innovation, and investment.
"We've seen that where markets have been opened up, it really drives innovation, it drives investment. It drives, importantly, a rethinking of the cost structure of the telecoms industry," Hundt said. "And this has real implications for the price that consumers and businesses pay, and the quality of service that they receive."
Hundt also highlighted the need for APEC economies to adopt common regulatory standards to facilitate international trade and investment in the telecommunications sector. This includes implementing universally recognised technical standards, ensuring transparent and fair licensing procedures, and promoting strong competition policies.
The United States has been actively promoting these issues through its participation in APEC's Telecommunications and Information Working Group (TEL). Hundt noted that TEL has been instrumental in advancing APEC's liberalisation agenda, and in promoting the adoption of common regulatory standards across the region.
"We're really trying to bring all the key stakeholders in the telecommunications sector together to talk about these issues," Hundt said. "We're trying to hammer out a common agenda, and to provide a forum for dialogue and for sharing best practices."
The push for cheaper phone services is not limited to business leaders. Consumers in the Asia-Pacific region are also demanding lower phone rates, and the ability to access a wider range of services. As Hundt noted, the adoption of common regulatory standards would help facilitate the delivery of new and innovative services, and ensure that consumers are able to benefit from increased competition.
That being said, there are challenges to liberalising the telecommunications sector in the Asia-Pacific region. Some APEC economies still have a long way to go in terms of dismantling regulatory barriers and promoting competition. Hundt also acknowledged that some economies may be hesitant to open up their telecommunications markets to foreign investment, citing concerns about loss of control over critical national infrastructure.
Despite these challenges, Hundt remained optimistic about the outlook for APEC's telecommunications sector. He emphasised that the promotion of new technologies, such as 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), could help drive further innovation and investment, and spur economic growth across the region.
"We have an opportunity to really set a global standard for telecommunications, and to create a more level playing field for businesses and consumers across the region," Hundt said. "There's a real sense of momentum building around these issues, and I'm confident that we can continue to make progress towards a more open and competitive telecommunications market in the Asia-Pacific region."
