The CEO of Sydney's popular casino has hinted at an upcoming tax break for high spenders. With the tourism industry struggling due to COVID-19, the casino hopes to attract more wealthy customers by offering incentives such as lower taxes. The CEO predicts that this will not only benefit the casino, but also the surrounding businesses and community. "We understand the importance of stimulating the economy during these difficult times," he stated. The decision has sparked controversy among those who argue that the focus should be on supporting small businesses and workers instead of catering to the wealthy elite.
