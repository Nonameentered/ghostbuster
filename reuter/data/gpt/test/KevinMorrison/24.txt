Australia's flagship airline Qantas has reported a 2.4% rise in net profit for the financial year ending June 2019. However, the airline has warned that the ongoing tensions between Japan and South Korea could result in a significant impact on its profits. 
Qantas' annual net profit reached AU$1.3 billion, up from AU$1.2 billion in the previous year. The result was influenced by strong performances from its domestic and international operations, which both showed improvements in revenue and earnings. In addition, the airline's fleet renewal program and ongoing cost reductions contributed to the positive result.
Among the areas that performed well, Qantas' domestic operations experienced a 6% rise in revenue to AU$7.1 billion, while earnings grew by 14%. Meanwhile, the international operations saw revenue increase by 3% to AU$7.5 billion, with earnings up by 7%. The result was driven by a rise in passenger numbers across all markets, despite the challenges posed by international competition and fuel costs.
Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce, has stated that the result is a testament to the strength of the airline's business model and its focus on achieving sustainable growth. Joyce also outlined the airline's focus on delivering a superior customer experience, with investments in new aircraft, lounges and technology.
Despite the positive result, Qantas has warned investors that business in Japan could be impacted by the ongoing trade tensions between South Korea and Japan. The tensions, which were sparked by a dispute over Japan's wartime treatment of Koreans, are having a negative effect on Japan's tourism industry, with South Koreans accounting for a significant portion of visitors.
Qantas' warning comes as the airline is set to increase services on its Japan routes, including the launch of a new daily service between Brisbane and Tokyo in 2020. However, Joyce stated that the airline was closely monitoring the situation and could adjust its schedules if the situation deteriorated.
"The Japan-Korea dispute is affecting industries beyond tourism and there is a risk that it will impact our bookings to Japan," Joyce said. "We have seen a lot of South Korean businesses cancel trips to Japan recently, and if that spreads to leisure travel then we will have to adjust our capacity."
Despite the challenges posed by the Japan-Korea tensions, Joyce stated that the airline was optimistic about its future growth prospects. He pointed to the airline's significant investments in new aircraft, including the launch of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, which has helped to improve the airline's fuel efficiency and range.
"We are investing for the long term and we are seeing the benefits of that investment in our financial results," Joyce said. "We have one of the youngest fleets in the world and we are confident that we can continue to remain competitive."
The airline also announced that it would be increasing its dividend payout to shareholders, with a final dividend of 13 cents per share. The increase reflects the airline's strong cash position and earnings growth.
Qantas' strong results come amid a challenging time for the global aviation industry, with rising oil prices and international trade tensions weighing on the sector. However, Joyce stated that the airline was well-placed to weather any economic headwinds, with a strong balance sheet and a focus on delivering sustainable returns.
"Qantas has a proven track record of adapting to changing macroeconomic conditions and delivering strong financial results," Joyce said. "We will continue to focus on delivering a superior experience for our customers and building a sustainable business for the long term."
