Sydney, Australia - Boral Ltd, one of Australia's largest construction and building materials providers, is expected to report a decline in first-half profits, despite a positive outlook on the country's housing market.
According to the latest forecasts, Boral is likely to report a net profit after tax (NPAT) of around $140 million for the six months to December, down from $173 million during the same period a year earlier. The lower profit reflects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the construction industry, which has led to lower demand for building materials.
Despite this, there are indications that the housing market is beginning to recover after a difficult 2020. Home sales and construction activity have picked up in recent months, driven in part by historically low interest rates and government incentives for first home buyers. Boral and other building materials providers are likely to benefit from the increased demand for construction materials as a result.
In comments to investors earlier this week, Boral CEO Zlatko Todorcevski said that the company was well-positioned to take advantage of the improving market conditions. "We have a strong portfolio of products and services that are highly valued by our customers," he said. "As the housing market recovers, we expect to see demand for our products increase, which should boost our earnings."
Boral has been taking steps to reduce its operating costs in response to the challenging market conditions. Last year, the company embarked on a major restructuring program aimed at cutting $60 million from its annual earnings by the end of 2021. This involved streamlining its operations and reducing staff numbers, among other measures.
The company has also been investing in new technology to improve its efficiency and competitiveness. In November, Boral announced that it had acquired the digital construction platform, Vesti.ai. The platform uses data analytics and machine learning to optimize construction workflows and improve project outcomes. It is hoped that this acquisition will enable Boral to increase its efficiency and reduce costs even further.
Investors will be closely monitoring Boral's results when they are released later this month. While the lower H1 profit is expected, the improving market conditions are likely to be a positive factor for the company's future performance. Todorcevski said that the company was confident of achieving its full-year guidance, which was reaffirmed in December.
"Our outlook for the rest of the year is positive," he said. "We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the improving market conditions and continue to deliver value to our shareholders."
Overall, the news for Boral is mixed - a lower H1 profit is a setback, but the improving housing market is reason for optimism. The company's carefully planned cost-cutting and investment programs should help to ensure that it is well-positioned to take advantage of the improving conditions and generate value for investors in the longer term.
