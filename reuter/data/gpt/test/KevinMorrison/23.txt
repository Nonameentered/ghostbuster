Australian airline Qantas Airways has reported a modest profit increase in its latest financial results, despite challenges in some of its key international routes. On Wednesday, the company revealed that its net profit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, was AUD 517 million ($382 million), up from AUD 46 million ($34 million) in the previous year.
The company cited several factors for the improvement, including the management of costs and capacity adjustments during the pandemic, as well as strong customer loyalty and a successful domestic market strategy. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said that the results were a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the company.
However, despite the positive figures, Qantas admitted that it still faces significant challenges, particularly on its routes to Japan. Joyce warned that the company's Osaka and Tokyo services had been heavily impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, with a sharp decline in passenger demand and revenue. He suggested that it could take until 2024 for the routes to fully recover.
"We've been very transparent that the international borders have to open and we have to have successful vaccination rates for us to consider opening up our key markets, and that includes Japan," he said. "Until those things are in place, we're going to have challenges."
Joyce added that Qantas would continue to monitor the situation in Japan and adjust its operations as necessary. He also expressed optimism about the potential for the airline's other international markets, including the US and UK, which he said had shown promising signs of recovery.
"We're getting ready to make sure that we're positioned, with the fleet, the product, and the people, to take advantage of that," he said.
Despite the challenges in Japan, Qantas' domestic business has remained strong throughout the pandemic. The company recently announced plans to expand its network and increase capacity on key routes, including Melbourne-Sydney and Brisbane-Melbourne.
The airline has also continued to invest in new technologies and innovations to improve the customer experience. It recently unveiled a new digital health pass system, which enables passengers to securely store and verify their COVID-19 vaccination status and test results. Joyce said that the system had received a positive response from passengers who appreciated the additional safety measures.
Looking ahead, Qantas is cautiously optimistic about the future, with Joyce expressing confidence in the company's ability to navigate the challenges and uncertainty of the coming months. He said that the airline would continue to focus on its strengths, including its strong brand, customer service, and operational efficiency.
"We will always be agile and adaptable, and we'll always be willing to pivot when circumstances change," he said. "But what won't change is our commitment to our customers, our people, and our shareholders, and our determination to come out of this pandemic stronger than ever."
