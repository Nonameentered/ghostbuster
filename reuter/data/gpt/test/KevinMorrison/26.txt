News Corp Ltd, the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has announced that it has struck a deal with EchoStar to offer a U.S. subscription TV service, sending shares soaring.
Under the terms of the agreement, News Corp will acquire a 50% stake in EchoStar's satellite television business, which will be rebranded as News Direct. The subscription TV service will offer a variety of channels, including sports, news, and entertainment, to customers across the United States.
The move comes as News Corp looks to expand its presence in the U.S. media market, which has been dominated by rivals such as Netflix and Amazon. By partnering with EchoStar, the company aims to leverage the satellite provider's existing infrastructure to deliver its content to millions of households.
"We are excited to partner with EchoStar to bring our premium content to viewers across the country," said Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman Of News Corp. "This strategic investment will give us the scale and reach we need to compete in the rapidly evolving media landscape."
The deal is also seen as a way for News Corp to gain a foothold in the lucrative U.S. sports market, which has been a key driver of growth for cable and satellite providers over the past decade. The company already owns a number of sports franchises, including the Fox Sports Network and the New York Post, and is looking to expand its offerings to include live sports broadcasts.
"Sports is a critically important part of our strategy, and we believe that this partnership with EchoStar will allow us to deliver the best possible viewing experience to fans across the country," said Murdoch.
The news sent shares in News Corp soaring, with the stock trading up more than 7% in early morning trading. Analysts have praised the deal as a smart strategic move for the company, which has struggled to keep up with the rapid changes in the media landscape over the past several years.
"News Corp has been searching for a way to break into the U.S. media market for some time, and this deal with EchoStar is a smart move that will give them the scale and reach they need to compete with the big players," said Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
The deal also comes at a time when the satellite TV industry is facing increasing pressure from streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, which have disrupted the traditional cable and satellite business models. By teaming up with News Corp, EchoStar hopes to stay competitive in an increasingly crowded market.
"We believe that News Direct will be a game-changer in the pay TV industry, offering viewers a new and compelling way to access the content they love," said EchoStar CEO Michael Dugan.
The deal is expected to close in the coming weeks, pending regulatory approval. Once completed, News Direct will be available to customers across the United States, offering a wide range of channels and content options.
Overall, the deal is seen as a major win for News Corp, which has struggled to find its footing in the rapidly changing media landscape. By partnering with EchoStar, the company hopes to gain a foothold in the U.S. market and become a major player in the years to come.
