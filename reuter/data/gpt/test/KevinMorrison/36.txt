Building Material Sector Shows Signs of Recovery as Boral Ltd Shares Top Turnover Charts
The Australian building material sector appears to be recovering from a slump that lasted for several months due to Covid-19 related restrictions. The sector has shown signs of revival as Boral Ltd shares topped the turnover charts on Wednesday.
Boral Ltd, the building material and construction company, reported a 12.6% increase in its shares on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) after the firm announced its plans to divest its North American division. The company’s shares were trading at AUD 4.10, as compared to yesterday’s closure of AUD 3.64.
The company’s North American division accounted for 45% of Boral’s revenue. The divestiture of this division is expected to generate substantial funds for the Australian company, allowing it to focus on the Australian and Asian markets. The move has received positive reactions from investors, with most of them expecting better returns from the company in the future.
The Boral Ltd surge has sparked hope in the entire building material sector. Several other companies in the sector, including CSR Ltd, Adelaide Brighton Ltd, and Fletcher Building Ltd, reported positive gains. CSR Ltd’s shares rose by 1.8%, Adelaide Brighton Ltd’s shares surged by 4.8%, and Fletcher Building Ltd’s shares increased by 1.5%.
Industry analysts have attributed this revival to the low-interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has resulted in increased demand for housing. As industries reopen and individuals return to work, the need for housing is expected to increase further, leading to a healthy demand for building materials. Additionally, the government’s ongoing stimulus measures, such as the HomeBuilder grant, have further boosted the industry.
The HomeBuilder grant, which offers AUD 25,000 to Australian citizens to renovate or build their homes, has been one of the key drivers of growth in the building material sector. The program was introduced in June 2020 and has been extended until March 2021. It has stimulated demand for building materials, furniture, and construction services, resulting in a boost in revenue for companies operating in the sector.
Several initiatives by the government aimed at accelerating infrastructure development and investment in the construction industry have also helped in improving the revenue of companies in the sector. The government plans to invest AUD 110 billion in infrastructure development over the next ten years, providing significant opportunities for construction companies and building material manufacturers.
The building material sector’s revival is also expected to boost Australia’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Several experts believe that the industry’s growth is a positive sign for the economy, as the sector accounts for a significant proportion of the nation’s GDP and provides employment opportunities for thousands of people.
The upbeat sentiment in the industry is expected to continue in the coming months, with investors remaining bullish on the prospects of the industry. The Reserve Bank of Australia has also indicated that it will maintain low-interest rates for the foreseeable future, which will contribute to the sector’s growth.
In conclusion, the building material sector has shown positive signs of recovery, with Boral Ltd’s positive performance leading the charge. The government’s stimulus measures, low-interest rates, and increased demand for housing have contributed to the sector’s growth. As industries reopen, and individuals return to work, the growth in the building material sector is expected to continue, boosting Australia’s economic recovery.
