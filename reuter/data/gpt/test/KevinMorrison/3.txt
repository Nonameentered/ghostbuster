The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) has been urged to expedite the liberalisation of the fast-growing telecommunications sector, according to a recent statement made by an Australian official.
In his address at the APEC Telecommunications Working Group Meeting, the Australian official called for greater collaboration among APEC nations to accelerate the growth of the sector. He noted that the industry had undergone substantial changes in recent years, with the emergence of new technologies and growing demand for connectivity worldwide.
The official highlighted the need for APEC countries to implement policies and regulations that enable a more open and competitive telecommunications market, which would ultimately benefit both consumers and businesses.
"Telecommunications is a critical sector that underpins many other industries and drives economic growth. A more liberalised and dynamic telecommunications environment is crucial for fostering innovation, improving access to services, and increasing productivity," he said.
The official also urged APEC members to work towards reducing barriers to trade and investment in the sector, pointing out that many countries still limit foreign ownership of telecommunications companies. He argued that foreign investment can play a crucial role in driving innovation and improving service quality.
In addition, he emphasised the importance of advancing the development of 5G networks, which offer faster and more reliable connectivity and are expected to transform many industries, including healthcare, transport, and manufacturing.
"5G has the potential to revolutionise the way we live and work, but its deployment requires significant investment and collaboration among stakeholders. APEC should play a leading role in facilitating this process," he said.
The official also touched on the need for greater coordination in addressing cybersecurity threats, a growing concern for all economies in the region. He called for APEC members to share best practices and information, as well as establish common standards and protocols to enhance cybersecurity resilience.
The call for greater liberalisation in the telecommunications sector was welcomed by many participants at the APEC meeting, who noted the significant benefits that could be gained from a more open and competitive market.
"Liberalisation is crucial for unlocking the full potential of the telecommunications sector and expanding access to digital services. It can also spur innovation and create new opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs," said one participant.
Others emphasised the need for regulatory frameworks that balance market openness with consumer protection and national security concerns. They also highlighted the importance of ensuring that all users, regardless of their location or income, can benefit from the latest digital technologies.
"A fair and transparent regulatory environment is necessary to ensure that everyone has access to affordable and high-quality telecommunications services. This is particularly important for people living in remote and underserved areas, who may face additional barriers to accessing digital services," said another participant.
The APEC Telecommunications Working Group Meeting is part of a broader effort to promote closer cooperation among member economies in the Asia-Pacific region. The group focuses on improving the policy and regulatory environment for telecommunications, as well as enhancing connectivity and bridging the digital divide across the region.
Australia, which currently holds the chairmanship of APEC, has made the expansion of digital trade and the development of digital infrastructure a top priority. The country has also been actively promoting greater cooperation on cybersecurity and other digital issues through other regional and international forums.
As the APEC member economies continue to navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving digital landscape, the call for greater liberalisation in the telecommunications sector is likely to gain even greater urgency.  By working together to foster an open and competitive market, APEC nations can help unleash the full potential of this critical sector and drive economic growth and innovation across the region.
