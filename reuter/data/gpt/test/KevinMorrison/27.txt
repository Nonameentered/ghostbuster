Media mogul Rupert Murdoch's company, News Corp, has made a major move in the U.S. television market with a new deal with EchoStar Corporation. The announcement sent News Corp's shares soaring on Wall Street.
Under the deal, News Corp will offer a subscription television service called "SkyRide" to U.S. viewers. The new service will deliver an array of programming, including news, sports, movies, and television shows.
News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch said in a statement that the company is "excited to bring this innovative new service to our U.S. audience. With the power of SkyRide, we can offer viewers an unparalleled range of programming choices, delivered in a user-friendly format that will revolutionize the television experience."
EchoStar is a satellite and television services company that has been in business since the early 1980s. The company provides satellite TV to subscribers throughout the United States and Canada under the DISH Network brand.
The partnership with News Corp is a significant expansion for EchoStar. The company has long been focused on satellite television, but the new agreement will allow it to offer its customers a wider range of programming options.
According to Business Insider, this deal could also bring an end to the contentious carriage dispute between Dish and Murdoch's Fox News. Fox News and other Murdoch-owned channels had been blocked by Dish's satellite TV service over a distribution disagreement. The two companies reached a new distribution agreement in early October, allowing Fox News and other channels to once again be broadcast on Dish's network.
While terms of the deal between News Corp and EchoStar have not been disclosed, the new service is expected to launch in the next few months. SkyRide will be available as a streaming service on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and televisions.
News of the partnership sent News Corp's shares up by more than 4% on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of EchoStar also rose by more than 5%.
This latest move by Rupert Murdoch suggests that he is once again looking to expand his media empire. Murdoch already owns a number of media properties, including Fox News, The New York Post, and The Wall Street Journal. His media holdings also include the British newspapers The Times and The Sunday Times, as well as the tabloid The Sun.
In recent years, Murdoch has faced criticism for his company's treatment of employees and for his conservative political views. But he remains one of the most powerful media figures in the world, and his companies continue to exert a significant influence on the global media landscape.
In conclusion, News Corp has struck a deal with EchoStar Corporation to offer a subscription TV service called SkyRide to US viewers. The announcement has sent News Corp's shares soaring. With this partnership, EchoStar will be able to expand its reach while News Corp is looking to expand its media empire. The deal could also bring an end to the contentious carriage dispute between Dish and Fox News. SkyRide will be available as a streaming service on a variety of devices and is expected to launch in the next few months.
