Australian entertainment company Village Roadshow has announced that it expects a significant boost in earnings during the second half of 2021, fueled in large part by the expansion of its cinema offerings.
The company, which operates theme parks, cinemas, and film distribution businesses across Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, saw its earnings take a significant hit in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the rollout of vaccines and a return to normalcy on the horizon, the company is optimistic about the future.
In a statement to shareholders, Village Roadshow CEO Clark Kirby highlighted the company's ongoing efforts to expand its cinema offerings. "We continue to work on delivering new or refurbished cinemas, improving the guest experience and upgrading our technology," Kirby said. "These efforts underpin our confidence in the outlook for the cinema division for the second half of 2021 and beyond."
The cinema expansion includes the construction of a number of new locations across Australia, including Gold Coast, Victoria's Frankston and Epping, and the Northern Beaches of Sydney. Village Roadshow is also in the process of upgrading some of its existing cinemas with new seating and state-of-the-art technology to enhance the viewing experience for customers.
In addition to the cinema expansion, Village Roadshow is also counting on the reopening of its theme parks to drive increased earnings in the second half of the year. The company's Gold Coast parks, including Movie World, Sea World, and Wet'n'Wild, were closed for much of 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions, but have since reopened with safety protocols in place.
Kirby expressed confidence that the company's overall performance will continue to improve as the world returns to a sense of normalcy. "With the ongoing roll-out of vaccines and the gradual reopening of borders, we anticipate a gradual recovery in our businesses," Kirby said. "We remain focused on delivering on our growth strategy and maintaining our strong financial position."
The company's share price rose on the news, with investors betting that the expansion of Village Roadshow's cinema offerings will help to offset some of the damage done by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. At the time of writing, the stock was up by 2.76% on the Australian Securities Exchange.
