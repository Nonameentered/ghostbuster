Hollywood Scouts Head Down Under for the Next "Shine" or "Babe" as Australia's Film Industry Basks in the Spotlight
Australia's film industry has been put under the spotlight by Hollywood once again as scouts have headed down under in search of the next "Shine" or "Babe". This comes as no surprise to industry insiders as the country has been consistently producing outstanding films for decades, yet it seems local talent is finally getting the recognition it deserves.
There has been a flurry of activity in the Australian film industry recently, with productions such as "Mad Max: Fury Road" grossing over $375 million at the box office and receiving ten Oscar nominations, and "Lion" receiving six Oscar nominations including Best Picture. These films have given international audiences a taste of Australia's unique storytelling abilities and cinematic landscapes, which have been capturing local audiences' hearts for years.
"I think Hollywood is beginning to catch onto what we already know here in Australia, that this country has some of the best talent, locations, and stories in the world," said Lisa French, Executive Director of Screen Producers Australia. "We've been producing films like "The Dressmaker" and "Red Dog" that have been embraced by audiences around the world, and now it seems like Hollywood is finally recognizing our potential."
In recent years, Australia has also become an attractive destination for international productions. The country's government offers a financial incentive to attract foreign investment, which has been a major factor in productions like "Aquaman" and "Thor: Ragnarok" choosing to shoot in Australia.
"A lot of Hollywood producers and directors are coming to Australia and realizing it's a fantastic place to shoot films," said Greg Basser, former CEO of Village Roadshow Entertainment Group and now an executive consultant to the film industry. "We have a lot of talented crews, stunning landscapes, and tax incentives to make it an affordable location to shoot in."
However, the recognition from Hollywood comes with its own set of challenges for the local industry. Local productions and talent can be overlooked in favor of international productions. Furthermore, Australian talent may choose to work on international projects rather than local productions due to more lucrative wages and larger budgets.
"The challenge for us is to maintain our identity and ensure the local industry does not become overshadowed by international productions," said French. "We want to maintain our distinctive voice and continue producing films that tell uniquely Australian stories."
Despite these challenges, the Australian film industry continues to thrive. Upcoming releases such as "True History of the Kelly Gang" and "Babyteeth" have received critical acclaim and are set to feature at international film festivals. There are also reports of upcoming projects such as "Thor: Love and Thunder" and "Avatar 2" choosing to shoot in Australia, which will provide opportunities for local talent and boost the economy.
"It's really exciting to see the industry getting so much attention from Hollywood," said Nick McKinless, Film, and TV lecturer at the University of Sydney. "We have such talented writers, directors, and actors in this country, and seeing them given opportunities on the world stage is fantastic for the local industry."
With Hollywood showing increased interest in Australia's film industry, it seems that the country's unique storytelling abilities and cinematic landscapes will continue to be showcased to the world. Local talent is poised to take center stage and continue producing films that capture the hearts and minds of audiences around the globe.
