As streaming services continue their meteoric rise in popularity, analysts are warning that the Pay TV industry in Australia may see significant rationalisation in the near future. With the likes of Telstra and Optus focusing on other battles, the Pay TV space is left vulnerable, and as a result, dramatic changes could be on the horizon.
In recent years, streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ have exploded in popularity, largely thanks to their affordability and convenience. With many Australians opting to cut the cord and ditch expensive Pay TV subscriptions in favour of streaming, the industry has seen a significant decline.
According to research from Roy Morgan, Pay TV subscriptions fell by 5.5% between 2018 and 2020, with 1.9 million Australians opting to cancel their subscriptions during that time. Meanwhile, the number of Australians subscribing to at least one paid streaming service increased by 23.4% in the same period, indicating a clear shift in consumer behaviour.
As a result, analysts are warning that the Pay TV industry in Australia is facing a significant challenge. In the past, the industry was largely dominated by Foxtel, however, with new competitors entering the market and established players such as Telstra and Optus reducing their focus on Pay TV, Foxtel's stranglehold on the industry is loosening.
Telstra, for example, recently announced that it will no longer market Foxtel as part of its bundled packages, instead opting to promote Kayo Sports, its sports streaming service. Optus, meanwhile, has shifted its attention towards 5G rollout, and has not released a new content offering in several years.
This leaves Foxtel in a precarious position, and analysts believe that the company may be forced to consider significant changes in order to survive. One potential avenue is greater collaboration with streaming services, as seen in Foxtel's recent partnership with Netflix. The partnership allows Foxtel customers to access Netflix content through their Foxtel subscription, providing greater value for customers.
However, some analysts believe that this may not be enough, and that Foxtel may need to make more dramatic changes in order to remain competitive. One potential option is to move towards a more on-demand model, similar to that of streaming services. This could help to attract younger audiences who are used to this type of service, as well as providing greater flexibility for existing customers.
Another potential option is the consolidation of the industry through mergers and acquisitions. This could see Foxtel and other Pay TV providers join forces in order to better compete against streaming services. However, it remains to be seen whether such consolidation will be allowed by regulators, given the potential for anti-competitive behaviour.
While the future of the Pay TV industry in Australia remains uncertain, one thing is clear - the industry is no longer the dominant force it once was. With Telstra and Optus focusing on other battles, and streaming services growing in popularity, significant changes are likely on the horizon. Whether this means greater collaboration with streaming services, a move towards an on-demand model, or consolidation remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure - the Pay TV industry in Australia is in for a bumpy ride.
