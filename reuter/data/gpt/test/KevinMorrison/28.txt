Tabcorp managing director says company on track to meet forecasts, eyeing NSW TAB acquisition.
The company's managing director, David Attenborough, has expressed confidence that Tabcorp is on track to meet its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts. The announcement comes after the company's half-year results revealed a 17.6% decline in net profit to AUD 186 million, which was attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Attenborough said the company has shown resilience and is focused on driving growth in its wagering and media businesses. He also highlighted the success of the company's digital channels, which have seen significant growth during the pandemic.
"We have managed to adapt to the current environment and continue to deliver for our customers," Attenborough said. "Our digital channels have been a key driver of growth, and we are seeing strong uptake in our online and mobile betting platforms."
Attenborough also discussed the company's plans to acquire the New South Wales (NSW) TAB, a move that is expected to significantly enhance Tabcorp's wagering business and strengthen its position in the Australian market.
"We believe the NSW TAB is a highly attractive asset that would complement our existing wagering business and provide us with new growth opportunities," he said. "We are currently in discussions with the NSW government about the potential acquisition, and we remain hopeful that we can reach a positive outcome."
The NSW TAB is currently owned by the NSW government and is the state's largest wagering operator, with a market share of approximately 30%. The acquisition would give Tabcorp a dominant position in the NSW market, as well as access to the NSW government's extensive racing and sports infrastructure.
Attenborough said the acquisition would also create significant synergies and cost savings for Tabcorp, as it would be able to leverage its existing infrastructure and expertise to improve the performance of the NSW TAB.
"We believe that we can unlock significant value through this acquisition by leveraging our existing capabilities and expertise," he said. "By bringing together two of the largest and most successful wagering businesses in Australia, we can create a powerful competitive force that is well positioned to succeed in the rapidly evolving wagering market."
The potential acquisition of the NSW TAB is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021.
In addition to its wagering business, Tabcorp also has a significant presence in the gaming industry through its ownership of the Star Entertainment Group and the Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group. Attenborough said the company remained committed to these investments and sees opportunities for further growth in the gaming sector.
"Our gaming businesses have been impacted by the pandemic like all businesses, but we remain committed to these investments and see opportunities for growth in the future," he said. "We believe that our diversified portfolio of businesses puts us in a strong position to navigate the current environment and emerge even stronger on the other side."
Tabcorp's shares were up 1.1% following the announcement. The company's share price has been volatile in recent months due to the impact of the pandemic, but Attenborough said the company remained focused on delivering long-term value for shareholders.
"We are focused on delivering sustainable growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders," he said. "While the current environment is challenging, we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to execute."
