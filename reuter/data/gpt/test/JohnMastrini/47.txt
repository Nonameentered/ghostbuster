Czech National Bank (CNB) has forced the country's largest private bank, Agrobanka, into administration due to liquidity problems following the failure of another bank. This move has left thousands of customers of Agrobanka in a state of uncertainty, the bank said. The CNB has taken over Agrobanka's operations, which will now be managed by Komerční Banka, a subsidiary of the Société Générale Group.
The decision by the CNB comes barely a week after another Czech bank, PQS Bank, went bankrupt. The failure of PQS Bank caused a run on deposits in Agrobanka, which resulted in mass withdrawals that reportedly led Agrobanka to seek emergency financial assistance from the CNB. The CNB was initially hesitant to provide any financial help but later decided to place the bank into administration.
Agrobanka follows in the footsteps of other major banks in Europe that have been forced into administration in recent years due to liquidity problems. However, this is the first time that a large private bank in the Czech Republic has been forced into administration. The CNB has said that depositors of the bank will be reimbursed up to €100,000 each under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme.
The CNB Governor, Jiří Rusnok, said that the decision to force Agrobanka into administration was a "necessary and responsible step in order to protect the interests of depositors and the stability of the financial system". He added that the CNB did not have any other option but to take this step as it became evident that the bank could not meet its obligations to customers.
The administrator appointed by the CNB will manage the bank's assets and liabilities, with the aim of either selling the bank or breaking it up and selling the parts. It is not yet clear how long the administration process will take.
The CNB has assured customers of the bank that all of their accounts are safe and that operations will continue as usual. However, this has not stopped customers from withdrawing their money from the bank. According to reports, Agrobanka has lost about 25% of its deposits since the announcement of the administration.
The collapse of Agrobanka is a major blow for the Czech banking sector. The bank had been one of the fastest-growing banks in the country and had reported a profit in 2019. Its failure will likely result in a consolidation of the banking sector, with larger players buying up smaller banks.
