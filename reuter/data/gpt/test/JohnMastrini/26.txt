The love and bond between fathers and sons can be special, and in the case of filmmakers Arturo and Carlos Valdez, it has also proven to be successful. The Mexican duo, who have been working together for years, have just received their second Oscar nomination for their latest film, "The Language of Love".
Announced on Monday, January 25th, 2021, by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, "The Language of Love" was one of five films nominated for Best Foreign Language Feature. This will mark the second time the Valdez team has been up for this honor, as they were previously nominated in 2016 for their film "Uno a Uno".
The father and son team has been making films for over a decade, and their most recent work is a beautiful tribute to the language of love, and the power it has to connect people. The film tells the story of a young woman, Ana, who travels to Paris to study French. While there, she meets and falls in love with a man, Antoine, who speaks no Spanish, the only language she knows. Despite their language barrier, their love blossoms and becomes a testament to the power of love.
When asked about their inspiration for the film, Arturo Valdez explained, "We wanted to explore how love can transcend boundaries, especially language barriers." Carlos Valdez added, "We also wanted to show the importance of communication. Words are powerful, but there are other ways to express yourself, like body language and feelings."
The Valdez team has become known for their ability to tell emotional and heartfelt stories, and avid moviegoers around the world have taken notice. They have received numerous international awards and have been praised for their ability to capture the essence of the human experience on screen.
Their first film, "Hasta que la Muerte nos Separe", was released in 2011 and told the story of a couple facing the challenges of a terminal illness. It was a critical success, earning them the admiration of audiences and critics alike. Their second film, a science fiction drama titled "La CÃ¡psula del Tiempo", was released in 2013 and received numerous international awards, including Best Film at the Malaga Film Festival.
"The Language of Love" is a beautiful film that showcases the power of love, and the impact that it can have on our lives. The Valdez team worked diligently to create an authentic and captivating story, and it has clearly paid off. The film has received positive reviews from critics, and audiences have been moved by its touching message.
When asked about the nomination, Arturo Valdez expressed his gratitude, saying, "We are so honored to receive this recognition from the Academy. It is a testament to the hard work and dedication of everyone involved in making this film."
Carlos Valdez added, "We are grateful for the opportunity to tell these stories, and we hope that our films can inspire and connect people from all around the world."
The Valdez team now turns their attention to the 93rd Academy Awards, which will take place on April 25th, 2021. They will be up against strong competition from other amazing films, including "Another Round" from Denmark and "Quo Vadis, Aida?" from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Whether or not "The Language of Love" takes home the award, it is clear that the Valdez team has made an incredible contribution to the world of cinema. This nomination is a testament to their ongoing dedication to bringing authentic and emotional stories to the screen.
In a time when the world feels divided and uncertain, films like "The Language of Love" can help to remind us of the power of love and the importance of connection. The Valdez team has once again demonstrated their ability to inspire and move audiences, and we can only hope that this nomination is the beginning of many more to come.
