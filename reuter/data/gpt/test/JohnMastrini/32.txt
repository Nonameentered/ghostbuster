The Czech Foreign Minister has hit out at Russia after economic reprisals were threatened over the country's NATO membership, calling the move "outrageous and unacceptable."
According to reports, Russia has warned the Czech Republic that it faces significant economic consequences if it continues to pursue NATO membership. The Kremlin has apparently threatened to impose economic restrictions on Czech goods, particularly in the energy sector, and place additional regulations and tariffs on Czech imports.
In response to these threats, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek issued a statement condemning Russia's actions and reaffirming the Czech Republic's commitment to NATO.
"Our sovereignty and our right to make our own decisions as a sovereign nation will not be compromised by any form of economic pressure," he said in the statement. "We will not allow any foreign power to dictate our foreign policy or to interfere in our domestic affairs."
Kulhánek went on to stress the importance of the Czech Republic's relationship with NATO and its commitment to collective defense and mutual security.
"The Czech Republic is a committed member of NATO and our cooperation with our allies is essential to maintaining peace and stability in Europe," he said. "We will not be intimidated or coerced by any external actor, and we will continue to pursue our foreign policy objectives in accordance with our national interests and international obligations."
Russia's threats have been met with widespread criticism and concern from other members of NATO, who have expressed support for the Czech Republic's sovereignty and security.
In a joint statement, NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and its 30 member countries expressed their "vigorous support" for the Czech Republic and its right to make its own sovereign decisions.
"We call on Russia to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all NATO members, and to refrain from any actions that could destabilize the peaceful and cooperative order that has been established in Europe," the statement read.
The threat of economic reprisals from Russia is the latest in a series of actions by the Kremlin that have been seen as attempts to exert pressure on NATO and its member countries. In recent months, Russia has increased its military presence and activities near NATO's borders, conducted cyber-attacks against member countries, and engaged in aggressive rhetoric and disinformation campaigns.
Despite these challenges, NATO remains committed to its mission of ensuring the security and stability of Europe and its allies. As Foreign Minister Kulhánek noted, "NATO is the cornerstone of our security and our shared values, and we will continue to work with our allies to defend them."
