The Czech National Bank Governor, Jiri Rusnok, has expressed concern over the sharp rise in the country's currency, the crown, despite a worsening trade balance and Eurobond issues.
In an interview with Bloomberg, Rusnok said that the appreciation of the crown could harm the economy, as it would make Czech exports more expensive and less competitive on the global market.
The value of the crown has risen by more than 3% against the euro since the beginning of the year, reaching its highest level since 2018. The Czech Republic's trade balance, however, has worsened significantly, with the country recording a trade deficit of CZK 25.8 billion in February.
Rusnok acknowledged that the weakening trade balance was due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought about a decline in global trade. However, he noted that the strength of the crown was also a contributing factor.
The governor stated that the central bank was closely monitoring the exchange rate and would take action if necessary to prevent the crown from appreciating further.
"We will use all the instruments we have to ensure that the exchange rate is in line with our monetary policy objectives," Rusnok said.
One of the tools at the central bank's disposal is interest rates. The bank has already implemented a series of rate cuts in response to the pandemic, reducing the key interest rate to 0.25%.
However, Rusnok indicated that further rate cuts may not be the best option, as they could exacerbate the country's trade deficit and inflation.
"We have to be very careful with interest rates," he said. "If we cut interest rates, it could lead to a further appreciation of the crown, which could hurt exports and increase inflation."
Eurobonds, or bonds denominated in a currency other than the issuer's currency, have also been a concern for the central bank. The Czech Republic has issued Eurobonds worth over EUR 3 billion this year, increasing the government's foreign debt to record levels.
Rusnok said that while the country's foreign debt was still manageable, the increasing reliance on foreign currency borrowing posed a risk to the economy.
"The Czech Republic is still in a good position when it comes to foreign debt, but we have to be careful about increasing the share of foreign currency borrowing," he said.
The governor added that the central bank was working closely with the government to ensure that any Eurobond issues were carried out in a responsible manner.
Despite these concerns, Rusnok remained optimistic about the Czech economy's recovery from the pandemic.
"We believe that the economy will recover quickly once the pandemic is over," he said. "The vaccination program is going well, and we are seeing signs of improvement in some sectors."
The governor also expressed confidence in the European Union's recovery plan, which he said would provide a boost to the Czech economy through increased investment and job creation.
In conclusion, the sharp rise of the crown despite a worsening trade balance and Eurobond issues is raising concerns for the Czech National Bank Governor. While rate cuts may not be the best option, the central bank is closely monitoring the exchange rate and is prepared to take action if necessary. The bank is also working closely with the government to ensure that any Eurobond issues are carried out responsibly. Despite these challenges, the governor remains optimistic about the Czech economy's recovery.
