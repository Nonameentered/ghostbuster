The Czech Republic's industrial sector is facing multiple challenges, including weak profitability and poor corporate leadership, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) team leader Hana Semerádová.
Semerádová, who is responsible for the EBRD's operations in the Czech Republic, highlighted these issues in a recent interview with Radio Prague.
She explained that the sector's profitability has been declining for several years, with companies struggling to generate sufficient revenue to cover their costs. "This is a widespread problem – not just in the Czech Republic but across Central Europe," said Semerádová.
The EBRD team leader also cited poor corporate leadership as a key factor contributing to the industrial sector's challenges. She noted that many Czech companies are family-owned and lack professional management structures.
"Owners of family-run businesses often prioritize their own interests over those of the company, and may lack the skills necessary to manage operations effectively," said Semerádová.
This, in turn, can result in limited investment in technology, limited innovation and a lack of ambition to compete on a global scale.
Semerádová emphasized the need for Czech companies to adopt more innovative and forward-thinking strategies in order to compete effectively in the global market.
"The Czech Republic has a great history of producing high-quality industrial goods, but companies need to modernize their thinking and operations to stay competitive," she said.
To address these challenges, Semerádová suggested that the Czech government and business community work together to promote innovation and increase investment in technology.
She also recommended that companies boost their international presence by investing in new export markets and improving their branding and marketing strategies.
Overall, Semerádová stressed that the Czech Republic's industrial sector has the potential to succeed, but must adapt to changing global markets and embrace new ideas and technologies in order to do so.
"The Czech Republic has a lot of advantages, including a highly skilled workforce and a long tradition of producing high-quality goods," said Semerádová. "But in order to keep up with the rest of the world, companies must be willing to change and embrace new ideas."
As the country continues to navigate economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains to be seen how the Czech industrial sector will respond to these calls for change and innovation. However, with the backing of organizations like the EBRD, policymakers and business leaders will have access to resources and expertise to help guide them forward and navigate these evolving economic realities.
