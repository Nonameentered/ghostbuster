Prague, Czech Republic – The King of Pop, Michael Jackson, kicked off the “HIStory World Tour” on June 16, 1996, in Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic. The show was nothing short of a high-tech spectacle, showcasing MJ’s signature dance moves, stunning lighting effects, and mind-blowing pyrotechnics.
The concert was held at Strahov Stadium, a vast sports complex with a capacity of 36,000 spectators. The stadium was filled to the brim, with thousands of fans eagerly anticipating the return of their pop idol to the stage after a four-year hiatus.
The show began with a thunderous applause as Michael Jackson appeared on stage, dressed in an electrifying gold and black outfit, complete with shoulder pads and a matching helmet. He launched into his opening track “Scream,” which he performed with his sister, Janet Jackson, on the album version.
The stage was dark and mysterious, with a giant screen projecting a hologram of MJ against a backdrop of flames. He then segued into his hit songs, “They Don’t Care About Us,” “In the Closet,” “Wanna be Startin’ Somethin’,” “Stranger in Moscow,” and “Smooth Criminal.”
For each song, Michael wore a different outfit, each dazzling and extravagant than the last. He wore silver sequined jackets, fedoras, and gloves for “Wanna be Startin’ Somethin’,” an ethereal white robe with a golden belt for “Stranger in Moscow,” and a red suit and fedora for “Smooth Criminal.”
The highlight of the show was MJ’s performance of “Earth Song,” a touching ballad about the environment. He sang while standing in front of a giant screen projecting images of poverty, war, and destruction. Towards the end of the song, MJ fell to his knees, overcome with emotion and the atrocities he witnessed in the video.
The stage then transformed into a scene reminiscent of Jurassic Park, with a giant mechanical elephant and other animals surrounding MJ while he sang “Heal the World.” The audience was spellbound by the stunning visuals and the message of unity and peace that MJ promoted in his music.
But it was not just MJ’s incredible voice and dancing skills that stole the show. The “HIStory World Tour” featured groundbreaking special effects that made it an unforgettable experience for every spectator in the audience. The set was a high-tech wonderland, with neon lights, holograms, and lasers that created a futuristic ambiance.
The spectacular pyrotechnics added to the visual spectacle, with giant flames shooting out of the stage, and fireworks lighting up the night sky. MJ flew across the stage on a pulley system and used a giant globe as a prop during “Earth Song.”
Another outstanding aspect of the show was the elaborate choreography performed by MJ and his troupe of dancers. The moves were precisely executed, with each step and gesture in sync with the music’s rhythm. MJ’s famous moonwalk and other signature dance moves added to the performance’s excitement and energy, leaving the audience in awe.
The “HIStory World Tour” was MJ’s most successful concert tour, grossing over $165 million and playing to more than 4.5 million fans worldwide. The show attracted people from all walks of life, proving MJ’s popularity and influence as a global pop icon.
