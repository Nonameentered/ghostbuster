The Czech National Bank (CNB) has placed Agrobanka, a small agricultural lender, under forced administration due to liquidity problems.
The move comes after the bank has been struggling with high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) for years. At the end of 2020, the bank's NPL ratio stood at 26%, compared to the industry average of around 4%.
Agrobanka has been under the CNB's supervision since 2018, when the regulator found serious deficiencies in the bank's management and internal controls. The CNB then ordered the bank to take corrective measures, but these proved to be insufficient.
In a statement, the CNB said that it had taken the decision to place Agrobanka under forced administration as the bank had failed to fulfill its obligations and had lost the trust of its clients and creditors.
The CNB also stated that it would work closely with the administrator to ensure that the bank's operations remained stable and that its clients were not unduly affected by the move.
Agrobanka is a small bank with total assets of around CZK 5.8 billion ($268 million) and operates mainly in the agricultural sector. The bank's clients include farmers, agricultural co-operatives and other businesses in the sector.
The forced administration of Agrobanka is a rare event in the Czech Republic's banking sector, which has been relatively stable in recent years. The last time a bank was placed under forced administration was in 2017, when the CNB took over Air Bank, a mid-sized lender, due to concerns over its risk management.
The CNB has been warning banks in the country about the risk of NPLs for some time, and has been urging them to improve their risk management and lending practices. The regulator has also introduced stricter rules on loan classification and provisioning to ensure that banks are adequately prepared for any deterioration in credit quality.
Agrobanka's forced administration is a reminder of the importance of effective risk management and the need for banks to ensure that they have sufficient capital and liquidity buffers to withstand future shocks. It also highlights the challenges facing small banks in the current environment, where competition is intense and profit margins are low.
