Leading Czech economist, Pavel Kohout, has urged caution against central bank intervention to prop up the Czech crown. Speaking to the press, Kohout stated that such measures could do more harm than good to the economy of the country.
Kohout, who served as an advisor to former Czech President Vaclav Havel, emphasized the need for a free market approach to currency exchange. He warned against interfering in the foreign exchange market, stating that it could distort prices and lead to unintended consequences.
"The central bank should not be involved in the exchange rate," Kohout said. "It should be left to the market to determine the value of the currency."
Kohout's comments come as the Czech central bank faces increasing pressure to intervene to support the crown, which has weakened in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the economic fallout that followed.
While the Czech economy has fared better than many of its European peers, with a relatively low infection rate and strong economic fundamentals, the ongoing pandemic has still had a significant impact on the country's economy. Unemployment has risen, and GDP growth has slowed, leading some to call for government intervention to stimulate the economy and boost the currency.
However, Kohout argues that such measures could be counterproductive, as they could lead to inflation and distort the economy. He cites the example of the 1990s, when the central bank intervened to prop up the currency, leading to a sharp rise in inflation and a subsequent economic crisis.
Instead, Kohout suggests that the government should focus on structural reforms to boost the economy, including improving the business climate, reducing bureaucracy, and investing in key sectors such as innovation and infrastructure.
"Intervention is not the solution," Kohout said. "It is a short-term fix that can cause long-term damage."
Kohout's comments have been met with mixed reactions, with some experts noting the need for flexibility and pragmatism in times of crisis.
"The central bank has a crucial role to play in supporting the economy," said one analyst. "While we should be careful not to interfere too much in the market, we also need to recognize the need for flexibility and rapid response in times of crisis."
In any case, the debate over the best approach to propping up the crown is likely to continue, as the Czech economy faces ongoing challenges from COVID-19 and other external factors.
