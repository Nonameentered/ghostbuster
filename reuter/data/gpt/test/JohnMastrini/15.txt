The Czech government has thrown its full weight behind the Transport Minister's hard line against striking railway workers. The government has described the strike action as illegal and has vowed to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of the country's public transport systems.
Transport Minister Karel Havlicek has been facing mounting pressure from the public and the government to resolve the ongoing strike by railway workers. The workers, who are members of the Trade Union of Railway Workers, have been on strike since December 2020 in protest against proposed changes to their working conditions.
The proposed changes would see the introduction of a new set of working conditions for railway workers, including changes to salaries, working hours, and benefits. The union members argue that the changes will have a significant impact on their overall compensation and job security.
The government, however, has argued that the proposed changes are necessary to modernize the country's railways and to ensure that it remains competitive in the face of increasing competition from other modes of transport, such as road and air transport.
In a statement issued on Monday, the government expressed its full support for Minister Havlicek and his efforts to resolve the strike. The government has also urged the striking workers to return to work immediately, warning that the ongoing strike is causing significant disruption to the country's public transport network.
"The government is fully behind the Transport Minister and the measures he is taking to ensure the safety and security of our public transport systems. We urge the striking workers to return to work immediately and to enter into a constructive dialogue with the minister to address their concerns," the statement read.
The government has also expressed its concern over the impact that the strike is having on the country's economy. The ongoing strike has already caused significant disruption to the country's railways, with many trains cancelled or delayed. This has resulted in inconvenience for passengers as well as significant losses for businesses that depend on the railway network for their operations.
The Transport Minister has been actively engaging with the union members in an effort to resolve the strike. He has offered a number of concessions, including a postponement of the proposed changes and the establishment of a joint working group to discuss the issues.
However, the union members have refused to accept these offers and have demanded that the proposed changes be withdrawn completely.
The government has now warned that it will take all necessary steps to ensure that the strike is brought to an end. This could include the use of force to remove the striking workers from railway premises and the imposition of fines on the union for its illegal strike action.
The government has also called on the striking workers to respect the laws of the country and to return to work immediately. Failure to do so could result in severe consequences, including the loss of jobs and the possible cancellation of their employment contracts.
Overall, the Czech government's support for the Transport Minister's hard line against the striking railway workers demonstrates its commitment to ensuring the safety and security of the country's public transport systems. The government's efforts to resolve the strike are also a clear indication of its determination to modernize the country's railways and to ensure that they remain competitive in the face of growing competition.
