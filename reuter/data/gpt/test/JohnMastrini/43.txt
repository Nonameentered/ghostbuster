The Czech National Bank (CNB) has delayed the release of key money supply figures, frustrating traders and analysts who are eager to glean insights into the health of the Czech economy.
The CNB had originally planned to release its M2 and M3 money supply data on April 1, but delayed the release without explanation. The data is now expected to be released on April 15.
Money supply figures are closely watched by economists and investors as they provide insight into the amount of money in circulation and the level of inflationary pressure in an economy. A delay in releasing such data can cause uncertainty in financial markets and volatility in currency exchange rates.
The delay has frustrated traders and analysts who rely on the data to make investment decisions and assess the outlook for the Czech economy. Some have questioned why the CNB has not provided an explanation for the delay, which they say only adds to the uncertainty.
"I think it's unhelpful and frustrating to market participants, as they are left trying to guess why the figures have been delayed," said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
Tuvey said he was particularly concerned about the delay given the recent volatility in the Czech koruna, which has strengthened against the euro in recent months. A sudden change in money supply figures could potentially trigger a sharp correction in the currency, he said.
The CNB has not commented on the delay or provided any indication of when the data will be released. However, some analysts have speculated that the delay may be related to the current political situation in the Czech Republic.
The country has been in political turmoil since last year, following a scandal involving Prime Minister Andrej Babis and his business interests. Babis, who has been accused of fraudulently obtaining EU funds, is facing mounting pressure to resign. His government survived a no-confidence vote earlier this week, but analysts say the situation remains volatile.
Some analysts have suggested that the CNB may be delaying the release of money supply data to avoid creating further uncertainty in an already unstable political environment.
"It's possible that the CNB is being cautious in light of the political turmoil in the country," said Liam Peach, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. "But at the same time, a delay in releasing such data only adds to the uncertainty and creates more questions than answers."
The delay in releasing money supply data comes at a time when the Czech economy is facing challenges from multiple fronts. Inflation has been rising steadily over the past year, prompting the CNB to raise interest rates in November and February.
At the same time, the country's export-focused economy is feeling the impact of slowing global growth and trade tensions between the US and China. The CNB has warned that the slowdown in the global economy could impact the Czech economy, which is heavily reliant on exports.
Against this backdrop, analysts say the delay in releasing money supply data only adds to the uncertainty and makes it difficult to gauge the outlook for the Czech economy.
"It's frustrating because we're in a period of heightened uncertainty and investors need as much information as possible to make informed decisions," said Tuvey. "A delay in releasing such fundamental data only adds to the confusion and undermines confidence in the economy."
