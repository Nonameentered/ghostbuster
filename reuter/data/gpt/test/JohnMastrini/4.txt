Prague's prestigious Charles University has conferred an honorary doctorate upon Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. The award recognizes her devotion to democracy, human rights, and peace, according to a statement from the university. Suu Kyi accepted the honor via video message at a ceremony held on Friday. The Burmese politician was unable to attend the event in person due to her busy schedule, but expressed her deep gratitude for the recognition.
"I am deeply honored to receive this doctorate from the esteemed Charles University," Suu Kyi said. "As we navigate through the challenges of our time, it is important to remember the values of democracy, human rights, and peace that have guided us in the past. I hope that this recognition will inspire us all to continue working towards those ideals."
Suu Kyi rose to prominence in Myanmar during the pro-democracy movement of the 1980s and 1990s, which saw her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), win a landslide victory in the country's first free elections in 1990. However, the military junta refused to cede power and placed Suu Kyi under house arrest for most of the next two decades. She became a symbol of resistance against oppression and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
After being released from house arrest in 2010, Suu Kyi continued to campaign for democracy and human rights, eventually winning another historic election in 2015. However, her tenure as leader of Myanmar has been marred by criticism over her handling of the Rohingya crisis. The Muslim minority group has faced persecution, displacement, and violence at the hands of Buddhist nationalists and the military. Suu Kyi has been accused of turning a blind eye to the atrocities and has faced calls to be stripped of her Nobel Peace Prize.
Despite the controversy, Suu Kyi remains a revered figure in the global struggle for democracy and human rights. She has been honored with numerous international awards and has received honorary doctorates from many prestigious universities around the world. The honor from Charles University comes as a recognition of her lifelong devotion to these values and her unwavering commitment to the cause of freedom.
