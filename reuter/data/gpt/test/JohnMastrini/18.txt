The Czech National Bank (CNB) has expressed dissatisfaction with the firming of the crown in recent weeks and has warned that it may soon intervene in the foreign exchange market to curb its appreciation.
According to a statement from the central bank released on Thursday, the CNB believes that the strengthening of the currency is unwarranted in light of the current economic situation. While acknowledging that the Czech economy has shown remarkable resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bank argues that there are still significant risks to growth, particularly in the global economy.
The CNB has frequently intervened in the foreign exchange market in the past to manage the value of the crown. Since 2013, it has used a policy of “intervention thresholds” to maintain the currency within a certain range against the euro. If the value of the crown moves outside this range, the bank has typically intervened by buying or selling euros on the market.
However, the CNB has not intervened in the market since 2017, when it ended its policy of currency intervention. At the time, the bank declared that the currency had reached a “balanced level” and that intervening in the market would no longer be necessary.
Despite this, the CNB is now warning that it may soon intervene to prevent the crown from becoming overvalued. The bank argues that a strong currency could harm the competitiveness of Czech exports, which are a key driver of the country’s economy.
The Czech Republic is one of the EU’s most trade-dependent economies, with exports accounting for over 80% of its GDP. A strong currency makes Czech goods more expensive to foreign buyers, potentially reducing demand for them.
In addition, the CNB argues that a strong currency could contribute to deflationary pressures. This is because it makes imported goods, such as oil and other commodities, cheaper, potentially fueling a downward trend in prices.
The announcement from the CNB has already had an impact on the currency market. The crown lost ground against the euro on Thursday, although it has continued to firm against the US dollar.
However, experts are divided on the CNB’s warning. Some argue that the bank is overreacting to a relatively minor shift in the value of the crown. Others say that intervening in the market could have unintended consequences, such as undermining the credibility of the central bank’s policy.
Ultimately, the CNB’s decision will depend on how the currency performs in the coming weeks. If it continues to strengthen against the euro, the bank may feel compelled to take action to maintain its competitiveness. However, if the crown remains stable, the CNB may decide that intervention is unnecessary.
