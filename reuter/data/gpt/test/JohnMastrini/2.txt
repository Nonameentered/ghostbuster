Prague, Czech Republic - Legendary pop star Michael Jackson launched his highly anticipated "HIStory" tour in Prague on Wednesday, stunning fans from all over Europe that gathered for the spectacular event. The tour began with an exclusive VIP event, where Jackson unveiled a unique statue that symbolizes his outstanding contribution to the music industry.
As the countdown hit zero, the King of Pop made a grand entrance, immediately flashing his signature smile and a sparkling black suit that left the audience in awe. Over 15,000 fans inside the O2 Arena screamed at the top of their lungs as his silhouette filled the stage. The "HIStory" tour celebrates the 25th anniversary of his best-selling album by the same name.
The two-hour concert was packed with classic Jackson hits like "Billie Jean," "Thriller," and "Beat It," all performed with his signature dance moves and vocal delivery. The performance was so electrifying that the fans couldn't help but sing along and dance their hearts out.
Jackson's iconic presence on stage was made more spectacular by the lighting and sound effects, as well as the giant video screens that displayed his best music videos, image montages, and real-life footage of his incredible life journey.
But the highlight of the show was the statue unveiling that marked the beginning of the concert. The statue depicts Jackson in an iconic pose, wearing his signature sequined jacket and fedora hat. It stands majestically right by the entrance of the O2 Arena as a permanent tribute to the greatest pop icon of all time.
The statue was designed and created by the talented Czech sculptor, Albin Polasek, who described the experience as "an incredible opportunity to immortalize the greatest pop icon of all time." The statue was made out of bronze, stands eight-feet tall, and weighs around 7,000 pounds.
After the statue unveiling, Jackson addressed the cheering crowd, saying that he was thrilled to be back in Prague, and described the unveiling as a "tremendous honor." He went on to dedicate the tour to his fans, whom he says have been his biggest inspiration over the years.
"I'm so grateful for all the love and support that you've given me throughout my career. This tour is for you, my fans. Let's make history together," Jackson said, as the crowd erupted with cheers and applause.
The "HIStory" tour is expected to be one of the most successful and memorable tours in Jackson's career, as he has promised to take his performance to new heights, and introduce his music to a new generation of fans.
Prague is the first stop on the "HIStory" tour, with more than 40 dates set across Europe and Asia until the end of the year. Jackson has also revealed plans for a new album, which he says will be a fitting way to celebrate his amazing musical career. 
In the end, the "HIStory" tour is a testament to Jackson's immense talent and his legacy, which continues to inspire and entertain millions of people worldwide. With the statue standing tall in Prague and the tour reaching new heights, Jackson's impact on the music industry will never be forgotten.
