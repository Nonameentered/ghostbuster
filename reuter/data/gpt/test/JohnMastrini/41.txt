PRAGUE - The Czech Republic's deputy finance minister, Martin Novak, has stepped down from his post amid criticism over his management of capital markets.
Novak, who has been in the role since 2017, has been under fire from opposition parties and some members of the public for his handling of the country's economy.
The resignation was announced by Czech Finance Minister Alena Schillerova on Friday. Speaking to reporters, she said that Novak had done a "great job" during his time in office, but acknowledged that his departure was necessary to "ensure stability in our ministry's management."
Novak's departure comes at a sensitive time for the Czech economy, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The country's GDP shrank by 6.1% in 2020, the biggest drop in over two decades.
Critics of Novak have accused him of failing to do enough to support small businesses, and of not investing enough in infrastructure projects that would create jobs and spur economic growth.
Opposition parties have also questioned the government's decision to plow billions of Czech crowns into a state-run investment fund, which has been criticized for its lack of transparency and for investing in companies with links to the ruling party.
Novak's resignation was welcomed by some members of the opposition. "It was long overdue," said Petr Fiala, the leader of the Civic Democratic Party. "We need someone who is capable of managing the country's finances and who will put the interests of the public first."
However, some observers have warned that Novak's departure could create uncertainty in the country's capital markets. "Investors may become nervous if they sense that the government is struggling to manage the economy," said Michal Stupavsky, an economist at the Prague-based think tank IDEA.
Stupavsky added that the government would need to move quickly to find a replacement for Novak in order to maintain confidence in the country's economy.
The Czech Republic's capital markets have been among the best-performing in Europe in recent years, with the country's main index, the PX, up over 100% since 2015. However, there are concerns that the markets could be vulnerable to external shocks, such as a sudden shift in global interest rates or a sharp decline in demand for Czech exports.
Some analysts have also suggested that the country's economic policy has become too reliant on low borrowing costs, which could pose a risk if interest rates were to rise.
While Novak's resignation may ease some of the pressure on the government, it is unlikely to solve all of the country's economic woes. With the pandemic still raging and uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook, the Czech Republic faces significant challenges in the months ahead.
Nonetheless, some are hopeful that a new finance minister could bring fresh ideas and a renewed sense of purpose to the government's economic policies. "It's a chance for a fresh start," said Jan Farsky, an economic commentator. "We need someone who can steer the country through these difficult times and bring new energy to our economy."
