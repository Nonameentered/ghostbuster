On Monday, Czech President Milos Zeman called on the country's Senate to approve a post-World War II reconciliation pact with Germany, in an effort to put to an end the long-standing disputes between the two neighbouring countries.
In a speech at Prague Castle, the Czech President said that the treaty would help to heal the wounds of the past and pave the way towards a more peaceful and cooperative future.
The pact, which was initially signed by Czechoslovakia and West Germany in 1973, seeks to formally acknowledge and apologise for the atrocities committed by Germany during its occupation of Czechoslovakia during WWII. The treaty also aims to establish a framework for cooperation and mutual respect between the two countries.
However, the pact has never been approved by the Czech Parliament, due to concerns over its perceived inadequacy in securing compensation for Czech victims of Nazi brutality and war crimes.
Speaking in favour of the pact, President Zeman argued that "we cannot keep opening old wounds and perpetually pointing fingers at each other," and called on the Senate to "finally put this chapter to rest."
The Czech President's speech has been met with mixed reactions from the Czech public, with some praising his efforts to promote reconciliation and move towards a more peaceful future, while others criticise the perceived lack of progress in securing compensation for Czech victims of Nazi crimes.
Many are also concerned about the potential impact of the pact on Czech-German relations, which have been marked by tensions for decades, particularly over the issue of Sudetenland, a region that was annexed by Germany prior to WWII and is now a part of the Czech Republic.
Despite these concerns, President Zeman's call for the approval of the pact is being seen as a significant step towards resolving the long-standing disputes between the two countries and promoting greater cooperation and understanding in the region.
It remains to be seen whether the Czech Senate will approve the treaty, with many expected to demand further concessions from Germany before giving their support. However, President Zeman's speech has successfully reignited the debate over the issue, and offers hope for a brighter future for Czech-German relations.
