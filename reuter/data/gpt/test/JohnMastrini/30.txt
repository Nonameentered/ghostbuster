The outgoing Vice-Chairman of Czech automaker Skoda Auto, Thomas Schäfer, has rejected allegations of bribery by German parent company Volkswagen (VW) as "nonsense".
Earlier this week, German prosecutors charged former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn and four other executives with fraud and other criminal offenses, accusing them of having participated in a deception scheme to sell diesel vehicles with rigged emissions. VW was fined $4.3 billion in 2017 by U.S. regulators for installing "defeat devices" in its diesel engines that allowed them to emit pollutants at levels up to 40 times above legal limits.
As part of the ongoing investigation, prosecutors also announced on Monday that they had indicted Schäfer on suspicion of fraud and offering a bribe to a public official, among other charges. According to the indictment, Schäfer is alleged to have bribed a former senior manager at VW with $51,000 in exchange for approving a contract with a supplier.
However, Schäfer vehemently denied the allegations in a statement to the media. "I reject the accusations against me as nonsense," he said. "I have always acted lawfully and in accordance with my duties at Skoda Auto, and I will fully cooperate with the authorities to clear my name."
Skoda Auto, which is based in the Czech Republic and is a subsidiary of VW, has also issued a statement in support of Schäfer. "We have complete confidence in Mr. Schäfer and are convinced of his integrity and professionalism," the company said. "We will provide him with the necessary support in his legal defense, and we expect him to continue to serve as Vice-Chairman until his retirement at the end of the year."
Schäfer, a German national, has been with Skoda Auto since 2017 and previously held executive positions at VW, including as head of the group's South Africa operations. He is due to retire at the end of 2021 and will be succeeded by Thomas Ulbrich, who currently heads VW's E-Mobility division.
The bribery scandal is the latest in a series of legal setbacks for VW, which has faced massive fines and legal action in several countries over the diesel emissions scandal. The company has since pledged to invest heavily in electric vehicles and has set a target of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.
