Washington D.C. - Madeleine Albright has been confirmed as the new Secretary of State by the United States Senate, becoming the first woman to ever hold the position. Albright, the daughter of Czechoslovakia-born diplomat Josef Korbel, has long been known for her work in foreign policy and diplomacy, and her appointment has been widely praised in Washington and around the world.
Albright's nomination by President Bill Clinton was met with bipartisan support in the Senate, with both Democrats and Republicans praising her qualifications and experience. Many also cited Albright's personal connection to her father, who was a respected diplomat in his own right and served as a mentor to many in the U.S. foreign service.
"Madeleine Albright is a leader of international stature who is respected around the world for her deep knowledge of foreign policy and her commitment to diplomacy," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. "But she is also much more than that. As the daughter of one of our nation's great diplomats, she embodies the values and ideals that we all hold dear."
Albright's parents, Josef and Anna Korbel, both fled Czechoslovakia in 1939 after the Nazis invaded the country. They eventually settled in the United States, where Josef Korbel became a professor of international relations at the University of Denver. He was also a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations in the early 1950s and served as a consultant to the State Department and the U.S. Information Agency.
Korbel's influence on his daughter was profound. Albright has spoken often about how her father's experiences shaped her own worldview and commitment to public service. In her memoir, "Madam Secretary," she writes that her father taught her the importance of "standing up for what you believe in, even when it is unpopular," and that "diplomacy is not just about talking to your friends, it's about trying to understand and influence those who are opposed to you."
Albright's own career in foreign policy has been marked by that same commitment to dialogue and understanding. She worked as a staff member on the National Security Council during the Carter administration, and later served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under President Clinton. In that role, she was a leading advocate for the expansion of NATO and was instrumental in shaping U.S. policy on Bosnia and Kosovo.
Throughout her career, Albright has also been a vocal advocate for women's rights and gender equality in politics and diplomacy. She famously declared that "there is a special place in hell for women who don't help other women," and has worked to create opportunities for women in government and public service.
Albright's confirmation as Secretary of State comes at a critical moment in U.S. foreign policy. The United States is facing challenges on multiple fronts, from the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan to the rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
Albright has already signaled her intention to tackle these challenges head-on. In a series of interviews following her confirmation, she emphasized the need for the United States to work closely with its allies and partners around the world to address these issues.
"I believe that America's strength comes not from our military might, but from our ability to mobilize global public opinion and to build coalitions of like-minded countries to address the challenges we face," Albright said. "We need to work with our allies and partners to find common ground and to build a more stable and secure world."
Albright's appointment has been met with widespread praise from foreign leaders and diplomats. Many have cited her experience and expertise in international affairs, as well as her commitment to diplomacy and multilateralism.
"Madeleine Albright is a true stateswoman and a global leader," said Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde. "Her appointment as Secretary of State is a testament to the values and ideals that America stands for, and is a signal of America's renewed commitment to multilateralism and cooperation with the international community."
Albright's confirmation as Secretary of State also represents a remarkable legacy for her father, Josef Korbel. Throughout his career in U.S. diplomacy and academia, Korbel was known for his commitment to democracy and human rights, and his belief in the power of diplomacy to resolve conflicts and build lasting peace.
As his daughter takes on her new role as the country's top diplomat, Josef Korbel's legacy lives on. His commitment to public service and international cooperation has been passed down to a new generation, and his daughter's appointment as Secretary of State is a testament to the enduring power of his ideas.
