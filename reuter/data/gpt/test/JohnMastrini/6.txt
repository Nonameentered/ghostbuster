Czech banks have received investment grade ratings from Standard and Poor's (S&P), in part due to the safety net provided by the state. This news is a significant milestone for the Czech financial sector, as it will strengthen the trust of international investors in the country's banks.
The S&P ratings for five Czech banks: Ceska Sporitelna, Komercni Banka, Raiffeisenbank, UniCredit Bank Czech Republic and Slovakia, and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, range from BBB+ to A-, which indicates a stable and strong financial position.
S&P highlights the government's support as a significant credit positive for the Czech banking system. The state deposit guarantee scheme, which provides insurance for deposits up to â‚¬100,000 per depositor, has significantly reduced mismatches between assets and liabilities in the banking sector. Additionally, the Czech central bank has established a liquidity facility that enables banks to borrow funds in times of crisis.
S&P also notes that the strong performance of the Czech economy has been a significant factor in the banks receiving investment grade ratings. The country's economy has grown at a rate of between 2.3% to 4.5% annually since 2015, which has contributed to the profitability of its banks.
Despite the ratings, some experts have raised concerns about the potential risks facing the Czech banking sector. Matej Bozicevic, an analyst at J&T Banka, warns that the low-interest-rate environment in Europe could squeeze profits in the long term, adding, "The real question is what happens when interest rates rise."
Bozicevic also calls on Czech banks to diversify their portfolios, as most of their lending is concentrated in housing and consumer loans. Diversification could help mitigate potential risks and improve profitability.
Overall, the news of the investment grade ratings is a welcome development for the Czech banking sector, as it will help attract more foreign investment and enable banks to access capital markets more easily. However, it's essential to keep in mind the potential challenges faced by the sector and work towards effective risk mitigation measures.
The Czech Republic is not the only country to have seen an improvement in rating. S&P has recently upgraded India's outlook to stable from negative and kept the country's rating unchanged at BBB-.
According to S&P, the sovereign credit rating had a stable outlook due to the country's strong growth prospects and solid external balances. Furthermore, the rating agency noted that India's economy had started to recover from the sharp contraction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and expected the economy to grow by 10% in the fiscal year ending March 2022.
The upgradation of India is a significant boost for the country's economy and will help increase investor confidence. India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted, "Shows India's economy "re-emerging" post COVID. The government is committed to reforms to boost economic growth," following S&P's rating upgrade.
