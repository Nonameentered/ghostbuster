Czech Prime Minister Criticizes National Bank's Attempt to Slow Inflation
The Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has criticized the central bank's recent actions to slow down inflation in the country. The Prime Minister accused the National Bank of overlooking the interests of the citizens and acting in its own interest by increasing interest rates.
In October, the National Bank of the Czech Republic (CNB) raised interest rates for the second time this year in an attempt to slow down inflation, which was 4.4% in September, up from 3.5% in August. The CNB had set the inflation target at 2% with a tolerance band of 1%.
Babis criticized the move, saying that the central bank was not taking into account the needs of the citizens, and that the hike in interest rates was hurting the economy. "They are increasing interest rates, and that leads to a slowdown in economic growth and lower investments," he said.
The Prime Minister added that a higher interest rate also meant that the cost of borrowing increased, making it difficult for people to take out loans and for businesses to access capital, which could slow down economic growth further.
The CNB defended its decision, saying that it was necessary to take action to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy. "We have a mandate to maintain price stability in the medium term, and we take that responsibility seriously," said CNB Governor Jiri Rusnok.
Rusnok also pointed out that inflation in the Czech Republic was largely driven by external factors, such as a rise in energy prices and food prices, which were beyond the control of the central bank. "We have to be careful not to let that inflation spill over into the broader economy and become a long-term problem," he said.
However, Babis argued that the CNB should have taken a more nuanced approach to inflation and not simply raised interest rates. He suggested that the bank could have used other tools, such as tightening financial regulations or increasing the reserve requirements for banks.
The Prime Minister's criticism of the central bank comes at a time when the Czech Republic is facing a number of economic challenges, including a shortage of labor and a slowdown in global trade. The economy grew by 2.7% in 2018, but the growth rate is expected to slow down to 2.3% in 2019.
The CNB has said that it will continue to monitor the situation and take action as required, but it has not ruled out further interest rate hikes in the future. The next meeting of the CNB's monetary policy board is scheduled for December, and the bank is expected to announce its decision on interest rates at that time.
In conclusion, the Czech Prime Minister's criticism of the National Bank's attempt to slow down inflation suggests that there is a difference of opinion regarding the best course of action for the Czech economy. While the CNB is focused on maintaining price stability, the Prime Minister is concerned about the impact of higher interest rates on economic growth. It remains to be seen how this debate will play out and what impact it will have on the Czech economy in the long term.
