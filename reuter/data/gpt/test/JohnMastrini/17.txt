The Czech National Bank (CNB) has expressed its displeasure over the continued firming of the Czech Crown in recent days. According to the bank, the currency has appreciated by 5% against the euro since the beginning of the year, which could have a negative impact on the country's economy.
The CNB suggested that it might intervene in the market to prevent the currency's further rise. In a statement released on Wednesday, the bank warned that the exchange rate of the Czech Crown could hamper the country's economic recovery, which is still ongoing after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The CNB's statement was issued after the currency had reached its strongest level against the euro in more than two years. The bank said that the appreciation of the Czech Crown, which has been driven by the recent weakening of the euro, could affect local exporters and reduce the attractiveness of the country as a destination for foreign investments.
The bank also expressed concern about the impact of the rising currency on inflation. The CNB's target inflation rate is 2%, which it has not been able to achieve since the end of 2019. The bank warned that the appreciation of the Czech Crown could cause a decline in inflation, making it even more difficult for the bank to reach its target.
The CNB said that it has been monitoring the situation closely and will take appropriate measures to prevent further appreciation of the currency. Although the bank did not specify what actions it might take, it suggested that it could intervene in the foreign exchange market to sell Czech Crowns.
The CNB has intervened in the foreign exchange market before. In 2013, the bank implemented a currency cap to prevent the Czech Crown from strengthening beyond a certain level. It abandoned the cap in 2017 when the currency became too strong to maintain.
The bank's intervention in the foreign exchange market is intended to stabilize the exchange rate of the Czech Crown and prevent excessive fluctuations that could harm the economy. The CNB said that it will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action if necessary to maintain economic stability.
The appreciation of the Czech Crown is a reflection of the euro's weakness, which has been caused by the European Central Bank's efforts to stimulate the eurozone economy. The CNB's warning follows a similar move by the Swiss National Bank, which has also expressed concern about the strength of its currency and the impact on its economy.
