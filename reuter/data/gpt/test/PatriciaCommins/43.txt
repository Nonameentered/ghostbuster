Einstein/Noah Bagels, the beloved chain known for its fresh-baked bagels and schmears, is set to become the dominant force in the consolidating bagel industry, according to industry analysts.
The company, which was founded in 1995 and merged with Noah’s Bagels in 2014, has quietly been expanding throughout the United States with its signature boiled-and-baked bagels and wide variety of toppings.
Now, industry analysts say Einstein/Noah Bagels is well-positioned to take over as the leading player in the bagel market following the bankruptcies of several competitors, including Bruegger’s Bagels and Manhattan Bagel.
"Amid a wave of consolidation and bankruptcy in the bagel industry, Einstein/Noah Bagels is uniquely positioned to become the dominant player,” said Matt Salzberg, CEO of venture capital firm Kitchen Fund and founder of meal kit company Blue Apron.
Salzberg said he sees Einstein/Noah Bagels as a strong contender to dominate the market because of its high-quality products, innovative menu offerings, and advanced technology platforms used for online ordering and delivery services.
"By making strategic investments in its products, technology, and distribution capabilities, Einstein/Noah Bagels has been able to build a strong brand and loyal customer base,” he said.
Salzberg noted that the bagel chain has been making significant investments in technology, including the rollout of its Order Ahead mobile app and WiFi-powered digital menu boards in stores across the country.
These investments have helped the brand stay ahead of competitors when it comes to convenience and accessibility, which are key factors in winning over consumers in today’s marketplace.
"Consumers are increasingly looking for fast, convenient, and affordable meal options, and Einstein/Noah Bagels is delivering on all fronts,” said Salzberg.
He pointed to the company’s diverse menu offerings, which include a wide range of bagel flavors, sandwiches, salads, and coffee drinks, as key factors in its success.
"Einstein/Noah Bagels has something for everyone, whether you’re a traditionalist who loves a classic everything bagel with cream cheese or a more adventurous eater who wants to try one of their unique sandwich combinations,” he said.
In addition to its strong products and technology platforms, the company has also been making strategic partnerships and acquisitions to further solidify its position in the market.
For example, in 2019, the company announced a partnership with Beyond Meat, which allowed it to offer plant-based breakfast sandwiches and bagels in select stores.
And in 2020, the company acquired Kettleman’s Bagel Co., a Canadian chain with 13 locations, which helped expand its presence in new markets.
Industry experts say other bagel chains will likely continue to either struggle or go bankrupt in the coming years, leaving Einstein/Noah Bagels well-positioned to capture even more market share.
"As the bagel market continues to evolve, I think we’re going to see Einstein/Noah Bagels stand out even more as the leader in quality, innovation, and customer experience,” said Salzberg.
He added that the brand has "all the pieces in place to become the go-to destination for bagels and beyond.”
