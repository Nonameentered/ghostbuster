A former executive of Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Mark Whitacre, is suing a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, Brian Shepard, for constitutional violations and assault and battery. According to Whitacre's lawyers, Shepard allegedly used excessive force during a 2016 arrest, which resulted in a broken arm and other injuries. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Urbana, Illinois, on June 1st.
Whitacre, 63, from Ohio, was a high-ranking executive at ADM in the 1990s. In 1995, he began working undercover for the FBI, exposing the company's price-fixing scheme. Eventually, Whitacre's cooperation led to criminal charges against ADM and several top executives, and he became famous for his role in the investigation.
However, years later, in 2009, Whitacre was sentenced to nine years in prison for embezzlement, fraud, and tax evasion. After serving almost eight years, he was released in 2016 and returned to Ohio.
According to Whitacre's lawyers, on September 20, 2016, Shepard and other FBI agents arrived at Whitacre's home to conduct a routine check-in with his probation officer. The lawsuit claims that Shepard assaulted Whitacre during the encounter, using excessive force while handcuffing him and causing him serious injuries.
The lawsuit accuses Shepard of violating Whitacre's rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution. Specifically, it alleges that Shepard used excessive force, conducted an unreasonable search and seizure, and deprived Whitacre of due process of law.
Whitacre's lawyers argue that Shepard had no probable cause to arrest Whitacre, and that the encounter was a pretext to intimidate and harass him.
“Mr. Shepard, as a sworn law enforcement officer, was required to follow the Constitution and obey the law, which he clearly failed to do,” said Robert A. Loeb, one of Whitacre's lawyers. “Mr. Whitacre has suffered significant physical and emotional injuries as a result of Mr. Shepard’s misconduct, and we’re confident that a jury will hold him accountable for his actions.”
The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for Whitacre's injuries, as well as attorneys' fees and other costs.
Shepard and the FBI have not yet responded to the lawsuit. However, in a court filing from 2018, the government denied Whitacre's allegations of excessive force and argued that Shepard acted reasonably and professionally.
Whitacre, who now works as a motivational speaker, has been criticized for his involvement in the ADM price-fixing scheme and his subsequent criminal conviction. However, he has also been praised for his cooperation with the FBI and for helping to expose corporate corruption.
As the lawsuit proceeds, the case is likely to attract attention from legal experts and civil liberties advocates who are concerned about police misconduct and violations of constitutional rights. The case may also shed light on the challenges faced by high-level executives who become whistleblowers and the risks they face from law enforcement and their former employers.
