Ralcorp Holdings Inc (RAL) has announced plans to cut costs and pursue acquisitions in order to achieve profitable growth. The food manufacturer, known for its private label products such as cereal, pasta and snacks, has been struggling to meet investor expectations following its spinoff from Conagra Brands in 2019.
In an effort to turn things around, RAL plans to reduce costs by $50 million over the next two years. This will involve consolidating production facilities, streamlining operations and reducing overhead expenses. The company is also looking to optimize its supply chain and investments in technology to increase efficiency and drive growth.
At the same time, RAL is actively seeking acquisition opportunities to expand its portfolio and customer base. The company has identified strategic areas for growth, including snacking, health and wellness, and premium products. RAL intends to use its strong balance sheet and cash position to fund potential acquisitions that align with its growth strategy.
"Our focus is on driving profitable growth through a combination of cost reductions and strategic acquisitions," said CEO Jeff Ettinger. "We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business and create value for our shareholders."
RAL's cost-cutting measures come as the food industry continues to face headwinds from rising commodity prices and supply chain disruptions. The company has already seen increases in raw material costs for key ingredients such as wheat and sugar, which have impacted its profit margins.
By reducing costs and pursuing strategic acquisitions, RAL hopes to position itself for growth in a challenging market. The company is also investing in innovation and marketing to drive sales of its existing products.
"We remain committed to delivering quality private label products that meet the needs of our customers and consumers," said Ettinger. "Through our focus on innovation and customer-centric strategies, we believe we can maintain our competitive edge and drive long-term growth for RAL."
Despite its challenges, RAL remains optimistic about its future. The company recently raised its full-year guidance and expects to deliver strong results in the coming quarters. By pursuing a balanced strategy of cost-cutting and growth, RAL aims to create value for its shareholders and establish itself as a leader in the private label food industry.
