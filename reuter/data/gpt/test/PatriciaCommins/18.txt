Roche Holding AG, a Swiss multinational healthcare company, has acquired Tastemaker, a US-based flavor and fragrance supplier, in a $1.1 billion deal. The acquisition was announced on Monday by Roche Holding AG, which is also known as Roche.
Two US chemical companies, Ashland Global Holdings Inc. and DuPont de Nemours Inc., sold Tastemaker to Roche as part of their ongoing efforts to streamline their businesses. Tastemaker is a leading supplier of flavors and fragrances to the food, beverage, and personal care industries.
"With this acquisition, Roche is expanding its expertise in the area of flavors and fragrances, which will benefit our customers and patients," said Severin Schwan, Roche's CEO. "We are excited to welcome Tastemakerâ€™s employees to the Roche family."
Tastemaker has a strong reputation for quality, innovation, and customer service, and its acquisition by Roche is expected to enhance Roche's offering to its customers. The acquisition is also expected to generate significant synergies and cost savings for both parties.
The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
"Tastemaker has been a leader in the flavors and fragrances industry for many years, and we are proud to have been a part of its success," said Guillermo Novo, Ashland's CEO. "This transaction will allow Ashland to focus on our core businesses and accelerate our growth strategy."
DuPont CEO Ed Breen said: "This deal is another step in our ongoing portfolio reshaping efforts, allowing us to focus on our high-growth, high-value businesses in materials science and biosciences."
Roche's acquisition of Tastemaker is the latest deal in a flurry of activity in the flavors and fragrances sector. In May, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. completed its acquisition of DuPont's Nutrition & Biosciences business for $26.2 billion. In June, German fragrance and flavors company Symrise acquired Sensient Technologies Corp.'s fragrance and aroma chemicals business for $900 million.
The flavors and fragrances industry is a multi-billion dollar global market, driven by demand from the food and beverage, consumer goods, and personal care industries. Companies in the sector are investing heavily in research and development to develop new and innovative flavors and fragrances that meet changing consumer preferences.
Roche Holding AG, which is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, is among the largest healthcare companies in the world. The company is known for developing innovative medicines, diagnostics, and personalized healthcare solutions. The acquisition of Tastemaker is expected to enhance the company's offering by providing a wide range of flavors and fragrances to its customers, such as pharmaceutical companies and food manufacturers.
