Hershey Foods Corp, the iconic American chocolate company, is planning to expand its presence in the sweet snack market. According to sources, the company is eyeing new acquisitions and product development to fuel its growth in this segment.
The move comes at a time when the demand for sweet snacks is on the rise worldwide, and the competition in the sector is intensifying. Hershey Foods is already a major player in the chocolate market, but its focus on sweet snacks is expected to diversify its portfolio and help it capture a bigger share of the market.
The company has already made some strategic acquisitions in the sweet snack segment in recent years. In 2018, Hershey acquired Amplify Snack Brands, a Texas-based maker of popcorn and other snacks, for $1.6 billion. This move helped the company gain access to the fast-growing market of salty snacks, and it has since been expanding its product offerings in this category.
Going forward, sources say Hershey is likely to look for more acquisitions in the sweet snack market. The company is said to be eyeing several targets, including startups and established players, that fit its strategic vision and portfolio.
Apart from acquisitions, Hershey is also looking to develop its own sweet snack products. The company has already launched several new snacks in the market, including Reese's snack cakes and Kit Kat Thins. These products have been well-received by consumers, and the company is likely to introduce more such products in the coming years.
Hershey is also investing heavily in research and development to create new and innovative sweet snack products. The company has set up a new innovation center in New York City, where its team of food scientists and researchers is working on new product ideas.
Analysts say Hershey's focus on sweet snacks is a smart move, given the changing consumer preferences and the growing competition in the chocolate market. The company has a strong brand, distribution network, and marketing expertise, which can help it make a mark in the sweet snack market as well.
Hershey's move into sweet snacks could also help it tap into new consumer segments, such as health-conscious consumers who are looking for healthier and more nutritious snacks. The company is reportedly exploring the use of plant-based ingredients and other healthy alternatives to traditional sweet snack ingredients.
Overall, Hershey Foods Corp's plans to expand into the sweet snack market are expected to drive its growth in the coming years. The company's focus on acquisitions, product development, and innovation could help it capture a bigger share of the market and stay ahead of the competition.
