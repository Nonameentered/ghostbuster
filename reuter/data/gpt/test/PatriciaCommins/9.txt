McDonald’s Corporation has reported another successful quarter, with strong profits despite lagging performance in the United States market. The fast-food company announced plans to scale back on restaurant expansion in an effort to focus on improving existing restaurant operations and menu offerings.
For the fourth quarter, McDonald’s reported a net income of $1.42 billion, or $1.82 per share, beating Wall Street’s expectations of $1.78 per share. However, the company’s comparable sales in the United States fell by 1.3%, while global comparable sales rose by 4.4%.
According to Chris Kempczinski, McDonald’s President and CEO, the company’s success in international markets helped offset weaker performance in the United States.
“Our results for the quarter reflect the broad-based strength of our global business, which continues to drive significant growth and value creation. While our growth in the U.S. was challenging, we continued to see strong performance across our international markets,” Kempczinski said.
In an effort to improve the company’s performance in the United States, McDonald’s announced plans to reduce the number of new restaurant openings in the country. The company currently plans to open around 400 new restaurants worldwide in 2020, with a focus on expanding in international markets rather than in the United States.
“We’ve been working to reset our growth trajectory in the U.S., and we’re making progress. As we look ahead to 2020, we’ll continue to prioritize investments in areas of the business that will drive sustainable, long-term growth,” Kempczinski said.
Rather than focusing on restaurant expansion, McDonald’s plans to invest in improving existing restaurants’ operations and menu offerings. Kempczinski said the company will prioritize improving the quality and speed of service, as well as rolling out new menu offerings and updates that better cater to customers’ evolving preferences.
One such menu update is McDonald’s recent addition of a plant-based burger, the McPlant, which is set to launch in 2021. The company also announced plans to introduce new bakery items, including apple fritters and blueberry muffins, to its breakfast menus starting in October.
Despite the challenges facing the fast-food industry in the United States, Kempczinski expressed optimism for McDonald’s future growth prospects.
“While the U.S. business faces near-term headwinds, we are taking actions to capture the long-term opportunities that I’m confident will position McDonald’s for sustained growth,” he said.
McDonald’s seems to be betting on international markets to drive growth, with plans to expand further into existing markets and enter new ones in 2020. The company currently has around 39,000 restaurants worldwide, with around 93% of those operated by franchisees.
McDonald’s earnings report comes amid broader concerns about the overall health of the fast-food industry in the United States. Several major chains, including Subway and Pizza Hut, have struggled with declining sales in recent years, while others, such as Chipotle, have seen growth slow.
The industry appears to be facing a number of headwinds, including competition from fast-casual and delivery-only restaurants, as well as changing consumer preferences for healthier and more sustainable food options. However, McDonald’s appears to be weathering these challenges better than most, thanks in large part to its strong international presence.
In its recent earnings call, McDonald’s reaffirmed its commitment to sustainability, including a promise to source 100% of its coffee, palm oil, and fish from sustainable sources by 2020. The company also said it is exploring alternative packaging solutions and working to reduce waste and improve energy efficiency across its operations.
While the fast-food industry in the United States may be facing some challenges, McDonald’s appears to be on a solid footing, with strong profits and a commitment to long-term growth and sustainability. By focusing on improving existing restaurants and expanding in international markets, the fast-food giant seems poised to thrive in the years to come.
