Minneapolis-based food giant General Mills is forecasting a recovery in the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market and is looking to capitalize on the trend with a slate of new product launches and tie-ins.
According to a company statement, General Mills is betting on a shift back to breakfast cereals and is planning a raft of new products to help boost sales in 2021.
The food manufacturer's cereal division is forecasting a positive outlook, citing an increase in consumer demand for healthy, convenient breakfast options in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
"We believe that the current environment is creating new opportunities for cereal brands like General Mills," said Jeff Harmening, chairman, and CEO of General Mills.
"We are confident that we have the right brands, the right innovation, and the right strategy to capitalize on these opportunities and win in the cereal category."
The maker of Cheerios and Lucky Charms, General Mills, and its peers faced an uphill battle in 2020 as fewer Americans headed to the office and school closures led to a drop in demand for on-the-go breakfast options.
However, the company's Q1 earnings report suggested that Americans may be returning to their pre-pandemic habits, with sales of cereal up 10 percent in the quarter, outstripping the growth in other food categories.
Furthermore, General Mills' economists are forecasting a 2 percent increase in breakfast cereal consumption in 2021, an improvement on last year's flat growth.
To capitalize on the predicted rebound, General Mills is launching a range of new breakfast products, including Cinnamon Cheerios, Lucky Charms Honey Clovers, and Marshmallow Froot Loops.
The cereal giant is also looking to extend the reach of its established brands with a series of tie-ins, including a partnership with children's publisher Little Golden Books.
The collaboration will see some of General Mills' most popular cereal brands adorned with classic children's book illustrations, such as I Can Fly and  The Little Red Hen.
The Little Golden Books tie-up is just one in a series of licensing agreements that General Mills is currently pursuing, and the company has said that it expects such deals to help revive consumer interest in classic cereal brands.
"We want to make sure that we are creating something that consumers will find exciting and that will motivate them to buy our products," Harmening said.
"Whether it's a new product launch or a tie-in with a well-loved brand, we're committed to giving our customers the breakfast choices they want." 
General Mills' renewed focus on cereal comes as the breakfast sector is awash with new product launches. Kellogg's recently unveiled a range of plant-based protein cereals, while Nestle's Cereals division is expanding into the U.S. with its Lion, Golden Grahams, and Shredded Wheat brands.
Despite the increased competition, General Mills is confident that its established brands, combined with its upcoming releases and licensing agreements, will help the company recover lost market share.
"We have a long history of innovation in the breakfast category, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to provide exciting new cereal options for consumers," Harmening said. 
As the world slowly emerges from the pandemic, General Mills is banking on a shift back to breakfast cereals to fuel its comeback, and with a host of new products and licensing partnerships in the works, it appears that the food giant is well-placed to cement its position as one of the leading players in the sector.
