General Mills earnings rise despite drop in sales and domestic cereal volume
General Mills, the multinational food company, reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, which ended on Feb. 28, despite a drop in sales and domestic cereal volume. The company, which makes popular brands such as Cheerios, Lucky Charms, and Wheaties, has been able to increase its profitability by cutting costs and investing in higher-margin products, such as pet food and snacks.
The company's net earnings rose to $595 million, or 97 cents per share, from $454 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. This exceeded the average analyst estimate of 89 cents per share. However, General Mills' net sales dropped 8% to $4.18 billion in the quarter, down from $4.51 billion a year ago. The company blamed this decline on weak demand for its cereals in North America and challenges in international markets, particularly in Brazil.
The North American retail segment, which makes up a majority of General Mills' sales, saw a 10% decline in net sales to $2.3 billion. The company attributed this drop to lower volume sales for its cereal and yogurt products. However, the segment's operating profit increased by 7%, thanks to cost savings measures and the shift towards higher-margin products, such as snacks and baking mixes.
The pet segment, which includes brands such as Blue Buffalo, saw a 22% increase in net sales to $436 million, driven by strong demand for pet food. The convenience stores and foodservice segment also saw a 19% increase in net sales to $498 million, thanks to strong sales of snacks and frozen food.
General Mills' CEO, Jeff Harmening, said in a statement, "We delivered another strong quarter of profit growth and increased our cash returns to shareholders. We remain focused on driving long-term shareholder value through disciplined execution of our global growth priorities while also managing costs and cash."
The company's focus on cost-cutting and higher-margin products has helped it weather the decline in sales of cereal, which has been struggling in recent years due to changing consumer preferences and increased competition from other breakfast options, such as yogurt, granola bars, and breakfast sandwiches.
General Mills has been investing in digital marketing and product innovation to try and attract younger consumers and meet current trends. This includes reformulating its products to remove artificial colors and flavors, as well as launching new products such as Cheerios Oat Crunch and Lucky Charms Frosted Flakes.
While General Mills' earnings have risen, some analysts are concerned about the long-term sustainability of the company's strategy, particularly as it faces increasing pressure from private label brands and lower-priced competitors. The company also faces challenges in international markets, particularly in Europe, where it has struggled to gain market share.
However, General Mills remains optimistic about its future prospects and is continuing to make investments in growth areas. The company recently acquired Blue Buffalo, a premium pet food brand, and is planning to expand its presence in the fast-growing natural pet food market.
"We're taking a portfolio approach to our business, investing for growth in categories and geographies where we see the greatest potential for long-term value creation," said Harmening.
Overall, despite the drop in sales and domestic cereal volume, General Mills' quarterly earnings have exceeded expectations, thanks to its focus on cost-cutting and higher-margin products. The company's ability to adapt to changing consumer trends and invest in growth areas bodes well for its future prospects.
