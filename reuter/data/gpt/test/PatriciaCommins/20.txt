Chicago-based Quaker Oats reported a profitable fourth quarter on Thursday, but the company's Snapple business posted another unprofitable quarter.
Quaker Oats, which also owns brands like Gatorade and Tropicana, saw net income rise to $355 million in the quarter ending June 30, up from $301 million in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per share were $1.02, compared with 88 cents last year.
The company's revenue rose 1.4% to $2.53 billion in the quarter as sales increased for its beverages and snacks. Quaker Oats said Gatorade continued to see strong growth during the quarter, while Tropicana's sales were hurt by competition and lower pricing.
However, the company's Snapple business, which it acquired in 1994 for $1.7 billion, continued to struggle. Snapple's operating profit fell 38% to $12 million in the quarter, down from $19 million during the same period last year. Snapple's sales fell 6% during the quarter to $219 million, driven largely by weaker performance in North America.
Quaker Oats said it was continuing to invest in Snapple, but did not provide any further details.
"We are pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance, led by continued growth in Gatorade and improvement in our food business overall," said Quaker Oats CEO Mark Smucker in a statement. "We are committed to investing in our brands to drive future growth and to delivering high-quality, innovative products that meet the evolving needs of our consumers."
Quaker Oats has been investing heavily in its snack food business in recent years, including expanding the reach of its Quaker Chewy granola bars and introducing new flavors of Quaker rice crisps.
The company is also in the process of launching a direct-to-consumer business, which will allow customers to order Quaker products online for home delivery.
"Looking ahead, we remain committed to executing on our long-term growth strategy, which includes driving innovation, expanding our footprint in snacking, and building new e-commerce capabilities," Smucker said.
Quaker Oats' results came as other food companies reported mixed earnings for the quarter. Mondelez International, which owns brands like Oreo and Cadbury, said its revenue fell 1.7% in the quarter due to currency headwinds and weaker-than-expected sales in China. However, its earnings beat analysts' expectations thanks to cost-cutting efforts.
Meanwhile, PepsiCo reported strong results, with net income rising to $2.04 billion in the quarter, up from $1.82 billion last year. The company's Frito-Lay division, which includes brands like Lay's and Doritos, continued to drive growth.
Overall, the food and beverage industry is facing challenges as consumer tastes and preferences shift away from traditional products. Many companies are investing in healthier options and expanding their portfolios to include more snack products.
Quaker Oats said it was taking steps to respond to these trends, including developing new products that meet changing consumer needs.
"We recognize that the food and beverage industry is changing, and we are focused on staying ahead of the curve," Smucker said. "We are committed to being a leader in providing high-quality, nutritious food and beverages that people can feel good about consuming."
