BAB Holdings Inc. has announced plans to expand its national presence through the acquisition of independent bagel chains across the United States.
The Chicago-based company, which already owns popular breakfast restaurant chains such as Le Peep and Egg Works, is looking to further solidify itself as a major player in the breakfast and brunch industry.
"Bagels have been a staple of breakfast for decades, and with the rising popularity of brunch culture, we see a great opportunity to expand our reach and offer customers even more options," said CEO of BAB Holdings Inc., John Smith.
The acquisition strategy will involve buying up individual bagel shops that fit the company's strict criteria, such as those with a loyal customer base, strong brand identity, and high-quality products. BAB Holdings Inc. plans to use its existing resources and expertise to enhance the acquired businesses and bring them into the company's portfolio of successful breakfast brands.
The move comes as the gourmet breakfast industry continues to grow in popularity, with millennials and younger generations leading the trend. According to market research firm NPD Group, breakfast and brunch are among the fastest-growing segments of the restaurant industry, with sales increasing by 31% since 2011.
BAB Holdings Inc.'s decision to focus on bagels specifically reflects a wider shift in consumer preferences towards artisanal, customizable, and locally-sourced food products.
"Our aim is to offer customers a great bagel experience that they'll want to come back for time and time again," Smith explained.
The company has already begun the acquisition process, with negotiations underway for several bagel chains across the country. While the specific locations have not yet been confirmed, BAB Holdings Inc. has expressed a desire to expand into both metropolitan and suburban areas.
"We want to bring the tastes and flavors of quality, authentic bagels to as many communities as we can," said Smith.
The expansion plans have been well-received by industry experts, who predict that BAB Holdings Inc.'s existing success within the breakfast industry will help them to thrive in this new venture.
"Bagels are an iconic breakfast food, and the demand for artisanal, fresh, and customizable options is only going to continue growing," said food industry analyst Sarah Johnson. "BAB Holdings Inc.'s acquisition strategy is a smart move that will only increase their foothold in the market."
With the breakfast and brunch industry continuing to soar, BAB Holdings Inc.'s expansion into bagels looks set to make them a major player in the restaurant world. As consumers increasingly seek out innovative and high-quality dining experiences, the company's focus on locally-sourced ingredients, quality products, and exceptional customer service is sure to prove a winning formula.
