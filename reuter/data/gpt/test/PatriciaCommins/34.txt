The transaction will make ReliaStar Financial Corp. a stronger, more diversified player in the insurance market and marks a significant expansion of their service portfolio.
The acquisition comes after months of negotiations between the two companies and was made possible by the strength of ReliaStar Financial's balance sheet and the positive outlook for the insurance industry. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, and ReliaStar Financial has announced plans to integrate Security-Connecticut Corp.'s operations into their own in the coming months.
"Joining forces with Security-Connecticut Corp. is an important step forward for ReliaStar Financial and represents a significant opportunity for growth," said James Kauer, CEO of ReliaStar Financial Corp. "We share a commitment to providing high-quality insurance products and services to our customers and are excited about the potential to leverage our combined strengths to better serve our clients."
Security-Connecticut Corp., founded in 1947, is a leading provider of life, health, and disability insurance products with a strong focus on the group market.

"Our two companies share a culture of putting customers first, and we believe that the combined resources and expertise of our organizations will enable us to deliver even greater value to our policyholders."
The $488 million price tag for the acquisition is based on the current market value of ReliaStar Financial's stock and represents a premium of about 20 percent over Security-Connecticut Corp.'s current market value.
