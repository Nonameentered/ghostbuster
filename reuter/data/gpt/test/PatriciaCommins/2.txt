The breakfast cereal industry is seeing a major shakeup as price wars between major cereal makers are taking a toll on their earnings. Kellogg, General Mills, and Post Holdings have all reported a decline in sales and profits in their latest quarterly reports.
The price wars began when private-label cereal brands started gaining traction among cost-conscious consumers. These brands offered similar quality products at a significantly lower price, eating into the market share of the major cereal makers.
In response to this, the major cereal makers decided to slash their prices in order to compete. This move, however, has not helped their bottom line as it has resulted in a price war that has hurt sales and profits.
Kellogg, for instance, reported a 3% decline in sales in their most recent quarter, with earnings per share falling by 10% from the same quarter last year. The company attributes this decline to increased promotional spending to drive sales and a drag from price reductions.
General Mills fared no better, with their latest quarterly report showing a 5% drop in net sales and a 7% decline in earnings per share. The company cited increased competition in the cereal category, higher input costs, and lower pricing for cereals as the main reasons for their weak results.
Post Holdings, the maker of Honey Bunches of Oats and Fruity Pebbles, also saw a decline in sales and profits in their latest quarterly report. The company cited lower volumes and lower net selling prices as the primary reasons for their weaker-than-expected results.
With sales declining and profits falling, the cereal makers are considering their options. Some are looking to diversify their product lines, while others are considering a pivot towards healthier breakfast options, such as granola or yogurt.
Kellogg, for instance, recently introduced a line of plant-based snack bars and is experimenting with non-dairy milk options. Similarly, General Mills is investing in healthier options like organic and gluten-free cereals as well as snacks such as cheddar cheese crackers and yogurt.
While the move towards healthier options may help these companies in the long run, it may be too little, too late. The breakfast market has become increasingly diverse, with consumers opting for a range of options from smoothie bowls to avocado toast.
Additionally, the cost-conscious consumer is unlikely to return to the higher-priced cereals of the past, making it difficult for these companies to regain lost ground. Private-label brands that offer similar quality products at a lower price are likely to continue to grow in popularity.
In conclusion, the price wars in the breakfast cereal industry have hurt major cereal makers' earnings. The increase in competition from private-label brands has eaten into their market share, leading to lower sales and profits. While diversifying towards healthier options may help these companies in the long run, it may not be enough to regain lost ground. The breakfast market is evolving, and cereal makers need to adapt to keep up.
