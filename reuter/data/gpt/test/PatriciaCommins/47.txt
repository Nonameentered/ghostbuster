Chicago-based kosher seafood company Vita Food Products Inc is looking to make a big splash in the market by boosting its sales four-fold in the next five years through acquisitions. This move comes as the company seeks to expand its presence through diversifying their product offerings.
Vita Food Products Inc has been a leading producer of kosher seafood products since its inception in 1918. They have established themselves as a trusted name in the seafood industry and are known for their commitment to quality and authentic taste.
The company has already started exploring potential acquisition targets to achieve their ambitious growth targets. According to sources, Vita Food Products Inc is primarily looking for companies in the seafood industry that can complement their existing product range and offer synergies in operations and distribution.
In an interview, Vita Food Products Inc’s President and CEO David Horowitz said, “We believe that acquisitions are an effective way to accelerate our growth and expand our product offerings. By strategically acquiring other seafood companies, we can achieve our goal of increasing our sales four-fold in five years.”
Vita Food Products Inc is not limiting its search to traditional seafood companies. They are also open to exploring opportunities in related sectors such as condiments, sauces, and spices that can enhance the flavor profiles of their existing products.
Horowitz added, “We are not only looking for companies that can bring new products to our portfolio but also those that can offer us unique capabilities like R&D, food science, and innovation.”
The move comes at a time when the global seafood industry is in a state of flux, with changing consumer preferences, new regulatory norms, and supply chain disruptions due to the ongoing pandemic. By consolidating their strengths through acquisitions, Vita Food Products Inc aims to stay ahead of the curve and capitalize on emerging market trends.
The company expects to finalize its acquisition strategy in the coming months and start evaluating potential targets soon. Vita Foods is confident that the right acquisitions will take them to the next level as they continue serving the kosher seafood market.
