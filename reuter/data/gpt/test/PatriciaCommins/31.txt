Chicago-based company Wm. Wrigley Jr Co is seeking new ways to revive its domestic chewing gum market. The company, which is currently owned by Mars Inc, has been facing falling sales in the US as consumers shift towards mints and other breath fresheners.
According to market research firm IRI, US sales of gum fell by 11.6% between 2014 and 2018, while sales of mints rose by 19.6% during the same period. Wrigley's leading brand, Extra, saw its sales fall by 16.6% in 2018.
To counter this trend, Wrigley is taking a multi-faceted approach to revitalizing its brand. The company has adopted a digital-first marketing strategy, partnering with influencers on social media and using targeted advertising campaigns to reach younger consumers.
Wrigley is also introducing new products, such as Sugarfree Extra Refreshers, which are marketed as a cross between a mint and a gum. The company has also experimented with non-traditional flavors, such as watermelon and grapefruit.
In addition, Wrigley is focusing on improving the in-store experience for customers. The company is working with retailers to optimize gum displays and make them more prominent in stores. Wrigley is also exploring new distribution channels, such as vending machines and online sales.
Despite these efforts, Wrigley is facing stiff competition from other gum and mint brands. Mondelez International's Trident brand has seen sales growth in recent years, while Mars' own Altoids mints have also seen increases.
Wrigley's success in reviving its domestic market will depend on its ability to innovate and differentiate itself from its competitors. With its digital-first approach and focus on new product development and in-store experience, the company is taking the right steps towards reversing its declining sales.
