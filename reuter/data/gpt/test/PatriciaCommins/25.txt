Michael Foods Inc, a leading producer of eggs and egg-based products, is considering divesting its potato operation. This includes its frozen french fries and refrigerated potatoes business due to the company's strategic focus on its core business.
The move comes after a comprehensive review of Michael Foods' business strategy, led by the executive management team. The review identified the potato operation as a potential candidate for divestiture, as it is not aligned with the company's growth strategy.
"We are focusing our resources on our core egg and egg-based product lines," said Sue Steely, President of Michael Foods. "This includes investing in new technology, expanding our global reach, and driving innovation in our product portfolio. As part of this strategy, we are exploring the potential divestiture of our potato operation."
Michael Foods' potato operation includes a strong portfolio of frozen french fries and refrigerated potatoes. The company's products are sold to foodservice customers and retail customers in the United States and Canada.
The potential divestiture of the potato operation would allow Michael Foods to streamline its operations and focus on its core business. The company will continue to operate its egg and egg-based product lines, which include shell eggs, liquid eggs, and egg products.
The divestiture of the potato operation is subject to market conditions, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Michael Foods has not yet announced a timeline for the potential divestiture.
Michael Foods is a subsidiary of Post Holdings, Inc., a publicly-traded food and beverage holding company. The company's portfolio of brands includes Post Cereals, Weetabix, and PowerBar, among others.
In conclusion, the potential divestiture of Michael Foods' potato operation is in line with the company's strategic focus on its core business of eggs and egg-based products. The move will allow the company to streamline its operations and focus on driving growth in its core business lines.
