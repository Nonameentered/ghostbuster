Fast food restaurants unaffected by minimum wage increase, but long-term impact feared
The recent minimum wage increase in several states across the U.S. has left many fast food workers hopeful for better wages. However, early indicators suggest that fast food restaurants are not struggling to absorb the increase in labor costs.
A recent survey conducted by the National Restaurant Association found that the majority of restaurant operators have not reported any significant changes in labor costs, but expressed concerns about the long-term impact on their businesses.
“The immediate impact of the minimum wage increase on fast food restaurants has been minimal,” said John Bertolini, a restaurant industry analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
Bertolini added that fast food restaurants like McDonald’s and Burger King are likely to absorb the additional labor costs by cutting down on employee hours and increasing automation. Many companies have already introduced self-service kiosks and mobile apps that allow customers to place their orders without the need for a cashier.
“Fast food restaurants are looking for more efficient ways to process orders and serve their customers,” Bertolini said. “They cannot afford to absorb the increased labor costs by simply increasing prices.”
Proponents of the minimum wage increase argue that it will help reduce income inequality and boost the economy by putting more money in the hands of low-wage workers.
But critics argue that it will lead to job loss and higher prices for consumers.
A report by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a $15 minimum wage would result in 1.3 million job losses by 2025, but lift 1.3 million people out of poverty and increase the earnings of 17 million people.
“The long-term impact of the minimum wage increase on fast food restaurants is uncertain,” Bertolini said. “If the increase continues to rise, it could lead to job losses and higher prices for consumers.”
A study by the University of California Berkeley found that a $15 minimum wage would lead to a 4.3% increase in prices at fast food restaurants, but would also increase the average wage of employees by 23.4%.
“Fast food restaurants may be able to absorb the initial increase in labor costs, but it will become more difficult if the increase continues to rise,” Bertolini said.
In the meantime, fast food workers are continuing to fight for better wages and benefits. The Fight for $15 movement has been advocating for a $15 minimum wage and union rights for fast food workers since 2012.
“The minimum wage increase is just the beginning,” said Terrence Wise, a fast food worker and leader of the Fight for $15 movement. “We are fighting for a living wage and respect on the job.”
