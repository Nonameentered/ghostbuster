Kmart Corporation, one of the world's largest retailers, announced on Monday that it may merge its Builders Square stores with HomeBase, a subsidiary of Waban Inc. The move is expected to create the third largest home improvement chain in the country, rivaling Home Depot and Lowe's, which currently hold the first and second spots respectively.
The proposed merger follows months of discussions between Kmart and Waban's management teams. The companies reportedly see the move as an opportunity to expand their share in the home improvement market, which is thriving due to a strong economy and low interest rates.
"Combining our strengths with HomeBase will allow us to offer customers an unparalleled shopping experience while capturing significant market share," said Floyd Hall, Kmart's Chairman and CEO. "We believe this move will create value for our shareholders and drive growth for our company."
According to industry experts, the merger will give Kmart access to HomeBase's well-established brand name, which has a loyal customer base and a robust product line. Builders Square, on the other hand, has struggled to gain traction in the market due to increased competition and declining sales.
"A merger with HomeBase will provide Kmart with access to a much stronger brand name and customer base," said Neil Saunders, Managing Director at GlobalData Retail. "It will also help Kmart move away from the discount image that has plagued it for years."
Under the proposed merger, Kmart will acquire HomeBase's 90 stores and merge them with its 95 Builders Square locations. The new company will be rebranded under the HomeBase name.
Waban, the parent company of HomeBase, will own a 20% stake in the new company and receive $400 million in cash as part of the deal. The remaining 80% will be owned by Kmart shareholders.
The merger is expected to generate significant cost savings for the new company through increased buying power and streamlined operations. However, some analysts have expressed concern about the challenges of integrating two distinct retail cultures.
"The biggest challenge will be integrating the two companies' systems and operations," said Saunders. "Retail culture is also a big factor, and Kmart will need to work to maintain HomeBase's brand identity and customer service reputation."
The move is the latest in a series of strategic initiatives aimed at turning around Kmart's fortunes. The company has struggled to compete with online retailers in recent years and has faced numerous financial challenges.
In 2018, Kmart sold its Craftsman line of tools to Stanley Black & Decker for $900 million as part of an effort to reduce debt and improve profitability. The company has also been closing unprofitable stores and investing in e-commerce initiatives to compete with Amazon and other online retailers.
The proposed merger with HomeBase is subject to approval by both companies' shareholders and regulatory authorities. If approved, the merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
The news of the potential merger was welcomed by analysts and investors, with Kmart's stock price rising by 5% in early trading on Monday.
"This is a positive move for Kmart," said Saunders. "It shows that the company is willing to take bold steps to turn around its business and compete in a rapidly changing retail environment."
