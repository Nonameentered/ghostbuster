CPC International Corporation, a leading American food company, recently announced that it will be spinning off its corn refining operations into a separate public company. This move comes as part of the company's efforts to focus on its core consumer food businesses.
According to CPC's CEO John B. Sanfilippo, the decision to spin off its corn refining operations was based on a careful review of the company's portfolio and strategic direction. He said, "We believe that this move will allow us to sharpen our focus on our core consumer food businesses and create more value for our shareholders."
CPC's corn refining operations include the production of high-fructose corn syrup, corn starch, and other corn-derived products. These operations generated over $1.5 billion in revenue for the company in 2020 and employ around 2,000 people.
The new publicly traded company that will be created following the spin-off will be named Corn Products International, Inc. Sanfilippo said that the new company will have a strong financial position and will be well-positioned to compete in the global corn refining market.
CPC's consumer food businesses include the production of snacks, cereals, and other packaged foods that are sold under brands such as Snyder's of Hanover, Lance, and Kettle Brand. These businesses generated over $3.5 billion in revenue for the company in 2020 and employ around 6,000 people.
Sanfilippo said that CPC's consumer food businesses have been performing well and that the company sees significant growth opportunities in this area. He said, "We are committed to investing in and growing our consumer food businesses, and we believe that this focus will drive long-term value for our shareholders."
The spin-off is expected to be completed by mid-2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Following the spin-off, CPC shareholders will own shares in both CPC and Corn Products International.
The announcement of the spin-off was welcomed by investors, with CPC's share price rising by over 10% following the news. Analysts also expressed optimism about the move, with many highlighting the potential benefits of a more focused and streamlined business strategy.
CPC is not the only food company that has recently announced plans to spin off non-core operations. Other companies, such as Kraft Heinz and Conagra Brands, have also made similar moves in recent years as they seek to focus on their core businesses and improve their financial performance.
The food industry has faced significant challenges in recent years as consumers have become more health-conscious and demand for certain products has declined. In response, many food companies have sought to diversify their product offerings or focus on healthier options.
Sanfilippo acknowledged these challenges but expressed confidence in CPC's ability to adapt and thrive in a changing market. He said, "The food industry is constantly evolving, and we are committed to staying ahead of the curve. By focusing on our consumer food businesses and investing in innovation and technology, we believe that we can continue to grow and succeed in the years ahead."
Overall, CPC's decision to spin off its corn refining operations and focus on consumer foods reflects a broader trend in the food industry. The move is expected to create value for shareholders and position the company for long-term success in a rapidly changing market.
