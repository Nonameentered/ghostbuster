McDonald's, the world's largest fast-food chain, announced the launch of a nationwide promotion on Monday, offering sandwiches for just 55 cents in a bid to attract more customers and beat its competition.
The promotion is set to begin on Tuesday and will run through the end of the week. The deal applies to select sandwiches, including the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with cheese, and Filet-O-Fish.
According to McDonald's, the promotion is aimed at celebrating the restaurant's 55th anniversary, as the first McDonald's restaurant opened its doors in Des Plaines, Illinois on April 15, 1955.
“We're proud to serve 3.5 million customers daily, and want to celebrate our 55th anniversary with them by offering sandwiches at a price they’ll love,” said Tom Dooney, Chief Marketing Officer for McDonald's USA.
McDonald's is hoping that the promotion will boost its sales in the face of stiff competition from other fast-food chains, such as Burger King and Wendy's.
Last year, McDonald's reported a 1.1% decline in U.S. sales, while Burger King and Wendy's saw respective 2.2% and 0.8% increases.
McDonald's is also facing competition from newer fast-food chains like Shake Shack and Five Guys, which have gained popularity in recent years due to their focus on higher-quality ingredients and customizable menus.
To compete with these newer chains, McDonald's has been revamping its menu in recent years, adding items like premium burgers and chicken sandwiches made with antibiotic-free chicken.
In addition to menu changes, the company has been testing new store designs, such as those with digital kiosks allowing customers to place their own orders, as well as delivery services in partnership with UberEats.
Despite these efforts, McDonald's has struggled to maintain its dominance in the fast-food industry, and has seen its market share decline in recent years.
According to food industry consultant Brad Haley, the 55-cent sandwich promotion is a smart move for McDonald's, as it will drive traffic to the restaurants and give customers a reason to try the revamped menu.
“This is a great way to get people back into McDonald's,” Haley said. “Even if they only come in to get a 55-cent sandwich, they're going to see other things on the menu and might be enticed to try something new.”
However, some restaurant analysts have questioned the long-term effectiveness of promotions like this, citing the need for McDonald's to offer sustainable value rather than just temporary discounts.
“Promotions like this can drive short-term traffic, but they don't necessarily lead to long-term customer loyalty,” said Darren Tristano, CEO of restaurant consulting firm Foodservice Results.
“McDonald's needs to focus on offering better-quality food and service, and creating a more modern and comfortable dining experience if it wants to compete in the increasingly crowded fast-food market.”
McDonald's is planning to roll out additional menu changes and store redesigns in the coming months, in an effort to stay relevant and appeal to a wider range of customers.
However, for now, the 55-cent sandwich promotion is the focus of the company's attention, as it seeks to win back customers and beat the competition.
