Kellogg’s iconic cereal brand, Frosted Flakes, has made a new stride into the international market with the launch of chocolate-flavored Frosted Flakes in China, India, and Thailand. More excitingly, the trademark brand ambassador, Tony the Tiger, will be at the forefront of this global expansion.
Tony the Tiger has been an integral part of the cereal brand since 1952, and his presence has been key in establishing Frosted Flakes as a beloved breakfast staple. The launch of the chocolate version is expected to further enhance the popularity of the cereal brand in the Asian market.
The introduction of the new flavor was done with a flair in China, where Tony the Tiger and the Kellogg’s team went all out to promote the Frosted Flakes Chocolate launch. A larger-than-life Tony was on display in a mall in Shanghai, where he danced and posed with fans of all ages, drawing in crowds by the dozens.
The chocolate flavor is also expected to be a welcome addition in India and Thailand, where chocolate-based breakfast items have been in high demand. The launch will open new horizons for Frosted Flakes, introducing it to a broader audience and reinforcing its position as one of the most recognizable cereal brands in the world.
“The global launch of Frosted Flakes Chocolate is a testament to the enduring appeal of the brand and our ability to innovate and meet the evolving taste preferences of consumers in different parts of the world,” said Chris Hood, President Asia Pacific, Kellogg Company. “We are excited to introduce consumers in China, India, and Thailand to the delicious taste of Frosted Flakes in a popular new flavor.”
According to Kellogg’s, the chocolate-flavored Frosted Flakes will contain all of the nutritional value and vitamins that the original brand is known for, making it a healthy and enjoyable breakfast option. The cereal is made with whole grain and fortified with vitamins and minerals, making it an excellent source of iron and fiber.
The launch of Frosted Flakes Chocolate follows the brand’s recent successful expansion into the Mexican market, where the cereal has become a popular breakfast option for families and children. The launch in China, India, and Thailand is a significant milestone for Kellogg’s as it seeks to expand its brand’s reach and establish itself as a leading breakfast provider in the Asian market.
Kellogg’s is optimistic that the chocolate flavor will resonate well with consumers in Asia, as it combines two of the most popular flavors in the world – chocolate and cornflakes. The company has also launched a comprehensive marketing campaign, which will utilize various platforms and mediums to reach consumers across different age groups and markets in the three countries.
“We are excited about the potential of Frosted Flakes Chocolate in the Asian market, and we look forward to seeing how consumers will receive it,” said Hood. “We are committed to providing our customers with delicious and nutritious breakfast options, and with the launch of Frosted Flakes Chocolate, we are confident that we can deliver on our promise.”
The launch of Frosted Flakes Chocolate in China, India, and Thailand is the first step in Kellogg’s ambitious plans to expand its breakfast offerings in the Asian market. With its iconic brand and solid reputation for providing nutritious and tasty foods, the cereal brand is well-positioned to tap into the growing demand for healthy, ready-to-eat breakfast options in the region. The future of Kellogg’s in Asia looks bright, and Tony the Tiger is likely to play a significant role in the cereal brand’s future expansion plans.
