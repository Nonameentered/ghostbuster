Minneapolis, Minnesota – ReliaStar Financial Corp has recently announced its acquisition of Security-Connecticut Corp for $488 million in a stock-for-stock transaction. The acquisition is expected to greatly expand ReliaStar’s presence in the life insurance and annuities markets, cementing its position as one of the leading providers of financial products in the United States.
The deal is expected to provide benefits to both companies, with ReliaStar gaining access to Security-Connecticut’s strong distribution network and deep expertise in fixed annuities. Security-Connecticut, on the other hand, will be able to take advantage of the scale and resources available to ReliaStar, allowing it to grow more quickly and effectively than it would be able to do on its own.
“ReliaStar is delighted to announce this acquisition,” said Brian Shea, CEO of ReliaStar. “We believe that the combination of our two companies will allow us to better serve our customers, and to continue to grow and expand our presence in the financial services industry.”
The acquisition of Security-Connecticut is part of a broader strategy by ReliaStar to expand its business in key areas, such as annuities, life insurance, and retirement services. The company has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions and partnerships in recent years, with the aim of enhancing its capabilities and building a stronger platform for growth.
“We are excited to welcome Security-Connecticut to the ReliaStar family,” said Shea. “Together, we will be able to build on our strengths, and to offer our customers an even broader range of financial products and services. We believe that this acquisition is a clear signal of our commitment to the financial services industry, and to the continued growth and success of ReliaStar.”
The acquisition is still subject to regulatory approval, but it is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Once the deal is finalized, Security-Connecticut will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ReliaStar, and its operations will be integrated into ReliaStar’s existing business.
The acquisition of Security-Connecticut is just the latest in a string of major mergers and acquisitions in the financial services industry. The industry has been rapidly consolidating in recent years, as companies seek to build scale and increase their market share in an increasingly competitive landscape.
ReliaStar is well positioned to benefit from this trend, with its strong balance sheet, deep expertise in the financial products industry, and ambitious growth plans. By adding Security-Connecticut to its portfolio, the company is taking a major step towards becoming one of the dominant players in the industry, and positioning itself for long-term success and growth.
