Cathay Pacific Airways to Increase Daily Flights to the Philippines Due to Surging Demand 

Cathay Pacific Airways announced today that it will be increasing the number of daily flights from Hong Kong to Manila, Philippines starting in October this year. The airline will go from operating 14 flights per week to 21 flights per week to meet the growing demand for travel between the two cities.

Cathay Pacific has seen a steady increase in passenger volume for its Hong Kong to Manila route over the past few years. The additional weekly flights aim to provide more options and flexibility for passengers traveling for both business and leisure. 

"The Philippines is an important market for Cathay Pacific and expanding our services to Manila reflects the increasing demand for high-quality air travel in the region," said Ronald Lam, Cathay Pacific’s Chief Customer and Commercial Officer. "We are very pleased to be able to provide even more convenient flight options for our customers traveling between Hong Kong and Manila."

The seven new flights will operate on Sundays, Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, using Cathay Pacific’s Airbus A330-300 aircraft. The additional flights provide an extra 1,400 seats per week on the route. Travelers will be able to connect to Cathay Pacific’s many destinations across Asia, Australia, North America and Europe via its hub at Hong Kong International Airport.

Manila has become an increasingly popular travel destination, with visitor arrivals growing over 13% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period last year. Cathay Pacific’s additional flights are poised to benefit from the steady influx of tourists as well as the strong trade and business links between Hong Kong and the Philippines. The new flight schedule will commence on October 27, 2019.
