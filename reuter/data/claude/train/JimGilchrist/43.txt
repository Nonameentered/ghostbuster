Hong Kong Shippers' Council urges government to outlaw airlines' illegal fuel surcharge on cargo rates 

The Hong Kong Shippers' Council has called on the government to take action against airlines that continue to impose fuel surcharges on cargo rates despite a sharp fall in jet fuel prices. The council said some airlines are still charging fuel surcharges of up to 50% of the base freight rate even though jet fuel prices have declined by more than 60% since mid-2014.

The council's chairman said this practice amounts to "profiteering" by the airlines and wants the government to investigate whether it constitutes anti-competitive behavior. "Air freight shippers have long been subject to high fuel surcharges by airlines which were supposed to offset volatile and rising jet fuel costs.  But with jet fuel prices now at six-year lows, there is no justification for such exorbitant surcharges," he said.

The base air freight rates which airlines charge shippers have also declined in recent years due to overcapacity and weak demand. But because fuel surcharges are calculated as a percentage of base rates, shippers end up paying a higher total price when there are surcharges. The chairman said some members reported fuel surcharges now account for 40-50% of their total air freight costs compared to just 25% a few years ago when fuel prices were much higher.

Industry analysts said airlines have become dependent on the revenue from fuel surcharges which provides a cushion even when base freight rates are under pressure. But shippers argue the original intention of these surcharges was to recover volatile fuel costs, not provide a permanent source of additional revenue. The council has written to the government demanding a probe into whether the failure of airlines to reduce or eliminate fuel surcharges when costs have fallen substantially constitutes an abuse of market power or anti-competitive behavior. 

If the government finds evidence to support the shippers' allegations, it has the power to issue an enforcement notice against the airlines and potentially impose financial penalties. The council said prompt action against such abuses would help ensure Hong Kong remains a competitive logistics and trading hub. But airlines are likely to argue that fuel surcharges are necessary due to ongoing cost pressures and operational challenges. The battle over sky-high air freight surcharges looks set to heat up in the months ahead.
