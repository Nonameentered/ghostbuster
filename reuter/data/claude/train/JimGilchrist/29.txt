Korean Air Reports Increase of 8.4% in Cargo Weight on Domestic and International Flights in July  

Korean Air, South Korea's national carrier and flagship airline, announced that it transported 8.4% more cargo in July 2019 compared to the same month last year. The total cargo uplift increased to 99,297 tons from 91,737 tons a year ago, according to a news release from the airline.

The rise in air cargo demand was seen both on the airline's domestic routes within South Korea as well as on long-haul international flights from the company's hub at Seoul's Incheon International Airport. On domestic flights, Korean Air transported 24,409 tons of cargo in July, up 16.5% versus 20,952 tons in July 2018. On international routes, the airline uplifted 74,888 tons of cargo last month, a 7.1% increase from 69,785 tons a year earlier. 

The increases on the cargo front come despite a 1.3% drop in Korean Air's passenger traffic in July due to geopolitical tensions with Japan that have dampened some travel demand. The cargo growth suggests the underlying strength of the South Korean economy with many industries relying on air transport to move high-value goods and components. Technology goods, e-commerce shipments, pharmaceuticals and perishables have been driving the higher demand for air cargo services.

Korean Air has also benefited from stronger cargo volumes between South Korea and major trading partners like China, Vietnam, and the European Union. The airline has the most extensive cargo network of any carrier operating from Seoul Incheon airport which has become a major air cargo hub. Korean Air's cargo arm, Korean Air Cargo, currently operates a fleet of 21 freighters and also uses the bellyhold capacity of the company's 168-passenger aircraft.

The airline attributed the July cargo increase to proactively capturing new business in the e-commerce and specialized cargo sectors. Korean Air has focused on diversifying beyond traditional tech goods and now transports a wide range of cargo including automotive parts, garments, live seafood and tropical fruits. The airline has also streamlined handling processes to meet the growing needs of time-sensitive e-commerce shipments.

Looking ahead, Korean Air sees cargo demand remaining solid given robust global trade flows and supply chain linkages with South Korea. However, overcapacity in certain markets, trade tensions and economic uncertainty could weigh on future growth. The airline will continue to tap diverse cargo segments and improve customer service to boost cargo volumes, the company said in its release. Overall, the strong July cargo numbers were an encouraging sign for both Korean Air and the South Korean economy.
