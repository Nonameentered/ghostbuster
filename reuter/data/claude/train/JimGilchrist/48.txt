American Airline Successfully Completes Proving Flight Over Russian Airspace for Future Air Navigation System (FANS) on Trans-Pacific Routes   

American Airlines recently completed a successful proving flight of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft over Russian airspace, demonstrating the ability to utilize Future Air Navigation System (FANS) technology on trans-Pacific routes. The flight originated in Dallas and landed in Shanghai, passing over Siberia and navigating Russian airspace for the first time with FANS.    

FANS is a digital communication system that allows pilots to directly communicate with air traffic control via satellite instead of relying only on traditional radio systems. With FANS, planes can fly more efficiently by taking direct routes that were previously unavailable due to lack of radar coverage or radio contact in remote areas. For American Airlines' transpacific routes, FANS enables the use of more direct routing over the Siberian portion of Russia, saving time and fuel.   

“We’re excited to be the first U.S. carrier to complete a proving flight using FANS over Russian airspace,” said American Airlines COO Robert Isom. “This technology allows us to enhance the customer experience by shortening flight times and improving efficiency and connectivity.”    

The FANS technology was installed on American Airlines’ Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft, which was used for the proving flight. The airline is in the process of updating its fleet of 47 Boeing 787s with the required avionics to utilize FANS overflights. Pending final approval from Russian authorities, the technology will enable American to optimize its transpacific flight routes with more direct paths beginning and ending in the U.S. and Asia. Flights from Dallas to Shanghai, for example, could see flight time reductions of 30-45 minutes.
