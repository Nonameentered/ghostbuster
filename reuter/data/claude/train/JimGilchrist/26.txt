Hong Kong-London airlines given new shortcut route through China

Hong Kong airlines offering direct flights to London will now be able to travel through Chinese airspace, shaving up to an hour off total travel time. The new routes were approved as part of an agreement between China and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 

The new routes will allow more direct paths over China, avoiding the need to detour around the country. Flights from Hong Kong to London currently take around 11-12 hours as planes have to navigate around restricted Chinese airspace. The new shortcut routes are expected to reduce travel time to under 11 hours on the Hong Kong-London routes.

Cathay Pacific and British Airways, which jointly operate direct flights between Hong Kong and London, welcomed the agreement. A spokesperson for the airlines said "We are pleased to now have access to more direct routes over China which will improve journey times and the overall experience for our customers traveling between Hong Kong and London." The airlines have already started using some of the new routes and will optimize flight paths over the coming months.

The move is seen as part of China's broader efforts to open up its airspace and shift to a more risk-based management approach to air traffic control. China previously had a more restrictive policy that sent most overflights around China's borders. The new agreement with ICAO opens up specific routes for commercial overflights to traverse China, though military airspace restrictions will still apply in some areas.

The shortcut routes are expected to provide cost and emissions savings for airlines in addition to reducing travel times. More direct routes require less fuel, lowering costs and carbon dioxide emissions per flight. Some estimates indicate the shortcuts could save up to 15-20 minutes of flight time and tons of fuel per flight, though actual savings will depend on factors like weather conditions and winds.

ICAO officials and industry groups have been working with China for several years to open up airspace for new international routes. Negotiations are still ongoing for access to additional routes, though changes will depend on China's willingness to relax airspace controls. The Hong Kong-London route appears to be an initial step towards broader opening of China's skies, which could benefit airlines and passengers throughout the region.
