DHL Worldwide Express Considers New Hong Kong Operations Centre for Future Growth  

DHL Worldwide Express, the world's leading international express and logistics services provider, announced today that it is exploring options to build a new logistics operations centre in Hong Kong to support future growth.

The new operations centre is expected to significantly expand DHL's handling capacity of express shipments in Hong Kong. The investment in a new, larger facility will enable DHL to meet the rising demand for express logistics services as Hong  Kong remains a strategically important global trade hub.

"With DHL's strong presence and connectivity in Hong Kong for over 40 years, this potential new operations centre investment reinforces our long-term commitment to support businesses in Hong Kong with their global shipment needs," said Ken Lee, CEO of DHL Express Asia Pacific. "We continue to see growing demand for DHL's services and investing in a new, state-of-the-art facility with higher automation and bigger handling capacity will help us stay ahead of growing trade volumes and customer needs in Hong Kong."  

The planned operations centre will feature the latest logistics technologies and equipment to handle express shipments including loading and unloading systems, conveyors, and integrated scanning and labelling systems. The facility is targeted to handle up to 8,000 shipments an hour, doubling DHL's current handling capacity in Hong Kong. DHL is working closely  with the Airport Authority Hong Kong and relevant government departments on the project.

Subject to regulatory approvals, the new DHL operations centre could commence operations in late 2023. The centre will be strategically located within close proximity to Hong Kong International Airport to support DHL's extensive air network and road connections in Hong Kong.
