Virgin Group's Cargo Unit Introduces New Air Freight Service to South Africa from Hong Kong via London  

Virgin Atlantic Cargo, the cargo division of Virgin Group, today announced the launch of a new direct air cargo service connecting Hong Kong and London Heathrow with Johannesburg, South Africa. The new route will provide fast and reliable air freight options for businesses shipping goods between Asia, Europe and South Africa.

The new service will operate three times per week using Virgin Atlantic's Boeing 787-9 aircraft. Extra cargo capacity has been added to the passenger aircraft to accommodate up to 15 tons of cargo per flight. The new route takes advantage of Virgin Atlantic's fast connections through London Heathrow, allowing for seamless cargo transfers between the flights.  

"South Africa is a key market for us, and the addition of a direct Hong Kong-London-Johannesburg route will provide our customers with faster transit times and increased cargo capacity between these important trading hubs," said Dominic Kennedy, Managing Director of Virgin Atlantic Cargo. "The introduction of the 787-9 on our Johannesburg route has given us more opportunity to boost our cargo capacity and the new service will help meet the strong demand we're seeing from customers in industries like e-commerce, pharmaceuticals, electronics and automotive."

The first flights on the new Hong Kong-London Heathrow-Johannesburg service commenced this week. Virgin Atlantic now offers cargo services on over 200 weekly flights to over 30 destinations worldwide, including other key cities in Asia, North America, the Caribbean, Middle East, and Africa. The airline is investing heavily in digitization and technology solutions to make shipping cargo with Virgin Atlantic Cargo more efficient, customer-centric and sustainable. 

The announcement of the new cargo route comes as Virgin Atlantic celebrates its 35th anniversary this year. The airline now has eight Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in its fleet, with more deliveries scheduled in the coming years to facilitate the airline's continued growth and expansion.
