Polar Air Cargo to Expand Services to New Delhi, Dubai, Bangkok, Kansai and Manila, Says EVP Jack Kane

Polar Air Cargo, the air freight subsidiary of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, announced plans to expand its international network with new freighter service to five cities across Asia and the Middle East. The expansion, effective in early 2020, will provide direct cargo flights from the company’s main hub in Cincinnati to New Delhi, Dubai, Bangkok, Osaka’s Kansai International Airport, and Manila. 

“We are excited to continue the strategic expansion of our international network by offering new service to these key destinations in Asia and the Middle East,” said Jack Kane, Executive Vice President of Polar Air Cargo. “Our customers have expressed strong demand for new routes to these cities, which are major centers for business and commerce. Our nonstop service will provide fast and efficient delivery of heavy shipments and outsized cargo for customers in industries like automotive, oil and gas, aerospace, and healthcare.”

The new routes will be operated by Polar Air Cargo’s fleet of Boeing 747 freighter aircraft, with three weekly flights to each city. The expansion follows the company’s recent additions of service to major European cities including Frankfurt, London, and Amsterdam. 

New Delhi and Dubai are two of the largest cargo hubs in their respective regions, serving as critical gateways for trade with Europe, the Americas, Africa, and beyond. Bangkok and Manila are also important cargo destinations, with Thailand’s capital city a major logistics hub for goods moving within Southeast Asia and the Philippines’ capital handling the highest cargo volume of any airport in the country. Kansai International Airport serves the key Kansai region in central Japan, handling high-tech goods, automotive parts, and perishable cargo.

“We see significant customer interest and long-term growth potential on these new routes,” said Kane. “Along with our new European routes launched earlier this year, this expansion establishes Polar Air Cargo as a truly intercontinental all-cargo airline and provides our customers with a global network to transport their goods quickly and seamlessly around the world.”
