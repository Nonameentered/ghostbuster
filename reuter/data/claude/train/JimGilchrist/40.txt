Fedex Plans to Utilize Former U.S. Military Base in the Philippines as Cargo Operator

FedEx, one of the largest express delivery companies in the world, announced plans today to take over the logistics operations at the former Clark International Airport located in Philippines. The airfield was previously operated by the U.S. military until 1991 and was turned over to the Philippine government. FedEx sees an opportunity to expand its cargo handling capacity in Asia by using the existing infrastructure at Clark International Airport.  

FedEx currently operates several major hubs across Asia, including Guangzhou in China, Singapore, Tokyo, and Delhi. The addition of Clark International Airport, located about 60 miles northwest of Manila, the capital city of Philippines, will provide FedEx an important hub to process packages and freight in Southeast Asia. The proximity to Manila also enables quick connections for customers in Philippines.

The Clark International Airport deal will provide FedEx control of over 2,400 acres of land, including two paved runways, aircraft hangars, and warehousing facilities. “This strategic investment in Clark will help boost export and import opportunities in the Philippines and surrounding Asian markets.” said David Cunningham, president of FedEx Express in Asia Pacific. “It highlights FedEx commitment to facilitate trade in and out of Asia.”

The move received widespread support from the business community in Philippines. Local officials hope the presence of FedEx will help revitalize the former U.S. airbase and bring more foreign investment and job opportunities to the region. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. FedEx plans to invest an initial $200 million to upgrade facilities and equipment at Clark International Airport. Operations are expected to begin within 24 months, pending final modifications and regulatory approvals.

With Asia being the fastest growing economic region in the world, FedEx sees the Clark hub as an important platform to meet customers’ needs and capture more business opportunities in Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. The strategic location of Clark International Airport could also provide FedEx a vital connection between its networks in Asia Pacific and the United States.
