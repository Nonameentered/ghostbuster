DHL Worldwide Express Plans Major Expansion in China, Aiming For 10% of Asian Sales by 2000

DHL Worldwide Express, the world's leading international delivery services group, announced major expansion plans for China today. Over the next three years, DHL aims to open 14 new offices in major cities across China and hire 600 staff, increasing its presence in one of the world's fastest-growing economies. 

The expansion will strengthen DHL's position in China's express delivery and logistics market, which is growing by over 20% annually. DHL currently has a 6% market share of the Chinese market and aims to raise that to 10% by 2000. The additional locations and staffing will help DHL extend its delivery network across China's 1.4 billion population. 

"China is a key market for DHL in Asia and globally," said Sam Rickard, CEO of DHL Express China. "China's massive manufacturing sector and increasing global trade connectivity means demand for express delivery services is surging. Our expansion will enable DHL to tap into that tremendous growth opportunity and better serve both local businesses in China as well as international companies shipping to and from China."

DHL currently operates 89 facilities in China across 56 cities, employing 4,700 staff. The 14 new locations will include the major population hubs of Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an and Qingdao. The 600 new hires will fill a range of roles including customer service, operations, finance, and management. DHL will also be opening its new Central China Hub in Zhengzhou this year, adding additional shipping capacity and reducing transit times.

The Chinese government's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative is helping to boost international trade and ecommerce in China. The country's express delivery volume grew 26% in 2018 to 64 billion parcels, according to China's postal bureau. A growing middle class, increased global trade deals, and economic reforms focused on consumer and service industries all point to high demand for express delivery and logistics services in the coming decades in China.

DHL's expansion comes amid increasing competition in the Chinese express delivery market from both domestic and foreign companies. However, DHL's global network, unmatched aviation fleet, and decades of experience in international shipping and logistics position the company strongly to win a larger share of China's high-potential delivery and logistics industry. With the new investments and staffing in place, DHL expects to achieve 10% market share within three years.
