Construction to Begin on Cathay Pacific's HK$1.6 Billion Headquarters at Chek Lap Kok  

Cathay Pacific announced today that it will begin construction on a massive HK$1.6 billion headquarters at Hong Kong International Airport. The state-of-the-art facility will consolidate Cathay Pacific's airport-based teams in one location, increasing operational efficiency and reducing costs. 

The seven-story headquarters building spanning 130,000 square meters will be located near the airport's third runway, scheduled to open in 2025. It will house 4,500 Cathay Pacific employees currently spread across four locations at the airport. The new headquarters is expected to be completed in 2023.

“This flagship facility reinforces our commitment to Hong Kong as our home base and equips us for future growth,” said Cathay Pacific CEO Augustus Tang. “The consolidation of our airport teams will enhance productivity through improved collaboration and operational synergy.”

The building is designed to achieve the highest green building standards, including LEED sustainability certification. It will feature an open-plan layout, a rooftop recreational space, and state-of-the-art high-tech systems throughout the building to enable seamless operations.

“This investment underscores Cathay Pacific’s confidence in Hong Kong as an international aviation hub," said Paul Chen, Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK. "The new headquarters will strengthen operational efficiency and further raise service quality, benefiting both businesses and travelers.”  

The headquarters announcement comes as Cathay Pacific aims to better compete with mainland Chinese and budget airlines. The airline posted an HK$4.9 billion loss for the first half of 2019 due to economic challenges and ongoing geopolitical tensions. The new headquarters is a signal to investors and customers that Cathay Pacific is committed to revamping its business for the future.
