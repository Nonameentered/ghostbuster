Cathay Pacific Chairman Urges Competitively Priced Landing Fees at Chek Lap Kok Airport  

The chairman of Cathay Pacific Airways, John Slosar, issued a stern warning to the Airport Authority of Hong Kong about the rising  landing and parking fees at Chek Lap Kok International Airport, Hong Kong’s primary airport. In a speech at the airline’s annual general meeting, Mr. Slosar said the fees had risen by more than 50% over the past decade and were damaging Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an aviation hub. 

“We simply cannot continue to absorb these costs indefinitely. Uncompetitive charges will only lead to higher fares, lower connectivity, and hamper Hong Kong’s role as an international aviation hub,” Mr. Slosar said. He noted that charges at Chek Lap Kok were already among the highest in the region compared to airports in Singapore, Seoul, and Bangkok.

The chairman’s comments come as Cathay Pacific faces significant financial pressure from a combination of slowing passenger traffic growth, volatile fuel prices, and increasing competition from low-cost carriers. The airline posted a HK$4.88 billion (US$620 million) loss in the first half of 2019. Mr. Slosar warned that further hikes in landing and parking charges would only weaken the airline’s financial position.

Analysts echoed the chairman’s concerns, noting that higher operating costs at Chek Lap Kok would be damaging to both Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong’s status as an aviation hub. “These airport charges go straight to the bottom line and significantly impact profitability,” said Steven Robinson, a Hong Kong-based aviation analyst. “If they go up further, it’s going to feed through to higher fares and make Hong Kong less competitive. That’s not good for anyone.”

In response, the Airport Authority insisted the fees were in line with industry standards and enabled continued investments to expand infrastructure and boost airport capacity. "We determine airport charges based on the cost of infrastructure and reasonable returns," said an Airport Authority spokesperson. "We also benchmark with other major global hub
