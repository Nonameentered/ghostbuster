Here is a 500-word news article on China Southern Airlines' new service to Amsterdam:

China Southern Airlines to Begin First European Service to Amsterdam  

China Southern Airlines, China's largest airline by fleet size, announced today that it will begin direct flights between Guangzhou and Amsterdam starting in June. The new service will operate three times a week using the airline's Airbus A380 aircraft. This marks China Southern's first route to Europe and expands the SkyTeam alliance member's international presence. 

The new Guangzhou-Amsterdam route is expected to reduce current travel time between China and the Netherlands by more than 4 hours. "China Southern is excited to connect Guangzhou and Amsterdam with our flagship A380," said China Southern CEO Tan Wangeng at a press conference today. "This new route will strengthen economic and cultural ties between China and the Netherlands and provide more convenient travel options for business and leisure passengers."

Amsterdam is a major hub for SkyTeam partner KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The Guangzhou-Amsterdam route boosts connectivity between China Southern's network of over 200 destinations in China and KLM's vast network in Europe and beyond. Passengers traveling from Amsterdam will be able to connect onward to nearly 100 destinations across China on China Southern. "This new direct service to Guangzhou opens up many opportunities for partnerships between Dutch and Chinese companies," said KLM CEO Pieter Elbers.

China is the Netherlands' third largest trading partner outside of Europe, with over $45 billion in annual trade. The new China Southern route is expected to facilitate more exchanges between the two countries. Up to six cargo flights a week will also operate between Guangzhou and Amsterdam using China Southern Cargo's Boeing 777 Freighters, providing up to 100 tons of cargo capacity each way per flight. 

China Southern's new service is the latest among many route launches by Chinese airlines to Europe in recent years. Hainan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines began service to Amsterdam in 2016 and 2017 respectively. China Eastern also operates direct routes from Shanghai to Amsterdam and Paris. The increased direct flights reflect China's growing global influence as an economic and tourism power. For China Southern, the expansion of its international network is a crucial part of its future growth strategy. The Guangzhou-Amsterdam route is just the start of  China Southern's ambitions in Europe and beyond.
