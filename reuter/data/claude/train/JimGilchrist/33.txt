Airlines to Raise Cargo Rates from Hong Kong to Europe Amid Escalating Fuel Costs

HONG KONG - Major airlines are planning to implement new cargo shipping rates from Hong Kong to Europe as fuel prices continue to rise globally. The fuel price hikes are cutting into airlines' profits on cargo routes between Asia and Europe, forcing the carriers to pass costs onto their customers. Cathay Pacific Airways, Air France-KLM, and Lufthansa all announced this week they will be raising cargo freight fees by between 4 to 6 percent starting in July. 

The rise in cargo rates come as Brent crude oil prices rose above $80 per barrel this week, the highest level since November 2014. Aviation fuel is a major cost component for airlines and closely tracks the price of crude oil. With no end in sight for escalating oil prices, airlines are under pressure to adjust rates to maintain profit margins.

"Fuel costs are significant for airlines and account for the majority of our operating expenses," said Andrew Bellinger, Director of Cargo for Cathay Pacific. "As such, when there are substantial increases in fuel prices, adjusting our cargo rates is an economic necessity to run our business sustainably."

Cathay Pacific reported a 7 percent drop in cargo shipments between Hong Kong and Europe in the first quarter of 2018. The airline blamed part of the decline on uncertainty around Brexit. However, volume is expected to pick up over the rest of 2018, allowing the higher rates to boost revenue. 

The cargo rate increases also reflect limited capacity on routes between Asia and Europe. Demand for air cargo has been on the rise over the past few years, driven by growing e-commerce in Asia and demand for high-value goods like electronics and pharmaceuticals. Limited availability of passenger planes that also carry cargo has made price hikes possible.

However, some analysts warn that higher rates could backfire and end up reducing demand and revenue. "There is a limit to how much extra cost can be passed onto customers before it starts impacting volumes," said Joanna Lu, an air cargo analyst at Fitch Ratings in Hong Kong.  "If fuel prices continue to rise over the long run, it may force airlines to absorb some costs to stay competitive."

For now, though, Cathay Pacific and other airlines are moving ahead with planned rate hikes to counterbalance oil prices and keep earnings stable in the face of rising fuel costs. Shippers will have no choice but to pay up if they want to get high-value goods to market quickly. The battle against escalating business costs is one airlines and shippers alike are grappling with as long as oil prices continue their upward trend.
