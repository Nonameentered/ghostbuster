Asiana Airlines Expands Cargo Fleet with New Boeing 747-400 Freighter for Seoul to New York Route 

Asiana Airlines, South Korea's second largest carrier, announced today the addition of a new Boeing 747-400 freighter aircraft to its cargo fleet. The aircraft will be used to operate a new cargo service between Seoul's Incheon International Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, starting in April 2021.

The new cargo route will operate three times per week, transporting high-value consumer goods, e-commerce shipments, perishables, and other cargo between South Korea and the New York metropolitan area. Asiana Cargo expects strong demand for air freight between Asia's fourth largest economy and the major consumer market of the U.S. East Coast.

"We are excited to launch our first dedicated transpacific cargo service to the important New York air cargo hub," said Mr. Park Sam-koo, CEO of Asiana Airlines. "The Boeing 747-400F is the ideal aircraft for this route with its long range, high payload capacity, and operational efficiency. This new service will enable us to better serve the air cargo demands of businesses in Korea and the New York region."

The Boeing 747-400F can transport up to 112 tonnes of cargo with its main deck capacity of 30 large pallets. Asiana's newest freighter features a nose door and a large side door to facilitate fast loading and unloading of shipments. The aircraft is powered by four Pratt & Whitney PW4056 engines capable of 63,300 pounds of thrust each.

With the expansion of its cargo fleet and network, Asiana Cargo aims to become a leading global air cargo carrier, leveraging its strength in the Northeast Asian market. The new transpacific route to New York is a major step forward in the company's cargo growth strategy.
