Labour Shortage Threatens Completion of Hong Kong's New Airport, Requires Additional Workers

Hong Kong's new multibillion-dollar airport terminal risks facing significant delays due to an ongoing labour shortage, according to officials involved in the construction of the project. The new terminal, which is set to open next year, requires an additional 3,000 to 4,000 construction workers to meet the current timeline, but attracting workers to Hong Kong has been challenging. 

The $18.8 billion USD terminal is a crucial infrastructure project for both Hong Kong and China. Once completed, it will be able to handle an additional 70 million passengers per year, greatly expanding Hong Kong's capacity as an international transit hub. However, the massive six-story terminal is only 60% complete and construction firms are struggling to find enough workers to finish the project on schedule. Hong Kong's low unemployment and aging population have made it difficult to recruit young construction workers locally. 

“We urgently need to attract more workers from overseas to speed up progress," said Lee Cheuk-yan, the Hong Kong legislator responsible for labour issues. Bringing in additional workers from mainland China and other countries in the region could address the shortfall, but bureaucratic hurdles threaten to stall the process. Strict regulations around immigration and work visas have made it challenging for firms to hire foreign workers, even for desperately needed roles.

Trade unions argue that improving work conditions and wages could help entice more local workers to join the project. However, others worry that could drive up costs further and weaken Hong Kong's competitive advantage. Legislators are calling on the government to take action by temporarily relaxing restrictions around hiring foreign workers for infrastructural projects deemed to be of critical economic importance.

With only 12 months until its planned opening, attracting and enrolling several thousand additional workers in short order would be an immense challenge and likely lead to delays in completing and opening the airport terminal. But if left unaddressed, the ongoing labour shortage puts the timely completion—and benefits—of Hong Kong's new world-class airport facility at risk. Overall, tackling Hong Kong's broader structural labour issues around an aging population and workforce mobility restrictions may be required to ensure the continued viability of future large-scale infrastructure projects.
