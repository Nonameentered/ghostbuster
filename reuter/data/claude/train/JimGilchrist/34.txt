El Al to Increase Trade and Tourism from Hong Kong with New Boeing 747 Direct Flight 

El Al Israel Airlines announced today that it will begin operating direct flights between Hong Kong and Tel Aviv starting in June 2020. The new route will be serviced by El Al's Boeing 747-400 aircraft three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. 

The new direct air link between Hong Kong and Tel Aviv is expected to significantly boost trade and tourism between the two cities. "There is increasing economic and cultural cooperation between Israel and Hong Kong, and demand for travel has been rising steadily in recent years," said Gonen Usishkin, El Al's CEO. "This new direct route will make travel more convenient, cut travel time by several hours, and strengthen the connection between our two dynamic business hubs."

Currently, there are no direct flights between Hong Kong and Tel Aviv, and travelers have to make at least one stopover, most often in Bangkok, Istanbul or a city in Europe. The direct El Al flight will reduce travel time from about 15-20 hours with connections to under 9 hours nonstop. 

Trade between Israel and Hong Kong has been expanding, with many Israeli companies entering partnerships in Hong Kong and China in the areas of technology, biotech, and other innovation sectors. Bilateral trade between Israel and Hong Kong reached over $1.3 billion in 2018. The new air route is expected to boost trade by faciliting more face-to-face business meetings and collaboration.  

Tourism is also set to benefit from the direct air connection between the two destinations. Some 30,000 Israelis visited Hong Kong in 2018, and over 50,000 visitors from Hong Kong traveled to Israel, reflecting a growing interest in experiencing each country's unique culture, food, and natural scenery. The three-times-weekly El Al direct flights will make such leisure and cultural trips much more convenient and accessible.

Subject to government approval, El Al plans to deploy its Boeing 747-400 aircraft with around 400 seats on the new Tel Aviv-Hong Kong route starting June 15, 2020. Flight tickets will go on sale within the coming months through El Al's website and travel agents. The direct El Al flight is expected to appeal to business and leisure travelers from both Israel and Hong Kong seeking to fly nonstop between the two points.
