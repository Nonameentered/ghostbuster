Hong Kong's Dragonair to Purchase Two New Airbus Aircraft and Lease Another to Meet Demand for China Routes  

Dragonair, a regional airline based in Hong Kong, announced today that it will purchase two new Airbus A320 aircraft and lease an additional A320 to expand its fleet. The move is aimed at meeting growing demand on Dragonair's routes within mainland China and other short-haul destinations in Asia.

The purchase of the new aircraft, worth over $200 million, will increase Dragonair's Airbus A320 fleet to 15 aircraft. The leasing of a third A320 will boost the fleet by 20% overall in the next six months. Dragonair currently operates a fleet of 30 aircraft serving over 45 destinations across Asia, with a particular focus on short-haul routes within mainland China.

' Passenger traffic on our China and intra-Asia routes has increased dramatically over the past few years,' said Dragonair CEO Patrick Yeung. 'The addition of these three Airbus A320 aircraft will allow us to offer increased frequency and flexibility, as well as serve new destinations on our core routes.' 

Dragonair has seen substantial growth in demand for its services due to rising tourism in the region, especially from mainland China, and a growing middle class seeking affordable air travel. The new aircraft will primarily serve routes within China, including cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Xian, and Wuhan. They will also support new routes to Southeast Asian destinations like Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Bali.

'The Airbus A320neo aircraft will provide additional capacity for us while driving greater fuel efficiency and keeping fares affordable for our passengers,' said Yeung. Dragonair is a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific Group, Hong Kong's flag carrier. The new aircraft are scheduled for delivery in early 2019, with the lease aircraft incorporated into the fleet in October 2018. The new routes and increased frequency on existing routes will be rolled out over the next year.

The additional aircraft demonstrate Cathay Pacific Group's commitment to strengthening Dragonair's position as a competitive regional carrier connecting Hong Kong and mainland China, according to analysts. The new aircraft and routes are expected to boost connections between the two destinations and increase Hong Kong's attractiveness as an international transit hub.
