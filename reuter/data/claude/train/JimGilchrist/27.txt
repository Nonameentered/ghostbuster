Japan Airlines (JAL) Expands Express Cargo Service "J Speed" to Meet Rising Demand for Rapid Deliveries Throughout Asia  

Japan Airlines (JAL) announced today that it will be expanding its express cargo delivery service called "J Speed" to additional cities across Asia in order to meet growing demand for fast, reliable shipping in the region. J Speed offers expedited air freight service with guaranteed delivery times and has become popular for companies shipping perishable goods, medical supplies or just-in-time components.

JAL first launched J Speed in 2017 with service to major cities in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China. The airline will now add J Speed service to Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. This expansion will provide much wider coverage across East and Southeast Asia with guaranteed delivery times of within 24 hours for most locations.  

"We have seen double-digit growth in demand for our J Speed service over the past two years," said Ichiro Fukuzawa, President of JAL's cargo and mail division. "Many companies are seeking faster and more reliable shipping options to match the pace of business today. By connecting more cities across Asia with our expanded J Speed network, we aim to provide seamless rapid delivery for customers anywhere in the region."

The expanded J Speed network will offer three tiers of service - J Speed Premium with delivery within 12 hours, J Speed Express within 18 hours and J Speed Standard within 24 hours. The new cities were chosen based on analysis of major cargo destinations and customer demand. JAL will start offering J Speed service to the additional Asian cities starting in April 2020.  

JAL faces competition for express air cargo services in Asia from carriers like Cathay Pacific, Korean Air and Singapore Airlines. However, JAL is the largest airline in Japan, a major cargo hub, which provides an advantage. The airline is also investing in more dedicated freight aircraft to expand capacity for services like J Speed. With businesses across Asia seeking faster delivery times to meet customer expectations in an e-commerce era, demand for premium cargo services in the region is expected to continue rising sharply in the coming years. The expanded J Speed network positions JAL well to gain market share in this fast-growing segment.
