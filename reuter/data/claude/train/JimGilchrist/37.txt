Airbus Markets Cargo Space for World's Largest Civil Transporter in Asia 

Airbus is marketing the cargo capabilities of its mega Beluga XL transport aircraft to logistics companies and freight operators in Asia. The Beluga XL, the world's largest civil transport aircraft, began operations earlier this year and Airbus sees major opportunities to utilize its vast cargo space in the fast-growing Asian air cargo market.

The Beluga XL was designed by Airbus specifically to transport aircraft components between its production sites across Europe. However, the aircraft has substantial excess cargo capacity that Airbus aims to sell to logistic companies, freight forwarders, and other transport operators when it is not being used for internal operations. 

"The Beluga XL offers a unique cargo capability that could benefit many industries in Asia's booming economies," said Jean-Brice Dumont, Executive Vice President of Engineering at Airbus. "Whether transporting machinery, delicate art installations, humanitarian supplies or any awkwardly shaped cargo, the Beluga XL delivers fast point-to-point transport in a fully pressurized environment."

The Beluga XL has a maximum payload of 51 tonnes, which can translate to more than 130 cubic meters of cargo space. The main deck is almost 50 meters long, 8 meters high and 8 meters wide, offering essentially a flying warehouse capacity. The aircraft's heavy-lift capabilities, large cross-section, and ability to land at most airports and airfields make it suitable for a wide range of cargo delivery needs.

Several logistics companies in South Korea, Japan and Singapore have expressed strong interest in utilizing the Beluga XL for their customers following a roadshow by Airbus highlighting the aircraft's capabilities. "The Beluga XL would be a game changer for our heavy lift cargo operations and open up many new opportunities for transporting awkwardly sized cargo over long distances across the region," said one logistics executive in Singapore who held discussions with Airbus.   

The Beluga XL began flying earlier this year, with the first transport for its intended use moving aircraft wings between Airbus' sites in the U.K. and France. Airbus aims to have the full fleet of five Beluga XLs in operation by mid-2020. The aircraft will be based at its Broughton site in the U.K. but available for cargo runs throughout Europe and potentially much further afield given its range of 4,000 kilometers fully loaded. Airbus sees Asia as a key market for utilizing spare capacity on the Beluga XL fleet, enabling freight companies and logistics operators in the region to transport huge cargo loads across large distances.
