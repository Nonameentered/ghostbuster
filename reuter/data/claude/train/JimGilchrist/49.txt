Korean Air Lines Ltd's Cargo Load Factor Drops 3.2 Percent in First Half of 2021

Korean Air Lines Co Ltd reported a 3.2 percent drop in cargo load factor for the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period last year. The cargo load factor, which measures how much of an airline's cargo capacity has been utilized, fell to 65.1 percent in the January-June period from 67.3 percent a year earlier, the company said in a regulatory filing.

Cargo traffic, measured in revenue ton kilometers, declined 5.6 percent, while cargo capacity, measured in available ton kilometers, edged down 2.2 percent. The cargo yield, a key measure of airfreight rates, rose 2.2 percent. 

The drop in cargo load factor and traffic reflects the ongoing challenges facing global air cargo demand due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Factory shutdowns and supply chain disruptions have reduced goods available for air shipment, while economic uncertainty has dampened consumer demand.

Korean Air's passenger traffic plunged 82.2 percent and passenger load factor dropped 51.5 percentage points to 31.8 percent in the first six months. International passenger traffic plummeted 95.7 percent.

Korean Air is not alone in seeing a drop in cargo and passenger air travel. The global aviation industry has been hit hard by border closures and travel restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said global air cargo demand dropped 10.6 percent in 2020, the sharpest fall since the 2008 financial crisis.

Korean Air said it would continue to take cost-saving measures, optimize its cargo network, and step up the transportation of medical goods and e-commerce shipments to weather the difficult times. The company remains cautiously optimistic that cargo and passenger demand will start to recover in the second half of the year as more people get vaccinated against COVID-19.
