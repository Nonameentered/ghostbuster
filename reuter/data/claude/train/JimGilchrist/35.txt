Air China Plans to Restart Flights to Los Angeles in 2022

Air China announced today that it plans to resume direct flights between Beijing and Los Angeles starting in July 2022. The airline had suspended service on the route since February 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing travel restrictions. 

Air China is China's national carrier and second largest airline. Prior to the pandemic, Air China offered two daily nonstop flights between Beijing Capital International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport using Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. Air China executives say they expect demand for travel between China and the United States to increase in 2022 as vaccination rates rise in both countries and border restrictions continue to ease.

“We are thrilled to announce the relaunch of our direct service to Los Angeles, an important route for business and leisure travelers alike,” said an Air China spokesperson. “China and the U.S. share a strong economic and cultural connection, so restoring our direct flights will help facilitate travel and exchange between the two countries as conditions improve.”

According to data from the United States Department of Commerce, Los Angeles welcomed over 1.2 million visitors from China in 2019, making China the second largest source of international visitors to Los Angeles after Mexico. Local tourism officials in Los Angeles also cheered the news of Air China’s return, saying the reinstated service will provide an economic boost to the region’s hospitality, retail, and entertainment sectors which rely heavily on foreign visitors.  

Air China said more details regarding flight schedules and ticket prices for Los Angeles-bound flights will be announced on its website and social media channels in the coming months. The airline joins several other foreign carriers like British Airways, Lufthansa, and Emirates that have restarted or plan to restart routes to the U.S. in 2022. Air China’s announcement is a hopeful sign for the revival of international air travel in the wake of the pandemic.
