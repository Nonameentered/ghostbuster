Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) urges government to retain Kai Tak's cargo facilities post Chek Lap Kok airport opening 

Hong Kong's major cargo handling operator, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL), has urged the government to retain cargo facilities at the old Kai Tak airport even after the opening of the new Chek Lap Kok airport next year. HACTL, which handles 70% of Hong Kong's air cargo throughput, says that retaining Kai Tak as an air cargo hub will help ensure Hong Kong maintains its position as one of the world's leading air cargo centres.

According to HACTL's chief executive Brian Chau, continued use of Kai Tak airport is necessary due to limited cargo handling capacity at Chek Lap Kok airport. "Chek Lap Kok airport will open with annual cargo capacity of only 2.6 million tonnes, which is similar to Kai Tak's current throughput. Given the rapid growth of air cargo volume in recent years, especially in the Pearl River Delta region, Chek Lap Kok's facilities will be unable to meet demand in the long run," said Mr Chau.  

HACTL proposes that certain cargo facilities such as warehouses and parking aprons at Kai Tak can continue to operate to handle cargo overflow from Chek Lap Kok. Some military facilities at Kai Tak can be released and converted for cargo use. Mr Chau suggests redeveloping Kai Tak into a dedicated air cargo park which can handle up to 5 million tonnes of cargo annually. Completing such redevelopment will take 3 to 5 years and require government investment of up to HK$5 billion (US$645 million).

While supporting the opening of Chek Lap Kok airport, Mr Chau stresses that its cargo facilities alone will not be sufficient to cement Hong Kong's position as an international aviation hub. Retaining Kai Tak is important for providing capacity to meet the needs of major express cargo companies and e-commerce giants which depend heavily on Hong Kong as a logistics hub for global distribution. 

However, some industry experts argue that operating two airports may be inefficient and that resources should be focused on maximizing Chek Lap Kok's cargo capacity. Redeveloping Kai Tak into an air cargo park also faces obstacles due to its location in a dense urban area. The government has not announced any plans to retain Kai Tak's air cargo functions and may redevelop the area into a business district.

The opening of Chek Lap Kok airport in July 1998 will mark the closure of Kai Tak airport which has served Hong Kong since 1925. While Chek Lap Kok will have state-of-the-art passenger facilities, its limited cargo capacity has led to calls from the cargo industry to retain Kai Tak as a supplement air cargo hub. The government has a challenging task to balance the needs of both the passenger airline and cargo sectors in ensuring a smooth transition to the new airport.
