Hong Kong's Baltrans Ltd to Enjoy Economies of Scale and Growth Following Acquisition of LA Competitor, Says Company Chairman 

Baltrans Ltd, a Hong Kong-based logistics and shipping company, is set to achieve significant cost savings and position itself for growth following its acquisition of Los Angeles-based competitor West Coast Freight Corp, according to Baltrans chairman David Chan.

The $250 million acquisition of West Coast Freight, a medium-sized freight forwarding company on the US West Coast, will provide Baltrans with greater scale and reach, enabling the company to reduce costs, Chan said in an interview. “By combining forces with West Coast Freight, we will be able to consolidate offices, optimize routes, and gain efficiencies across the board. This will translate into lower costs and higher profit margins for us.”

In addition to cost savings, the acquisition will allow Baltrans to tap into West Coast Freight’s extensive operations and client base in the western United States, Chan said. “This provides us with a solid foothold in the US and paves the way for further expansion into North America. We see strong potential for growth in the region, and the acquisition puts us in a good position to capitalize on emerging opportunities.”

The deal is the largest in Baltrans’ 15-year history and signals its ambitions to become a global leader in logistics, according to Chan. “We have long had our sights set on international expansion, and this is an important milestone for us. With West Coast Freight on board, we are better equipped than ever before to serve customers around the world and establish Baltrans as a major international provider of shipping and freight services.” 

Subject to regulatory approval, the acquisition of West Coast Freight is expected to be finalized in January next year. Baltrans shares rose 3% on the Hong Kong stock exchange following the announcement of the deal.
