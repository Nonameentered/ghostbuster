Cathay Pacific Digs First Turf for New HK$3.5 Billion Headquarters at Chek Lap Kok Airport  

Cathay Pacific Airways today held a groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of construction of its new HK$3.5 billion corporate headquarters at Hong Kong International Airport. The airline's top executives were joined by government officials to dig the first turf for what will be the Cathay City campus.

The new headquarters will consolidate Cathay Pacific's offices currently spread across multiple locations in Hong Kong, bringing 3,500 employees under one roof at Chek Lap Kok Airport. The project includes an office building spanning 320,000 square feet and a training center with flight simulators for pilots and cabin crew. 

"This groundbreaking marks an important milestone for Cathay Pacific," said CEO Ivan Chu. "Cathay City will strengthen connectivity and collaboration across our teams, and provide a modern, vibrant workspace to support our vision to make Cathay Pacific the world's best airline."

The headquarters is designed to foster innovation and better support Cathay Pacific's digital transformation. It features an open office layout with flexible workspaces, the latest video conferencing technology and a staff hub with dining, retail and recreational facilities.

Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan lauded the headquarters as a vote of confidence in Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub. "Cathay City will showcase the very best of Hong Kong design and sustainability standards. It will stand as an iconic development at our airport city and a source of pride for Cathay Pacific's home base," said Chan.

Construction of the headquarters will take between 36 to 48 months. Cathay Pacific expects to transition employees from their current offices to the new Cathay City campus in phases starting in 2021. The relocation will mark the first time in over 70 years that Cathay Pacific's entire head office operations come together at a single site dedicated for the airline.

The Cathay City project reinforces Hong Kong Airport Authority's vision to develop Chek Lap Kok into an "Airport City" containing office space, logistics facilities, retail space and accommodation for businesses. Cathay Pacific's headquarters will add a major office component to the evolving airport metropolis.
