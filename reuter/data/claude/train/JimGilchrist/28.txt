Dragonair increases flights to Sendai, Japan with new Airbus fleet

Dragonair, the Hong Kong-based subsidiary of Cathay Pacific Airways, announced today that it will be increasing its flight frequency to Sendai, Japan and upgrading the aircraft used on the route. Starting next month, Dragonair will operate daily flights between Hong Kong and Sendai, up from the current four flights per week. The route will also transition from an Airbus A321 aircraft to the larger A330, offering up to 40 percent more seats on each flight.

The increase in capacity reflects growing demand for travel between Hong Kong and Japan, as well as Dragonair’s efforts to strengthen its regional network under Cathay Pacific. “We are pleased to enhance our services to Sendai with more flight options and larger aircraft to support the increasing popularity of this route," said Algernon Yau, CEO of Dragonair. 

Sendai, the largest city in the Tohoku region and northern Honshu, has become an attractive tourist destination, especially for visitors from Hong Kong and mainland China. Located a short ride from scenic national parks, the city offers a mix of natural and cultural attractions. The increased flight frequency and larger aircraft size will make it more convenient for business and leisure travelers to visit Sendai and the surrounding area.

The additional Dragonair flights to Sendai will boost the city’s tourism industry and foster closer economic ties with Hong Kong. "We welcome Dragonair’s decision to strengthen its Hong Kong-Sendai route with more flights and larger aircraft. This will further promote tourism, trade and cultural exchange between the two cities," said a spokesperson for the Sendai Tourism Board.

The schedule change to daily Airbus A330 flights on the Hong Kong-Sendai route will start from October 1. Dragonair is a 18-time recipient of the World Travel Awards’ World's Best Regional Airline award.
