Polar Air Cargo expands fleet with new Boeing 747-200F aircraft, eyes increased Asian operations 

Polar Air Cargo, the cargo airline division of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, has announced the purchase of two used Boeing 747-200F freighter aircraft. The cargo jets are scheduled to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2019. With the addition of these two aircraft, Polar Air Cargo's fleet will grow to 15 Boeing 747 freighters.

"We are excited to introduce additional capacity to our fleet as we continue to capitalize on strong global demand for air freight, especially on long-haul trade lanes between North America, Europe and Asia," said Polar Air Cargo President Bill Flynn. The expansion of Polar Air Cargo's fleet will enable the airline to launch new routes to Asia, including flights to major cargo hubs like Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Singapore's Changi Airport.  

The two Boeing 747-200F aircraft are converted passenger jets that have been refurbished for cargo operations. Each plane has a payload capacity of up to 115 tons, providing much-needed capacity for Polar Air Cargo's customers during the peak Asia-North America cargo season in the fourth quarter. With e-commerce continuing to drive demand for air freight, especially from China and other parts of Asia, additional cargo capacity and routes have become essential.  

While the air cargo industry faces challenges from the ongoing US-China trade war and global economic slowing, cargo carriers focused on the Asia market are positioned for growth in the coming years. According to Boeing, air cargo traffic between Asia and North America is expected to grow 4.7% annually over the next 20 years. The expansion of Polar Air Cargo's Boeing 747 fleet enhances the airline's ability to tap into this important growth market and deliver critical capacity for its customers during the peak season. With these additional aircraft, Polar Air Cargo is strengthening its position as a key player in transpacific and Asia-Europe air cargo transportation.
