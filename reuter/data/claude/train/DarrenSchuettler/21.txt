Fidelity Removes Veronika Hirsch Amid Regulatory Probe, Damaging Expansion Efforts in Canada 

Fidelity Investments, one of the world's largest investment firms, has removed Veronika Hirsch from her position as head of Fidelity Canada amid an ongoing regulatory probe by Canadian authorities. Hirsch had led Fidelity's expansion into Canada over the past three years, but her abrupt departure raises questions about Fidelity's growth plans in the country.

According to sources familiar with the matter, Hirsch was placed on administrative leave two weeks ago as part of an internal investigation into compliance issues at Fidelity Canada. The investigation is linked to a broader probe by the Ontario Securities Commission into Fidelity's practices related to mutual fund sales and fees. The OSC launched its investigation earlier this year to determine whether Fidelity Canada properly disclosed information to investors about the fees and costs associated with its mutual funds.

With Hirsch's removal, Fidelity Canada's ambitious expansion plans face significant disruption and uncertainty. Since launching in Canada in 2017, Fidelity has sought to gain market share from the country's largest investment firms, including RBC Global Asset Management, CIBC Asset Management, and Manulife Investment Management. Under Hirsch's leadership, Fidelity Canada grew to over $12 billion in assets under management across 200,000 customer accounts. Fidelity planned to double its Canadian workforce to 1,000 employees over the next two years.

Hirsch's interim replacement, Sonia Martin, is a Fidelity veteran but lacks Hirsch's experience running an entire unit. There are also concerns that the OSC investigation could lead to significant fines and customer restitution that hinder Fidelity Canada's growth. The probe raises questions about Fidelity's controls and governance that could damage its reputation in the Canadian market.

In a statement, a Fidelity spokesperson said: "We take compliance and regulatory matters extremely seriously. We are fully cooperating with the OSC's requests and have undertaken an internal review to address their concerns. We remain committed to the Canadian market and our long-term growth plans."  

But analysts argue that Hirsch's removal injects instability at a critical time and signals deeper issues. "Losing your head of Canada is hugely problematic, especially given how much that growth strategy depended on her leadership," said Olivia Miller, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "This OSC investigation seems to point to some significant failures in oversight and governance. Fidelity has a lot of work to do to restore confidence."
