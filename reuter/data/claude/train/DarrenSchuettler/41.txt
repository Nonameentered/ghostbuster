Laidlaw Inc. Shares Soar as Company Makes Major Moves in Ambulance Services and Waste Management Worth Over $2 Billion

Shares of Laidlaw Inc. rose over 25% today following the announcement of two major acquisitions by the environmental services and transportation conglomerate. Laidlaw agreed to purchase American Medical Response, the largest ambulance service provider in the United States, from Envision Healthcare Corp. for $2.1 billion. Laidlaw also acquired Waste Connections, a leading waste collection and recycling services company, for $875 million in an all-cash deal. 

The ambulance services deal is the largest in Laidlaw’s history and signals the company’s ambitions to become a major player in healthcare transportation and logistics. American Medical Response operates in 40 states and transports over 5 million patients each year, bringing in $1.8 billion in revenue and $160 million in adjusted earnings last year. “This acquisition allows us to provide essential transportation and logistics services to millions of patients across the country, which aligns with our mission to support critical infrastructure for communities,” said Laidlaw CEO Kevin Coyle in a statement. The deal is expected to close within 6-8 months, pending regulatory approval.

The Waste Connections acquisition expands Laidlaw’s existing solid waste management operations in the U.S. and Canada, adding over $5 billion in revenue and $700 million in EBITDA. Waste Connections serves commercial, industrial, residential and municipal customers in 42 states, with a network of 126 collection operations, 75 transfer stations and 41 landfills. “Waste Connections is an ideal partner for us with its commitment to customer service, safety and environmental protection. Together we will pursue further opportunities to expand, enhance and optimize waste and recycling services across North America,” said Coyle. The deal closed today with the signing of final agreements.

Laidlaw plans to fund the nearly $3 billion in deals through a mix of cash on hand, drawing on existing revolving credit facilities and issuing new debt. The company believes the acquisitions will be accretive to earnings in the first year. Laidlaw stock jumped $4.25 or 27% to close at $20.15 per share, an all-time high for the stock. Analysts praised the strategic moves and boosted their price targets for Laidlaw, anticipating strong growth and returns on the new assets. The acquisitions are a sign of the increasing consolidation in the ambulance, healthcare logistics and waste management industries.
