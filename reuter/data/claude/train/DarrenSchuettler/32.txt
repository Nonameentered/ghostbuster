Royal Bank of Canada Reports Record Annual Profit and Dividend Hike 

The Royal Bank of Canada announced its financial results for the 2019 fiscal year today, posting record net income of $12.9 billion, up 6% from the previous year. The strong performance allowed the bank to increase its quarterly dividend by 3 cents to $1.05 per share.

"2019 was another successful year for RBC," said Dave McKay, RBC's President and CEO. "We continued to gain market share, leveraging our competitive advantages, including our leading digital capabilities, comprehensive advice and solutions, and strong capital base."

Total revenue climbed 5% to $47.2 billion, driven by solid loan and deposit growth across its domestic retail and commercial banking and wealth management divisions. Net interest income rose 6% due to robust volume growth and net interest margin expansion. RBC saw double-digit earnings growth in its insurance, technology and operations, and capital markets businesses.  

Profit from RBC's personal and commercial banking unit increased 9% to $6.7 billion, reflecting higher net income from residential mortgages, business loans, and deposits. Revenue from its wealth management division gained 3% to $4.9 billion on the back of a rise in average fee-based client assets and growth in traditional asset management fees.

RBC's strong capital and liquidity position has enabled continued investments in its digital innovation strategy. The bank aims to become the "bank of choice for the digital age" and has introduced several new digital capabilities for both retail and business customers over the past year. RBC also continued to invest in machine learning, data analytics, and automation to enhance the client experience.

Given the bank's solid performance and capital position, RBC's board of directors approved a 3 cent or 3% increase in its quarterly dividend. The higher dividend is payable on February 24, 2020, to common shareholders of record on January 27, 2020. RBC has increased its dividend for 8 consecutive years at a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% over that period.  

RBC is Canada's largest bank by market capitalization and is among the largest banks in the world, based on market capitalization. The bank has over 16 million clients and employs more than 86,000 full- and part-time employees worldwide.
