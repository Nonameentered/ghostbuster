Toronto-Dominion Bank Reports Record Profits for 1996, Increases Dividend  

Toronto-Dominion Bank posted a record profit for the 1996 fiscal year, driven by robust lending growth and stable credit quality. Net income increased 13% to $2.1 billion Canadian dollars ($1.56 billion), up from C$1.87 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose 12% to C$2.46. 

Revenue from interest on loans and other financing activities climbed 9.4% to C$5.74 billion, reflecting strong volume growth in residential mortgages, business loans and credit cards. Revenue from other banking operations including service charges, commissions, and trading rose 7.2% to C$2.3 billion.

Against the backdrop of an overall slower economy, loan growth has been particularly notable. Residential mortgage lending expanded 11%, business loans grew 13.1% and personal loans including credit cards rose 10.8%. The bank has also gained market share in investment banking and wealth management. The bank's diverse range of lending and fee-based activities is providing an offset to margin pressure from a competitive lending market.

The bank's provisions for credit losses declined 6% to C$385 million, reflecting stable economic conditions and employment markets as well as prudent risk management. The bank's ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans improved to 0.36% from 0.42% a year earlier.

In light of the strong results, the bank's board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 37 cents per share from 35 cents, for an annual payout of C$1.48 per share. The higher dividend reflects the bank's confidence in its continued growth and profitability.

"Our record earnings this year reflect solid progress in achieving profitable growth through providing superior service and advice to personal and business customers across Canada as well as selectively expanding beyond our borders," said Allen G. Loney, president and chief executive officer.

The bank remains well positioned for continued success and growth, with a strong balance sheet, diverse revenue streams and a proven growth strategy. Barring unforeseen events, we anticipate another year of strong financial performance in 1997.
