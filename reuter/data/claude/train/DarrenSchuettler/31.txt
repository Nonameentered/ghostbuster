Canada's Big Six Banks Set to Record C$6 Billion Annual Profit 

Canada's major banks are expected to report another year of strong profits in 2020, despite the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to analysts, the Big Six banks - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and National Bank of Canada - are on track to book a total annual profit of approximately C$63 billion (US$50 billion), down only moderately from C$69 billion (US$54 billion) last year.  

The resilience of bank earnings in 2020 highlights the stability of Canada's financial system. While banks implemented provisions for loan losses and temporarily suspended dividends early in the pandemic due to economic uncertainty, the overall hit to their bottom lines proved less severe than feared. Core revenues from residential mortgages, wealth management fees, and capital markets activity held up well. Government wage subsidies and regulatory leniency on capital requirements also provided banks flexibility during the downturn. 

“The Canadian banking system has shown its adaptability in the face of this unprecedented slowdown,” said Robert Sedran, analyst at CIBC Capital Markets. “Both household and business customers received much-needed support, thanks to government programs and bank accommodations, yet core operations remained profitable. It was an effective display of cooperation between public and private sectors.”

After a sharp drop in March, bank stocks have rebounded to record highs, adding over 50% in value since the spring. Investors expect higher returns in 2021 due to an improved economic outlook and the anticipated winding down of credit provisions. However, risks remain around weak business lending, the end of mortgage deferral programs, and ongoing low interest rates squeezing margins.  

“Banks have navigated the crisis well so far but face significant uncertainty looking ahead,” said James Shanahan, a financial services analyst at Edward Jones. “While government support has been a lifeline, there are limits to how long it can continue. The strength of the rebound in key areas like employment, trade, and tourism will be crucial for banks to maintain their momentum into next year and beyond.”   

Overall, the Big Six are poised to cap off a tumultuous year on a high note. But the road to full economic recovery remains long, and lasting effects on consumers and businesses could still weigh on bank results for months to come. The banking sector's continued resilience in 2021 and ability to drive growth will depend on the broader revival of activity across Canada. At this point, the major banks appear well-positioned but stability is still fragile.
