Canada's Big Six Banks Report Record Profits, but Face Growing Public Anger over High Service Charges and Credit Card Rates  

Canada's major banks announced impressive profits for the fiscal second quarter, driven by increased activity in the housing market and stock  market trading. However, the results also highlighted the large sums  customers are paying in service fees and high-interest rates on credit cards.   

The Royal Bank of Canada led the way with a 23% increase in quarterly  profits to $3.5 billion. Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal also  posted double-digit profit gains. The banks attributed the results to low  loan losses and improving margins.  

However, buried in the reports were figures showing that customer  fees accounted for a sizable portion of the banks' earnings. Royal Bank  collected $4 billion in fees over the six months, an increase of 6%.  Critics argue these fees, such as for overdrafts or wire transfers, far  exceed the cost of providing the services.  

"Banks have been raising fees steadily for two decades to offset low  interest rates and generate profits," said Duff Conacher, co-founder of  Democracy Watch, a non-profit watchdog. "It's gouging and price-gouging."

High credit card interest rates were another source of frustration.  Although the Bank of Canada benchmark rate is only 0.25%, the average annual  percentage rate (APR) on credit cards is around 20% according to Ratehub.ca.  The six biggest banks control over 90% of the credit card market,  limiting choice for consumers.

In an open letter, a debt counselling organization urged Finance  Minister Bill Morneau to take action on "predatory" lending practices.  "Excessive fees and interest rates are damaging the financial health of  consumers and the Canadian economy," the letter stated.  

In response, the Canadian Bankers Association noted that Canada has  a competitive and innovative banking sector that provides "good value" to  customers. The CBA said costs are rising for security and compliance, and  interest rates reflect risk. It added that Canadian rates are lower than  other countries and regulations already protect consumers.

However, some argue tougher rules are still needed to curb fee and  rate gouging in the oligopolistic banking sector. "There is a growing  public consensus that the current regulatory framework does not  sufficiently protect consumers,‚Äù said PIAC, a consumer advocacy group.

With strong profits and resentment simmering, Canada's big banks face a balancing act to maintain their earnings momentum while also keeping customers and policymakers onside. The result could be a push for more regulatory or policy changes to level the playing field in the years ahead. Overall, while shareholders will celebrate the latest results, customers may remain unimpressed with the costs of doing business with the country's dominant banks.
