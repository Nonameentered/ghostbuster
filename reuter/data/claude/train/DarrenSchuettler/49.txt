Canada's Financial Markets React Favorably to Finance Minister Paul Martin's 1997/98 Budget 

Canada's financial markets responded positively today after Finance Minister Paul Martin tabled the Liberal government's 1997/98 budget. The budget aims to eliminate the federal deficit within three years through a combination of spending cuts and revenue generation.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark S&P/TSX index rose over 200 points or 3% following the budget announcement. The Canadian dollar also strengthened against the U.S. dollar, appreciating nearly half a cent. Investors and analysts viewed the budget as credible, prudent and likely to inspire business confidence. 

The centerpiece of the budget is a plan to cut program spending by $17.3 billion over three years, including reductions in defense, infrastructure, and regional development spending. However, major social programs like healthcare and education were largely protected from cuts. The budget also pledged to find $2.5 billion in additional revenue through higher excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco and gasoline.

"This budget charts a credible path to eliminating the deficit, which should boost consumer and business confidence," said Craig Wright, Chief Economist at RBC. "While spending cuts will slow economic growth modestly, the overall impact of deficit reduction will be positive for interest rates and the Canadian dollar."

The budget projected a deficit of $17 billion for 1997/98, down from $19.7 billion last fiscal year. If projections hold, this would represent the sixth consecutive year of declining deficits. However, the path to a balanced budget relies on restrained spending growth and steady economic expansion averaging 2.2% annually. Some critics argue this leaves little room for error.

"The government is depending heavily on favourable economic conditions to balance the books," said David Dodge, former Bank of Canada governor. "If growth or interest rates deviate from projections, the deficit targets could easily be missed."

Still, most analysts applauded the government's determination and probability of success. With spending cuts and the economy on track, the federal budget appears poised to drop into surplus by the fiscal year 1999/2000 for the first time since 1974. For Canada's finance minister and markets, that outcome looks increasingly within reach.
