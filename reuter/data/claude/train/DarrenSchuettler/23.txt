T.A. Associates Launches Rival Bid for Canada's Altamira Management Ltd. Amid Ongoing Legal Battle 

T.A. Associates, a Boston-based private equity firm, launched a rival takeover bid today for Canada's Altamira Management Ltd, a distressed debt investor and owner of nearly $2 billion in nonperforming loans. T.A. Associates offered $3.1 billion in cash for Altamira, topping an earlier $2.9 billion bid from a consortium led by Cerberus Capital Management and Broadhaven Capital Partners.

The new bid injects further drama into the high-stakes fight for control of Altamira, which has been mired in legal disputes in recent months. Minority shareholders of Altamira have alleged that the Cerberus-led consortium's bid undervalues the company and is designed primarily to benefit board members and large shareholders. Two separate lawsuits were filed last month seeking to block the Cerberus bid.

In a letter to Altamira's board of directors, T.A. Associates said its all-cash offer represents a 10% premium over the Cerberus group's bid. "We believe our proposal constitutes a superior offer that is in the best interests of all Altamira shareholders," the letter said. T.A. Associates also pledged to drop all outstanding litigation related to the takeover if its bid is accepted.

Altamira's board has not yet formally responded to the new bid. In a statement, the company said the board "will carefully consider the T.A. Associates proposal in due course and determine the course of action that maximizes value for all Altamira shareholders." The board continues to recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the Cerberus-led bid at a meeting next week.

Analysts said the new bid places pressure on the Altamira board and the consortium to revise their offer. "It appears T.A. Associates sees significant untapped value in Altamira that isn't reflected in the current deal," said Martin Stevens, a distressed debt analyst at Harbour Advisors. "The board will have to take this seriously and get the consortium to pony up more cash, otherwise they risk a shareholder revolt."

Cerberus and its partners could increase their bid or attempt to negotiate directly with large Altamira shareholders in a bid to salvage their deal. But upping the ante further could dent the returns targeted by the consortium when the takeover was first launched early this year. The Altamira deal is a key part of Cerberus's strategy to expand its investments in global nonperforming loan portfolios.

The takeover tussle is poised to intensify just as Altamira seeks to expand its presence in new markets and tap continued strong investor interest in distressed assets. Altamira posted a 15% increase in assets under management in 2019 and recently launched new funds focused on nonperforming loans in Brazil and China.
