Royal Bank of Canada Surprises Shareholders with Record Annual Profit and Dividend Hike

The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) announced record annual profits for 2019-2020 and an unexpected increase in dividends for shareholders. The bank's net income was $12.9 billion for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2020, up 2% from the previous year. But the biggest surprise was an 11% boost to the quarterly common share dividend,which will be now 63 cents per share.

RBC's strong performance despite the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has buoyed investor sentiment. The bank's shares jumped 12% after the announcement of the record profit and dividend hike.

The quarterly profit of $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter alone surpassed analysts' expectations. Revenue was $12.4 billion, up from $12.38 billion a year earlier and higher than the $12.17 billion expected by analysts.

"Our results this year speak to the resilience of our diversified business model, the dedication of our employees and the strength of our technology infrastructure in a very challenging operating environment," said Dave McKay, President and CEO of RBC.

RBC enjoyed double-digit growth in its banking, wealth, and asset management divisions as people increasingly conducted their financial transactions online and through mobile apps during the pandemic. The bank's provisions for credit losses declined 28% from a year earlier, signaling that RBC does not expect widespread defaults on loans and mortgages despite the economic crisis.

"We are well positioned for 2021 with a strong balance sheet, leading market positions, and disciplined expense management to support our strategic investments," McKay said. "While the pace of economic recovery remains uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic that widespread vaccination will spur a rebound starting in mid-2021."

The Royal Bank of Canada is Canada's largest bank by assets and market capitalization. It is among the biggest banks in North America, with over 70 domestic branches and offices in 15 other countries. RBC is a global leader in diversity and social inclusion, with over 86,000 employees serving more than 17 million clients.
