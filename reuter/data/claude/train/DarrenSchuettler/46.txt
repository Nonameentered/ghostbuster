Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves plans to reduce budget cuts thanks to stronger economy 

Ontario's Finance Minister Ernie Eves announced today that the provincial government will be scaling back planned budget cuts for the coming fiscal year thanks to a stronger than expected economic performance. The cuts to healthcare, education, and other public services will now be $2 billion less than originally projected in the budget, Eves said in a press conference.

The revised budget plan comes as economic growth in Ontario has accelerated over the past six months, leading to higher tax revenues for the government. Economic expansion in the second half of the year is now forecast to be 3.2%, up from the 1.9% projected in the original March budget. The jobless rate has also declined faster than expected. "TheOntario economy has turned a corner and is gaining strength," said Eves. "As a government, we have a responsibility to respond to this improved fiscal situation."

The reduced budget cuts will mean $1.2 billion in additional health spending, $500 million more for primary and secondary schools, and $300 million for colleges and universities in the next fiscal year. Eves stressed that this new spending will be one-time, as the government is still committed to eliminating the deficit over the next two years as previously legislated. He also pledged to make up for the lost cuts in later years if economic growth slows.

Reaction from opposition parties was mixed. The Liberals said the government was too quick to cut in the first place and the reduced cuts do not make up for damage already done. The NDP said the government's budget plan remains too harsh on average workers and public services. However, business groups welcomed the government's continued commitment to fiscal discipline and balancing the books. 

The revised budget will be officially tabled in the legislature this afternoon. Eves said the government's prudent approach means Ontario's economy can now accelerate with the tax relief and investment in priority services to further support growth. The Finance Minister expressed optimism that continued fiscal responsibility and economic expansion can go hand in hand.
