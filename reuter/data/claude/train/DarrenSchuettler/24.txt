Major Shareholders of Altamira Management Ltd. Set Deadline for Court Action Against Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. Ltd. Takeover Bid 

A group of major shareholders in Altamira Management Ltd., one of Canada's largest asset management firms, announced today that they have set a deadline of June 15th for commencing legal action against Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. Ltd. (Manulife)’s hostile takeover bid for Altamira. The shareholder group, which controls over 30% of Altamira's shares, has argued that Manulife's all-cash offer of $52 per share significantly undervalues Altamira and its future growth prospects.

In a press release, the shareholder group said "the timing of Manulife’s opportunistic hostile bid is designed to take advantage of short-term market volatility and in no way reflects the intrinsic value and immense potential of Altamira’s business." The group has consistently stated that an offer of at least $68 per share would be required for them to consider supporting a sale of Altamira. At the current offered price, the total takeover bid would be valued at over $3.1 billion.

Manulife, Canada's largest insurance company, first announced its intentions to acquire Altamira in an unsolicited, all-cash takeover bid in late April. Manulife has argued that the acquisition of Altamira would strengthen its asset management division and increase its presence in the high-net-worth and institutional client segments. Manulife has said that $52 per share is a "full and fair offer" based on an analysis of Altamira's business and future financial projections. Manulife has also threatened to take its offer directly to Altamira's shareholders if the company's board of directors continues to reject its bid.

The shareholder group opposing the deal includes two of Altamira's founders, who still own over 10% of shares, combined with several major pension funds and institutional investors. They argue that Altamira's share price does not reflect the company's strong fundamentals and leadership in the alternative asset management space. The group claims Altamira is poised for rapid growth over the next 3 to 5 years as institutional clients increasingly move money into alternative and private market investments. The group has said they are prepared to commence legal proceedings to block the takeover bid if Manulife does not increase its offer by the June 15th deadline.
