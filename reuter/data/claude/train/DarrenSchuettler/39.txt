CBC Cuts 1,000 Jobs Amid Overhaul and Potential Fund-raising and Corporate Sponsorships  

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) announced today that it will cut 1,000 jobs, or about 20% of its total workforce, over the next two years. The cuts are part of a major overhaul of the public broadcaster with the goal to shift into a digital-first organization. 

CBC President and CEO Catherine Tait said the job losses are necessary to redirect funds to produce more digital content, especially on streaming platforms, and to better compete with global media giants like Netflix and Disney. "Changes in technology and audience behavior mean that the CBC needs to continue evolving in order to stay vibrant and relevant," said Tait. "Our plan requires us to make difficult but necessary reductions in staff over three years starting this fiscal year."

The cuts will reduce the number of jobs across English and French radio and TV operations, as well as at corporate support levels. However, CBC will add up to 200 new positions in its digital operations to support the new digital-first strategy. CBC aims to have an overall staff of 4,000 permanent employees by 2021-22.

With its funding primarily coming from the federal government, the CBC is also planning to generate additional revenues through fund-raising and sponsorships with corporate partners, which can lead to questions about editorial independence. Tait has denied accusations that corporate sponsorships will compromise the CBC’s journalistic integrity and editorial independence. “The fundamentals of public broadcasting - editorial integrity, quality Canadian content - they don't change at all,” she said.

The announcement of the massive cuts and reorganization was immediately met with criticism from industry groups and the CBC’s own union. The Canadian Media Guild called on the federal government to increase funding for the CBC to prevent the job losses. However, Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said that "the government has no plans to change the overall level of funding for CBC/Radio-Canada." The overhaul is certain to cause uncertainty over CBC’s future as it navigates technological disruptions and evolving audience needs. But with strategic digital investments and new funding sources, CBC hopes to thrive as a next-generation public broadcaster.
