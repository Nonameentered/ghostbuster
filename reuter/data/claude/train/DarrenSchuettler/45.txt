Shivering Enthusiasts Brave Frigid Conditions to Harvest Rare Icewine  

Dozens of intrepid wine lovers bundled up to brave temperatures of -8 degrees Celsius in the early hours of the morning on Saturday for a chance to harvest grapes for the prized icewine that is produced in the Niagara region.  

Icewine is made from grapes that have been left on the vine after the normal harvest to develop higher sugar levels. The grapes can only be picked once the temperature drops below -8°C, freezing the grapes on the vine. The concentrated juice from these frozen grapes produces a sweet nectar that is renowned around the world. 

“Picking icewine is a rare opportunity and a real experience for wine enthusiasts,” said Jill Cartier, a spokeswoman for Icewine Harvesting Tours. Her company offers tours that allow visitors to pick grapes at an icewine vineyard to get a firsthand taste of the challenging conditions required to produce this sought-after wine.

At 6 am on Saturday morning, a group of 43 visitors from as far away as Texas and California arrived at Cave Spring Cellars in Beamsville, Ontario, ready to harvest Riesling grapes for the winery’s 2019 icewine vintage. However, even with multiple layers of clothing, insulated boots, gloves, and hats, the frigid conditions took their toll. 

“My hands were numb after just five minutes out there,” said Chad Williams, a retiree from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “But it was worth it to be able to pick those amazing grapes and know I had a small part in making something really special.”

The Riesling grapes, left on the vine since the normal harvest in October, had frozen solid during the recent cold snap in Niagara. Vineyard staff carefully inspected grapes for the optimal sugar levels before giving visitors the okay to start snipping.

“The hard work of our visitors during those cold hours means we will have a very limited but exceptional vintage of Cave Spring icewine this year,” said winemaker Angelo Pavan. “We are grateful so many brave souls came out to experience the harvest and lend a hand.”  

The harvested grapes were pressed immediately, yielding only a tiny amount of concentrated juice. Once fermented, the final icewine will have a sugar content of 35% or higher and an intense fruit aroma and flavor. Most visitors took the opportunity to taste last year’s vintage of Cave Spring icewine following their harvest efforts.

“After all that work in the cold, the taste of that lovely icewine was the sweetest reward,” said Karen Thomsen, who traveled from Winnipeg with her husband for the tour. “I’ll never forget this experience.”

 With another successful icewine harvest in the books, enthusiasts will now have to wait again for the right weather conditions to produce the next vintage of this quintessential Canadian delicacy. The limited release of Cave Spring 2019 Riesling Icewine will be available for purchase at the winery in the coming months for approximately $50 per 375mL bottle—if you’re quick and lucky enough to snag one before they sell out.
