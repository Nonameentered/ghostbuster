Canadian banks hope for tax relief in upcoming budget, but analysts doubt major changes

Canada's largest banks are hoping the upcoming federal budget will provide some tax relief to boost their profits, but industry analysts are skeptical significant changes are on the way.

The Big Six banks—Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and National Bank of Canada—are pushing for changes like lower corporate tax rates and taxes on stock options for executives. However, the Liberals have signaled tax cuts are unlikely given the government's focus on spending on social programs and infrastructure.

"The banks always ask for tax relief, but there are a lot of competing priorities in this budget," said John Aiken, an analyst at Barclays Capital. "With an election looming, new spending programs seem to be a higher priority than broad-based tax cuts."

Finance Minister Bill Morneau's budget on March 19 is expected to focus on initiatives around affordable housing, skills training, green infrastructure, and childcare. The budget is seen as a launch pad for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's re-election platform ahead of an expected vote in October.

Still, the banks argue Canada's tax regime is uncompetitive compared with other countries and discourages investment in Canada. They point to lower business tax rates and more generous tax treatment of stock options in the recent U.S. tax reforms.

"Canada's tax system needs to keep up with competing countries to continue attracting investment," said Neil Parmenter, chief executive of Canadian Bankers Association. "Tax relief for businesses would allow banks to accelerate investments in technologies and people that benefit all Canadians."  

However, tax policy experts argue Canada's corporate tax rates are already competitive and that lower rates primarily benefit higher-income shareholders.

"There is little evidence that corporate tax cuts lead to higher business investment or benefit the overall economy," said Kevin Milligan, an economist at the University of British Columbia. 

With the budget deficit on track to exceed $20 billion this fiscal year, the government also has little fiscal room for major tax cuts, analysts said. Though interest rates have risen, debt servicing costs remain affordable due to low rates. Still, credit rating agencies are watching closely for a credible plan to balance the books.

"Modest tax adjustments are possible but expect the budget to largely maintain the status quo," Aiken said. "Significant tax relief for the banks seems unlikely this year."
