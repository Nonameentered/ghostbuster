Canada's Big Six Banks Set for Another Record-Breaking Year, but Analysts Predict Slowing Growth in 1997  

Canada's largest banks are on track to report record profits for fiscal 1996, continuing a streak of strong performance over the past several years. However, analysts warn that slowing economic growth and increased competition could pressure bank earnings in 1997.

The Big Six banks—Royal Bank, TD Bank, Scotiabank, CIBC, BMO, and National Bank—are expected to announce double-digit profit growth for the year ended October 31st, according to analysts. "The banks have benefited from a strong Canadian economy, low loan losses, and expense control," said John Aiken, an analyst at Barclays Capital. Net income for the group could top C$12 billion, up from $10.8 billion in 1995.

Revenue growth has accelerated this year thanks to higher business volumes, expanded fee income, and rising interest rates. Residential mortgage growth has boomed, while commercial lending and credit card balances have also climbed quickly. "Robust top-line growth and stable expenses have fueled profit margins," said Mario Mendonca, an analyst at TD Securities. Return on equity for the banks could exceed 16% this year, a level not seen since before the 1990 recession.  

However, economic storm clouds gathering could dampen the party. Interest rates have started to decline, and the pace of job creation and household spending is slowing. "The banks have enjoyed a prolonged period of strong, steady growth, but the economic cycle is maturing," said Bradley Saunders, head of Canadian Financial Services at Blackmont Capital. Credit losses remain near historic lows but are poised to creep higher if conditions worsen. Ongoing technological investments also require higher spending, crimping efficiency gains.

Competitive pressures are another concern. Foreign banks continue to expand in Canada, while credit unions and insurance companies are taking a bigger slice of the lending and wealth management markets. "The competitive field is becoming more crowded, and the battle for customers more fierce," said Barclays' Aiken. "This will restrain revenue and profit growth for the established players." 

While the short-term outlook remains positive, most analysts predict bank earnings growth will decelerate in the coming year. According to the median forecast, net income for the Big Six banks will increase 6-8% in 1997. That would be the slowest pace of profit growth since 1992 but still surpass the performance of most industries. For now, the long rally rolls on—but more difficult times may lie ahead.
