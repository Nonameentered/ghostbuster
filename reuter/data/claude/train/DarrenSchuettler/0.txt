Bob Dylan Fans Outraged Over Bank of Montreal's Use of "The Times They Are a-Changin" in TV Commercial 

Bob Dylan fans were up in arms this week over the Bank of Montreal's use of Dylan's famous 1964 anthem "The Times They Are a-Changin'" in a new TV commercial. The ad depicts a montage of scenes highlighting how technology and society have progressed over the decades. However, Dylan's fans argue that the use of the song, which was originally written as a protest anthem for political and social change, is inappropriate for a bank's commercial marketing campaign.

The Bank of Montreal's new ad launched Monday as part of a rebranding effort focused on innovation and social change. The 60-second spot uses a cover version of "The Times They Are a-Changin'" as the soundtrack for images of the civil rights movement, the moon landing, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and recent technologies like mobile payments and artificial intelligence. The ad suggests the bank has been "changing with the times for 200 years."

However, Bob Dylan fans were quick to call out what they see as the inappropriate co-opting of an iconic song. "Dylan wrote that song as a call for radical social change, not to help some bank make a quick buck," said Mark Stevens, a moderator for the popular Bob Dylan fan site Expecting Rain. Critics argue the ad glosses over the song's original protest message and meaning. Calls for the bank to pull the ad are trending on music and Dylan-focused social media sites and message boards.

The Bank of Montreal has defended the use of the song, saying that "The Times They Are a-Changin'" is an anthem for progress and social change which aligns well with the theme of looking toward the future. However, Dylan's record label Sony/ATV Music Publishing declined to comment on whether the Bob Dylan camp approved the commercial licensing of the song. Dylan's representatives and Bank of Montreal officials were not available for comment. While legal, the appropriation of protest music for commercial use remains controversial and this appears to be a misstep that has raised the ire of Bob Dylan's loyal fans worldwide.
