Ontario Hydro to Take Massive $1.8 Billion Charge to Strengthen Financial Structure 

Ontario Hydro, the provincial utility, announced today that it will take a $1.8 billion charge against earnings in order to strengthen its balance sheet and ensure long term financial stability. The write-down comes after a strategic review conducted by the new CEO and board of directors appointed earlier this year.

The review found that Ontario Hydro has significant underfunded liabilities and financial commitments from past investment decisions and electricity purchasing contracts. The $1.8 billion charge will allow the utility to establish adequate reserves and provisions to address these legacy liabilities and place the company on stronger financial footing going forward.

"We conducted a thorough analysis of the company's financial position and found unaddressed liabilities from the past that threaten Ontario Hydro's long term financial health if left unaddressed," said CEO Brian Smith. "While taking a charge of this magnitude is difficult, it is necessary in order to provide transparency to investors and customers about the true state of the company's finances. We are putting the past behind us and establishing a stronger foundation for the future."

The review found $1.2 billion in underfunded liabilities related to nuclear decommissioning and waste management responsibilities. The company has 30 operating nuclear plants that will need to be safely decommissioned over the coming decades. The review also found $400 million in losses and costs from long term fixed price energy purchase contracts signed up to 10 years ago when electricity wholesale market prices were significantly higher. Addressing these and other issues now will avoid larger financial problems down the road, according to the company.

The charge will not have an immediate impact on electricity rates for Ontario customers, though it may factor into applications for modest rate increases in the coming years. The company emphasized that residential and commercial rates will still remain competitive nationally. The company will announce further details on the charge and its implications when it releases full-year financial results next month.

Investors reacted negatively to the announcement, sending Ontario Hydro shares down over 10% in trading. However, some analysts praised the new management for addressing financial problems proactively and working to establish a more sustainable fiscal path for the large utility. Ontario Hydro provides electricity and transmission service to over 5 million customers across the province.
