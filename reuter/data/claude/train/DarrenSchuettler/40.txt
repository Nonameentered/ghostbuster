Laidlaw Inc announces major moves in ambulance services and waste management worth over $2 billion, shares soar

Laidlaw Inc, a leading provider of environmental and transportation services, announced two major acquisitions today worth over $2 billion combined. The company will acquire National Ambulance Corporation, one of the largest private ambulance operators in the U.S., as well as Amwaste Inc, a regional waste management firm operating in the Midwest. 

Laidlaw will pay $1.2 billion in cash to acquire National Ambulance Corp, which operates a fleet of over 2,000 ambulances across 38 states. The deal will make Laidlaw the second largest ambulance operator in the country and accelerate its strategic goal to expand its transportation services segment. “This acquisition allows us to provide critical healthcare transportation services to millions of additional Americans in both emergency and non-emergency situations,” said John Smith, Laidlaw’s CEO. 

Laidlaw will finance the National Ambulance deal using a combination of cash on hand and new debt. The company expects cost synergies of $80 million within the first two years of closing the deal. National Ambulance is expected to generate over $700 million in revenue this year.

In a separate all-cash transaction, Laidlaw will pay $850 million for Amwaste Inc, a regional waste collection company with operations centered in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. Amwaste operates a fleet of over 800 waste collection vehicles and seven waste transfer stations. The acquisition will significantly strengthen Laidlaw’s existing waste operations in the Midwest.

“We continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that reinforce our position as a leading environmental services provider in North America,” said Smith. “Amwaste is a high-quality operator in a region where we want to expand, and it will enhance our dedicated fleet, transfer station and disposal network in the Midwest.”

Laidlaw expects the deals to close within 4-6 months, subject to regulatory approvals. The company’s shares rose over 15% on the news, reflecting investor enthusiasm for the diversified expansion of Laidlaw’s transportation and environmental services operations. The acquisitions highlight Laidlaw’s ability to deploy capital for targeted, accretive deals that strengthen its competitive position, according to analysts.
