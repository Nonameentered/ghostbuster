Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce report strong Q3 earnings

Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, two of Canada's largest banks, reported strong third quarter earnings today driven by growth in their retail and commercial banking operations. 

Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's biggest bank, said profit rose 4% to $3.3 billion Canadian dollars ($2.5 billion) in the three months ended July 31, up from $3.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue increased 7.1% to $12.4 billion, beating analysts' expectations. Strong mortgage lending and higher interest rates contributed to the improved results.

"Solid volume growth in Canadian Banking and strong performance in our market-sensitive businesses drove good revenue growth and positive operating leverage this quarter," Royal Bank CEO David McKay said in a statement.

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported net income of $1.37 billion, up 10% from a year ago. Revenue grew 6.2% to $4.99 billion. The performance was driven by robust commercial and retail banking activity in Canada as well as in the United States. The bank also benefited from higher interest rates in both Canada and the U.S.

"We delivered strong and broad-based results this quarter with contributions across all business lines," CIBC CEO Victor Dodig said. "Our investments in talent, technology and client experience continue to deliver value and position us well for the future."

The solid results from Royal Bank and CIBC follow strong earnings reports from Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank last week. Canada's major banks, ranked among the world's strongest, have posted forecast-beating results over the past several quarters, fueling their stocks to record highs. Barring any major economic downturns, analysts expect the string of strong results to continue in the coming quarters backed by higher interest rates and loan growth.
