Hyder's Shares Soar as Profits Rise by 25% Thanks to Takeover of Electricity Business Swalec 

Shares in the energy provider Hyder surged nearly 10% today after the company announced a 25% increase in profits for the first half of the year. The boost in earnings was largely due to Hyder’s acquisition of Swalec, an electricity distribution business, which completed in January of this year.

Hyder’s pre-tax profits rose to £275 million in the six months ending June 30th, up from £220 million during the same period last year. Revenues also climbed 18% to £1.7 billion, reflecting the addition of Swalec to Hyder’s group of companies. Hyder supplies gas and electricity to over 5 million households across the UK.

The takeover of Swalec added over 1 million customers to Hyder’s consumer base and strengthened its electricity distribution infrastructure, especially in South Wales and parts of Gloucestershire. According to Hyder’s chief executive, Amanda Johns, “The acquisition of Swalec was a pivotal moment for our company and has made us a more formidable force in the UK energy market. We are already reaping the benefits of having Swalec under our umbrella, and there is significant potential for further gains as we integrate our operations over the coming years.”

Hyder expects to achieve cost savings of at least £50 million per year within three years by merging infrastructure and streamlining operations across the combined group. The company is also hoping to cross-sell more products to Swalec’s customer base, including smart meters and boiler care plans. 

Despite the strong results, Ms. Johns warned that Hyder faces “many challenges and uncertainties in the wider economy.” The energy regulator Ofgem recently imposed a price cap on some tariffs to protect households, while politicians have discussed renationalizing parts of the UK energy system. Brexit could also impact the company’s costs and supply chains.

Hyder’s shares closed the day up 67 pence at £7.82, just shy of the company’s record high. Analysts remained upbeat about Hyder’s prospects, especially if it can continue to successfully leverage the Swalec acquisition to boost profits over the medium and long term.
