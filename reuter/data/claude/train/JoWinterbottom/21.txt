CalEnergy Launches $1.2 Billion Takeover Bid for Northern Electric Plc, Promptly Rejected

CalEnergy, one of the largest power companies in Western US, made a $1.2 billion takeover bid for Northern Electric Plc., one of Britain's main electricity generation and distribution companies. CalEnergy offered 250 pence ($3.50) per share in cash for Northern Electric, an 18% premium over the closing price of Northern Electric's shares last week. The all-cash deal would value Northern Electric at £1.5 billion ($2 billion). 

Northern Electric's board promptly rejected the bid, stating that it "significantly undervalues" the company. Northern Electric's shares jumped 15% on news of the bid. Analysts suggested CalEnergy would likely raise its offer, as Northern Electric's renewable energy and smart grid assets would help CalEnergy expand outside its core markets and accelerate its energy transition plans. However, CalEnergy hit back stating that 250 pence per share was its "best and final" offer.

CalEnergy has been under pressure from activist shareholders to diversify from its traditional oil and natural gas power plants. Acquiring Northern Electric, which generates 20% of its electricity from solar and wind, would advance CalEnergy's goal to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Northern Electric also provides advanced energy management services to help customers improve energy efficiency.

The takeover battle comes as Britain aims to triple renewable energy generation and reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Northern Electric has plans to invest £2.5 billion over the next 5 years to expand its renewable power generation and upgrade infrastructure. CalEnergy sees an opportunity to accelerate those investment plans with its large balance sheet.

However, Northern Electric's chairman Michael Edwards insisted the company can create more value for shareholders by remaining independent. The company has delivered steady returns to shareholders through its generation of reliable electricity supply and dividend payments. Its shares have generated a return of 220% over the last decade, beating the wider stock market.  

CalEnergy will need to make a far more compelling offer to convince Northern Electric and its shareholders. Most analysts think an offer of at least 300 to 350 pence per share, valuing the company at £2.2 billion to £2.6 billion ($3 billion to $3.5 billion), may be needed to bring Northern Electric to the negotiating table. Whether CalEnergy will raise its bid that significantly remains to be seen. The battle for Britain's electricity future, and one of its most attractive infrastructure assets, is set to intensify.
