Northern Electric Defends Against Undervalued $1.225 Billion Bid by American CE Electric

Northern Electric, a major electric utility serving 3.2 million customers across the Midwest, announced today that its board of directors has rejected an unsolicited acquisition offer from American CE Electric to acquire Northern Electric for $1.225 billion in cash. The board of Northern Electric determined that the offer by American CE Electric significantly undervalues Northern Electric and its prospects. 

"After careful review, our board has concluded that the offer by American CE Electric does not come close to fully recognizing the long-term value of our company," said Jane Thompson, CEO of Northern Electric. "We have assembled an attractive set of renewable energy and infrastructure assets, invested billions of dollars in improving our grids, and developed valuable relationships with the communities we serve. The offer fails to adequately compensate our shareholders for these accomplishments and the bright future we foresee."

American CE Electric and its private equity owner, Texas Pacific Group, had proposed to pay $48 per share in cash for Northern Electric, a premium of only 12 percent over Northern Electric's stock price prior to the announcement. Northern Electric shares rose briefly following the announcement of the offer then declined as investors interpreted the company's statement as signaling the unlikeliness of a deal at the proposed price. Northern Electric has a current market capitalization of $1.42 billion.   

"We are disappointed that Northern Electric's board did not see the significant benefits of our offer, which provides an immediate and attractive cash premium to shareholders," said Martin Richards, CEO of American CE Electric. "We continue to believe there is a compelling strategic rationale for combining our companies to better serve customers, invest in new technologies, and operate more efficiently. We hope that Northern Electric's board and management team revisit their decision and work with us toward a negotiated transaction."

Northern Electric has been seeking to expand its investments in renewable energy and implement grid modernization projects across its service territory. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to add over 1 gigawatt of new wind and solar power and upgrade thousands of miles of transmission lines over the next decade. These initiatives are aimed at enabling customer choice, improving reliability and affordability, and achieving ambitious environmental goals.

“Our vision is to lead the transition to a clean energy future in a way that is affordable, creates new jobs, and generates economic growth across our region,” Thompson said. “We do not believe this vision would be best achieved by accepting an offer that fails to fully value our company and its aspirations.”

Northern Electric said its board and management remain open to considering all opportunities to create shareholder value and advance its strategic priorities. However, the company stated that any engagement with American CE Electric would need to start from a "significantly improved offer" that properly values Northern Electric, its assets, and its prospects.
