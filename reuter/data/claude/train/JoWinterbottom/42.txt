U.S. Entergy Plans Potential $2 Billion Bid for London Electricity 

U.S. power company Entergy Corp is considering making a $2 billion takeover bid for London Electricity Plc, according to people familiar with the situation. Entergy, which generates and distributes power to parts of the U.S. South and Midwest, has been evaluating a bid for London Electricity for several weeks and could make an offer as soon as January, the people said. 

London Electricity operates electricity distribution networks across London and southern England, serving around 3.5 million customers. The potential deal highlights the attractiveness of U.K. utilities to overseas buyers, drawn by stable returns and sought-after infrastructure assets. Any deal is far from guaranteed, and Entergy could still decide against pursuing an acquisition, the people said.

Entergy is working with advisers on a bid for London Electricity, though it hasn’t yet made a formal approach, the people said. London Electricity’s owner, the investment fund KKR, will only engage in talks if a sufficiently attractive offer is made, and there is no certainty a deal will be reached, they said.

Entergy generates electricity through power plants in the South and Midwest U.S., and delivers electricity to 2.9 million customers across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The New Orleans-based company has looked to expand its regulated utility operations to diversify away from wholesale power markets. The company has a market value of $22 billion.

Buying London Electricity would mark a bold move into international markets and strength Entergy’s position in regulated utilities. However, some analystsquestion whether such a deal would align strategically and fit within Entergy’s geographic footprint. There is also likely to be political scrutiny of a U.S. company buying critical national infrastructure.

Representatives for Entergy and London Electricity declined to comment. KKR didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. News of the potential deal was first reported by Bloomberg News.
