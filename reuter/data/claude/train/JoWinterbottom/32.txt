Political pressures may slow down latest wave of takeovers of British regional electricity companies (Recs) ahead of general election, say analysts

The latest flurry of merger and acquisition activity in Britain's regional electricity sector may stall in the coming months due to increasing political scrutiny and sensitivities ahead of the next general election, according to industry analysts.

Three sizable deals have been announced in the past four months that would see some of the largest remaining independent regional electricity companies (Recs) taken over by major European utilities. However, these deals are yet to receive full regulatory approval and the election factor may lead to delays or concessions, experts suggest.

In October, France's state-controlled EDF reached a preliminary deal to acquire Eastern Power Networks for £2.2 billion. Last month, Iberdrola of Spain signed an agreement to take over Scottish Power Energy Networks Holdings in a transaction worth £2.6 billion. And most recently, the Czech group EPH announced its intention to buy a majority stake in ESB Energy, the electricity distribution unit of Ireland's Electricity Supply Board, in a deal valued at £1.8 billion.  

The Recs sector is seen as an attractive investment target for large utilities seeking stable cash-generating businesses, but takeovers in such a strategic industry invariably face close regulatory scrutiny, especially when the buyers are foreign state-backed enterprises. With a general election looming, the political spotlight will intensify, analysts say.

"Scrutiny of foreign acquisitions in the UK critical infrastructure space has been increasing for some time but an election atmosphere will dial it up further," said Ben McPherson, senior energy analyst at Wood Mackenzie consulting firm. "The government will be very sensitive to any suggestion of UK strategic assets coming under excessive foreign control."

Mark Bell, head of the energy practice at consulting firm Frontier Economics, agreed the election significantly raised risks for the Recs deals. "The timing is awkward and the Review can get messy during election fever," he said. "I'd expect attempts to delay decisions until after the election or possibly revision of deal terms to alleviate concerns." 

Opposition parties will likely criticize the government for allowing British energy interests to come under foreign ownership, even if independent regulators approved the deals. The EU may also choose to weigh in due to the pan-European nature of the transactions, further complicating the picture. 

Whether the deals simply take longer to approve or require certain undertakings like price controls or investment pledges, most analysts expect the election to leave its mark. For the prospective buyers, that may mean a longer wait before finally getting their hands on the keys to Britain's electricity networks and the stable returns they promise. But for critics, it could represent a small victory in a longer effort to keep vital infrastructure in UK hands. The next few months will determine where the political and regulatory winds ultimately blow.
