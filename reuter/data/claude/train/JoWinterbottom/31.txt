Dominion Resources to Acquire East Midlands Electricity in £1.3bn Takeover Bid, but Faces UK Competition Doubts Ahead of General Election  

Dominion Resources, one of the largest electricity companies in the United States, announced today that it has made an offer to acquire East Midlands Electricity in a £1.3 billion takeover bid. The acquisition, if approved by regulators, would significantly expand Dominion's operations in the UK energy market. However, the deal is likely to face scrutiny from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority as well as politicians ahead of next year's general election.

East Midlands Electricity serves more than 3.7 million customers across central parts of England, including major cities such as Nottingham, Leicester, and Derby. The company is currently owned by a consortium of pension funds and infrastructure investors. Dominion, which is based in Richmond, Virginia, serves nearly 6 million customers in 15 states along the eastern seaboard of the US. Dominion said the acquisition of East Midlands Electricity is part of its international growth strategy to diversify into regulated utilities abroad.

"East Midlands Electricity is a prized infrastructure asset and this acquisition would represent an important new platform for growth in the UK market," said Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman and CEO of Dominion Energy. He added that Dominion is committed to "maintaining high reliability, customer service, and a safe work environment" at East Midlands Electricity. The deal is expected to close next year pending reviews and approvals.

However, the acquisition is likely to face close scrutiny by UK regulators and politicians, especially after recent concerns over high prices and poor service in some British utilities. The opposition Labour party called for the deal to be halted immediately so it could be reviewed by authorities and evaluated as to whether it was in the public interest. "Foreign takeovers cannot simply be waved through without proper oversight," said a Labour spokesman. The government said the deal would be reviewed to ensure compliance with regulations for fair competition in essential services. 

Under the terms of the deal, Dominion would gain 100% ownership and control over East Midlands Electricity's power distribution operations, which cover 64,000 kilometers of power lines across the region. The acquisition grew out of an initial partnership formed last year for specific joint projects between the two companies. Dominion said that building on that partnership through outright acquisition will allow greater efficiencies and improved service for customers over the long run. East Midlands Electricity declined to comment on the deal. Its board is reviewing Dominion's offer and considering its options.
