US firm Entergy considers £1.2bn bid for London Electricity

US power generator Entergy Corp is considering making a £1.2 billion takeover bid for London Electricity, one of Britain's regional electricity suppliers, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Entergy, which operates nuclear power plants and delivers electricity to customers in the southern and midwestern US, is said to have held preliminary talks with National Grid, the owner of London Electricity. National Grid has been exploring options to sell London Electricity as part of a strategic review announced last year.

A bid from Entergy would continue a trend of US companies acquiring UK utility assets, attracted by stable returns. American rivals Exelon and FirstEnergy have made acquisitions in Britain in recent years.

With over 3 million customers, London Electricity is one of Britain's largest regional power suppliers, serving homes and businesses in the capital and surrounding areas. It generated revenues of £3.2 billion and profits of £230 million in 2016. National Grid has owned London Electricity since 2010 but chief executive John Pettigrew has made clear he is willing to sell certain assets to focus the FTSE 100 group of gas and power utilities on its core regulated networks.

Analysts claim Entergy's interest in London Electricity shows its desire to expand beyond the US as it faces a more challenging regulatory backdrop in its domestic market. Tightening environmental rules and the growth of renewable energy generation have created headwinds for traditional nuclear and gas-fired power producers. An acquisition of London Electricity would give Entergy a platform for growth in the more supportive UK market and also an opportunity to diversify its business mix into power supply and retail.

While talks are at an early stage, Entergy's interest signals healthy investor appetite for UK utilities given their stable cash generation and dividends. However, sources warned a deal was not certain and National Grid may yet decide to retain London Electricity. National Grid and Entergy both declined to comment.
