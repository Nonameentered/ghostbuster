Dominion Resources Completes $2.15 Billion Deal for East Midlands Electricity with Concerns of Obstacles from British Competition Authorities

Dominion Resources, a Richmond, Virginia-based energy company, completed its $2.15 billion acquisition of the British utility East Midlands Electricity today despite concerns that the deal may face objections from U.K. competition authorities. 

The deal, first announced in April, will add over 2 million customer connections and 15,000 miles of power lines in central England to Dominion's portfolio. East Midlands Electricity serves customers across six counties including major cities like Leicester, Derby and Nottingham.

"We are excited to close on the acquisition of East Midlands Electricity and welcome their talented team members and customers to Dominion Energy," said Thomas F. Farrell, II, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Dominion Energy. "This acquisition expands our regulated electric and gas platform to an eighth U.S. state or Canadian province and is an excellent geographic, regulatory, and cultural fit."

The deal required approval from utility regulators in Virginia and North Carolina as well as the British government. However, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority has expressed concerns about potential anti-competitive effects given the consolidation it may bring to the electricity distribution market. The CMA could require Dominion to sell certain portions of the East Midlands Electricity business to third parties to address competition concerns, which could reduce the ultimate benefits of the acquisition to Dominion.

Analysts question whether Dominion fully understands the complex regulatory environment in the U.K. energy market. “Regulated utilities in the U.S. operate under a very different set of rules than in the U.K.,” said Hugh Wynne, utilities analyst at S&P Global Ratings. “There is a lot more political involvement in the regulation of utilities there. Dominion may face challenges navigating various layers of regulatory oversight that they are not accustomed to.”
