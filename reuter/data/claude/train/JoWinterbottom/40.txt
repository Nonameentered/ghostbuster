US company Entergy mulls £1.2bn bid for London Electricity 

US energy giant Entergy is considering a £1.2 billion takeover bid for London Electricity, one of Britain's regional electricity distributors. Entergy, which supplies power to parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, is exploring an expansion into the UK market through the acquisition of London Electricity, which provides electricity to homes and businesses in London and the South East.

According to sources close to the negotiations, Entergy views London Electricity as an attractive target because of its large customer base in a region with strong economic growth. London Electricity is currently owned by a consortium of infrastructure investors, including Macquarie Group. The potential deal under discussion could value London Electricity at around £1.2 billion, representing a 20 percent premium on its current market capitalization.

The prospective takeover of London Electricity is a bold move by Entergy to diversify its operations beyond the US at a time when the company faces a challenging market environment domestically. Demand for electricity has been flat or declining in parts of the US due to the increased adoption of energy efficiency measures and rooftop solar installations. In contrast, demand for power continues to rise steadily in London and across Britain. By acquiring London Electricity, Entergy stands to gain access to a new growth market.

However, the deal is far from certain and hinges on several factors, including price and regulatory approval. Entergy is likely to face significant competition from other bidders interested in London Electricity's attractive assets. What's more, any deal would require sign-off from regulators in both the UK and the US, as well as the shareholders of both companies. According to people familiar with the matter, while initial discussions between Entergy and London Electricity have been positive, a final agreement to proceed with the takeover could take several months of negotiations.  

Entergy and London Electricity declined to comment on the prospective deal or merger talks. Under UK takeover rules, Entergy has until next month to make a formal bid approach to London Electricity or walk away under a six-month cooling-off period. The coming weeks will prove crucial in determining whether this bold transatlantic merger can proceed.
