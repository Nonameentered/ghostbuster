Allied Domecq Rules Out Demerger and Focuses on Improving Operating Performance

Britain's Allied Domecq, the second-largest drinks company after Diageo, today announced that its board had reviewed the option of splitting up the company but decided against it. In a statement, Allied Domecq says it believes it can reach its goals for shareholder value by restructuring its business and improving its operating performance. 

For several years, analysts have speculated that Allied Domecq would benefit from splitting into separate spirits and wine companies. The rationale was that the two businesses have little in common and would perform better as focused entities. However, Allied Domecq chairman Philip Bowman said that "while demerging the two businesses might have theoretical benefits, we believe the costs and risks outweigh the potential rewards at this time."

Allied Domecq reported sales growth of 5% in its latest fiscal year, spurred by strong sales of its leading brands like Malibu rum, Kahlua, and Perrier-JouÃ«t champagne. However, its operating profits declined 4%, highlighting the need to cut costs and improve efficiency. The company announced a three-year plan to boost operating margins, including cutting 2,000 jobs, sourcing more materials centrally, and streamlining its product portfolio. 

"We have significant opportunities across procurement, marketing spend and overhead costs to improve our operating margin," said Philip Bowman. "Our performance on costs and efficiencies has not been good enough, and we are determined to strengthen our approach." The restructuring is expected to yield annual cost savings of at least 150 million pounds.

Some analysts remain skeptical about Allied Domecq's prospects and believe splitting up may eventually be needed. "There is a risk of distraction from the latest restructuring, and the targeted cost savings still seem quite modest relative to the scale of the challenge," said Keith Bowman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers. However, if Allied Domecq can successfully implement this new plan, its shares may rerate upwards and recap some of the ground lost against Diageo in recent years.

Allied Domecq's brands have suffered in comparison with Diageo's trendier, aspirational products like Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Ketel One vodka. However, Allied still owns several category-leading brands, especially in rum and tequila. Improving marketing and distribution of these core brands will be key to improving its performance over the long run. The company's focus on premiumization of its range should also support higher profit margins. 

If Allied Domecq's plan delivers the promised results, Mr. Bowman may yet be vindicated in keeping this drinks giant together. Stronger sales and profits growth could make the company an attractive takeover target, which would unlock value for shareholders and justify the decision to avoid a demerger at this time. However, another restructuring that fails to gain traction may exhaust investor patience and force Allied Domecq to finally split its spirits from its wine.
