Thames Water Reports Strong Rise in Profits and Dividend, Boosting Shares in Sector  

Thames Water, Britain's largest water company, reported a 12% rise in pretax profits to £635 million for the year ended March 31, boosted by higher tariffs and cost cutting. The utility also raised its dividend, sending its shares up 1%.

The results helped lift shares of other water companies, several of whom have also pledged higher payouts. United Utilities rose 0.8% and Severn Trent added 0.4%.

Thames Water said the increase in profits was achieved despite higher costs from greater investment in infrastructure, environmental improvements and leak reduction. Revenue rose 6% to £2.1 billion, reflecting an average tariff increase of 2% as permitted by the industry regulator.

The water company reduced operating costs by 3% through efficiency savings. It invested a record £979 million in infrastructure, 80% of which went toward improving services and maintaining existing assets. The remainder was spent on growth and environmental projects.

"We have delivered another strong set of results while driving efficiencies, reducing customer bills and increasing investment, said Steve Robertson, chief executive of Thames Water. “Customers remain at the heart of everything we do and providing them with great service and affordable bills is our top priority.”

The company increased its total dividend for the year by 3.2% to £318 million, or 38.7 pence a share. The rise beats the rate of inflation and reflects the company's confidence in its future performance, Mr. Robertson said.  

Thames Water provides water and wastewater services to 15 million customers across London and the Thames Valley. The company has pledged to cut average bills by 5% in real terms between 2010 and 2020. It is also investing heavily to meet various regulatory targets around areas such as leakage, interruptions to supply and pollution.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS CRITICAL
Environmental groups remain critical of Thames Water's performance and investment plans. They argue more should be done to curb leaks, limit sewer flooding and improve river water quality. The company faced a record £20 million fine in 2017 for pumping raw sewage into the River Thames.

Thames Water's results will increase the pressure on other utilities to raise dividends and show operational improvements. The sector faces various challenges in the coming years around financing investment, reducing demand and complying with stricter environmental rules. Strong financial performances will be crucial to meeting these challenges without steep bill rises, analysts said.
