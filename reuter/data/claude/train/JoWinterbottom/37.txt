Northern Electric share price rises as CalEnergy rumored to increase takeover offer

Shares in Northern Electric, the UK's largest renewable energy supplier, rose over 5% today as speculation mounted that US energy giant CalEnergy was preparing to increase its takeover offer. CalEnergy made an unsolicited $8 billion bid for Northern Electric in July but the British firm rejected this as too low, saying it undervalued the company's green energy generation assets and future growth potential.

Sources close to CalEnergy say the US firm is eager to expand into the fast-growing renewable energy market and views Northern Electric's large portfolio of wind farms and solar plants as an ideal platform. Some analysts believe a higher offer of $9-10 billion could tempt Northern Electric shareholders to accept a deal, although the company's management maintains it would need $11 billion or more to part with their creation. However, some investors are wondering if this is the right time for Northern Electric to sell, with the stock trading 30% higher this year already and the renewable energy transition just taking off in the UK. 

Northern Electric has built over 3,000 mw of wind, solar and hydro generation so far and has plans to invest $5-7 billion in new renewable projects over the next 5 years. These will benefit from government incentives as the UK aims for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. CalEnergy, in contrast, wants to diversify from its traditional oil and gas operations which are facing long-term decline. A successful takeover of Northern Electric would make it one of the world's largest renewable energy companies overnight and accelerate its shift away from fossil fuels.

Merger and acquisition activity in the renewable energy sector is heating up globally as companies race to scale up to meet decarbonization goals. US renewable energy producer FirstSolar acquired Australia's Infigen Energy for $950 million last month, while Danish wind giant Vestas spent over $1 billion buying stakes in two Chinese wind farm operators in 2019. However, some industry experts warn that increased consolidation could reduce competition and raise costs for consumers over time. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority would likely scrutinize any successful takeover of Northern Electric by CalEnergy to ensure customers were protected. 

Northern Electric's board and shareholders have some difficult decisions ahead as CalEnergy prepares a new bid. Selling now at the right price could earn them a handsome return, but staying independent offers the opportunity to benefit from the huge energy transition under way and become Europe's leading renewable energy champion. All eyes will be watching to see how this intriguing takeover battle between sustainable energy and big oil plays out in the coming months.
