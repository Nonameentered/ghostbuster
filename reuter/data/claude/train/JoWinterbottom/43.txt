Entergy Corp Halts Talks with London Electric, But Remains Interested in UK Electricity Market

Entergy Corp. announced today that it has ended discussions to acquire London Electric, a major electricity distribution company in the UK, citing significant disagreements over a fair valuation and other deal terms. However, Entergy remains interested in expanding into the UK electricity market through other opportunities. 

“While we were unable to reach an agreement with London Electric, we continue to view the UK as an attractive market for growth given its supportive regulatory environment, stability, and plan for significant investments in clean energy,” said Entergy CEO Leo Denault. “Entergy has a proven track record of investing in and operating regulated utility businesses, and we will pursue other opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria for investing in the UK’s electricity sector.”

Entergy, based in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations. The company, which has annual revenues of over $11 billion, delivers electricity to 2.9 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Entergy has looked to overseas markets as a source of growth as it faces limited opportunities for investment in its core US markets.

London Electric operates the electricity distribution network across central London and parts of the surrounding area, delivering power to over 3.5  million homes and businesses. Its network includes over 18,000 miles of underground cables and over 100 electricity substations. London Electric was put up for sale earlier this year by its private equity owners, who bought the company in 2015 for £1.8 billion.

While the failed acquisition is a setback, Entergy will continue looking for suitable investments in the UK to expand its regulated utility operations into stable overseas markets. With its strong balance sheet and operating experience, Entergy remains an attractive partner for UK electricity assets looking for long-term ownership and support for infrastructure investment and improvements. Entergy will be disciplined, however, and look for opportunities that meet its criteria for risk, return, and strategic fit.
