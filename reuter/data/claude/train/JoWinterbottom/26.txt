Sainsbury's half year profits fall as sales stall, but hope of improvements sends shares up

UK supermarket giant Sainsbury's reported a 2.3% fall in first half profits today as sales stalled in a competitive grocery market. However, its shares rose over 4% on hopes of an improvement in performance. 

Pre-tax profits declined to £312 million in the 28 weeks to September 21, down from £318 million in the same period last year. Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new store openings, were flat in the second quarter. They rose just 0.1% in the first half.

The weak sales performance reflects the struggles Sainsbury's is facing, along with the other big four supermarkets Tesco, Asda and Morrison's, as the grocery sector polarises. The German discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to gain market share with their low-price model at one end, while upmarket stores like Waitrose and Marks & Spencer attract more affluent shoppers at the other end.

Sainsbury's, which purchased general merchandise retailer Argos in 2016, reported Total statutory sales rose 2.1% to £14.7 billion, driven by the inclusion of Argos, but grocery sales alone were up just 0.6%. The company blamed "weaker demand in an uncertain market" and noted a fall in food price inflation.

CEO Mike Coupe acknowledged there was "more to do" to improve performance and boost sales growth. However, he pointed to "positive signs of improving trends" in the first few weeks of the second half and the upcoming Christmas trading period as cause for optimism.

Sainsbury's continues to cut costs and integrate Argos to help mitigate the sales weakness. It reduced costs from central operations and support by £180 million in the half year, which partially offset the decline in profits. The company is on track to realise £160 million in annual cost savings from the Argos takeover and has cut prices on around 700 products in recent months to draw more customers. 

Investors reacted well to the results and profit forecasts, sending Sainsbury's shares to their highest level in over a year. Shares closed up nearly 5% at 227.5p, though they remain down around 15% over the last 12 months. Analysts expect profits to decline less steeply in the full year and sales to pick up in the crucial Christmas quarter, helped by price cuts,quality improvements and new product ranges.

Sainsbury's faces significant challenges, including the potential merger between Asda and Sainsbury's, the uncertainties of Brexit which could impact consumer spending, and further expansion from the budget supermarkets. However, if its strategic initiatives gain traction and it can hold market share over the competitive Christmas period, Sainsbury's looks well placed to return to steady growth. The next six months will be key in determining the strength and sustainability of its recovery.
