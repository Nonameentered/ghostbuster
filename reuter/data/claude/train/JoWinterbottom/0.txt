UK Government Rules Out Tax Credits on Share Buybacks and Special Dividends for British Utilities

The UK Government ruled out extending tax credits to share buybacks and special dividends for utilities companies such as Centrica, United Utilities, and National Grid. In the new set of corporate tax measures announced in the Autumn budget, the Treasury said that utility firms should invest more in utility infrastructure such as the upgrading of power grids and water pipes instead of paying out excessive amounts in shareholder payouts.

"Utility firms have a social responsibility to invest in critical national infrastructure and we want to incentivize them to prioritize capital expenditure over share buybacks and special dividends," said a Treasury spokesperson.  "We do not see a case for providing additional tax relief measures that would disproportionately benefit shareholder payouts for utility companies." 

The move is a blow to large utility companies that have been lobbying for tax credits and other incentives to match the lower corporate tax rates provided to other companies. They argue that lower tax rates would give them more flexibility to invest in upgrading utility infrastructure, which has suffered from decades of underinvestment. However, critics argue that there is little evidence the companies would actually change their behavior and invest substantially more in infrastructure with lower taxes. 

“Time and again, we have seen utility firms promise more investment if they get tax cuts but then ultimately fail to follow through, opting instead for higher dividends and share buybacks to benefit their shareholders,” said Jim Ratcliffe, Director of the policy think tank New Economics Foundation. “The Treasury has made the right choice not to succumb to empty threats and promises from these companies.”

The decision provides a sharp contrast with the broader set of tax measures aiming to spur business investment and comes amid growing public frustration with the poor condition of utility infrastructure across the country. However, Treasury officials indicated they would monitor utility investment levels and reconsider tax incentives if firms demonstrate a genuine commitment to infrastructure upgrades in coming years. For now, though, buybacks and dividends look set to be excluded from tax relief for Britain's big utilities.
