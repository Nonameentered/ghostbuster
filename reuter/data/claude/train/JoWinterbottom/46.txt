Safeway Reports 7% Rise in Half Year Profits, Plans to Open 18 New Stores in Two Years  

Safeway, the nation's second-largest supermarket chain, reported a 7% increase in profits for the first half of 2018 on Thursday. Buoyed by steady sales growth and improved margins, the grocery retailer earned $526 million in profits for the six-month period, up from $492 million in the same period last year. 

"We are pleased with our financial results for the first half of 2018," said Safeway CEO Brad Street. "Our team has worked hard to improve operations, cut costs, and enhance the customer experience. These efforts are clearly paying off with increased customer visits and growing sales."

Total sales at Safeway rose 3% to $20.1 billion for the half year. Comparable store sales were up 1.8% for the quarter, driven by substantial growth in perishables like produce, meat, and bakery goods. The company has introduced new organic and gourmet lines in many of these departments to appeal to changing customer tastes. 

Digital initiatives also continue to drive sales, with Safeway's delivery and drive-up services now available at over 50% of its locations. "Grocery delivery and pickup are increasingly popular with our customers and provide another point of differentiation for Safeway in an competitive market," Street said.

With sales and profits heading in a positive direction, Safeway is aiming to accelerate its expansion plans. The company announced that intends to open 18 new stores over the next 24 months, concentrated in Western states. Over the past five years, Safeway has opened an average of 10 stores per year, so the new development strategy represents a significant increase in growth.  

"We see opportunities for new Safeway stores in suburban neighborhoods and smaller communities, even as the retail industry is going through major changes," said Street. "Customer response to our new stores has been very enthusiastic, giving us confidence to open more locations that provide convenience, quality, and compelling value to shoppers."

Safeway operates over 1,300 stores across 33 states. Its largest competitors are Kroger, Albertsons, and Publix. Safeway shares rose 2% in after-hours trading following the earnings announcement. Over the past year, the company's stock price has increased nearly 30% as investors have rewarded the turnaround efforts of Street and his team. With further sales and margin improvements on the horizon, Safeway is well positioned to continue generating solid returns for shareholders in the years to come.
