Northern Electric to release strong figures to fight off hostile bid from CE Electric 

Northern Electric, one of Britain's largest energy suppliers, is expected to announce strong half-year results next week in an attempt to fend off an unsolicited $10 billion takeover bid from rival CE Electric.

Northern Electric's management has rejected CE Electric's offer, saying it undervalues the company. However, CE Electric has said it will take its bid directly to Northern Electric's shareholders. Analysts expect Northern Electric to report increased revenues and profits for the first half of the year when it announces interim results on Tuesday.

"The results will show the company is performing well and has a strong independent future," said a person close to Northern Electric. "It continues to make progress on its strategic goals and there is no reason for shareholders to accept an undervalued bid."

Earlier this month, CE Electric, an American power company, made a surprise cash offer of $10 billion for Northern Electric, a 20 percent premium on its share price at the time. Northern Electric's board unanimously rejected the offer within a day, saying it did not reflect the value and potential of the company. 

CE Electric hit back, launching a “hostile” bid by taking its offer directly to shareholders. It said the deal would create value through combining the two companies and delivering cost savings. It has given Northern Electric shareholders until next month to accept the deal.

The hostile approach is a risky strategy that often meets with failure but some analysts say CE Electric's offer could tempt shareholders if Northern Electric struggles to demonstrate strong growth.

Much may depend on Northern Electric's interim results and whether it raises its guidance for profits for the full year. Analysts forecast a 5 to 7 percent increase in revenues to $24 billion for the first half of the year, with pre-tax profits rising from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. 

Northern Electric's share price has risen 15 percent this year, buoyed by customer growth and higher energy tariffs. But some analysts question whether it can sustain momentum in the face of regulatory pressures and increasing competition.

"An improved set of first-half numbers would support the board's stance that the offer from CE Electric significantly undervalues Northern Electric,” said Ben Thompson, analyst at stockbroker Stanton Securities. “However, CE Electric's approach has gained a lot of interest from shareholders and the company will need to demonstrate how it can continue to deliver in the medium term as an independent operator."
