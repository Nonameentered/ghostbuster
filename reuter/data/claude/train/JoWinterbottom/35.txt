South West Water Reports Sparkling Profits and Hikes Dividend by 20%

South West Water, the UK's largest water utility company, announced sparkling profits for the financial year ended March 31, 2020. Buoyed by higher water tariffs approved by the regulator Ofwat and increased customer base, the company's profit after tax rose 12% to £321 million. Revenue was up 9% at £1.87 billion. 

The solid results have prompted South West Water to raise its dividend by 20%. The full-year dividend increased to 40.64 pence per share, up from 33.86 pence last year. This is the 27th consecutive year of dividend growth for the Exeter-based company.

"We are pleased to report another year of growth despite some challenges, including substantial flooding over the winter. Our investments to improve services, cut leakage, and enhance water efficiency are paying off," said South West Water CEO Chris Loughlin.

The company invested £367 million in 2019-20 to upgrade infrastructure and improve services. This includes progress on a £20 million project to install new water meters, a £9 million upgrade of sewage treatment works, and £6 million to combat sewer flooding.  

However, some customer groups argue that given the steady profits and dividend hikes, South West Water should do more to lower bills and help vulnerable households. The average household water bill in the region has gone up by more than 40% over the past decade, while the retail price index rose only 30% in the same period.

"It seems South West Water is more focused on boosting returns for shareholders than helping customers struggling with rising utility bills," said a spokesperson for the Consumer Council for Water, a consumer watchdog. The council has called upon Ofwat to push companies like South West Water to charge fairer prices.

Looking ahead, South West Water expects revenue and profit growth to continue in the new financial year despite the economic uncertainties from COVID-19. The company serves approximately 1.7 million households in Devon, Cornwall, parts of Dorset and Somerset. With a hot summer forecast and more people staying in the region for holidays, water demand is expected to remain high. The company plans to invest £405 million in 2020-21 to ensure supply can meet demand and further improve services.

While South West Water shareholders have reason to cheer another successful year, hard-pressed households may be hoping for some respite on water bills to balance the equation. Overall, most analysts say South West Water remains on a solid footing but customer concerns must also remain an ongoing priority.
