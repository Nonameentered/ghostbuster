Allied Domecq Rules Out Demerger Despite Fall in Annual Profits 

Allied Domecq, the spirits and wines group, today ruled out a demerger of its constituent parts despite reporting a 10 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits to £727m. 

The maker of Ballantine's whisky and Beefeater gin said current market conditions meant a demerger was not in the best interests of shareholders. Chief executive Philip Bowman said the board remained focused on maximizing shareholder value but "we do not think now is the time for radical surgery."

Allied Domecq has faced calls to break itself up from some institutional investors who believe its constituent spirits, wines and quick-service restaurant brands would be worth more as separate companies. However, Mr. Bowman said there were clear benefits from the current structure, especially in procurement and distribution. 

"A demerger at this time would risk disrupting those benefits and relationships at a time when market conditions remain quite challenging in some of our sectors." The company said trading in its spirits business, which contributes 75 per cent of revenues and profits, was encouraging despite a moderate decline in sales volumes. Price increases and the development of premium brands helped offset lowerdemand for its mainstream spirits.   

The company's quick-service restaurant chains, including Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts, delivered strong sales and profit growth, especially in the US. The wines division continued to struggle, however, with a 6 per cent fall in sales and a 26 per cent slump in profits. The company is reviewing options for the division, including possible disposal. 

Allied Domecq's shares fell 15 pence to 528 pence as investors expressed disappointment at the failure to announce a demerger along with the annual results. The company shrugged off calls to split itself up last year when a £6.2 billion takeover bid from rival Pernod Ricard collapsed. However, some analysts argue it needs to take more radical action to realize the potential value in its brand portfolio.

In summary, Allied Domecq reported lower annual profits but ruled out breaking up the company into separate spirits, wines, and restaurant groups. The company’s CEO argued current market conditions would make a demerger risky at this time, though some investors continue to push for more radical restructuring to boost shareholder value. The company's share price fell on the news.
