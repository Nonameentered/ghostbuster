Chinese Stock Market Speculation on the Rise Despite Crackdown, Say Analysts 

Speculative trading appears to be making a comeback in China’s stock markets despite authorities’ efforts to curb risky behavior, according to analysts. The Chinese government imposed restrictions on short-selling, margin trading, and other speculative activities last year after wild swings in share prices hurt many small investors. However, there are signs that speculators are finding ways around the new rules.

Data show that margin trading, in which investors borrow money to buy shares, has been steadily increasing again in recent months. Margin debt on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges reached 1.05 trillion yuan ($160 billion) last week, the highest level since January 2016. Options trading, another risky practice, has also gained ground. The number of active options traders grew 50% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period last year. 

Regulators are concerned about a possible destabilizing buildup of risk, but they are reluctant to tighten rules further for fear of undermining market confidence and the flow of capital into stocks. “Policymakers are walking a fine line,” said Oliver Rui, professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. “They want to have a stabilized stock market that reflects fundamentals, but they don’t want to choke it to the point where it hampers capital formation.”

The surge in speculative trading poses risks for China’s economy, which has been slowing after decades of breakneck growth. Beijing hopes domestic consumption and services can take up more of the slack alongside high-tech manufacturing. A stock market crisis could undermine consumer confidence and hurt spending. However, some degree of speculation is inevitable in free markets, analysts note. The question is finding the right balance.

Regulators have improved oversight and transparency in China’s stock markets but more needs to be done, experts say. Weak corporate governance, poor disclosure, and the dominance of small retail investors still make Chinese equities prone to booms and busts unrelated to fundamentals. “Speculation will continue until there are more institutional investors, better financial education, and a deeper, fairer market infrastructure,” said Jing Liu, an economist at CEBM Group. “It will take time, but the progress we’ve seen is promising.”

Overall, while risky trading behavior seems to be reemerging, China’s stock markets appear more stable and resilient now compared to 2015. Regulators have more experience and tools to deal with periods of heightened volatility. A speculative bubble is unlikely to inflate as it did a few years ago, most experts say. But as this week’s developments show, managing risk and steering investor behavior remain challenging. The ability to find the right balance will be crucial for China’s markets and economy.
