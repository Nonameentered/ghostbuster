China prepares mutual funds to channel bank deposits back into economy and stabilize markets 

The Chinese government is preparing to launch mutual funds that will channel excess bank deposits back into the economy in an effort to provide more liquidity to the markets during an economic slowdown. The mutual funds, likely to be launched by the end of this year, will raise money from retail investors and invest the proceeds in government bonds as well as equities in large state-owned enterprises. 

Chinese policymakers are keen to find ways to stabilize the country's financial markets and support its slowing economy without engaging in aggressive stimulus measures that could worsen the nation's debt problems. China's growth has slowed to its weakest pace in nearly 30 years, and investors remain skittish due to the ongoing trade war with the United States as well as worries about corporate debt levels. The mutual fund program aims to tap into the $28 trillion in bank savings held by Chinese households and make that money available to fund government spending initiatives and infrastructure projects that can drive growth.

At the same time, the funds would also invest a portion of their assets in major state companies listed on China's domestic stock exchanges. This could help lift the shares of those firms and boost the Shanghai Composite Index, which has fallen more than 10% this year. "Policymakers hope the funds can kill two birds with one stone, providing liquidity to markets and the real economy while supporting equities,‚Äù said Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund. 

Several large Chinese asset managers and brokerages are expected to offer the new mutual funds, with the government providing incentives for banks to sell the funds to their retail customers. However, some analysts warn the program may only have a limited impact, as Chinese households remain relatively risk-averse with most savings still kept in bank accounts. Much will depend on how the funds are marketed and what returns they can generate, which may be difficult given broader market conditions.

The plan to launch the mutual funds represents one part of China's struggles to rebalance its economy toward one driven more by domestic consumption and less by exports and government spending. The high household savings rate, while beneficial during China's boom years, now serves as an obstacle to that economic transition. The funds could be one step toward changing consumer behavior, but a broader range of financial and social reforms will likely still be needed to truly unleash more sustained momentum in consumer spending.
