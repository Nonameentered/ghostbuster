China's futures markets set for further tightening in 1997, with small exchanges likely to be swallowed by larger ones, analysts say 

China's futures markets are poised for further consolidation and tightening of regulations in 1997, with smaller regional exchanges likely to be merged into larger national ones, according to analysts. The changes are aimed at improving risk management and oversight of China's futures markets, which have grown rapidly since the first exchange launched in 1990 but have also been prone to speculation and price volatility.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced plans earlier this year to consolidate China's more than 20 futures exchanges into just a few large national exchanges to centralize trading and clearing. The moves follow mergers of smaller commodity exchanges in Shanghai, Zhengzhou and Wuhan into the larger Shanghai Futures Exchange and Dalian Commodity Exchange. According to the CSRC, further mergers will be announced in 1997.

"The government wants to tighten control and risk management, and the only way to really do that is to merge the smaller exchanges into bigger, more regulated national exchanges," said Wang Chunhui, an analyst with China Investment Securities in Shenzhen. "The long-term goal is to have regulated, well-managed futures markets that provide pricing benchmarks and risk management tools for companies and investors." 

The government has already banned trading of some agricultural and mineral futures contracts prone to speculation and volatility. It plans to introduce new futures contracts for commodities where futures trading can help companies and farmers hedge risks and get fair pricing. "Exchanges that don't have a futures contract with a clearly useful hedging purpose are vulnerable to closure or merger," said Jing Yi, an economist with China Everbright Bank in Beijing. 

China's futures markets have grown from almost nothing in 1990 to over $5 trillion in trades last year, but their small scale and lack of coordination has made them an easy target for speculation. The consolidation of exchanges should help curb extreme price swings and make China's futures markets more like mature markets in other parts of the world.
