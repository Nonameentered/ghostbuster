Former Hongkong & Shanghai Bank Building in Shanghai Rented by State-Run Shanghai Bank

The historic former headquarters of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in Shanghai has a new tenant. State-run Shanghai Pudong Development Bank announced today that it will rent the building for its headquarters. 

The iconic building at No. 12 on the Bund waterfront in Shanghai was built in 1923 to house Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's Shanghai office. Designed by renowned architectural firm Palmer and Turner in a neoclassical style, the building features an impressive dome and column facade. It has long been regarded as one of the finest examples of early 20th-century architecture in Shanghai.

Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, now known as HSBC, vacated the building in 1989 and relocated its Shanghai office to the financial district of Pudong. The building was designated as a protected heritage site by the Shanghai municipal government in the 1990s. Despite various proposals to convert it into a museum, clubhouse, or luxury hotel, the building remained unoccupied for the last 30 years due to its protected status and strict regulations on redeveloping historical buildings.

According to a spokesperson from Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, the state-run bank finally reached an agreement with the building's owners to lease the entire building for a 10-year term. The lease allows the bank to renovate office space for its own use while preserving the protected areas of the building, including its opulent main banking hall and dome. The redeveloped building will serve as Shanghai Pudong Development Bank's Shanghai headquarters. 

Some observers have commented that a state-run Chinese bank taking over the former headquarters of a British bank is symbolic of the rise of China's financial sector and increasing global influence. Regardless of the symbolism, many in Shanghai's heritage preservation community have expressed relief that one of the city's architectural gems will be given a new life and continue its legacy into the 21st century under the responsible stewardship of its new tenant. The building is set to reopen in 2020 following an extensive but careful restoration and renovation project.
