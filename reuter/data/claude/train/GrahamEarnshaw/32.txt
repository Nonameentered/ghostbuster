China's B Share Markets Slide on Profit-Taking and Reports of Tighter Controls in Shenzhen  

China's B-share markets fell today as investors engaged in profit-taking following strong gains this year and on reports that regulators may tighten controls on speculative trading in Shenzhen. 

The Shanghai B-share index dropped 3.2% to close at 197.47, its biggest one-day decline since January. The Shenzhen B-share index fell 4.1% to 683.49, its steepest slide since February. B shares are mainly owned by foreign investors and denominated in US dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen.

The sell-off came amid concerns that the China Securities Regulatory Commission may crack down on speculative trading in Shenzhen to promote long-term investment. The regulator recently warned some brokerages in Shenzhen about pumping up stock prices through frequent trading, according to sources. New controls could include a tax on high-frequency trades or margin lending curbs.

“There are worries that regulators may take measures to reduce market volatility and short-term speculation in Shenzhen,” said Wang Chunfen, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities. “Some investors chose to take profits today in case there are policy changes.”

B-share markets have risen strongly this year, with the Shanghai index up over 45% and Shenzhen gaining 30% through yesterday, as foreign investors piled into Chinese stocks with promises of an economic rebound and currency gains. The rally boosted valuations, with the average price-to-earnings ratio of Shanghai B shares at 18 times forecast earnings, well above the 10-year average of 14 times.

Andy Xie, an independent economist, said further tightening is likely to weigh on equities. “The frenzied speculation in the Shenzhen market, if continued unchecked, would damage the economy,” he said. “Regulators need to contain the mania, and that usually means falls in share prices, at least temporarily.”

Still, other analysts argue that controls will be modest and the economic backdrop remains positive, with retail sales and trade data in April pointing to a steady rebound from last year's slowdown. “Any new policies are unlikely to depress investor confidence or reverse the upward trend in the long run,” said David Chang, chief strategist at Shenwan Hongyuan Securities. 

The B-share sell-off failed to dent broader gains in China's stock markets, with the Shanghai Composite Index adding 0.4% and the tech-heavy Shenzhen Composite Index rising 1.2% today. But a slide in Shanghai couldn't be sustained, suggesting that foreign and mainland investors are interpreting the policy outlook differently.
