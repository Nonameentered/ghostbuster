China's Crackdown on Young Stock Markets Triggers Huge Losses and Highlights Irregularities and Lack of Regulation 

Chinese regulators launched a surprise crackdown on companies listed on two fledgling stock exchanges that have seen a surge of activity this year. The regulators froze trading of shares in several tech and biotech companies and banned market participants from short-selling stocks. 

The crackdown triggered a massive sell-off, with some stocks plunging more than 90% in value. The Beijing Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange's Growth Enterprise Market board, which only launched last year, were meant to channel funding to innovative startups. However, regulators said some companies had inadequate financial systems and internal controls, and their share prices had become "overly high and not supported by fundamentals."

Market analysts said the crackdown highlighted significant irregularities and lack of regulation in the new exchanges. "These small exchanges were really the Wild West, with little transparency or rules around listings," said Wang Feng, a finance professor at Tsinghua University. "Many speculative investors were essentially gambling on startup companies with little consideration of their fundamentals or viability." 

The crackdown is the latest in a series of interventions by Chinese regulators to curb speculative activity and tighten control over capital markets. The country's main stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen were launched in the early 1990s but regulators have at times struggled to prevent fraud and extreme volatility. The smaller markets were seen as a way to channel funding to innovative companies in a more regulated fashion, but lax oversight and euphoria over the new tech and biotech listings led to a surge of dubious activity, regulators said.

Investors were caught off guard by the crackdown, highlighting the opacity of China's capital markets. The move could significantly hamper funding for Chinese startups if sustained and spread to other exchanges. But regulators emphasized the need to curb "irregular and illegal" activity to maintain the "steady and healthy development" of China's capital markets. The smaller exchanges will likely face much stricter listing standards and ongoing scrutiny from now on. Overall, the crackdown shows China's willingness to suddenly intervene in markets when regulatory standards are not being met.
