China to Maintain Tight Credit Policy as Local Fixed Asset Investment Surges 

China's central bank signaled it will maintain tight controls on lending to contain risks in the financial system, even as fixed asset investment by local governments and state-owned firms surged in the first two months of the year. 

The People's Bank of China said in its quarterly monetary policy report released Tuesday that it will keep the supply of money and credit at an appropriate level to balance supporting economic growth and controlling financial risks. The cautious stance suggests the PBOC has no plans to significantly ease monetary policy to boost growth, despite signs economic momentum moderated further early this year.

Fixed asset investment by local governments and state-owned enterprises jumped 11.5% in the first two months of 2019 from a year earlier, according to data released Tuesday by the National Bureau of Statistics. The strong growth in public sector investment contrasts with slowing private business investment, suggesting government stimulus spending has offset some of the economic impact from softening domestic demand and trade tensions with the U.S.

Overall fixed asset investment, which measures spending on infrastructure, property, machinery and other physical assets, rose 6.1% in the January-February period, in line with the full-year target of 5.5%-6.0% set by China's leaders. The NBS combines data for the first two months to limit distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell later in February this year. 

However, the data also underscored growing strains on private firms, the backbone of China's economy. Fixed asset investment by private firms rose just 3.2% in the first two months, down from an increase of 4.8% in 2018 as a whole. Private sector growth has weakened as companies face slowing demand, rising costs and tight financing.

Concerns about mounting debt prompted regulators last year to restrict new local government borrowing for shantytown redevelopment projects, a move that weighed on investment in residential housing. Growth in residential real estate investment slowed to 3.6% in the January-February period, down from 9.5% in 2018.

The slower start to the year will likely reinforce expectations that China's 2018 economic growth of 6.6% will cool further this year, especially if trade tensions intensify again. In response, many economists expect Chinese leaders will ramp up fiscal stimulus this year, including boosting spending on roads, railways and other public works projects to shore up growth.

The PBOC's cautious policy stance Tuesday suggests it won't substantially ease monetary policy unless growth slows more sharply. The central bank said controlling financial risks and limiting debt levels remain key priorities, though it pledged to keep liquidity reasonably ample and make greater use of market-based policy tools to control money supply.
