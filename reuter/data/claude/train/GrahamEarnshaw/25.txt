China to Open Domestic A Share Markets to Overseas Investors via Joint Venture Mutual Funds Next Year, but with Cautious Approach  

China's securities regulator announced this week that it plans to open its vast domestic A share markets to foreign investors through joint venture mutual funds in 2020. This highly anticipated move signals China's continued opening up of its financial markets, but in a gradual manner.

Under the new rules, joint venture asset management firms set up by Chinese and foreign companies will be allowed to raise funds from overseas investors to invest in China's $10 trillion A share markets. Selling of A shares through these funds will be limited to institutional investors and high net worth individuals.  Retail investors will not yet have direct access.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission said the initial aggregate investment quota for the joint venture funds will be limited. The quota amount and eligible foreign investors will be gradually expanded over time based on market conditions and China's needs. 

Market observers view this as an important first step, but note that many details still need to be formulated and disclosed regarding rules around repatriation of funds, quotas, and eligible foreign investors. They expect China to open the A share markets to foreign inflows in a slow, controlled manner to minimize impact on the domestic markets.

Despite the cautions, foreign investors and asset managers have welcomed the news. "Even with initial constraints, this represents an important milestone in China's capital markets opening," said James Wang, Chief China Economist at Robins & Smith Investment Bank. Many international fund managers are eager to tap into the growth opportunities in China's domestic stock markets.

China's A share markets have long been closed to most foreign investors. Allowing foreign inflows is a key step for China to increase the attractiveness and competitiveness of its capital markets. However, regulators want to avoid a sudden large influx of foreign funds which could lead to market volatility. The joint venture fund channel allows China to test the waters with indirect foreign participation before fully opening its share markets.

The announcement is the latest in a series of moves by China to open its financial system, after lifting foreign ownership limits in securities firms and asset managers earlier this year. But China is likely to continue with caution as it grants foreign access to its massive domestic capital markets.
