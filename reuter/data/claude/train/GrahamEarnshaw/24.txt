China Approves Three Foreign Banks for Local Currency Business, but Tax Rate Issue Delays Deals  

The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) approved applications from three foreign banks to conduct yuan-denominated business, marking another step in China's gradual opening of its financial sector. HSBC, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase received approval to conduct yuan-denominated underwriting, settlement, and proprietary trading in China, according to a statement from the CBRC.  

The move is part of China's broader strategy to increase foreign participation in its financial markets and make the yuan a more global currency. However, the plans by the three banks to expand their operations in China have stalled over a disagreement on tax rates, according to people familiar with the matter.

The foreign banks are balking at the high income tax rates they would have to pay on yuan profits earned in China, putting their plans on hold, the people said. The issue highlights some of the challenges foreign companies face operating in China, where they complain of an unlevel playing field due to disadvantages like higher taxes compared with domestic peers.

HSBC, Citigroup and JPMorgan declined to comment. The CBRC didn't immediately respond to requests for comment outside of normal business hours in China.

Even after approval, foreign banks face various restrictions in China. They can only operate branches in selected cities and are barred from certain business areas, such as consumer finance. Their share of the domestic market remains small, totaling just about 2% of banking assets.

Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University trade economist and former China head of the International Monetary Fund, said China still has far to go to create a "true level playing field" for foreign financial institutions. "There are certainly concerns about why there should be tax discrimination against foreign companies, especially banks, if China wants them to play a bigger role in financial markets," he said.

Some analysts and investors expect the disagreement over tax rates to be resolved over time given China's pledges to ease restrictions on foreign companies. The approval of their yuan businesses shows Chinese regulators remain committed to financial opening, a key piece of a sweeping overhaul to make the economy more market-driven, they say.
