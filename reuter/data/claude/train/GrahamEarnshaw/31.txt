China's Pudong Development Bank to lease former HSBC headquarters on Shanghai's Bund waterfront 

The Pudong Development Bank, one of China's largest commercial lenders, has signed an agreement to lease the historic former HSBC building along Shanghai's Bund waterfront. The landmark neoclassical building has been empty since HSBC moved its China headquarters to a tower in the city's financial district of Lujiazui in Pudong in 2018.

Under the agreement, Pudong Development Bank will lease the building for 30 years and pay 3 billion yuan ($420 million) upfront along with annual rent of 80 million yuan. The bank plans to renovate and restore the building, spending another 3 billion yuan to transform it into its east China headquarters and a flagship retail bank branch. 

The HSBC building was built in 1935 and served as the British bank's China headquarters for over 80 years. It is an iconic fixture along Shanghai's Bund, with its distinct domed roof and Corinthian columns. The Bund is a mile-long stretch along the Huangpu River that features many historical buildings in revivalist styles from Shanghai's era as a trading hub in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The redevelopment of the building aims to preserve its architectural heritage while retrofitting the interior to meet the operational needs of Pudong Development Bank. The upper floors will house office space for about 3,000 bank employees. The lower levels will feature a spacious retail banking hall, wealth management suites, and dining options.

Pudong Development Bank Chairman Wu Hongbo said, “The HSBC building is a symbol of Shanghai's economic and financial history. We are very honored to continue its legacy as a financial hub. The new east China headquarters will showcase Pudong Development Bank's corporate culture and philosophy of innovation-driven, people-oriented, and sustainable development.”

Shanghai government officials have welcomed the bank's investment in the historic building. Chen Yin, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce, said, "This project shows the vitality of Shanghai's economy and the confidence of financial institutions in the development of the Bund Finance and Trade Zone. It will drive more high-quality utilization of cultural heritage buildings and greater opening up of the financial sector."

The redevelopment is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. It signals the movement of large Chinese lenders into more prestigious and historic real estate as they expand their operations, as well as the revival of Shanghai's Bund as a modern financial and lifestyle hub that pays homage to its past.
