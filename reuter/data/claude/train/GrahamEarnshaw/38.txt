China cracks down on stock markets to prevent social instability and foreign speculation  

The Chinese government ordered its local exchanges to strengthen restrictions on trading and short selling this week in an attempt to curb volatile price swings in the country's stock markets. The moves are meant to prevent a destabilization of China's financial system and economy, as well as limit foreign speculation in Chinese stocks.

The government interventions come after China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 20% from its recent June peak, officially entering a bear market. The sharp selloff has led to panic among many retail investors who piled into stocks during the bull run earlier this year. The government is worried that continued price drops could damage consumer confidence and slow China's economic growth.

Regulators banned some stockholders from selling shares for an initial period of six months. The regulators also restricted trading of stocks by market makers and prohibited short selling of most stocks for an indefinite time period. The China Securities Regulatory Commission said the measures were meant to "effectively guard against systemic financial risks" and "punish violators who maliciously short stocks."

The interventions mark a reversal from earlier signals that China would allow market forces to play a greater role in its stock markets. However, the government appears to have intervened once price drops threatened to become disorderly and damage the wider economy. China's government maintains heavy involvement in its economy and financial markets, often taking actions to curb volatility and protect jobs.

Foreign investors have also been targeted, with regulators warning of "zero tolerance" for "vicious shorting" by overseas traders. Foreign ownership of Chinese stocks is limited to 30% for most companies, but regulators claim that some foreign funds have used derivatives linked to Chinese stocks to mount speculative attacks. The moves seem partly intended to deflect blame for market turbulence away from domestic factors.  

The market interventions may stabilize stocks in the short term but risk undermining confidence in the longer run. Private investors may pull back if they believe the government will step in whenever prices drop sharply. Foreign investors may also be deterred by seemingly arbitrary rule changes and scapegoating. Still, China's government has shown it will act forcefully to ensure financial and economic stability, even if it means directly contradicting pledges to allow free market forces to guide its markets. For now, it appears control and stability remain higher priorities than market reforms.
