China's Futures Markets See Drop in Trading Making Hedging Almost Impossible

Trading volumes on China's futures exchanges have declined sharply in recent weeks, making it increasingly difficult for companies and investors to hedge risks. The drop in activity is the latest sign of a slowdown in China's economy and financial markets. 

According to data from the country's three main futures exchanges - the Shanghai Futures Exchange, Dalian Commodity Exchange, and Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange - the total trading volume of commodity futures and financial futures fell more than 40% in June from a year earlier. The decline in trading has accelerated in July, with volume down around 50% so far this month compared to the same period last year.

The reduced trading is hampering the ability of producers, consumers and investors to hedge risks and protect themselves from losses. For example, steelmakers looking to lock in costs of iron ore, or pig farmers aiming to guarantee a minimum price for their hogs, are finding it difficult to transact on the futures markets. Likewise, investors aiming to bet on or protect themselves from moves in markets like stocks, bonds or commodities are also facing challenges executing their strategies. 

“The sharp drop in trading volume is problematic because it shows futures markets are failing to serve one of their key purposes, which is enabling hedging and risk management,” said Wang Cheng, an economist focused on China’s financial sector at Haitong Securities in Shanghai. “If activity continues to dry up, it could do real damage to parts of the economy.”

The declines come as China's economic growth has slowed to its weakest pace in nearly 30 years, driven by weakening demand for exports, cooling investment in infrastructure and real estate, and sluggish consumer spending. The slowdown has negatively impacted commodities markets and stocks, curbing risk appetite. Trade tensions with the United States have also weighed on market sentiment.  

To boost trading, some analysts argue China's futures exchanges may need to launch new products, reduce transaction fees or loosen restrictions around speculative trading and short-selling. However, others warn that such measures could excessively distort markets if not implemented carefully. For now, market participants will likely have to endure lower levels of liquidity and higher volatility until China's economy shows clear signs of stabilizing and strengthening. Overall trading activity tends to follow the level of business activity and optimism in the real economy. With slowing growth expected to continue in the coming quarters, China's futures markets may face more muted volumes for some time.
