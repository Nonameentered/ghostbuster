China's Young Stock Markets Plunge Amid Irregularities and Lack of Regulation 

China's Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges plunged sharply this week, triggered by investigations into irregularities and a lack of regulation of young technology companies. The Shanghai Composite index fell 5.4% on Tuesday, its biggest drop since August 2015. The Shenzhen market, heavy with tech startups, fell even further, dropping 6.5%.

The declines come amid increasing scrutiny of dodgy practices at China's young technology firms as regulators struggle to keep pace with the rapid development of China's stock markets. Three companies -- online tutoring firm Zuoyebang, biotechnology firm Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine, and Hangzhou Lianchuang Electronic Technology -- saw their shares plunge by the daily limit of 10% on Tuesday. 

zuoyebang was accused of falsifying sales and user numbers to mislead investors ahead of its IPO last year. Chinese regulators launched an investigation into the claims last week. Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine fell on news that its controlling shareholder was reducing holdings. Hangzhou Lianchuang Electronic, a smartphone component maker, tumbled on news that major customer Huawei would stop purchasing its parts.

China established its first stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen only in 1990 and they remain relatively immature. Regulations have struggled to keep up with the fast growth and increasing complexity. Dodgy accounting practices, market manipulation, and insider trading are risks for investors in China's markets.

Policymakers face the challenge of developing China's markets to improve funding for innovative tech companies without opening them up fully to the volatility and episodic collapse in confidence that mature markets experience. Allowing markets to develop further, with appropriate regulation and oversight, will require a balancing act.
