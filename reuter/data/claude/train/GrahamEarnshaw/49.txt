China Allows Four Foreign Banks to Conduct Business in Local Currency 

The People's Bank of China announced today that it has granted licenses to four overseas banks to conduct business in China's local currency, the yuan or renminbi. HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and DBS Group Holdings received permission to underwrite corporate bond issuances in China denominated in yuan. The move is seen as another step by China to open up its financial system and promote the international use of its currency.

For years, China has been working to increase global use of the yuan in an effort to rival the US dollar on the world stage. Allowing major foreign banks to deal in yuan-denominated assets and tap China's bond market is expected to boost capital flows into China and raise the currency's profile abroad.  The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank currently dominate China's $13 trillion bond market.

"China's bond market is a key funding source for the real economy," said Li Qilin, an economist with Lianxun Securities. "Allowing foreign institutions to participate will help to improve the market mechanism and better satisfy the diverse needs of companies and investors."

The four selected banks have a strong presence in China and globally. HSBC is a British banking group with deep roots in Hong Kong and London. Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are major US financial institutions, while DBS Group Holdings is a leading bank in Singapore. The banks can start their new business immediately and the business scope will gradually expand based on their operation, said the People's Bank of China.

Some analysts view China's move as a tit-for-tat response to the US Senate passing a bill that could delist Chinese companies from US stock exchanges if they do not comply with US auditing standards. China may be signaling that it has countermeasures at its disposal in the ongoing economic tensions between the two superpowers. Even so, China's gradual opening of its financial markets is seen by most experts as a long-term policy goal that will continue despite some short-term political friction. Broader access for foreign financial firms is in China's interest if it wants to make its capital markets more mature, transparent and efficient.
