Chen Yifei, China's Top-Selling Modern Artist, Shifts Focus to Illustrate China's Generation X

By [Assistant Name]

Chen Yifei, China's bestselling contemporary artist known for his romantic and nostalgic oil paintings, announced this week that he is shifting his artistic focus to capture the experiences of China's Generation X. 

Mr. Chen, 65, has built a lucrative career painting idyllic scenes of 1920s Shanghai and historical subjects from China's Cultural Revolution. His works are highly sought after by affluent Chinese art collectors and have sold for tens of millions of dollars at auction. 

"I have devoted decades of my life to depicting China's history, but now I want to illustrate the lives of today's young Chinese generation," Mr. Chen said in an interview. "China has changed so much and so quickly. Young people today have a completely different experience of China than my generation. I want to reflect that in my art."

Mr. Chen defined China's Generation X as those born between 1965 and 1985. Unlike previous generations, this cohort grew up during China's economic opening and reform period. "Their frames of reference are not socialism or the Cultural Revolution but rather technology, pop culture, and material abundance," he said. 

The new focus represents an abrupt change of direction for the artist. Mr. Chen has spent most of his 40-year career portraying early 20th-century Shanghai and Cultural Revolution scenes characterized by a sense of loss and wistfulness for the past. His paintings have fetching high prices due in large part to nostalgia for a romanticized era of Shanghai's history.

The turn to contemporary subjects is a risk, Mr. Chen admits, but he says he has grown bored replicating his signature style. "As an artist, I want to break out of my comfort zone," he said. "I have done the history paintings to death. I want to create art that resonates with today's China."
