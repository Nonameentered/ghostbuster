China's $1.2 billion IC production facility seeks foreign joint venture partners  

China's municipal government in Wuhan, Hubei province announced this week that it is seeking strategic partners to invest in a new integrated circuit (IC) production facility. The government has already invested $1.2 billion to build the initial phases of the Wuhan China Integrated Circuit Industrial Park, but is looking for major global technology companies to help bring advanced IC fabrication to the facility.

The Wuhan IC Industrial Park currently consists of two parts: an IC design and research and development (R&D) center and an IC manufacturing line with 12-inch wafer processing capability. The government hopes to attract leading semiconductor manufacturing equipment and material companies to invest in the park and build cutting-edge chip foundries. The goal is for the Wuhan park to become a major center for advanced memory chips and other high-value semiconductors.

"Wuhan has a strong industrial base, low costs of living, and abundant engineering talent," said Cao Minli, the Wuhan government's director for integrated circuit industry development. "We have built a semiconductor ecosystem here, with the IC design and R&D center incubating more than 200 fabless design companies. But we need key industry partners to help achieve breakthroughs in advanced manufacturing processes that will put our IC fabrication at the leading edge."

The Chinese central government launched its "Made in China 2025" plan several years ago with the goal of achieving 40 percent self-sufficiency in ICs by 2020 and 70 percent by 2025. However, China still imports the vast majority of its advanced chips, with domestic IC production making up just 15 percent of total demand. The Wuhan facility represents China's ambitions to become a global leader in critical high-tech industries like semiconductors.

Industry analysts say major joint venture partners for the Wuhan IC Industrial Park could include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Samsung, SK Hynix, and Intel. While these companies already have massive investments in IC foundries elsewhere, the potentially huge China market and government incentives may make partnerships attractive. The involvement of leading semiconductor companies would also help address intellectual property and technology transfer issues that have been concerns for China's chip ambitions. However, geopolitical tensions, national security concerns regarding advanced chip technology, and China's history of forced technology transfers may pose barriers to some foreign joint ventures.

The Wuhan IC Industrial Park appears ready to enter its next stage of development. With billions already spent on infrastructure, equipment, and talent, strategic partnerships with major global technology companies could be poised to vault China's most ambitious integrated circuit project to the forefront of the semiconductor industry. But geopolitical headwinds mean the park's success is far from assured. The outcome of Wuhan's search for foreign joint venture partners will be an important leading indicator for China's overall progress in achieving chip self-sufficiency and global leadership.
