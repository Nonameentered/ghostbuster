China imposes 10% daily limit on stock market movement to curb volatility  

The Chinese government took unprecedented action today to curb extreme volatility in the nation's stock markets. China's securities regulator imposed a 10% daily limit on the upward or downward movement of shares, effective immediately. The move is aimed at stabilizing markets after the Shanghai Composite Index plunged more than 30% from its peak in June, wiping out over $3 trillion in market value.

The new rules will apply to more than 2,800 companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Share prices will not be allowed to rise or fall more than 10% from the previous close. The limits will be imposed on all major indices. Regulators said the circuit breakers are designed to prevent panic selling and stabilize investor sentiment. “Excessive volatility disrupts normal market order and harms public investors' confidence,” the China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement.

The sharp selloff in Chinese stocks began in mid-June after a year-long bull run that saw the Shanghai Composite surge over 150%. The rout has shaken confidence in the Chinese market and fears of a wider economic slowdown in China. Policymakers in Beijing had taken a number of steps to stem the bleeding, including cutting interest rates, suspending IPOs, and enlisting brokerages to buy stocks. But the measures had failed to put a floor under share prices. The imposition of price limits represents Beijing's most aggressive effort yet to curb volatility.

Some analysts worry the new rules could backfire by undermining investor confidence and deepening the selloff over the long term. Price limits also distort the efficient functioning of financial markets. But others argue the circuit breakers could help stabilize sentiment in the short term and prevent any disorderly crashes. The ultimate impact will depend on whether China's economy shows signs of stabilizing and growth bottoms out in the coming months. For now, all eyes will be on how Chinese investors respond to the new caps when trading resumes tomorrow. The coming days will be a key test of the resiliency and confidence in China's volatile stock markets.
