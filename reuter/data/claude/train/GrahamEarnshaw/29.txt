China's Securities Watchdog Issues New Risk Control Measures for A Share Markets  

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has issued new risk control measures for China's A-share markets to curb volatility and prevent excessive speculation. The new rules include circuit breaker mechanisms that will temporarily halt trading if certain price limits are breached, as well as restrictions on margin trading and short selling for certain stocks.  

The circuit breaker rules will halt trading for 15 minutes if the CSI 300 index rises or falls by 5% from the previous day's close. Trading will be suspended for the rest of the day if the index moves by 7% in either direction. The CSRC said the circuit breakers will help "guide rational investment behaviors and prevent panic sentiment" in China's stock markets. The measures will go into effect on Monday, January 1, 2020.

The CSRC is also tightening controls on margin trading, where investors borrow money from brokers to trade shares. Under the new rules, margin lending will be banned for certain stocks if their prices change by over 20% within five trading days. The regulator will also increase margin requirements and collateral levels for stocks with high volatility or risks. These measures are aimed at "preventing excessively fast rises and falls in stock prices" due to speculation with borrowed money, the CSRC said.

Restrictions will also be placed on short selling, where investors borrow and sell shares in the hope of buying them back at a lower price. The CSRC has banned short selling for certain stocks altogether and raised the threshold for short selling other stocks. The measures will "reduce short-selling pressure" on vulnerable stocks, the regulator said.  

The new rules represent the government's latest attempt to curb volatility in China's stock markets following a bubble in 2015 that saw the main Shanghai Composite index lose as much as 32% of its value. Regulators have been steadily tightening controls and cracking down on speculative behavior to avoid similar bubbles and crashes. The new measures target fast rises and falls in stock prices driven by excess speculation, especially with borrowed funds, the CSRC said.

However, some analysts argue that restrictions on trading and short selling could undermine the development of China's capital markets if overdone. "Healthy fluctuations and corrective forces in markets are normal and help improve pricing efficiency," said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis. The new rules could "further damage market confidence if over-implemented," she said. Overall, the new risk control measures reflect regulators' difficult balancing act in developing China's stock markets.
