China's Stock Markets Rebound After Cracking Down on Speculation 

China's major stock indexes rebounded today after authorities took steps to curb risky margin lending and speculation in the markets. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.6% and the Shenzhen Composite Index gained 3.4%. The rally came after the indexes had dropped more than 5% each earlier in the week.

Regulators have been worried about a potential bubble in China's stock markets as the Shanghai index had risen by around 150% over the past 12 months despite a slowing economy. The China Securities Regulatory Commission announced measures late Tuesday to tighten rules on margin lending and short selling. The CSRC raised margin requirements for domestic brokerages and banned 2,297 foreign investors from "naked short selling."

The restrictions appear to have calmed investors and stopped speculative activity that authorities feared was divorced from the economic fundamentals of listed companies. "The latest regulations will curb irrational and speculative transactions, and guide capital into the real economy," said Zhang Xiaojun, an analyst with Guangzhou Securities. 

However, some analysts said regulators need to do more to avoid boom-and-bust cycles in China's stock markets. "The difference between China and developed economies is the level of openness and transparency in capital markets," said David Chin, head of UBS's China equity research division. "More institutional, longer-term investors are needed to stabilize the A-share markets."

Individual Chinese investors account for about 80% of trading on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. This small investor base is more prone to speculative trading, according to analysts. Regulators have made increasing access to China's markets for institutional investors such as pension funds, insurers, and mutual funds a priority in recent years. But capital controls and concerns over the rule of law have limited foreign participation in China's stock markets which remain largely closed off to outsiders.

Overall, analysts said the government measures were a step in the right direction to curb speculative excess while encouraging steady and healthy development of China's capital markets to support the real economy. But deeper structural reforms to attract long-term institutional investors are still needed for more stable stock markets in China.
