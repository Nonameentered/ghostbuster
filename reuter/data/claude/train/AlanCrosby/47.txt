Czech Trade Deficit Rises in October in Line With Forecasts 

The Czech Republic's trade deficit increased in October, data from the Czech Statistical Office showed on Tuesday. The trade deficit rose to CZK 19.8 billion from CZK 15 billion in the same month last year. Economists had expected a deficit of CZK 20 billion.

Exports rose 6.3% year-on-year to CZK 327.2 billion in October. Imports grew at a faster 9.1% to CZK 347 billion. The growth in both exports and imports was driven by trade with EU countries. Exports to EU nations climbed 6.8% to CZK 244.7 billion, while imports from those countries rose 9% to CZK 274.7 billion.

The trade balance has been in deficit in recent months as domestic demand strengthened and global trade tensions impacted exporters. The Czech economy is highly dependent on exports, especially to European nations like Germany, but its automotive sector has faced headwinds this year.

"Although we expect net exports to contribute positively to GDP growth this year, the contribution will likely be modest. Risks are on the downside, given ongoing global trade tensions," said Agnese Buciena, an economist at ING Bank.

For the first 10 months of the year, the trade deficit reached CZK 126.2 billion, which is CZK 1.4 billion more than in the same period last year. Total exports grew 3.2% year-on-year to CZK 3.2 trillion and imports rose 3.6% to CZK 3.3 trillion.

The Czech National Bank expects the overall trade balance for 2019 to show a deficit of CZK 180 billion. The wider-than-expected October deficit is unlikely to prompt any shift in the central bank's  policy stance, analysts said. The bank uses interest rates as its main policy tool and rates have been stable for over two years.

In its latest economic forecast, the Czech National Bank predicted 3% GDP growth next year driven by household spending and a slower pace of growth in external demand. The central bank sees inflation staying at or slightly above its 2% target over the next two years.
