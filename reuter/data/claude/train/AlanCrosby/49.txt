Eastern European Markets Continue to Slump in Autumn with No End in Sight, Except for Budapest and Ljubljana  

Financial markets in Eastern Europe have continued their downward trend this autumn with most major indexes in the region posting losses for the third consecutive quarter. Ongoing global trade tensions, Brexit uncertainty, and slowing growth in Western European economies have dampened investor sentiment across Central and Eastern Europe.

The Polish WIG20 index fell over 9% in the third quarter, bringing its year-to-date loss to 14.2%. The Czech PX index dropped 8.2% in Q3 and is down 10.8% for the year. The Romanian BET index has plunged 18.1% so far in 2019 as the government struggles with rising budget deficits and conflict with the EU over judicial reforms. Outside the EU, the Russian RTS index has tumbled 25% this year amid lower oil prices and weak economic data.  

However, the Hungarian BUX index and Slovenian SBITOP index have bucked the regional trend, posting modest gains for the quarter and year thanks to strong domestic consumer spending and export growth in both countries. The BUX index rose 3.4% in Q3 and is up 9.6% for the year. The SBITOP has gained 2.1% in 2019, supported by a robust Slovenian economy that grew 4.8% year-over-year in Q2.

"The widening divergence we’re seeing between indexes like the BUX and SBITOP versus the broader regional trend highlights the benefits of less exposure to volatile global trade and closer ties with the core EU market,” said Lukasz Wroblewski, an analyst at Raiffeisen Bank International. 

Economists say the negative market impacts are likely to persist for several more quarters at a minimum. “We see no major catalysts for an upward turnaround across most of the region until uncertainty over trade, Brexit, and EU economic growth start to lift,” said Agata Urbanska, a senior economist for ING in Warsaw.

Budapest and Ljubljana may continue to outperform neighboring markets in the short term, but a prolonged downturn across Western Europe poses risks even for the CEE region’s strongest economies. Barring no further deterioration in external conditions or domestic politics, however, Hungary and Slovenia appear well-positioned to again lead an eventual rebound across Central and Eastern Europe.
