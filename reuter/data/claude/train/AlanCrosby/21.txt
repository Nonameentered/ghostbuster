Czech September Trade Deficit to Grow by 13-15 Billion Crowns, Say Economists 

Economists predict the Czech Republic's trade deficit will widen in September due to slowing export growth and steady imports. Analysts surveyed by Reuters forecast the deficit to range between 13 billion to 15 billion Czech crowns ($570 million to $660 million) for September, up from 11.6 billion crowns in August.

The Czech economy is heavily dependent on exports, especially to the European Union which accounts for over 80% of total exports. However, export growth is slowing down due to weakening demand from Germany and other major trading partners. At the same time, imports remain resilient as domestic demand stays solid, supported by rising wages and low unemployment.

"Export dynamics are really unflattering, mainly due to developments in Germany, which is battling an economic slowdown. That is prompting Czech exporters to search for new markets to make up for that," said Raiffeisenbank analyst Ondrej Habal.  

The Czech National Bank expects the trade balance to contribute negatively to economic growth in the second half of this year and the whole of 2020. The central bank predicts the Czech economy will grow by 2.4% this year, and slow further to 2.1% in 2020, well below rates of over 3% seen in recent years.

While the trade gap is set to widen, the current account balance, which also includes services and transfers, should remain slightly in surplus due to a thriving tourism sector. The service balance showed a surplus of 6.4 billion crowns in August.

The Czech trade and current account balances have been volatile in recent years, swinging from deficits to surpluses, depending on global economic conditions. The small, open economy and its reliance on exports and imports leaves it exposed to swings in foreign demand, trade conflicts and other external shocks.

The Czech Statistics Office will report the September trade balance figures on November 8th. Analysts will be closely watching the data for signs of further deterioration in the country's external balances.
