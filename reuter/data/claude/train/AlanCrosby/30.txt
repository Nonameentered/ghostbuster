Headline: Sepap Group's Nine-Month Net Profit Falls Due to Shutdown of Main Paper Mill and Downturn in Paper Cycle

Sepap Group, one of the largest paper product manufacturers in Asia, reported a 23.4% decline in net profit for the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period last year. Net profit fell to $180.9 million from $236.1 million in 2019 due to the temporary shutdown of its main paper mill in Q2 2020 and weaker demand and pricing in the paper industry. 

Revenue for the nine months declined 5.7% to $4.88 billion from $5.17 billion in 2019 as Sepap's paper, packaging, and wood products segments were impacted by the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The temporary closure of Sepap's integrated pulp and paper mill in Indonesia for most of Q2 2020 led to a 12.4% drop in paper volume. Although the mill has resumed operations, it is still ramping up to full capacity.

The paper segment was the hardest hit, with revenue falling 11.2% from $2.73 billion to $2.43 billion. Volumes declined in higher-margin printing and copier paper by 15.6% and in paperboard by 7.3%. Prices also came under pressure, declining for most paper grades. The packaging division fared slightly better, with revenue dropping 4.1% to $1.96 billion as some demand for essential packaging products was sustained.  

"It was a difficult nine months with our main mill shut for COVID-19 containment efforts and demand being suppressed in many of our markets," said Peter Ng, CEO of Sepap Group. "Although we have begun ramping up again, the road ahead remains challenging with the threat of further shutdowns still present and economic activity still muted."

Ng cautioned that Q4 2020 is likely to remain weak before conditions start to recover in 2021. Sepap has reduced operating costs and deferred all non-essential capital expenditures to offset the impacts of lower volume and pricing. It has also diversified into hygienic products like tissues and sanitary pads, which have seen stronger demand during the pandemic. 

Sepap's shares fell 3.2% on the news, underperforming the broader market's decline of 1.7%. Analysts expect Sepap's net profit to fall by at least 29% for the full year 2020 due to ongoing issues in its paper and end-user segments. However, its strong balance sheet, integrated operations, and diversification into paper packaging and hygienic products are expected to see it through this difficult period.
