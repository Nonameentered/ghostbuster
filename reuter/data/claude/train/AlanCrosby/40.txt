Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus' Three-Party Coalition Wins Majority in Senate Run-Off Elections

Prague—The coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus captured a majority in the Czech Senate today in run-off elections, cementing control of parliament and setting the leader up for a full term in office. 

Klaus' coalition—made up of his Civic Democratic Party, the Christian Democrats, and the Union of Freedom Party—won 13 of the 27 seats up for election in the run-offs, increasing its majority in the Senate to 35 of the 81 seats. The results capped a closely watched contest that was seen as a referendum on Klaus and his free-market policies in the post-communist nation.

"The people have given us a mandate to continue with reforms," Klaus said in a victory speech to supporters chanting "Klaus, Klaus." He added, "This win is an answer to all who criticize our vision of transforming this country into a prosperous and secure democracy."

The Senate run-offs pitted the top two finishers from last month's first round of voting in each district. Klaus' coalition went into the run-offs with a 22-seat Senate majority. By winning over half the seats, it now has a larger buffer against opposition efforts to block legislation.

The run-off results were a setback for the opposition Social Democrats, who gained only 4 seats. Social Democratic leader Milos Zeman had framed the elections as a chance for voters to curb what he called Klaus' "unfettered" economic reforms and tilt more toward a Western European-style social model. 

Continued public unease with high unemployment, austerity cuts, and corruption scandals had given Zeman's party an opening. But Klaus campaigned vigorously around the country, arguing that the fiscal pain was necessary and that prosperity would come if voters had patience. The results suggest many Czechs still endorse that vision.

While the Senate victory gives Klaus momentum, the next flashpoint is shaping up to be the country's first EU parliamentary elections next month. Klaus is a staunch Eurosceptic, and gains by parties with opposing pro-EU views could curb his influence on EU policy. For now, however, Klaus appears well positioned to advance his goal of privatizing state industries and cutting bureaucracy in the months ahead. His coalition controls both chambers of parliament, and the Senate results will make any attempt to oust him more difficult.

In the end, Klaus seems to have benefited from a recovering economy, divided opposition, and his own energetic campaign. Today's Senate victory suggests Klaus will remain the dominant figure in Czech politics as the country seeks to strengthen its democratic institutions and capitalist economy after decades of communist rule.
