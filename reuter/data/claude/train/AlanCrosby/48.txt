Eastern European Markets Continue Autumn Slump with Little Hope for Change  

The stock markets across Eastern Europe continued their downward slide this week with most major indices firmly in the red. The declines were seen as part of a wider global trend of retreating equities led by mounting uncertainty around trade disputes between the United States and China. However, Eastern European markets face additional headwinds including sputtering economic growth, declining exports, and political instability in some countries.  

The largest fall was seen in the Hungarian stock market, with the BUX index down nearly 3% for the week. The benchmark index has declined over 18% since reaching an all-time high in April. The declines were broad-based across sectors, with financials and industrials seeing some of the steepest drops. Analysts pointed to growing doubts about the health of the export-dependent Hungarian economy in the face of slowing German GDP growth. 

In Poland, the WIG index slid 1.8% amid concerns over government policies that critics argue undermine judicial independence and the rule of law. The ruling right-wing Law and Justice party passed controversial reforms giving politicians more control over the judiciary, raising fears of further isolation within the European Union. The Polish economy has been one of the strongest performers in the region, but the political turmoil is starting to take its toll on markets.

Other major stock markets followed the downward trend, with Russia's RTS index and the Czech PX index dropping 1.6% and 1.2% respectively for the week. Foreign investors have been net sellers across the region for the past several months, pulling out funds at some of the fastest rates since the financial crisis. Unless economic or political conditions shift in the coming months, analysts say emerging European markets may continue to underperform through the end of the year and into 2020. For the autumn at least, there appears little hope of a change in trajectory. Overall, it was another dismal week for Eastern European markets with storm clouds on the horizon and no immediate end in sight.
