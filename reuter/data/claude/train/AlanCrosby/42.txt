Prague Stock Exchange Hits New Year-High thanks to Strong Gains from Major Banks 

The Prague Stock Exchange reached its highest point of the year today, fueled by strong gains from major Czech banking stocks. The PX Index, the main benchmark of the Prague Stock Exchange, rose over 3% to close at 1,128, the highest level since January 2019.

Shares of Komercni Banka, the Czech Republic's third-largest bank, rose nearly 8% after reporting higher than expected profits for the first quarter of the year. The bank earned 12.3 billion koruna ($550 million) in the first three months of 2019, a 15% increase from the same period last year. Most analysts had forecast profits of around 11 billion koruna. The better than expected results were driven by rising interest rates in the Czech Republic and growth in loans to businesses and consumers.

"We see continued healthy growth in the Czech economy which is translating into solid demand for loans," said Jan Juska, Komercni Banka's Chief Financial Officer. "We were able to increase our lending volumes while also raising interest rates on new loans, which drove the increase in our profitability."

Shares of the nation's largest bank, Ceska Sporitelna, also rose sharply, gaining over 5% after it reported a 12% rise in first-quarter profits this morning. Its earnings of 14.9 billion koruna beat analysts' estimates of 14.4 billion koruna. 

The overall rise in bank stocks propelled the broader Prague Stock Exchange to its best level in 2019 and one of its strongest days in the last year. Trading volume on the exchange was 33% higher than the daily average as investors reacted to the unexpectedly strong bank results. 

"The banking sector is the engine driving the Czech economy and stock market," said Tomas Hlavenka, an analyst at Patria Finance in Prague. "When the banks post solid results like today, it gives investors confidence and leads to broad-based buying across the whole exchange."
