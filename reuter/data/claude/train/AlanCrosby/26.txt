SPT Telecom Reports 6.0 Billion Crowns Gross Profit in Nine-Month Period

SPT Telecom, the largest telecommunications company in the country, reported a gross profit of 6.0 billion crowns in the first nine months of this year. This represents an increase of 3.2% from the same period last year.  

The company attributed the improved results to continued growth in its mobile business and broadband Internet services. Revenue from the mobile segment grew by 5.7% year over year, driven by both an expanding subscriber base as well as higher average revenue per user. SPT Telecom now has over 15 million mobile subscribers, making it the clear leader in the market.

Broadband Internet services also showed robust growth, with revenue up 12.4% from the same period last year. SPT Telecom has invested heavily in expanding its fiber-optic network across the country, enabling it to offer faster Internet speeds and gain new subscribers. The company now provides broadband Internet services to over 3 million households.  

While the mobile and broadband segments fueled revenue growth, SPT Telecom’s landline telephone business continued its steady decline. Revenue from landline services fell by 8.2% as more customers cut the cord in favor of mobile or Internet-based alternatives. However, the landline segment still contributes over 30% of total revenue.

“We delivered another solid quarter with healthy growth in our key growth segments of mobile and broadband,” said Peter Sonefors, CEO of SPT Telecom. “Our fiber infrastructure investments are clearly paying off, enabling us to provide customers with faster speeds and an enhanced experience. We remain optimistic about continued progress in the fourth quarter and into next year.”

SPT Telecom is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden and employs over 25,000 people. The company was founded in 1878 and was formerly owned by the Swedish government before its privatization in the 1990s. SPT Telecom’s shares trade on the Stockholm Stock Exchange under the ticker SPTB.
