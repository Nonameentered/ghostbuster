Czech telecom operator SPT reports 6.0 billion crown gross profit for nine-month period  

Czech telecommunications operator SPT reported a 6.0 billion crown ($250 million) gross profit for the first nine months of 2019, citing growing mobile data usage and improved cost efficiencies.

The company, majority owned by Slovak telecom operator Slovak Telekom, said its operating revenue in January-September edged up 1.3% year-on-year to 24.5 billion crowns. Mobile data usage jumped 57% as SPT benefited from growing demand for mobile internet services.

SPT has sought to offset declining revenue from traditional voice services by promoting data plans and discontinuing some older technology like 2G. Its mobile data revenue rose nearly 15% in the nine months while revenue from mobile voice calls fell 10.4%.  

Fixed-line revenue was flat at 9.8 billion crowns as SPT gained customers for broadband internet but lost some television subscribers. The company had 3.5 billion mobile customers at the end of September, up 2.9% from a year earlier.

"The positive development of operating results confirms that our strategy focused on increasing the share of revenue from mobile data and ICT services is correct and effective," SPT Chief Executive Branimir Maric said in a statement.

SPT's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 4.1% year-on-year to 12.0 billion crowns, while its EBITDA margin increased to 48.9% from 47.6%. The company said it benefited from an efficiency program that has cut costs by more than 4 billion crowns over the past three years.

Capital expenditures fell 13% to 4.3 billion crowns as SPT reduced spending on new technology while still improving its mobile and fixed networks. The company launched commercial 5G services in parts of Prague and Brno this year as part of its strategy to bring new technology to customers.

SPT kept its outlook for full-year operating revenue growth of 1-2% and EBITDA growth of 3-5% in 2019. The company is controlled by Slovak Telekom, which is part of the Deutsche Telekom group.
