Central Bank Scheme to Buy Doubtful Debts of Smaller Banks Gains Interest from 10 Participating Banks

The central bank today announced that 10 smaller commercial banks have expressed interest in participating in the recently launched scheme to buy their non-performing assets or doubtful debts. The scheme offers these smaller lenders an opportunity to clean up their balance sheets by selling their bad loans to the central bank. 

The central bank will buy the non-performing loans through a bidding process, where the lenders will offer their bad loan portfolios to the central bank. The central bank will evaluate the loan portfolios and make an offer to the lenders for purchasing the non-performing assets. The scheme aims to provide liquidity to the smaller lenders so they can focus on providing new loans to businesses and consumers.

The 10 banks that have expressed interest in the scheme have a collective 40 billion in non-performing loans, making up nearly 15% of their total lending. Offloading these bad loans is expected to free up their capital and enable fresh lending. The central bank has set aside 100 billion for purchasing such assets from smaller lenders in the current financial year.

A spokesperson for the central bank said, “The scheme has generated good interest from smaller lenders who have a high proportion of non-performing loans. Our aim is to clean up their books and strengthen them to support more lending to productive sectors of the economy.”

However, some analysts remain skeptical about the scheme's benefits. “The central bank will be taking on a lot of risk by buying doubtful debts. If a large proportion of these loans turn out to be unrecoverable, it can dent the central bank's finances,” said a banking analyst from a credit rating agency. However, the central bank remains confident that through rigorous evaluation and settlement, it can recover a good part of the non-performing loans over time.

The scheme is open for the rest of the current financial year. More smaller lenders are expected to show interest, given the opportunity to clean up their balance sheets at a subsidized cost. The central bank hopes a good response will help boost lending and support continued economic growth.
