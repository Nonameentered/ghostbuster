Senate Runoff Elections in Czech Republic Expected to Have Minimal Impact on Capital Markets 

The two second-round Senate elections being held this weekend in the Czech Republic are expected to have minimal impact on financial markets according to analysts. The runoff elections on January 12th and 13th will determine the winners of the final two Senate seats where no candidate received a majority in the first round of voting last October. While the elections have importance in the domestic political dynamics within the Czech Republic, markets are not anticipating any changes that would influence investment prospects or the economy.

The Czech Senate has limited powers compared to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament where Prime Minister Andrej Babiš’s ANO party holds a majority. The Senate can propose or amend legislation but the Chamber of Deputies has the final say. "The results of these two Senate runoff votes may influence political debates within the Czech Republic but we do not expect any direct policy or economic impact," said Jan Vejmělek, an economist at CSOB bank in Prague. 

The two Senate seats up for runoff elections are in District No. 22 centered around Přerov and District No. 24 covering parts of the Moravian-Silesian Region. In District 22, the runoff is between a candidate from the Christian Democrats, part of the governing coalition, and an independent. In District 24, the runoff is between a candidate from ANO, Prime Minister Babiš’s centrist party, and a candidate from the anti-establishment Freedom and Direct Democracy party. Neither runoff is considered particularly consequential for Prague's markets or business policies.

“The overall make-up of the Senate is not going to change significantly regardless of the outcomes in these two districts,” said Martin Ekrt, a political analyst with the polling firm STEM. “For Prime Minister Babiš and the Czech government, the impact will really depend on the results of the Chamber of Deputies elections later this year. The Senate runoffs themselves should not be an immediate focus or prompt any strong reactions.”

With the outcomes expected to be inconsequential, markets and investors are anticipated to remain largely indifferent to this weekend's results. The next major political events that could influence Czech markets will be the Chamber of Deputies elections scheduled for October 2021. Barring an unexpected outcome in the Senate runoffs, the elections are set to pass without much notice financially. Overall, political stability and a steady policy environment remain supportive for Czech assets.
