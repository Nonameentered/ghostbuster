Czech Senate Elections Give Government a Boost, but Capital Market Remains Dormant 

The Czech Senate elections held last weekend gave the ruling coalition government led by Prime Minister Andrej Babiš a boost by confirming its majority in the upper house. However, the country’s capital markets remained largely unchanged as investors were cautious about extrapolating the results.

The ruling ANO party and the Czech Social Democratic Party won more than half of the 27 seats up for election in the 81-seat Senate. The victory affirmed the position of the coalition, which also has a majority in the lower house, and will allow it to continue pushing through its political agenda over the next two years.

“The results show the Czech people continue to support our vision and path for the country,” Prime Minister Babiš said in a statement. “We have a stable government and we will keep working hard to increase pensions, improve healthcare and education, and invest in infrastructure.”

However, the capital market in Prague showed little reaction to the news. The Czech Stock Exchange’s PX Index was largely flat, gaining only 0.1% on Monday. The koruna currency also barely moved against the euro.  

Analysts said investors remained cautious ahead of upcoming data on economic growth, exports and industrial production. Tomas Cvikl, an economist at Patria Finance in Prague, said Senate elections rarely have a strong influence on markets. 

“Investors need to see real evidence that the economy is gaining strength before changing their positions significantly,” Cvikl said. “The government has promised economic reforms and growth-stimulating measures but so far there have only been limited changes.”

Even with a strong coalition in place, the Babiš government faces many hurdles to substantive policy changes. The opposition has enough seats to block constitutional changes, and policies like tax hikes on banks and major corporations are likely to face legal challenges. Most analysts think major economic reforms are unlikely before the next general election in two years.

Overall, the election results indicate the government will remain stable in the coming months. But to galvanize the nation’s capital markets and trigger stronger investment, Babiš and his allies will need to deliver concrete changes that boost growth, justify business optimism and drive the Czech economy forward.
