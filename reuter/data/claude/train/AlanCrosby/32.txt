Czechs show record low turnout in Senate elections 

Prague, Czech Republic - Voters in the Czech Republic showed little interest in the country’s biennial Senate elections this weekend, with a record low turnout of just over 15 percent in the first round of voting on Friday and Saturday. The dismal participation threatens to undermine the credibility of the Senate, the upper house of the Czech parliament.

The 100-seat Senate, with members serving six-year terms, holds limited powers compared to the lower house. But its approval is required for constitutional changes and treaties. The Senate has recently opposed some policies of the populist government, creating tensions. Low turnout allows candidates with minimal voter support to win seats, critics argue.

According to the Czech Statistical Office, only 15.38 percent of eligible voters - about 1.5 million out of 9.4 million - cast ballots in the first round of the election. Turnout has been decreasing steadily, down from 20 percent in 2016, 29 percent in 2012 and 42 percent in 2010. The final round of voting is scheduled for next weekend.  “Such a low turnout means the Senators have a very weak mandate and legitimacy,” said Jakub Moravec, a political analyst in Prague.

The ruling ANO party and opposition Civic Democrats did well in the first round, finishing first or second in 24 of the 27 districts. The ultra-liberal Pirate Party also advanced to the second round in several districts. The center-left Social Democrats, traditionally one of the Big Three parties in Czech politics, struggled. The party received just 6 percent of the vote nationwide and will have candidates in run-off votes in only six districts.

The low turnout was not a surprise, given Czechs’ increasing disillusionment with politics as usual and their focus on their own well-being. “Many Czechs just don't seem to care much about politics and public affairs,” said Milan Koukal, a voter in central Bohemia. “As long as the country is doing OK and their lives are stable, that's good enough for them.”

The Senate has long been a natural target of public apathy and skepticism. But the trend of sinking voter turnout, especially among younger Czechs, is consistent across all types of elections. During last year's general election for the lower house of Parliament, turnout was 60.8 percent, the lowest in the post-Communist era. Alarmed by the trend, some political leaders and activists are advocating making voting mandatory, as in some other countries.

The run-off round of Senate elections will be held on October 19-20. Roughly 2 to 3 million registered voters are again expected to stay home. While the Senate’s powers are limited, experts warn its dwindling legitimacy due to low voter turnout could create problems down the road. The body may face calls to be abolished altogether.
