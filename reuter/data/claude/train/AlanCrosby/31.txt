Sepap Group's Nine-Month Net Profit Falls due to Paper Mill Shutdown and Downturn in Paper Cycle 

Sepap Group, one of the largest paper and packaging companies in Southeast Asia, announced today that its net profit for the first nine months of the year declined by 15% compared to the same period last year. The company attributed the lower earnings to the temporary shutdown of its largest paper mill for maintenance and upgrades, as well as the cyclical downturn of paper prices.

Net profit for the January to September period fell to $112 million from $132 million in the previous year. Revenue was flat at $1.8 billion. The company said production at its main paper mill in Indonesia was halted for 45 days in the second quarter to facilitate a $60 million equipment upgrade, reducing total paper output by over 10% so far this year.  

The shutdown compounded the impact of weak paper prices, which have declined by an estimated 8% this year due to an oversupply in the market. The price of paper pulp, the key raw material, has also remained elevated, compressing profit margins.

“It has been a challenging year for the paper industry, and we were not spared,” said Sepap Group CEO Paul Chan. “The scheduled mill upgrade was necessary to boost future productivity and efficiency, but the temporary closure exacerbated the effects of lackluster demand and pricing.”

Despite the headwinds, Sepap Group said its packaging business, which produces cardboard boxes and other paper packaging materials, grew at a stable pace. The packaging division accounts for nearly 40% of revenue and half of total profits. Mr. Chan said he expects the corrugated packaging market to continue expanding at a mid-single-digit rate. 

The company has also started ramping up production at its Indonesian paper mill which reopened in August. Barring further weakness in paper prices, Sepap Group said it anticipates net profit for the full year will still register low single-digit growth over 2018, buoyed by an anticipated firming of prices in the fourth quarter and continuing momentum in the packaging segment.

“We are cautiously optimistic that paper prices will stabilize and the worst of the downturn is behind us,” Mr. Chan said. “Sepap Group has weathered previous cycles and emerged stronger, and we are confident the same will hold true again.”
