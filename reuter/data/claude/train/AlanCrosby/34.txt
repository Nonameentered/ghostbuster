Czech Markets Surge on Strong Showing by Right-Wing Party in Senate Elections, but Analysts Warn of Potential Profit Taking and Uncertainty in Second Round  

The Prague Stock Exchange saw a strong opening to trading this morning as investors reacted positively to the surprise victory of right-wing opposition party Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) in first-round Senate elections over the weekend. The benchmark PX index surged more than 3% in early trading, led by gains in utility, industrial and financial stocks. 

The snap elections, called by President Milos Zeman earlier this year, were seen as a referendum on the ruling coalition government led by the populist ANO party and the Czech Social Democratic Party. The rise of the anti-immigration, euroskeptic SPD party, which won 10 of the 27 Senate seats up for election, signals voter dissatisfaction with the status quo. The elections were "a wake-up call for the government,” said Tomas Richter, head of economics at the investment firm Patria Finance.

However, analysts warned investors not to get carried away. Second-round runoff elections scheduled for next weekend could result in a mixed outcome and continued political fragmentation. “There are still too many wildcards in play to determine exactly how much influence the SPD will wield in the Senate,” said Monika Kofrova at KB Bank in Prague. She noted the SPD will have to build coalitions to pass any legislation, and its protectionist economic policies could ultimately hamper growth if implemented.

Others pointed to the risk of profit taking in the coming days, arguing the initial market surge was an overreaction. “The PX index has gained over 10% this year already, so we could see some market participants locking in gains before the final results of the Senate elections are known,” said Radomir Jac, chief economist at Generali Investments CE. He suggested any major policy changes were unlikely in the short term. “For now, we advise investors to exercise caution,” Jac said. 

The two-round Senate election continues the recent trend of voters in Central Europe opting for populist and nationalist parties, as seen recently in Poland's and Hungary's general elections. The rise of these factions could increase political turmoil and division at a time when cooperation is needed on key issues like immigration and eurozone reform. How that dynamic will play out in the Czech Republic, as well as the wider region, remains to be seen.
