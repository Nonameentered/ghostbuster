Czech Capital Market Needs Independent Regulator, But Not a Silver Bullet for Transparency Woes

The Czech capital market is poised for growth but struggles with a lack of transparency and investor protection. The establishment of an independent securities regulator could help address some of these issues but is not a panacea, according to experts.

The Prague Stock Exchange has seen a rise in issuers and trading volumes in recent years as the Czech economy strengthens. However, the market still lacks an independent regulatory body to enforce disclosure rules and protect minority shareholders. The Czech National Bank currently oversees the exchange but also regulates the banking sector, creating potential conflicts of interest. 

“An independent securities commission is absolutely critical for the development of the Czech capital market,” said Pavel Hollmann, a lawyer specializing in corporate governance. “But it needs to be part of a broader set of reforms to truly improve transparency and win back investor trust.”

In particular, experts point to the need for stricter rules around related-party transactions, shareholder rights, and the timely disclosure of price-sensitive information. The issue was highlighted again recently with the surprise announcement that majority shareholders in Moneta Money Bank would sell their stakes, sending the stock price tumbling over 15 percent in one day. Minority investors were left with little recourse or ability to anticipate the development.

“The Moneta situation showed again that minority shareholders in the Czech Republic have almost no rights and very limited access to information,” said a fund manager at a Prague-based investment firm who declined to be named. “A new securities commission will help but much more needs to be done to align with EU transparency standards.” 

Promises of new legislation and an independent regulator have been made repeatedly over the last decade with little actual progress. But with the economy motoring ahead and capital markets in neighboring countries pulling further ahead, experts hope there is now real impetus for change. The establishment of an independent securities regulator may be an important first step, but broader reform will be needed to truly establish the Czech capital market and win back investor confidence after years of neglect. Overall, an independent regulator is needed but will not be a quick fix or silver bullet for the transparency woes that have long plagued the market. Incremental but comprehensive reforms will likely be required to meaningfully move the needle.
