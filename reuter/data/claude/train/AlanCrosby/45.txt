Czech Shares Rally on Technical Correction Following Coalition Win in Senate Elections

Shares in the Czech Republic rallied today as investors cited a technical correction following the victory of the center-right ruling coalition in weekend senate elections. The PX index rose 1.5% mid-day, erasing last week's losses. 

The ruling coalition of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš’s ANO party and the Social Democrats won 15 of the 27 seats up for election in the weekend vote, cementing their control of parliament's upper house. The results suggest political stability will continue, easing fears of early elections that some had warned could lead to a period of uncertainty.

“The election results removed the tail risk of early elections and suggest continuity in policies,” said Michal Brožka, an analyst with Wood & Co. in Prague. “We see the senate results as supportive for local assets.”

The koruna currency also strengthened 0.3% against the euro, extending gains this year to more than 1%. The Czech economy has been one of the best performers in Europe, with growth of more than 2% and record low unemployment. Investors had been concerned that political turmoil could disrupt the economic momentum.  

The coalition victory was not a surprise but the margin of the win was wider than expected. The opposition went into the election hoping to chip away at the government's majority but won only four seats. Voter turnout, however, remained low at just over 17%, reflecting a mix of voter apathy and satisfaction with the status quo.

“It seems voters are reasonably content, the economy is doing well, and there are no strong reasons for people to turn against the government,” said Michal Kořan of the STEM polling agency.

Still, the coalition faces challenges in pushing through some economic reforms and managing tensions within the alliance. ANO is a centrist populist party while the Social Democrats represent more traditional leftist values. There are also concerns about ongoing conflicts of interest related to Mr. Babiš's substantial business holdings.

Political stability and further reforms are needed to ensure strong and sustainable growth in the Czech economy, analysts said. But for now, investors appear relieved and local markets have room to gain further if the period of predictability holds.
