Right-wing party takes lead in Czech Senate elections with low turnout despite presidential appeal

The right-wing Freedom and Direct Democracy Party took the lead in the first round of the Czech Senate elections held over the weekend, preliminary results show. The independent candidates supported by the party won 10 of the 27 seats up for election, gaining the most seats. However, voter turnout was only 15.38%, despite appeals from the country's President Milos Zeman for people to participate in greater numbers.

The three-day elections were the first held under new rules that make it easier for independent candidates to run. The main opposition Civic Democrats and the Social Democrats each won four seats, while the Communists won three seats. The ANO movement, the senior party in the ruling coalition government, did not win any seats in this round of voting. Run-off votes will now be held in the 13 electoral districts where no candidate secured an absolute majority.  

President Zeman had appealed to voters to turn out in higher numbers for the elections, saying "Every citizen who does not vote will vote through their inactivity in favor of extremism.‚Äù However, his message appears to have resonated little with the public, as turnout was down from the previous Senate elections in 2016. The low turnout likely benefited smaller parties like the Freedom and Direct Democracy party, as their core base of supporters made sure to vote while other parties' supporters stayed home.

Commentators expressed disappointment with the low turnout, viewing it as a sign of disenchantment with politics and a lack of competitive choices on offer. However, others argued that for Senate elections, which receive little media attention, it is unsurprising that many voters do not feel motivated enough to cast ballots. The Senate has little political power compared with the lower house of Parliament in the Czech Republic.

The run-off rounds will be held on October 26 and 27, with the newly elected Senators taking their seats in November to serve six-year terms. The final makeup of the 81-member Senate will be determined once the remaining seats are filled, but the Freedom and Direct Democracy party looks poised to increase its representation and influence in the upper chamber.
