Czech Monthly Trade Deficit Eases, Surprising Analysts and Boosting Market Sentiment  

The Czech Republic reported a smaller-than-expected trade deficit for April, surprising analysts and boosting optimism about the nation's economic outlook.

The trade deficit narrowed to CZK 15.2 billion ($660 million) in April, according to data released today by the Czech Statistical Office. That was less than half the CZK 32.4 billion deficit recorded in March and below the CZK 20 billion median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  

Exports rose 3.3% from a year earlier to CZK 315.2 billion, mainly driven by increased sales of vehicles, machinery, and mineral fuels. Imports climbed at a slower pace of 0.8% to CZK 330.4 billion. The improved trade figures suggest domestic demand is stabilizing after a slowdown in the first quarter.

"These trade numbers are encouraging," said Michal Brozka, an economist at Ceska Sporitelna AS in Prague. "The improvement in net trade could add 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points to economic growth this quarter."

The data added to evidence the economy is picking up pace again after expansion slowed to 0.6% in the first quarter, the weakest in more than two years. Economic growth is projected to accelerate to 2.6% this year, according to the Czech central bank.

The figures come as the central bank debates when to start raising interest rates from near zero. Two board members voted to increase the main rate by 25 basis points at the May 2 policy meeting. The differing views are clouding the policy outlook.

The rate decision, improving economic data and easing political tensions lifted market sentiment in May. The Prague Stock Exchange's PX Index climbed 3.4% this month, the most in the region. The koruna has appreciated 0.6% against the euro, the most in the world.

"The longer the central bank waits with rate hikes, the higher the risk of overheating the economy," said Jakub Seidler, chief economist at ING Bank NV's Prague branch. "Today's data reduced that risk and averted the need for the central bank to take any rush actions."

The narrower-than-expected trade shortfall in April should temper inflation pressures and allow the central bank to delay rate increases until August, according to Brozka. Policy makers next meet on June 26 to set rates.
