Record-low turnout in Czech Senate elections suggest far-right may be the real winners 

Prague - Voter turnout in the Czech Republic’s Senate elections hit a record low this weekend, raising concerns that fringe and extremist parties are gaining more influence. Just over 15% of eligible voters cast ballots to elect 27 of the Senate’s 81 seats, the lowest turnout for any election since the fall of communism in 1989.

The ruling centrist ANO party led by Prime Minister Andrej Babiš won the most seats, taking 9 in the upper chamber. But the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party also made gains, increasing their Senate seats from 1 to 2. The SPD promotes an anti-immigration and Eurosceptic platform, and its charismatic leader Tomio Okamura has been likened to nationalist leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orban.

The low turnout indicates a high level of voter apathy and frustration with the political establishment. But it also means that fringe parties with motivated supporters, like the SPD, are able to win seats with a relatively small number of votes. The SPD received just over 6% of the national vote in the last parliamentary elections in 2017, but their supporters appear far more likely to actually turn out for local and regional elections like the Senate vote.  

Political analysts warn that if established parties cannot re-engage disaffected voters, the power of extremist groups in the Czech Republic will continue to grow. “When turnout is so low, it shows these Senate elections are really just a mobilization game for highly motivated fringe voters,” said Alena Klvaňová, a political scientist at Masaryk University. “Mainstream parties should be very worried about this trend.”

The Czech Republic is not alone in facing a crisis of voter turnout and the rise of anti-establishment parties. Across Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Western nations like France and Italy, long-standing centrist parties have struggled in recent years. Incumbents are being challenged by populist outsiders who promise radical solutions to issues like economic inequality, immigration, and political corruption. The SPD and other far-right groups will likely try to capitalize on the current political turmoil and translate their limited Senate success into greater power.
