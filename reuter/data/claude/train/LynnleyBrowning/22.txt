Azerbaijan Wins Fourth Multi-Billion-Dollar Oil Deal as It Outstrips Russia in Attracting Foreign Investment for Caspian Projects  

Azerbaijan secured its fourth multibillion-dollar oil deal this year, outpacing its rival Russia in attracting foreign investment to develop energy projects in the oil-rich Caspian Sea region.    

British oil major BP signed an agreement with Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR to develop the Shafag-Asiman offshore block in the Caspian Sea, the companies announced today. The deal is valued at $3.9 billion and aims to produce 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the block. 

The agreement highlights Azerbaijan’s success in positioning itself as the premier destination for energy investment in the former Soviet region as Russia struggles with Western sanctions and a sluggish economy. Since the beginning of the year, Azerbaijan has signed deals worth a combined $18 billion with BP, Italy’s Eni, Norway’s Equinor, and Saudi Arabia’s Aramco to boost oil and gas output in the Caspian Sea.

“Azerbaijan is open for business, and we welcome all investors and partners to work with us to fully realize the potential of our natural resources,” said President Ilham Aliyev at the signing ceremony with BP executives in Baku.   

In contrast, new investment in Russia’s oil and gas sector has slowed to a trickle due to risks from Western sanctions over Ukraine and a unstable ruble. As Azerbaijan courts western oil majors, Russian energy companies have faced obstacles accessing technology and financing to develop complex offshore and shale projects.

The Shafag-Asiman block, located 125 kilometers offshore Baku, is thought to contain 1.5 billion barrels of oil reserves. BP will operate the block with a 30% stake, while SOCAR will hold the remaining 70%. Production from the block is expected to start in 2022 and last for 30 years.

BP called the deal a “historic milestone” that builds upon its 25-year partnership with Azerbaijan. “This is a unique opportunity to extend our business in a strategic nation and a core region for BP,” said BP CEO Bob Dudley.
