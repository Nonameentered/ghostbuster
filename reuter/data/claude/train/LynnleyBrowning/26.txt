Russian Finance Minister Warns Norilsk Nickel to Pay Overdue Taxes

Russia's Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, issued a stern warning today to mining giant Norilsk Nickel over unpaid taxes amounting to over $2 billion US dollars. Speaking at a press conference in Moscow, Siluanov said the company must pay the overdue taxes "without delay" or face potential consequences. 

Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium, has reportedly fallen behind on tax payments in 2018 and 2019. According to Siluanov, the total bill for overdue taxes owed by the company now stands at 157 billion rubles or just over $2 billion US dollars at current exchange rates. The Finance Ministry expects the taxes to be paid in full before the end of Russia's current financial year which concludes at the end of March.

“The law is equal for all taxpayers, regardless of their importance or size,” Siluanov said in comments to reporters. “If the company does not fulfill its tax obligations within the prescribed period, it will face the same consequences that apply to other taxpayers of the Russian Federation who do not pay taxes.” He declined to specify what potential actions or penalties the government may take if Norilsk Nickel fails to comply.

Norilsk Nickel, also known as Nornickel, has grown into Russia's largest metals and mining company and remains majority owned by billionaire Vladimir Potanin and his investment firm Interros. The company operates mines in Russia's Arctic north, including the massive Norilsk mining and smelting operation. Norilsk Nickel produces about 40% of the world's palladium and 5-10% of its nickel. While the company generates huge revenues, its profits can be volatile due to swings in global commodity prices.

In response to Siluanov's statements today, a spokesperson for Norilsk Nickel said the company has proposed a repayment schedule for the overdue taxes to the Russian government and remains in discussions. The schedule involves paying off the total tax bill in installments over the next 6-12 months. Norilsk Nickel maintains that its finances have remained strong despite the coronavirus pandemic and it expects its operations and tax payments to return to normal over the course of 2021. The company's management expects a constructive resolution to the situation, but it remains to be seen whether its proposal will satisfy Russia's Finance Ministry.
