Russia to Forgo Export Duty on Heavy Fuel Oil This Winter

The Russian government announced today that it will waive its export duty on heavy fuel oil (HFO) shipments for the winter season, running from December 1 through February 28. The move is aimed at boosting HFO exports at a time of year when domestic demand for the residual fuel declines in Russia. 

HFO is the thick, tar-like oil left over after the crude oil refining process. It is commonly used by ships as bunker fuel for their engines. Russia is a major producer and exporter of HFO, with nearly 70% of its HFO produced exported abroad. But in the winter, demand for the fuel drops in Russia as utility companies shift from HFO to natural gas and heating oil for powering furnaces and other equipment.

By eliminating the export tariff—which is normally set at $52 per tonne—for three winter months, Russia hopes to incentivize its oil refineries and traders to continue exporting HFO in large volumes over that period. Last winter when a similar duty waiver was in place, Russian HFO exports increased by 14% compared to the prior-year period. With international demand and spot prices for HFO also predicted to remain strong this coming winter, the tax break is expected to drive another sizable boost in Russian export volumes.

The export duty waiver is also timed to counter a new regulation by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) that took effect January 1, limiting the sulfur content in marine fuels to 0.5% from 3.5% previously. The rule change is spurring greater use of low-sulfur fuel oil by ships and decreased reliance on high-sulfur fuels like HFO. By dropping the export tax, Russia aims to make its HFO more price competitive on global markets despite weaker demand. 

Critics argue, however, that incentivizing HFO exports and consumption works against Russia’s environmental priorities. A government report earlier this year found that HFO combustion is the biggest source of air pollution in several major port cities, including St. Petersburg and Vladivostok. HFO also produces heavy black carbon emissions that accelerate Arctic ice melt. The export duty waiver may prolong Russia’s dependence on a fuel that causes severe health and environmental impacts, the critics contend.

Supporters counter that the three-month tax break will have limited impact while giving a boost to a sector of Russia's oil industry that is currently facing economic difficulties adapting to the IMO's new sulfur cap. They note that Russia has committed to meeting the new emissions standards by the IMO’s next deadline in 2025. A longer-term shift away from HFO is still needed, the supporters argue, but should not come at the cost of jobs and revenues over this winter season.

The debate highlights the tensions Russia faces balancing its economic interests with its environmental obligations, both regionally and globally. While the HFO export duty waiver may fulfill the former, it could further delay progress on the latter without a clear roadmap for unwinding use of the residual fuel.
