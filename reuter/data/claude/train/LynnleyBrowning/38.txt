Russian Aluminium Smelters Seek Consolidation to Rationalize Costs Amidst "Perplexing" World Prices, Says Industry Official  

The aluminium industry in Russia is ripe for consolidation and restructuring to reduce costs and increase efficiency, according to a top industry official. "Aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange have been perplexing over the last few years, swinging wildly based more on speculative trading rather than fundamentals," said Ivan Glushenkov, CEO of Rusal Aluminium, Russia's largest aluminium producer.  

The volatility in world aluminium prices, fueled by financial speculators, has created uncertainty for producers like Rusal which are investing in new production capacity to meet rising long-term demand for the metal. "While demand for aluminium, especially from the automotive and construction sectors, has been growing steadily, the prices we have received for our product have not kept pace due to the speculative activity in financial markets," said Glushenkov.  

Rusal and other Russian aluminium smelters are paying high costs for electricity and raw materials but have had little pricing power due to the disconnect between the physical market fundamentals and trading on the London exchange. Glushenkov believes the Russian industry needs to consolidate into larger companies to gain economies of scale, cut costs, and increase their leverage with buyers and the LME.   

"A consolidated larger producer will have more flexibility to restructure legacy assets, invest in modernization, and reduce overall costs to remain globally competitive despite the vagaries of speculative trading," said Glushenkov. Rusal, which produces about 3.7 million tonnes of aluminium annually, is in talks to acquire some of the smaller smelters, especially in Eastern Siberia where operating costs are higher due to ageing infrastructure. The company is also upgrading many of its own older smelters to reduce costs and comply with environmental regulations.

Restructuring the Russian aluminium industry will not be easy, however, as smaller smelters are reluctant to sell out given the potential upside if aluminium prices rebound on a sustainable basis. The Russian government, which still owns stakes in many metal producers, supports consolidation to strengthen the industry but needs attractive offers to sell its shares. Glushenkov remains optimistic the benefits of consolidation will win over reluctant players. "Scale and cost are key to success when metals industries are exposed to volatile markets and price moves that defy logical explanation."
