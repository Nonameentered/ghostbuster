Russia Faces Tough Competition from Returning Iraqi Oil to World Markets

Iraq is poised to flood world oil markets with crude in coming months as Baghdad ramps up exports and production, a move that could pressure oil prices lower and pose a serious competitive threat to other major oil exporters like Russia. 

Iraq has ambitious plans to boost oil production capacity by 1 million barrels per day this year to 5 million barrels per day. The country is also taking steps to increase oil exports, upgrading infrastructure like pipelines and port facilities. Iraq’s oil exports averaged 3.6 million barrels per day in January, the highest level in decades.

With the world’s fifth largest proven oil reserves, Iraq is in a strong position to gain market share if it follows through on expansion plans. Russia, with the largest oil reserves on the planet, has benefited in recent years from coordinated production cuts with OPEC and non-OPEC producers like Iraq. Those production cut deals have helped prop up oil prices, padding the coffers of petroleum-dependent economies.

However, Iraq appears poised to prioritize growing production and exports over cooperating with the production cut deals. Iraq has exceeded its production cut commitments on several occasions over the past year. Russia and Saudi Arabia, the two leaders of the producer group, have called on Iraq to fall in line. But those pleas appear to have fallen on deaf ears in Baghdad. Iraq seems focused on exploiting its massive oil bounty as a means to generate higher revenues, especially as the country faces a multitude of economic and security challenges.

The impending flood of additional Iraqi barrels could complicate Russia’s ambitions to maintain elevated oil prices. U.S. shale production also continues to rise, despite relatively flat oil prices. With more supply from Iraq and U.S. shale set to enter the market, demand may struggle to keep up. That points to the possibility of an oil price downturn if no action is taken.

To avoid a price slide and support Russia’s economic wellbeing, Moscow may need to double down on its coordination with OPEC and negotiate deeper production cuts. However, that strategy is not foolproof. Russia has grown weary of sacrificing volumes to prop up prices, a sentiment increasingly shared by other producers.

Deeper cuts are no guarantee of higher prices if Iraq moves ahead with plans to boost exports and if shale drillers in the U.S. ramp up activity. But Moscow has little choice but to continue collaborating with its OPEC partners if it wants to defend its position in global oil markets in the face of ambitious competitors like Iraq. The coming months may prove pivotal in shaping the outlook for oil prices and in determining how much market share Russia can retain against a revitalized Iraq and freewheeling shale producers.
