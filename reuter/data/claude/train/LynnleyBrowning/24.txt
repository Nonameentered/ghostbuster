Russia Unsure About Imposing Export Curbs on Heavy Fuel Oil This Winter  

Russia is still undecided about whether to impose temporary export curbs on heavy fuel oil (HFO) shipments this winter to protect domestic users from potential shortages. The Energy Ministry held a meeting with oil companies and port operators on Wednesday to discuss the HFO supply situation but did not reach a final decision on export restrictions.

HFO exports from Russia have been booming this year, with shipments up more than 50% from January through August compared to the same period in 2018. The strong foreign demand, especially from Singapore, has raised concerns that the outflow could lead to tighter domestic supplies during the peak winter season. However, Russia's refineries have also been processing more fuels, and some producers argue there may be enough supply to satisfy both domestic and foreign customers.  

A source at the Energy Ministry said it will continue monitoring the HFO market closely and could still decide to limit exports from December through February if needed. But for now, producers and ports will operate without any mandated export cuts. Reducing HFO shipments during the winter, even temporarily, risks annoying some key customers and could lead to a longer-term loss of market share, industry sources said.

Russia has restricted HFO exports during past winters, for example limiting ports to shipping up to 30% of their average monthly volumes during winter 2017-18. Some market players expect export volumes may still be cut by 200,000-300,000 tonnes per month, or roughly 20%, this winter if domestic stocks tighten. But the higher refining rates could preclude the need for such a large reduction.

HFO, a byproduct of oil refining used mainly as shipping fuel, has been oversupplied in global markets for the last few years. But new maritime rules capping sulfur oxide emissions are set to boost demand for lower-sulfur versions from the start of 2020. Russian producers have invested in refineries to produce more of these upgraded residues and want to boost exports while global prices are still relatively strong. For now, there appears room for both Russian refiners and domestic consumers to benefit from healthy flows of HFO, but the Energy Ministry will keep a close eye on the situation in case market forces start to pull in opposite directions.
