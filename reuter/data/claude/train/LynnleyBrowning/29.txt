Political Tensions Delay Crucial Diamond Deal Between Russia and De Beers  

Tensions between Russia and Western nations have stalled a critical supply deal between Russian diamond mining company Alrosa and Anglo American's De Beers, the world's largest diamond producer. The deal to extend Alrosa's long-term supply contract with De Beers was expected to be signed this month but has been delayed indefinitely due to geopolitical factors, according to sources close to the negotiations.  

Alrosa and De Beers jointly account for about 60% of global diamond supply. They have had a supply deal in place for over a decade that provides crucial rough diamonds to De Beers. The current deal expires in 2020, and negotiations have been ongoing throughout this year to extend the contract for at least another 10 years. The new deal is estimated to be worth over $50 billion, making it one of the largest supply agreements in the global diamond industry.

However, in recent weeks the talks have stalled. Sources say tensions between Russia and Western governments, including the United States and UK, have made finalizing the deal more complex. There are concerns that Russia may leverage its position as the world's largest diamond producer to gain political advantage on other fronts. Western politicians have urged De Beers to be cautious in continuing to do business with Russian companies that are linked closely to Kremlin interests.

For De Beers, losing guaranteed access to Alrosa's mines would disrupt its operations and place significant pressure on its profits. De Beers has supply agreements with mines in Botswana, South Africa, and Canada but relies heavily on Russian diamonds to fill supply gaps. Alrosa, in turn, depends heavily on De Beers as a market for its rough diamonds, with an estimated 60-70% of production going to De Beers, so a failure to extend the deal would also strain Alrosa's business. However, Alrosa is keen to strengthen its relations with countries outside of Western influence and diversify into the growing Indian and Chinese jewelry markets. 

Negotiations are expected to continue at a high level in an attempt to resolve the political tensions stalling the deal. However, any resolution is likely months away and may require government intervention and assurance on both sides. The diamond industry will watch closely for updates, as the implications of a failed deal between its two largest players would reshape the global supply chain and change market dynamics. Overall, while significant obstacles remain, sources suggest the mutual commercial benefits to Alrosa and De Beers of finalizing a long-term supply deal will drive the parties to address political concerns and find a compromise.
