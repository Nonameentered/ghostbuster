Russian oil industry sees slow pace of demand recovery at home

The Russian oil industry is facing a slow recovery in domestic demand even as the global oil markets begin to rebound. Russia's oil production has stabilized in recent months after OPEC+ production curbs, but demand for oil and refined products within Russia remains well below pre-pandemic levels.  

Russia's oil output averaged 10.02 million barrels per day in June, just below the ceiling of the OPEC+ agreement. The recovery in oil prices in recent weeks, with Brent crude rising back above $40 a barrel, has helped support revenue for Russian oil companies after a turbulent second quarter. However, a key concern is the pace of demand growth within Russia's domestic market.

Consumption of refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel remains more than 10-15% below last year's levels in Russia. Social distancing measures and reduced economic activity have cut into demand for transport fuels. The contraction has been slightly offset by higher demand for some refinery products like fuel oil, but overall demand is recovering at a sluggish pace.

The lack of a strong rebound in domestic demand could weigh on Russian oil companies as they look to ramp up production in the coming months under the OPEC+ schedule. Companies like Rosneft and Lukoil sell a sizable portion of their fuel output within Russia, so a slow return of Russian motorists and businesses will impact theirbottom lines.

Analysts expect Russian oil product demand could take until 2022 to return to 2019 levels. The economic fallout from the COVID-19 crisis has weakened consumption and industrial activity. GDP is projected to decline over 4% this year in Russia. The government has outlined a recovery plan to boost economic growth, but demand is likely to only see a gradual pickup over the next 18 months.

For Russia's oil industry, a prolonged period of reduced domestic oil demand comes at a challenging time. Companies face lower crude oil export revenue, smaller profit margins on refined products, and higher costs to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Companies were already under pressure before the pandemic hit, and a stalled recovery in Russia's domestic market will add further strain. 

With oil prices stabilizing, Russian oil companies and the broader economy are poised for the start of a rebound. But until demand is reignited at home, the industry's recovery will be slow going. A return of Russian consumers and businesses to normal activity can't come soon enough. Overall, the Russian oil sector continues to navigate a complex environment in 2021 with many open questions around the balance between global supply, domestic demand, and the energy transition.
