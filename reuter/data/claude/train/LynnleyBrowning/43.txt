Russian Aluminium Industry Reports Strong 1996 Output, but New Investments Unlikely for Sector's Reshaping

The Russian aluminium industry posted strong production numbers for 1996, according to year-end statistics released by the Ministry of Industry. The industry produced roughly 3.2 million tons of primary aluminium last year, a 6% increase over 1995 levels. However, industry experts do not expect new investments in the sector that would be needed to significantly reshape and modernize the ageing plants and infrastructure. 

The increased production in 1996 was mainly the result of greater capacity utilization at existing smelting facilities, not new plant openings or expansions. The largest companies, including RUSAL, SUAL, and smaller operators, were able to run at nearly maximum capacity through the year to generate the higher output numbers. But few companies have invested in new technologies or upgrades that would boost efficiency and lower costs in the long run. 

“The industry remains reliant on Soviet-era plants and equipment, much of which is three decades old or older,” said Ivan Petrov, an analyst at Moscow-based Metals and Mining Research. “Despite boasting of record output, Russian aluminium smelters are generally far less efficient, more polluting, and higher cost than global competitors using newer facilities.”

RUSAL, the industry’s largest producer and a major global supplier, acknowledges the technology gap but claims significant modernization would require Western financing and investment partners. The company’s smelters average over 40 years of age, while the newest facilities of major competitors like Alcoa and Rio Tinto are less than 10 years old on average. However, attracting major foreign investment has been difficult given economic uncertainties and risks in Russia.

Some upgrades are moving forward, though at a pace considered too slow by experts. RUSAL recently completed a $400 million modernization of its Krasnoyarsk smelter, but future investments rely largely on profits from operations. “Demand for aluminium, especially from China, has been very strong, so the companies have substantial cash flow to potentially fund further modernization,” Petrov said. “But so far the will to plow profits back into technology updates has been lacking."

Overall, the industry’s future remains in doubt despite the strong output numbers. Government subsidies could decline over the next several years, environmental regulations are tightening, and key export markets could weaken. Without an injection of foreign investment and technology, experts argue that the sector will struggle to remain competitive on a global scale. For Russia’s aluminium sector, increased production has offset concerns for now but not reshaped the long-term outlook. Modernization, if it happens at all, may come too little too late.
