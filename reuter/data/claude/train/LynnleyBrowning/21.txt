Russia's Demand for Feed Grains to Outstrip Output, Turning the Country into an Importer 

Russia's demand for feed grains is projected to exceed domestic production in the coming years, turning the country into a net importer of grains like corn and barley for the first time. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service, Russian feed demand will grow by 2-3% annually over the next decade while production remains stagnant. This supply-demand imbalance will likely force Russia to import up to 7 million metric tons of feed grains per year by 2025 to meet the shortfall.

For decades, Russia has aimed to be self-sufficient in grains and has restricted most foreign imports. However, the growing animal feed sector has outpaced the capacity of domestic farmers to supply grains. Russia's poultry, pork and beef industries have boomed to meet increasing demand for meat, especially as consumers opt for more protein in their diets. This surge in livestock numbers has fueled more demand for feed grains to support expanded livestock operations. At the same time, Russia's total grain production has leveled off in recent years due to modest yield improvements and limited agricultural land expansion.

The USDA report estimates Russia will need 51-53 million metric tons of feed grains annually within five years compared to a projected domestic supply of only 44-46 million tons. Corn and barley are the two primary grains used in Russian animal feed, and imported corn from Ukraine, Brazil and Argentina is most likely to fill the deficit in the near term, according to industry experts. However, some expect Russian authorities may ease restrictions on other suppliers to diversify import sources and increase competition.

Any substantial Russian imports of grains would be a significant departure from policies promoting food self-sufficiency. But livestock producers have increasingly lobbied the government to open doors to more imported feed to sustain the growing sector. Moscow has already shown more willingness to rely on imports for staples when domestic output cannot keep up with demand. Russia became the world's largest wheat importer in 2016/17 due to a poor harvest, though wheat imports declined again once local crops rebounded.

Russia turning into an importer of feed grains would provide opportunities for major grain exporting nations to ship more supplies to the previously closed market. However, it may also threaten the dominance of Russian grain traders if large multinational commodity firms become involved in the flow of imports. The USDA analysis concludes that while Russia is poised to become a net importer of feed grains, the country will continue to remain a major wheat exporter, as wheat is less central to the feed ration and Russia maintains a strong competitive advantage in wheat production. So government support for grain producers is likely to continue but may increasingly focus on wheat rather than feed grains.
