Russia faces second year of bad grain harvest, expected to turn to Western markets for imports

Russia is poised to suffer a poor grain harvest for the second consecutive year, raising the prospect of grain shortages and higher food prices domestically. The Russian grain harvest is expected to fall below 100 million tons this year for only the second time this decade, down from record harvests of over 135 million tons as recently as 2016 and 2017.

The losses are attributed to unfavorable weather across much of European Russia, including excessive rains in some areas during key periods of crop growth and development. The poor weather has damaged Russia's wheat crop, which accounts for about two-thirds of the country's total grain production. Russia is typically one of the world's largest exporters of wheat, but is now planning to curb wheat exports to protect domestic supply. 

Faced with a diminished harvest and the possibility of higher prices for staples like bread, Russia is likely to turn to global grain markets to fill the supply gap through imports. "With another poor harvest this year, especially for wheat, Russia will have to import more grain to satisfy domestic demand,‚Äù according to Swithun Still, director of grain trading at Solaris Commodities in Switzerland. Russia is expected to import at least 5 million tons of wheat and possibly other grains like barley and corn in the coming year.

The increased Russian demand is likely to drive up global grain prices, which have already been trending upwards due to dry weather reducing harvest expectations in other parts of the world. Higher grain prices will have the most significant impact on developing countries that depend heavily on wheat and other food imports. However, farmers in grain exporting nations like the United States, Canada, Argentina and Australia are poised to benefit from stronger sales to Russia and other importers.

Russia's back-to-back years of poor grain harvests highlight the vulnerability of global food supply to weather-related shocks. Although Russia has invested in grain storage and export infrastructure in recent years, even the world's largest exporters can be quickly turned into importers following droughts, heat waves or other adverse weather. Tighter global grain stocks and more volatile prices are likely to persist as the threat of climate change continues to intensify.
