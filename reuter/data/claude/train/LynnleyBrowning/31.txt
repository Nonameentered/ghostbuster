Western Oil Companies Present Study Showing Russia to Benefit Most From Oil Deals

Major Western oil companies today released an industry-funded study showing that Russia stands to gain the most from recent partnerships and deals with international oil firms. The study looked at dozens of joint exploration and production deals signed between Russian state-owned oil companies and global oil giants over the last decade. It found that the Russian government and Russian oil firms captured the lion's share of profits and benefited disproportionately from technological and operational expertise provided by Western companies.  

The study comes at a time of increasing scrutiny on deals between Western oil majors and Russia, the world's largest oil producer. Critics argue the partnerships transfer knowledge and skills to Russia that could be used to expand their oil production with or without Western involvement. However, oil companies have contended the deals are mutually beneficial and provide access to Russia's vast oil and gas reserves, the largest in the world.

The new study calls into question some of the benefits claimed by Western oil companies. It found that on average, Western firms received only 18-22% of total profits from Russian joint ventures and projects, while Russian state-owned companies received 50-60% of profits. Western companies also received a minority equity stake in nearly all projects, limiting their control and influence. The study concluded that the current deal structures favor Russia, allowing them to harness Western expertise on the cheap while limiting the longer-term benefits to foreign firms.

Not surprisingly, Russian officials and oil executives dismissed the study's findings and questioned its methodology. They argue that Western companies receive substantial rewards from Russian deals, including new reserves to add to their portfolios. But analysts say the study highlights an unequal partnership where Russian firms have considerable leverage and Western companies have limited options. With massive new oilfields and resources at stake, though, Western oil majors may have no choice but to accept minority stakes and lesser benefits--at least for now. Overall, the study points to a geopolitical landscape where petropolitics and hard-nosed national interests are shaping energy deals as much as commercial factors. The uneasy alliances between Russian and Western oil titans appear poised to continue into the future.
