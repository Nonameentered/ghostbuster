Russia's Oil Industry Earns High Export Revenues but Concerned Over Slow Domestic Demand Recovery 

Russia's oil industry earned $37.4 billion in export revenue in July, a 37% increase from a year earlier, according to statistics from the Russian Federal Customs Service. The increase was driven by higher global oil prices as demand recovers around the world. However, domestic oil consumption within Russia continues to lag due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Russian oil export volumes increased 7.4% in July compared to the same month last year, averaging 5.36 million barrels per day. The combination of higher prices and export volumes boosted overall export revenues for Russia's oil industry. The largest buyers of Russian oil were China, the Netherlands, South Korea, Poland, and Finland.

Domestically, Russian oil demand is still below pre-pandemic levels. Consumption of diesel and jet fuel has been hit especially hard due to decreased economic activity and lower transportation usage. Diesel demand was down 8% in July compared to the previous year, while jet fuel demand plummeted 43% as air travel remains depressed. 

The uneven recovery in demand has created a dilemma for Russian oil companies. Export revenues are highly lucrative at current prices, but the companies have to cut domestic production to match the slower demand recovery within Russia. “For Russian oil companies, the optimal solution now is to maintain maximum production and exports to generate revenue while being very careful with domestic supply cuts to avoid overstocking the market.” said VYGON Consulting analyst Mikhail Turukalov.

Private oil company Lukoil reported a net profit of $2 billion in the second quarter after a loss last year, benefiting strongly from the rebound in oil prices. But Lukoil also noted headwinds from lower domestic demand for motor fuels in its statement. State-owned Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, reported a net profit of $2.37 billion in the second quarter, also citing the revival of global oil prices as a key factor. But Rosneft’s statement similarly cautioned that domestic fuel consumption had not yet fully recovered.

With the pace of vaccination accelerating and economic activity rising again in Russia, analysts expect domestic oil demand to continue improving over the rest of the year. However, it may still take until mid-2022 for demand to reach pre-pandemic levels. For now, Russia's oil industry remains highly dependent on strong export revenues to offset the impacts of slower recovery in its own domestic market. Overall, the rebound in global oil prices has cushioned the blow, but risks still remain if export volumes or prices were to fall again.
