Russia to Restructure Gazprom, But Analysts Say World's Largest Gas Company Will Remain Intact 

The Russian government announced plans this week to restructure state-owned energy giant Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas producer and exporter. However, analysts say the reforms are unlikely to significantly alter the company or reduce the Russian government's control over its operations.

Gazprom has long been criticized as an inefficient monopoly under tight control of the Kremlin. This week, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the government aims to spin off Gazprom's pipeline infrastructure and gas processing assets into separate companies. The goal is to introduce more market-based competition into the gas sector and reduce Gazprom's dominance.

"Gazprom has a monopoly position that is unacceptable," Medvedev said. "We need to do everything to ensure that the company works in a competitive environment."

However, Chris Weafer, a senior partner at Macro-Advisory, a Moscow-based consultancy, said he is skeptical the announced changes will make much difference. "The government wants to give the impression it is dealing with the monopoly issue and market concerns, but there is little evidence real change is coming," he said.  "Gazprom will remain intact and under government control."

Under the restructuring, Gazprom would retain ownership and control of gas exploration, production, and sales. Two new companies would be spun off to own and operate the gas transportation pipelines and underground gas storage facilities. But as Weafer noted, "The Kremlin will have total oversight over the boards and management of the new companies, just as it does with Gazprom."

Gazprom was founded in 1989 when the Soviet Union's Ministry of Gas Industry was converted into a corporation. It holds a monopoly on natural gas exports from Russia and provides the majority of the country's gas. The company's close ties to the Kremlin and its role as an instrument of political influence and control have repeatedly sparked concerns from European countries that rely heavily on Russian gas imports.  

The European Union has launched investigations into Gazprom's business practices, accusing it of unfair pricing policies and blocking competition. The threat of potential EU sanctions or penalties seems to be driving some of Russia's motivation to restructure Gazprom. But most analysts doubt whether the changes will do much to alter how the company operates or loosen the Kremlin's grip.

"The Russian government wants to appear responsive to critics by announcing these reforms," said Tatiana Mitrova, director of the oil and gas department at the Energy Research Institute in Moscow. "But in reality, there will still be the same leadership, the same people and the same links with the Kremlin. Only minor details will change." 

For now, Russia's bold announcements suggest more may be coming to overhaul Gazprom. But until concrete steps are taken to make the company more transparent, efficient, and independent, most experts remain highly skeptical that any meaningful shakeup is truly underway. Gazprom has remained largely unchanged for decades, and analysts see little reason to believe that is about to change now despite the government's stated ambitions.
