Russia Tightens Access to Export Pipelines, Jeopardizing Western Oil Joint Ventures

The Russian government this week issued a decree tightening state control over its major oil export pipelines, threatening Western oil companies operating joint ventures in Russia. The decree gives state oil company Rosneft sweeping authority over pipeline exports from Russian oil fields where Western companies like BP, Shell and ExxonMobil hold minority stakes. 

The new rules require the pipeline operators to give priority access to Russian state companies, potentially limiting export capacity available for fields operated by Western joint ventures. Russia has sought to boost state control over its energy sector in recent years, worrying international oil companies that have spent billions of dollars to tap Russia's huge oil and gas reserves.

"This adds to the risk and uncertainty of doing business in Russia," said Will Pearson, Global Energy Monitor's Russia analyst. "If fully implemented, these changes could significantly constrain the ability of Western joint ventures to export and market their share of production, undermining the viability and value of some projects."

BP, Shell, Total and Exxon are all involved in joint ventures with Russian state oil firms to develop oil fields in Siberia and elsewhere. The deals were made in the 1990s and 2000s, when Russia was seeking to attract international expertise and capital to boost growth in its oil industry. But as oil prices rose, the value of Russia's oil bounty grew along with its ambitions to exert more state control.

The export pipelines carry most of the oil from western Siberia, where many of the joint ventures operate, to ports and refineries in the west. Under the new decree, pipeline operator Transneft will have to give priority access to Russian state oil companies, which could delay or constrain exports from fields operated by Western firms.
