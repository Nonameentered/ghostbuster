Russia Quietly Imports Western Grain to Offset Meagre Harvests, but Too Broke to be a Big Presence on World Grain Markets  

Russia has been quietly importing grain from Western suppliers over the past few months to make up for its own meagre harvests, according to traders and shipping data. However, Russia lacks the financial firepower to be a major player in global grain markets despite its vast farmland.

Russia’s grain harvest declined this year due to dry weather and competition for land from more profitable crops. The country’s wheat harvest fell 18% from last year to 72.6 million tonnes, according to Russia’s agriculture ministry. Barley and corn harvests also dropped from 2020 levels.  

The smaller harvest has forced Russia to import grain, though the government has not officially confirmed any purchases. According to shipping data and traders, at least seven grain cargoes from France, Germany, and the Baltic states arrived at Russian ports between October and December. The shipments likely contained over 420,000 tonnes of wheat, barley and corn.  

“Russia prefers to import grain quietly rather than trumpet it, but the reality is their harvest was down this year and domestic prices have been rising,” said a European grain trader. “Western grain is still cheaper, even with shipping costs, so mills and food producers in Russia have turned to imports.”

However, Russia is unlikely to become a major buyer on global grain markets despite its appetite for imports. Government finances have been hit hard due to weak energy prices and Western sanctions, limiting its purchasing power. Russia’s sovereign wealth fund has declined over four years from $91 billion to just $182 billion. The Russian economy is expected to grow just 2-3% annually over the next few years.

“Russia has the potential to import large volumes of grain, but its weak economy and finances mean it can’t spend as much as it might like,” said Andrei Sizov, a Russia-based analyst at SovEcon, an agricultural consultancy.
