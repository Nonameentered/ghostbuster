Russia's Norilsk Nickel Struggling with Shaky Financial Future Despite Steady Output

Russia's largest mining company, Norilsk Nickel, has maintained steady production of its key metals over the past several months even as the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on the global economy. Norilsk Nickel produced 195,000 metric tons of nickel and palladium in the first half of 2020, in line with targets, due to the resilience of its mining operations in Russia's harsh Arctic.

However, despite the stable operations, Norilsk Nickel faces significant headwinds that threaten its financial future. The company's share price and profits have declined sharply this year due to lower metal prices and rising costs. Nickel prices have dropped over 15% since January due to lower demand from stainless steel makers. Palladium, although still at a high price, has also declined by 7% this year. 

The financial troubles faced by Norilsk Nickel provide a glimpse into the difficulties facing many mining companies worldwide during the pandemic. Mining operations have been less affected by lockdowns and social distancing measures relative to many industries, allowing most companies to continue operating at a normal pace. However, the downstream effects of COVID-19 on global growth and key industrial sectors have reduced demand and prices for commodities, squeezing mining companies' profit margins.

For Norilsk Nickel, the blow to profits and share price comes at a time when the company also faces rising costs for key inputs like fuel and electricity as well as higher expenses related to infrastructure investment. The firm is in the midst of a $12 billion investment program to overhaul equipment, expand capacity, and upgrade environmental controls at its aging facilities in the Russian Arctic. Much of this investment is aimed at reducing pollution in an effort to head off criticism over the company's environmental record.
