Russia's Diamond Industry in Chaos as Prospects for De Beers Trade Deal Grow Dim 

Russia's domestic diamond mining and trading companies are in disarray as the possibility of reaching a new deal with De Beers, the world's largest diamond trader, continues to fade. For decades, De Beers purchased the bulk of gem-quality diamonds from Russia, providing a steady and lucrative market for the stones. However, the previous trade agreement between De Beers and Russian diamond mining giant ALROSA expired in 2016 and talks to negotiate a new long-term deal have stalled.

Without the De Beers deal, Russia's diamond miners and traders have struggled to find consistent buyers and markets for their diamonds. Miners are producing fewer diamonds due to lower demand, and traders have had to accept lower prices from other international buyers. The Russian government also has lost a major source of tax revenue from diamond exports. The chaotic state of Russia's diamond industry and uncertainty about its future has led to falling stock prices for diamond companies, job losses in mining regions, and concerns that Russia may lose its position as a major player on the global diamond market.

“The diamond trade deal with De Beers was the foundation of our industry for 20 years,” said Ivan Polyakov, spokesman for Rosizhim, a state-owned diamond mining and trading company. “Now that it's gone, everything is unpredictable and it's very difficult to plan. We don't know where most of our diamonds will end up or who will buy them. The entire system was built around supplying De Beers, so now the whole value chain is broken.”  

De Beers has stated that while they aim to resume purchasing some diamonds from Russia, they will do so under new terms that are less favorable to the Russians. The new deal, if reached, will likely give De Beers more power to buy diamonds at lower prices and renegotiate price points. The Russian government is reluctant to approve a new deal that provides fewer economic benefits, but Russia's diamond companies are eager for any deal that would revive their business. With little progress in the latest round of talks, however, Russia's chaotic diamond industry faces an uncertain future with or without its longtime trading partner De Beers.
