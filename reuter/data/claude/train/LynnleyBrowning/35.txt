Russia Ready to Cooperate with De Beers on Vital Diamond Market Deal  

Russia’s state-backed diamond mining company Alrosa said today it is open to cooperating with De Beers to support stability in the global diamond market. The move signals a shift in Russia’s position, as the country has previously criticized De Beers market-controlling policies and now appears willing to work together to prevent price volatility.

For decades, the De Beers cartel monopolized the international diamond market by controlling supply. While that monopoly is now broken, De Beers still sells about a third of the world’s rough diamonds. After a slump in sales following the global financial crisis, the diamond market has stabilized in recent years around $15.4 billion in sales of rough diamonds.

Alrosa accounts for 28% of global production and has long accused De Beers of anti-competitive behavior. However, in a statement today, Alrosa said “while there is a long history of competition between Alrosa and De Beers, we believe it is in the interests of all parties to cooperate to maintain a stable diamond market.” Alrosa cited a slowdown in demand from key markets like China and India as well as political uncertainty in Europe as reasons why stability was vital for “such a vulnerable luxury product.”

There are concerns that tightening supplies could lead to a spike in diamond prices that could threaten future demand. By collaborating to release and withhold stones from the market, Alrosa and De Beers could aim to keep prices at a level that continues to stoke consumer demand. However, such cooperation risks raising regulatory concerns about diamond market manipulation.

In response, De Beers said it “welcomes open dialogue with key producers to support a healthy diamond market” but added any cooperation must avoid anti-competitive behavior and follow a 2018 agreement with the European Commission to cease illegal market control. Some analysts say information sharing and joint marketing campaigns could be acceptable but directly cooperating on managing supply volumes risks violating competition laws.

The diamond market remains crucial for the economies of both Russia and Botswana, where De Beers is headquartered. With Alrosa now signaling a willingness to partner with its largest competitor, the state of play in the global diamond industry could be poised to shift once again. The next steps in this process will be critical in determining whether a partnership or further competition defines the market in the coming years. Overall, a healthier diamond market will depend on maintaining a balance of supply and demand to drive continued consumer interest in diamond jewelry around the world.
