Chechnya demands cut in foreign deals for major oil pipeline guarantee

The leadership of Chechnya, a southern republic of Russia, is demanding a greater share of profits and control from foreign oil companies developing major new pipelines across its territory. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said in a statement today that “Chechnya should receive no less than 30% of all profits and revenues” from the proposed Euro-Caspian pipeline, which would carry oil from Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan to European markets. 

The tough stance threatens to further delay or complicate the pipeline, which has been in planning for over a decade. The project is led by a consortium including British Petroleum, Total of France, and Eni of Italy. The pipeline would allow the landlocked Caspian nations of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan to export oil to Europe without relying on routes through Russia.

However, much of the proposed 2,400-mile route passes through southern Russia, including Chechnya. While Kadyrov has sought to attract foreign investment to rebuild Chechnya after years of war, he insists that the republic receive a greater share of wealth from projects on its territory. “We demand participation and control, not just meager transit fees,” Kadyrov said. “Chechnya should be an equal partner in this project or we will not allow the pipeline to be built.”

The foreign oil companies involved issued a joint statement indicating a willingness to negotiate but expressing concern about “changing demands” and “unstable conditions.” Russia’s energy minister responded by affirming that Moscow, not Chechen leaders, would determine the pipeline transit terms. But Kadyrov, an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, seems emboldened to challenge Moscow in pursuit of Chechen interests.

The showdown could delay construction that was set to start next year. The pipeline has already faced setbacks including disputes over environmental concerns, security issues, and competition from other proposed routes. The latest demands from Kadyrov introduce further uncertainty for the pipeline’s future.

Some analysts argue that stability in Chechnya remains fragile, and that the republic does not have the right to make unilateral demands of foreign investors. But others say that Kadyrov feels empowered by the stabilization of Chechnya under his brutal rule, and by Moscow's previous largesse, to seek greater spoils for his regime and a stronger hand over resource-related deals. For now, the pipeline consortium finds itself caught at a disadvantage between the interests of a restive Caucasus republic and a dominant oil-rich power aimed at maximizing control and profits from its network of energy partnerships.
