Former Aide of Polly Peck Head Asil Nadir Walks Free from Court after Winning Appeal Against Sentence for Handling Stolen Money

Simon Mollison, a former aide to disgraced business tycoon Asil Nadir, founder of Polly Peck International, has walked free from court after winning an appeal against his conviction for handling stolen money. Mollison, 67, has served over half of a 6-year sentence for his role in transferring millions of pounds stolen from Polly Peck between 1988 and 1990. 

The Court of Appeal ruled that Mollison's original trial was unfair because the judge misdirected the jury. The presiding judge in the appeal, Lord Justice Moses, said the original trial judge "failed to direct the jury that they had to be sure that Mollison knew the funds were stolen." Mollison has always denied any knowledge that the funds he transferred came from illegal sources.

Mollison worked as Nadir's personal assistant and managed a secret bank account in Northern Cyprus that was used to transfer funds stolen from Polly Peck. Over Â£150 million was stolen from the company leading up to its collapse in 1990. Nadir was convicted of theft in 1993 but fled the country before sentencing. He returned to the UK in 2010 to serve a 5-year sentence.

The Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted the original case, expressed disappointment at the verdict. Director David Green said, "We are disappointed by this verdict. We will consider whether it's in the public interest to pursue a re-trial."  Mollison's defense argued that new evidence suggested Mollison believed the funds were legitimate bonuses and loans, provided by Nadir to avoid tax.  

Mollison emerged from court a free man, though declined to comment on the verdict. His lawyer, Paul Bishop, said, "After over 25 years of this hanging over him, Mr. Mollison feels huge relief that his name has been cleared. He has maintained his innocence throughout and is looking forward to moving on with the rest of his life." Nadir remains imprisoned, though is reportedly in poor health. The Polly Peck scandal is seen as a prime example of financial fraud and corporate greed in 1980s Britain. 

The impact of this news story would come as a further blow to confidence in the UK's financial administration and system of justice. However, defenders of the justice system might argue that the right verdict was reached on appeal, addressing errors from the original trial and ensuring an innocent man did not remain unjustly incarcerated.
