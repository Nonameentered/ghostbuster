Barclays sells global custody business to Morgan Stanley in consolidation move 

Barclays, the British multinational bank, announced today that it is selling its global custody business to Morgan Stanley in a deal worth $620 million. The sale is part of Barclaysâ€™ strategy to streamline its operations and focus on its core corporate and investment banking divisions.

The custody business, known as Barclays Global Investor Services, safeguards assets for clients like asset managers and provides services like trade settlement, cash management, and securities lending. It has $2.5 trillion in assets under custody and serves over 4,000 clients across more than 60 markets. Barclays said that while the business has performed well, it wants to concentrate its resources on areas where it has a competitive advantage.

The sale to Morgan Stanley, which has a similar set of custody and fund services operations, will provide "significant benefits to clients" according to Daniel Littman, global head of Morgan Stanley's Securities Services division. He said combining the businesses will create operational efficiencies and allow more investment in new technologies. The deal will make Morgan Stanley the largest custody bank in the world with over $14 trillion in client assets. 

JP Morgan currently holds the top spot in the global custody industry, followed by BNY Mellon and State Street. custody banks provide an important back-office function for global asset managers and the consolidation trend reflects both pressures on fees as well as the increasing scale required to meet regulatory and technological demands.

Barclays said the sale will free up capital that can be redeployed across its core businesses and that it expects to use some of the proceeds to buy back shares. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020 pending regulatory approvals. While Barclays shares rose 2% on the news, analysts said the deal is a positive for Morgan Stanley and reflects its ambition to grow in wealth and investment management. The acquisition shows it "punching above its weight" according to one analyst note.

The sale of non-core operations by Barclays comes as the bank prepares for the appointment of a new CEO. Jes Staley announced he would step down at the end of 2021 after challenges from regulators and an investigation into his links with Jeffrey Epstein. The front-runners for Staley's role are understood to be pushing for Barclays to further streamline its operations.
