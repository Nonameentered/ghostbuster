British High Court rejects $1.8bn claim against Ernst & Young by liquidators of BCCI  

The British High Court has dismissed a $1.8 billion claim against accounting firm Ernst & Young by the liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). BCCI collapsed in 1991 amid fraud and money laundering allegations, in what was one of the largest banking failures at the time.

The liquidators had argued that Ernst & Young was negligent in its auditing of BCCI, failing to detect massive fraud that led to the bank's collapse. However, Justice Robert Miles ruled that there was no evidence Ernst & Young had "actual knowledge" of the fraud. The judge said the scale and nature of the fraud at BCCI was "unprecedented" and it was unreasonable to expect Ernst & Young to have uncovered it given the information available at the time.

BCCI was founded in 1972 by Pakistani financier Agha Hasan Abedi. It grew rapidly into a global banking empire with operations in 73 countries, but undetected fraud and illegal activity caused huge losses. Regulators took control of BCCI in 1991 and discovered the bank was missing billions of dollars.

The liquidators claimed Ernst & Young failed to properly audit BCCI's accounts according to accepted accounting standards, ignoring warning signs that could have exposed the fraud earlier. However, Justice Miles said there were "no grounds" for concluding Ernst & Young displayed a "lack of integrity" or deliberately turned a "blind eye" to wrongdoing. He found no evidence the firm did not honestly believe BCCI's accounts showed a substantially true and fair view.  

The BCCI case highlights the risks of auditing complex global institutions and has led to stricter regulations of financial firms. But Justice Miles said auditors cannot be expected to uncover sophisticated fraud if there are no obvious warning signs and all proper checks have been conducted. His ruling will reassure other major accounting firms their liability is limited if no negligence or deliberate failings can be proven.

The BCCI liquidators said they plan to appeal the ruling, arguing it raises important issues regarding the scope of auditorsâ€™ obligations. If the decision is upheld, it will be the end of a legal saga that has lasted almost 30 years since BCCI's collapse in 1991. For Ernst & Young, it marks the clearing of its name in one of the most notorious episodes in its history.
