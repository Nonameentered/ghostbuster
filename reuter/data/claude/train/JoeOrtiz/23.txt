Creditors of Fraud-Ridden BCCI to Receive $2.65 Billion, 24.5% of Claims, After 5-Year Struggle  

The long process of liquidating and distributing assets of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) has finally come to an end after more than five years. The global bank collapsed in 1991 amid fraud allegations and after regulators seized its assets across multiple countries.

Liquidators announced this week that BCCI's creditors will receive $2.65 billion, which amounts to 24.5% of the total claims filed against the bank estimated at $10.9 billion. The payout brings closure to thousands of small depositors, major international banks, and others who lost money due to BCCI's fraudulent practices and mismanagement.

"This has been an extremely complex case, but we believe we have now achieved the maximum returns possible for creditors while also incurring the minimum costs," said John McFall, the lead liquidator. The liquidation was one of the largest and most complex in British corporate history with BCCI operations spread across 73 countries. 

 sorting through BCCI's records proved immensely difficult as key documents went missing and its assets and liabilities were tangled in a web of thousands of subsidiary companies. Investigators uncovered widespread fraud, including illegal loans to those connected with the bank and inflated balances to deceive regulators.

The liquidators collected BCCI's remaining assets and loans, including legal claims against those who perpetrated the fraud. They also recovered funds for creditors from BCCI's auditors Price Waterhouse and a major shareholder, Bank of America. Still, the $2.65 billion payout represents only a fraction of the initial claims, leaving many creditors with major losses.

The collapse of BCCI in 1991 prompted major reforms in banking regulation worldwide to prevent similar events from happening again. Although BCCI is now defunct, its impact on global finance will not be forgotten. The long liquidation and meager payouts are a reminder of the massive costs of financial malpractice.
