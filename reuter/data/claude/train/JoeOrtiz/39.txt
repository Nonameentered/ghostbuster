Former MGAM Fund Manager, Nicola Horlick, Unlikely to be Reinstated Despite Battle Against Ex-Employer

Nicola Horlick, the former star fund manager of Montgomery Asset Management, is unlikely to win her battle to be reinstated at the firm she co-founded in 1999. Sources close to MGAM have indicated that the firm's board has no intention of bringing her back into her former role after her unceremonious departure last month following a disagreement over management fees. 

Horlick, dubbed "Superwoman" for her success in the overwhelmingly male fund management industry, has launched a public campaign to drum up shareholder support to have her reinstated to her position as Chief Investment Officer at MGAM. She has argued that her forced resignation was unjustified and threatens the future performance of the firm's funds under her management. MGAM has declined to comment publicly on the board's decision or Horlick's campaign.

The dispute arose over Horlick's demands for MGAM to lower fees charged to investors in some of the highest-performing funds she managed. Horlick claims the fees were excessive and ate into client returns, while MGAM has insisted their fees remain competitive and aligned with industry standards. According to sources, the firm's all-male board voted unanimously to force Horlick's resignation after she threatened to move her funds to another firm if fees were not lowered.

Despite her reputation for strong returns, Horlick's demanding management style and threats to take her funds elsewhere allegedly strained her relationship with MGAM's board over the years. However, many industry experts argue that the board has shot themselves in the foot by forcing the departure of the star manager responsible for the majority of the firm's investments and returns. MGAM's share price has dropped over 10% since the news of Horlick's resignation broke.

While Horlick has harnessed social media and mainstream press coverage to argue her case, MGAM remains unlikely to reinstate her due to the irreparable breakdown in trust and the desire of its board to assert their authority. The battle looks set to end in a costly divorce for both parties, despite their shared history of success. Investors will now closely monitor performance under new fund management to determine whether MGAM's decision will impact their returns in the long run.
