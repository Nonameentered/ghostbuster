Eurotunnel Agrees Deal to Give Bank Creditors Majority Ownership in Exchange for Debt Reduction

The operator of the Channel Tunnel between the U.K. and France today announced an agreement with its bank creditors that will reduce its debt pile in exchange for majority ownership. Eurotunnel SE has reached a deal with its bank lenders to exchange €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) of its €3.3 billion debt for equity, giving the banks majority control of the company.

The restructuring plan will reduce Eurotunnel's debt to €1.8 billion and cut its interest charges by €60 million per year. The company has been struggling under a debt mountain since the Channel Tunnel first opened in 1994. Passenger and freight traffic through the tunnel has increased over the years but revenue growth has not kept up with the company's large interest payments on its initial loans. 

Eurotunnel said the agreement with its lenders will ensure its long-term financial viability and allow new investment in its infrastructure. "This is a pivotal moment in the recovery of the company," said Jacques Gounon, Chairman and CEO of Eurotunnel. "The restructuring we have negotiated with our banking partners will finally give Eurotunnel the means to sustainably develop its activities, invest in the upkeep and improvement of its infrastructures and enhance service for its customers."

The agreement comes after months of negotiations with the company's bank lenders and bondholders. The banks will swap much of Eurotunnel's debt for stakes in a new holding company that will control Eurotunnel. The company's largest shareholder, Belgium's TQ Infra, will retain a 10% stake in the holding company. Other shareholders are likely to see their stakes substantially diluted.

The restructuring requires the approval of regulators and Eurotunnel shareholders. The company said it aims to complete the deal before the end of the year. Eurotunnel carries about 21 million passengers, 1.6 million trucks and 1.8 million cars through the 50 kilometer Channel Tunnel each year, making it an important link in European transportation infrastructure.

The debt-for-equity swap is the latest example of companies exchanging ownership for relief from debt burdens that threaten their solvency. Eurotunnel said the restructuring will put it in a stronger position to refinance its remaining debt in the coming years as European interest rates start to rise.
