Halifax Building Society flotation expected to exceed estimated price range of 390-450 pence per share

The Halifax Building Society's initial public offering is poised to exceed the estimated price range of 390 to 450 pence per share, according to sources close to the deal. Strong investor demand is driving up the expected offer price for the shares ahead of the company's stock market debut on Tuesday.  

Halifax, the UK's largest mortgage lender, is floating 25% of its shares on the London Stock Exchange in what will be the biggest financial services IPO in British history. The offering is expected to raise more than £10 billion for the building society, which will use the proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet and fund expansion into new products and markets.

The price range for the IPO was set last week at 390 to 450 pence per share, implying a market capitalization for Halifax of £27 billion to £32 billion. However, investor roadshows held in London, Edinburgh and New York sparked significant interest in the shares, particularly from institutional investors in North America and the Middle East.  

Sources said the book is already oversubscribed at the top end of the range. Halifax and its advisor JPMorgan are considering raising the final offer price to between 420 and 460 pence per share. At the top end of the new range, the IPO would value Halifax at £33 billion and raise £11.1 billion in fresh capital. An announcement confirming the final price is expected Monday evening.

Analysts said strong demand was not surprising given the attractiveness of the UK mortgage market, Halifax's leading position, and its resilient financial performance during the economic downturn. Halifax also offers an attractive dividend policy, with the society planning to distribute 60-70% of net profit as dividends to shareholders following the IPO.

The successful IPO will be a milestone for the building society sector. Halifax chose to demutualize and float shares to gain permanent access to capital markets and close a competitive funding gap with listed banks. The offering also provides an exit for member accounts, which will be converted into shares. policyholders will receive one share for every £100 in their accounts.

Halifax CEO Andy Hornby said the IPO marked "the start of an exciting new chapter" that would enable further growth and create value for members and new shareholders alike. With the shares poised to float at the top of the range, it seems Halifax's debut is set to make a splash.
