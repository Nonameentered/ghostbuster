Lloyds Bank fined £325,000 and faces millions in compensation for pension transfer scandal

Lloyds Bank was fined £325,000 today by Britain's financial regulator and faces paying millions of pounds in compensation for giving unsuitable advice to customers regarding final salary pension transfers.

Between 2012 and 2015, Lloyds advisers encouraged clients to transfer their guaranteed final salary pensions into more risky personal pension schemes. Over 2,000 customers were advised to transfer their pensions by Lloyds during this period, with many of these transfers now deemed unsuitable. 

Final salary pensions provide a guaranteed income for life based on the employee's years of service and salary. They are prized for providing secure retirements and protecting against market volatility and the risk of people outliving their savings. Personal pensions offer more flexibility and control but lack guarantees, exposing customers to more risk.

The Financial Conduct Authority found that Lloyds advisers failed to properly warn customers about the risks of transferring out of final salary schemes. In many cases, the security of the final salary pension was not sufficiently explained or the benefits of a transfer to a personal pension were overstated. The FCA reviewed 156 cases and found 106 of the pension transfer recommendations were unsuitable, a failure rate of over two-thirds.

Mark Steward, the FCA’s executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: “Final salary pensions are valuable benefits that provide financial security throughout retirement. Firms and advisers should ensure that people fully understand the risks before they transfer out of these schemes.”

“Lloyds failed to ensure that customers were getting suitable pension transfer advice. Its advisers were recommending that customers transfer out of guaranteed benefits without properly considering and explaining the risks,” he added.

The fine and requirement to review past cases and provide compensation underscores the regulator's concerns about the final salary transfer advice market. The FCA estimates that over £50 billion has been transferred out of defined benefit pensions since 2015, and it fears much of this movement has been the result of unsuitable advice. The regulator has demanded firms do more to protect customers and improve standards.

Lloyds has agreed to conduct a review of past pension transfer cases and expects to pay significant compensation to customers impacted by unsuitable advice. Along with the £325,000 fine, this scandal will cost Lloyds millions and further damage trust in the advice provided by UK retail banks. A spokesperson for Lloyds said the bank "apologised for any unsuitable pension transfer advice provided by HBOS."
