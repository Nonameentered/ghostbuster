Former Barings Treasury and Risk Chief Banned from Being a Director in the City 

The former group treasury and risk director of Barings Bank, Peter Norris, has been banned from holding a directorship in the City of London for eight years. The ban was issued by The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) due to Norris’ failure in his role during the collapse of Barings Bank in 1995.

Barings Bank, one of the oldest merchant banks in London, collapsed in 1995 after one of its traders, Nick Leeson, lost £827 million through speculative trading in futures and options on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange. The massive trading losses led to the bank's demise and it was taken over by ING Bank.

An FCA investigation found that Norris was partly responsible for the control failures that allowed Leeson’s losses to accumulate unchecked. As the head of the treasury and risk function at Barings, Norris had a responsibility to ensure proper checks and oversight of trading activities were in place. However, the FCA found that he failed in this duty and lacked competence in carrying out his role. 

Specifically, the FCA investigation concluded that Norris did not ensure proper reconciliation of the accounts in Barings Futures Singapore, Leeson’s trading division. This meant that the hidden losses in that operation went undetected for over two years. The probe also found that Norris failed to manage obvious risks in Leeson's trading activities and did not act on warning signs about his conduct and the control environment in Singapore.

Commenting on the banning order, Mark Steward, FCA Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight said: “Those in senior positions in firms have an important responsibility to ensure robust controls and risk management. Barings’ collapse was a seminal event and it is important that we continue to learn the necessary lessons to maintain high standards of conduct and competence.”

Norris held various senior roles at Barings from 1992 until 1995.  In addition to the FCA ban, he was fined £50,000 by the now-defunct Securities and Futures Authority in 1998 for failing to carry out his duties at Barings with due skill, care and diligence. Norris did not contest the FCA's findings and agreed to the eight-year ban. The ban took effect from 24 June 2019.
