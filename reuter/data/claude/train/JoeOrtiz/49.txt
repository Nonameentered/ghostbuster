British Banks Set to Deliver Strong Profits and Returns to Shareholders in Upcoming Reporting Season

Britain's largest banks are expected to report strong profits and improved returns for shareholders when they announce their full-year results in the coming weeks. Analysts predict the major high street lenders will post increased earnings and higher dividends as the economic recovery gains momentum and bad debts remain under control.

Barclays and HSBC kick off bank reporting season next week, with Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland publishing results the following week. According to analysts at Morgan Stanley, pre-tax profits across the big four banks will increase by 15% to £36.4 billion for 2021. They expect this profit expansion to translate into dividend increases of up to 50% versus last year, boosting returns for long-suffering shareholders.

The improved outlook reflects the effects of the coronavirus vaccine rollout, economic reopening, and policy support during the pandemic. Household and business lending has held up well, while government support schemes have limited loan defaults. Interest rates have also remained higher than expected, boosting net interest margins. However, there are concerns about inflationary pressures, higher costs, and potential bad debt charges from the end of government support programs.

Barclays is forecast to report pre-tax profits of £6.4 billion and raise its dividend to 6 pence per share. Its investment bank has benefited from market volatility and dealmaking activity. HSBC is tipped to announce profits of $18.7 billion with an improved payout of 40 cents per share. Its Asia-focused strategy and interest rate sensitivity should drive growth.

Lloyds, the UK's largest mortgage lender, is expected to report profits of £7.2 billion and raise its dividend to 2.1 pence. Its net interest margins and costs have been closely watched amid interest rate changes. RBS is forecast to report £5.5 billion of profits, though its dividend will depend on completing the last of its state bailout terms. Analysts say RBS may announce a final dividend of 4 pence per share if given approval to resume payouts.

However, there are headwinds on the horizon for British banks. The economic rebound could slow once government support schemes end, increasing risks around business and consumer lending. There are also concerns borrowers may struggle with repayments when temporary payment holidays and loans come to an end. Meanwhile, interest rates remaining low could restrict future margin growth. Overall though, most analysts expect the UK banking sector to continue its recovery in the year ahead, supporting higher profits and dividends. For long-suffering shareholders who have weathered over a decade of weak returns since the financial crisis, this reporting season may provide cause for optimism at last.
