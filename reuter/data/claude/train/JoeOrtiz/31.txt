Lloyds Bank Fined for Mis-Selling Pension Products, Faces Millions in Compensation Payments 

Britain's biggest retail bank, Lloyds Banking Group, has been fined £56 million by city regulators and faces paying out nearly £1 billion in compensation for mis-selling retirement savings products to thousands of customers. The  Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that Lloyds had provided unsuitable advice to nearly 90,000 clients between 2010 and 2017. 

The FCA investigation discovered that Lloyds sales staff were pressured into persuading customers to pull money out of low-risk pension funds and invest in higher-fee investment funds that were riskier and less suitable for retirement savings. Many customers lost money as a result. The average compensation payout is expected to be over £10,000 per customer.

“Lloyds Bank failed its customers. Its sales staff were pressured to recommend investment products to customers that did not match their needs,” said Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. “Lloyds failed to ensure its sales process was fair and not misleading. Lloyds let its customers down and we will continue to take action against firms that demonstrate poor conduct.”

The FCA fined comes as another blow to the reputation of Britain's banking sector, which has faced a string of controversies in recent years over unlawful behavior. Lloyds has set aside nearly £400 million to cover compensation claims related to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. The bank said it accepted the regulator's findings and had made significant changes to address the failures. 

“We apologize unreservedly to the customers affected by our failures,” said Horta-Osório, Lloyds chief executive. “We have made significant progress in recent years to enhance our customer policies and processes. However, we recognize that we still have more work to do to rebuild trust and ensure consistent outcomes for our customers.”

The compensation process will begin in early 2020, according to the FCA. Lloyds has promised to learn lessons from this episode and pledged to work to regain customer trust. But critics argue that Britain's big banks continue to show a callous disregard for customers in pursuit of profits. The Lloyds episode is another sign that culture change across UK banking still has a long way to go.
