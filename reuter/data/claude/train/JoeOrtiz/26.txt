British Government Proposes New Laws to Water Down Building Societies' Immunity from Takeover 

The British government today proposed new legislation that would make it easier for banks and other financial institutions to take over building societies. Building societies, which are mutual organizations owned by their members, have traditionally been protected from takeovers through laws restricting ownership and voting rights. However, the government argues that removing some of these protections would increase competition in the banking sector and benefit consumers through lower interest rates and fees.

Under the proposed laws, the threshold for outside shareholders to gain voting rights and board seats in a building society would be lowered from the current 50% to just 25% of shares. This could make building societies susceptible to "creeping takeovers" where an outside group slowly amasses more and more shares over time until it has effective control. The government counters that there would still be safeguards in place to prevent hostile takeovers, such as requiring member approval for any proposal to convert a building society into a bank. 

Building societies have voiced strong opposition to the proposed changes, arguing that they would undermine the mutually-owned and customer-focused nature of their businesses. They point out that building societies typically offer higher interest rates and lower fees than big banks, and say that opening themselves up to more outside influence could jeopardize their ability to maintain these benefits for members. Some consumer groups have also argued that building societies provide an important competitive check on large banks, and weakening them could reduce choice and innovation in the sector.

However, others argue that building societies are relying too much on laws to protect them from market forces, rather than improving their own competitiveness. They say that if building societies want to survive independently, they need to better match the digital services and convenience offered by banks. Easing restrictions on takeovers could encourage them to become leaner, more innovative and responsive to customersâ€™ needs. The proposed new laws may also make building societies more attractive partners for strategic alliances and investments that could help them improve their technology and services.

The legislation is still in early stages, and lawmakers will debate amendments and input from various interested parties. However, if passed, these new rules could significantly reshape the building society sector in the UK and impact how consumers bank and borrow money. While more open competition often benefits customers, some worry these particular changes might endanger unique financial institutions that many value and rely upon. The future of building societies hangs in the balance as this issue moves forward.
