British Banks See Positive Start to 1997 with Buoyant Share Prices and Analysts Confident in Continued Growth 

The British banking sector started 1997 on a positive note, with share prices buoyant in the first week of trading and analysts expressing confidence the sector will continue to show strong growth over the coming year. Major British banks saw their share prices rise between 3 to 5 percent in the opening days of the new year, reflecting investor optimism about the health and future prospects of the industry.

HSBC Holdings, the largest bank in Britain, saw its share price rise 3.8% to £9.24, while Barclays Bank stock rose 4.6% to £15.43. Analysts cited several factors driving the positive sentiment around British banks, including sustained economic growth in Britain, low interest rates, and management teams that have restructured balance sheets and improved efficiency and service in recent years. 

“The British economy continues to grow at a steady pace with low inflation and falling unemployment, which provides a very supportive environment for the banking sector,” said Richard Hunter, Head of Research at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. “At the same time, banks have largely completed their post-financial crisis restructuring and balance sheet repairs, and are now well-positioned to benefit from the improving economy.”

A particular area of growth and opportunity is the mortgage market, analysts noted, as demand for homes and refinancing of mortgages remain strong. Interest rates in Britain have been kept low by the Bank of England, with the base rate at 6% since October 1996. This has spurred demand for mortgages, even as competition among lenders has intensified.

“Mortgage lending has been a major driver of revenue and profit growth for most major banks in Britain over the last several years, and we expect this trend to continue in 1997,” said Adam Cole, a banking analyst with RBC Capital Markets in London. “If interest rates remain low and stable, mortgage lending will likely continue to underpin healthy top line growth for the sector.”

Despite the positive start to the year, some analysts cautioned that uncertainty remains, including potential headwinds from weak continental European economies, uncertainty around Hong Kong’s transition to Chinese rule, and risks of a future rise in British interest rates. However, most analysts remained sanguine about the outlook for British banks and expect the positive momentum of 1996 to carry through this year.
