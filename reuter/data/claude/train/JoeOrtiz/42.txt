Northern Rock Building Society reports 14% increase in profits ahead of autumn IPO 

Northern Rock Building Society today reported a 14% increase in half-year profits as the mortgage lender prepares for a stock market listing later this year.

Pre-tax profits rose to £323 million in the six months to June 30, up from £283 million a year earlier. The increase was driven by higher mortgage lending, particularly in the buy-to-let market, and from an increase in savings interest rates.

The results come as Northern Rock prepares for an Initial Public Offering on the London Stock Exchange, where it is hoping to raise up to £500 million to fund future growth. Northern Rock announced plans earlier this year to demutualize and list at least 25% of its shares on the stock exchange in an IPO in October 2018.

Net mortgage lending during the period was up 19% to £18.1 billion, as Northern Rock increased its market share amid robust demand for housing loans. The group has been expanding in the buy-to-let market in particular, where margins are higher, as well as growing its savings and commercial loan business. 

Operating expenses edged higher as Northern Rock invested in technology and compliance controls to meet regulatory requirements and service its expanding customer base. However, the cost-to-income ratio improved slightly to 35% from 36% the previous year.

Gary Hoffman, Chief Executive of Northern Rock, said: “This is an excellent set of results that demonstrates the progress we have made in growing our key markets and enhancing efficiency. Mortgage lending and savings are up strongly, profits have increased significantly and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We have good momentum and a clear strategy, leaving us well placed as we prepare for our stock market listing this autumn.”

The14% profit rise was slightly better than analysts had expected and is seen as an encouraging sign for Northern Rock's IPO. The lender hopes to open the IPO by early October if market conditions remain supportive, and list its shares on the LSE by the end of the month. 

However, shares in Northern Rock will only be available to institutional investors in the IPO and not to its members or customers. This has angered some long-standing members of Northern Rock, who believe they should get priority access in the listing of shares. Northern Rock's board has defended the decision by arguing that prioritizing certain groups of investors could weaken the IPO and raise less money for the society's expansion plans.
