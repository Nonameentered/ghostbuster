British Government Publishes Draft Legislation But Lack of Parliamentary Time a Concern Before Election 

The British government today published draft legislation to overhaul the country's immigration system, advancing a key electoral promise to take back control of UK borders. However, with a general election expected within the next year and Parliamentary time in short supply, there are concerns that the bill may not make it into law before voters head to the polls.

Home Secretary Priti Patel unveiled the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, which would end free movement from the European Union and introduce a points-based immigration system focused on attracting high-skilled workers. The government hopes the new system, to be introduced from January 2021, will reduce overall immigration numbers while supporting key economic sectors like technology and health care.

"We are delivering on the democratic will of the British public by ending free movement and taking back control of our borders," Patel said. "This landmark legislation delivers on that promise and sets the foundation for a fair and sovereign immigration system."

The legislation requires parliamentary approval to pass into law, but with a crowded legislative agenda and the government's Conservative Party holding only a narrow majority, there are doubts about whether there will be enough opportunity for proper debate and scrutiny. The government's term runs until 2022, but most political analysts expect Prime Minister Boris Johnson to call an election in fall 2020 to try to gain a larger majority and a fresh mandate for his political program.

Opposition parties have accused the government of prioritising "soundbites over substance" with this bill and said there are provisions that could negatively impact businesses by making it harder to recruit key workers. "This bill is not remotely ready for the statute book. It would damage our economy and society," said Nick Thomas-Symonds, the immigration spokesman for the Labour Party. "Instead of gimmicks, we need a wholesale reform of this Tory government's cruel and failing immigration system."  

Pro-EU activists argue ending free movement will strip away rights, making it harder for British citizens to live and work abroad. But the government has said Brexit offers an opportunity to rebalance immigration controls in Britain's favour while establishing a "global immigration system" that treats applicants equally regardless of nationality.
