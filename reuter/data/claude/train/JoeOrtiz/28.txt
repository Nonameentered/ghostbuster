Woolwich Building Society to Hold £3 Billion Stock Market Flotation in July, Members to Receive Windfall  

The Woolwich Building Society has announced plans for a highly anticipated stock market flotation in July that will raise about £3 billion from investors and value the UK's fourth-largest mortgage lender at more than £6.5 billion. Members, who own the 174-year-old mutual building society, will receive shares or cash payouts in advance of the flotation.

The building society said it would distribute about £900 million in shares and cash windfalls to its 2.5 million members ahead of listing an estimated 30-40% of its shares on the London Stock Exchange. The payout means long-standing members could receive thousands of pounds in windfalls when the society demutualizes and converts into a publicly traded bank, named Woolwich Bank.

“This is an exciting new chapter for our members and colleagues,” said Woolwich Chief Executive Neil Stevens. “As a bank, we will have greater flexibility to invest in the business, support more customers, develop new products and services, and ultimately deliver value for our new shareholders.”

The Woolwich has sought to demutualize and list on public markets for years to gain greater access to capital for loans and to fund its digital transformation. The building society saw profits drop 8% last year as it invested heavily in improving its digital and mobile banking services. The Woolwich says its new bank will be better positioned to weather economic downturns and competitive pressures.

The planned stock market flotation will be the second largest in the UK this year, after the £4.8 billion IPO of fintech firm Revolut in May. Investor interest in new bank stocks has been strong, with Metro Bank and Starling Bank seeing their share prices jump 50-60% after listing in London over the past two years. Analysts expect the Woolwich IPO to be well received given its stable mortgage book and potential for future growth.

Members will vote on the demutualization plan in June, but the proposal is widely expected to receive strong support. Members with mortgage, savings or insurance accounts will receive at least 1,000 free shares in the new bank, worth up to £3,500 at the midpoint of the offering price range. The Woolwich said it will announce the exact details of the member payout and stock offering in the coming weeks.
