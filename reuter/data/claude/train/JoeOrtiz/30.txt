Morgan Grenfell Asset Management to Resume Trading in Suspended European Funds

Morgan Grenfell Asset Management today announced that it will resume trading in its European Equity Fund and European Progressive Fund, effective immediately. The funds had been suspended since March 18 amid extreme volatility in European markets due to the COVID-19 crisis. 

The firm suspended the funds to protect investors from adverse price movements as European markets declined sharply in mid-March. Major European indexes fell over 30% from February highs, entering bear market territory. The funds were unable to meet redemption requests from investors without selling holdings at distressed prices.

“We have closely monitored market conditions in Europe over the past several weeks, and volatility has declined to more normal levels,” said Simon Jones, Chief Investment Officer at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management. “European policymakers have also taken extraordinary steps to stabilize markets and support the economy. We believe the time is now appropriate to resume trading in the funds so that investors can access their holdings and make adjustments to their portfolios as needed.”

The European Equity Fund invests in a diversified portfolio of stocks of companies headquartered in Europe, excluding the United Kingdom. As of March 18, the fund had $3.2 billion in assets under management. The European Progressive Fund takes a higher-risk, higher-reward approach focused on emerging sectors of the European economy such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. It had $1.8 billion in assets before the suspension.  

Morgan Grenfell stated that both funds remain invested in high-quality companies with sustainable business models and that short-term price declines do not materially impact the long-term value of the portfolios. The firm does not expect significant redemptions from the funds post-suspension based on investor conversations over the past month. However, portfolio managers have raised additional cash reserves in case redemption requests exceed 10% of fund assets within the first week of resumed trading.

“We greatly appreciate the patience and understanding of our investors during this turbulent period,” Mr. Jones said. “Morgan Grenfell remains confident in the European equity markets over the next 3 to 5 years based on a variety of macroeconomic and corporate fundamentals.”
