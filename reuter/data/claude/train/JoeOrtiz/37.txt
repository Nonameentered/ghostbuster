Halifax Building Society Plans Flotation Valued at $20 Billion – Largest Share Ownership Extension in UK History

The Halifax, Britain’s largest mortgage lender, announced plans today to demutualize and float on the London Stock Exchange. The floatation is expected to raise $20 billion, making it the largest share offering in British history.  

For Halifax, demutualization means it will transition from being owned by its account holders to being a publicly traded company owned by shareholders. As part of the offering, qualifying Halifax account holders will receive an allocation of shares in the new company worth up to £3,000. This represents the largest direct share ownership by customers of any UK company.

“We believe now is the right time to demutualize the Halifax and allow both our new and longstanding customers to participate in the exciting next stage of our growth,” said Andy Hornby, CEO of Halifax. “The proceeds from the IPO will allow us to invest further in innovative products and services, enhance our technology capabilities, and continue our expansion into new geographic markets.”

Halifax has over 15 million customers and £260 billion in assets, making it a dominant player in the UK mortgage market. By going public, Halifax aims to gain access to capital markets to fund its growth plans, as well as incentivize management and employees through share-based compensation programs. 

Analysts expect strong demand for Halifax shares given its leading market position, high brand recognition, and customer loyalty. However, some critics argue mutual organizations ultimately benefit customers more as they are exclusively focused on member interests rather than shareholder returns. There is also concern that Halifax’s large branch network, required to service its many small retail customers, could be a drag on costs and shareholder profits.

The announcement is a victory for advocates of building society demutualization like former Halifax CEO James Crosby, who had argued conversion would give members a chance to gain financially from the value created in the organization. However, demutualization remains controversial and the decision is still pending final approval from Halifax members. A vote is expected in early 2020 with the potential IPO to follow later that year. If approved and executed, it would be the largest demutualization and stock offering in British history.
