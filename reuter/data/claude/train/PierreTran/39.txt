Airbus Partners Sign Agreement to Restructure into Single Limited Liability Company to Compete with Boeing Co.  

The European aircraft manufacturing conglomerate Airbus announced today that its key shareholders have signed an agreement to consolidate into a single company to better compete with rival Boeing. The new company, to be called Airbus SE, will combine multiple Airbus subsidiaries and affiliates under one corporate umbrella.  

Airbus is currently composed of Airbus Group SE and three subsidiary companies: Airbus SAS, which handles commercial aircraft; Airbus Helicopters, focused on civil helicopters; and Airbus Defence and Space, which works on defense and space projects. These subsidiaries will be folded into the new Airbus SE, simplifying the corporate structure.  

"Our industry is extremely competitive and becoming more globalized each day," said Airbus Group SE CEO Thomas Enders. "By streamlining our governance and simplifying our structure, we will strengthen our competitiveness, better satisfy our customers, and open up new opportunities for our future growth."

The restructuring has been approved by the boards of Airbus Group and its subsidiaries and is expected to be completed before the end of 2020, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. Airbus Group SE will be renamed Airbus SE once the integration is complete.  No job losses or factory closures are anticipated as a result of the consolidation.

The move is seen as a response to rival Boeing's strong positioning in the global aircraft market. Boeing remains the world's largest aerospace company and top manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems. By consolidating into a single entity with a simplified management structure, Airbus aims to compete more effectively against Boeing and capture a larger share of growing aircraft markets, especially in Asia and the Middle East.

Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services with a workforce of around 52,000 and annual revenue of more than $70 billion. Airbus offers the most comprehensive range of passenger airliners from 100 to more than 600 seats. Airbus also features the most comprehensive civil helicopter range in the world and is the European leader in fixed-wing military aircraft. 
  
The agreement to restructure into a new single limited liability company is a bold move that aims to reshape how Airbus goes to market and interfaces with customers. The company is betting that streamlining management and operations will result in a more nimble organization able to challenge Boeing's dominance. If approved and executed successfully, the reorganization could herald a new era of intensified competition in the global aircraft manufacturing industry. Overall, the deal highlights the increasing drive toward consolidation as a strategy for success in highly competitive, mature industries.
