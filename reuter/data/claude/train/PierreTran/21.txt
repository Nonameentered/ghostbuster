Air France Orders 10 Boeing and 10 Airbus Jets, Reports Profit Jump of $158 Million 

Air France-KLM announced a major expansion of its long-haul fleet with orders for 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 10 Airbus A350 jets. The French-Dutch airline also reported a sizable jump in quarterly profits, boosted by higher ticket prices and lower fuel costs.

Air France unveiled the aircraft orders as part of a fleet renewal program aimed at improving its environmental footprint and meeting growing global competition. The Boeing and Airbus jets, valued at $7.8 billion based on list prices, will replace older aircraft including some four-engine models with two-engine planes that are more fuel efficient.  

The orders are a boon for Boeing and Airbus, which have faced a slowdown in wide-body plane orders. They will also enable Air France to open new routes and increase capacity on existing connections between Paris and international destinations. The first new aircraft will be delivered in 2022, with the Boeing jets deployed on routes to the U.S. and Canada and the Airbus A350s flying to Asia, Africa and the French Caribbean.

“This transaction will enhance our operational performance, enable us to deliver the best experience to our clients, and contribute to ouremission reduction targets,” said Ben Smith, Air France-KLM’s CEO. The company aims to cut emissions by 50 percent per passenger and per kilometer by 2030 compared with 2011.

Air France also reported profits of $158 million for the July-September quarter, a turnaround from a loss of $39 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.8 percent to $8.04 billion. Traffic and yields—a measure of airfares—increased, helped by a recovering global economy and the soccer World Cup, which boosted travel to major matches across Europe, including the final in Paris.  

The results were better than expected, and Air France stock rose over 4 percent. Analysts said the strong quarter signaled that Air France’s strategic focus on premium customers and improving efficiencies are paying off. At the same time, fuel costs declined, supporting profit margins.

“Air France is beginning to see the benefits of its transformation,” said Samuel Engel, aviation analyst at consulting firm ICF. “Higher-paying passengers and lower costs have led to significantly improved profitability and the results give Air France’s management some breathing room.”

After years of losses and aircraft cancellations, Air France has sought to boost competitiveness by reducing domestic airline staff. Mr. Smith, a veteran executive who previously overhauled Air Canada, was appointed as CEO last year to lead the turnaround. The fleet order and financial results suggest the recovery of one of Europe’s most prestigious airlines is on track, though it still faces economic and geopolitical uncertainties going forward.
