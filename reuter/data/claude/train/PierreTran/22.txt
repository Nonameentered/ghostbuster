Air France Reports Dramatically Improved Earnings and Places Bumper Order for 20 Boeing and Airbus Aircrafts 

Air France issued upbeat quarterly results today, reporting dramatically improved earnings on the back of strong traffic growth and lower costs. The airline also announced a major order for 20 new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus to renew its long-haul fleet.

Air France's net income for the first quarter of 2019 rose to $120 million compared with a loss of $178 million in the same period last year. Revenues increased 8% to $6.2 billion, beating analysts' forecasts. The results reflect the success of the airline's ongoing cost-cutting and restructuring plan as well as buoyant conditions in the European aviation market.

"Our turnaround is well underway, and we are delivering on our financial commitments," said CEO Anne Rigail. "Strict cost discipline and our continuous efforts to improve operational efficiency are clearly paying off."

Rigail added that the troop remains focused on reaching its medium-term financial guidance. As part of its recovery plan, Air France aims to boost revenue and reduce costs by $340 million this year while also improving customer satisfaction. 

The improvement in Air France's performance gave the carrier confidence to place a major aircraft order to upgrade its long-haul fleet. The airline will buy 10 Airbus A350 wide-body jets and 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners for delivery starting in 2023. The new aircraft are more fuel efficient and comfortable, with lower emissions and operating costs.  

"This order demonstrates our confidence in the future of Air France and our determination to continue improving our competitiveness and profitability in a sustainable way," said Rigail. The aircraft will primarily be used to replace Air France's current Boeing 777s on routes to Asia, the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and North and South America.

The fleet renewal forms an important part of Air France's broader transformation plan aimed at returning the loss-making airline to consistent profitability while improving customer experience. Air France merged with Dutch carrier KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in 2004 but has faced significant financial difficulties in recent years due to recessions, competition from budget airlines, and high costs.

However, with higher sales and lower unit costs, Air France seems to have regained positive momentum. Its shares rose over 6% in midday trading in Paris following the earnings report and aircraft deal. If macroeconomic conditions remain supportive, the airline looks to be in a good position to continue rebuilding value for shareholders through improved operational performance and smart investments in critical infrastructure like its new Boeing and Airbus fleet.
