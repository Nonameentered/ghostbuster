Schneider aims to double return on equity capital to 15 percent in 3 years

Schneider Electric, a global specialist in energy management and automation, announced plans today to double the return on its equity capital to 15 percent within the next 3 years. The company plans to achieve this goal through accelerated growth, simplification and energy productivity initiatives. 

“We have built a very solid foundation over the last few years that positions us well to accelerate growth and boost returns,” said Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO of Schneider Electric. “Technology trends such as IoT and sustainability objectives are massive drivers of our growth opportunities. Our strategy is focused on simplifying our company, delivering more value to our customers, and boosting our energy productivity.”

Specifically, Schneider Electric will focus on higher growth segments including its energy and sustainability services, industrial automation, software and other digitally enabled opportunities. The company expects its innovation platforms like EcoStruxure, offering IoT-enabled, plug-and-play, open, interoperable architecture and platform, to be major growth catalysts. 

Schneider also plans to drive over €1.5 billion in cost savings and simplification over the next three years. The cost actions will span multiple initiatives including Zero Overhead initiative focused on reducing structural costs, asset optimization and footprint rationalization programs. These programs are aimed at improving the company's cost structure and generating funds to invest in growth opportunities.

The company has also set an ambitious target to improve its own energy productivity by 3.5 percent year-over-year. Schneider believes that boosting its own energy efficiency will not only lower costs but also showcase its capabilities as an energy management specialist to customers and support its growth ambitions.

The announcements were made during the company's Investor Day where Tricoire and executive leadership team outlined their strategic priorities and growth focus areas for 2017 to 2019 to the investor and analyst community. The company reaffirmed its 2016 targets and 2017-2019 outlook. Schneider Electric's stock price rose over 4 percent following the announcements, showing investor confidence in the company's growth and simplification plans.
