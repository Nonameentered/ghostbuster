Airbus Claims to Have Overtaken Boeing in Market Share, but Boeing Disagrees 

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus announced this week that it delivered more commercial airplanes than its main competitor Boeing in 2019, claiming to have overtaken Boeing in market share for the first time. According to Airbus, it delivered 863 commercial aircraft last year compared to 345 for Boeing.  

“For the first time in our history, Airbus has delivered more aircraft in a single year than Boeing,” said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury in a statement. “This makes Airbus No. 1 in the commercial aircraft market.”

However, Boeing disputed Airbus’s claim, saying the figures are not an accurate comparison. Boeing says Airbus’s numbers include deliveries of the smaller A220 airliner, a plane Boeing does not produce and does not compete directly against. Excluding the A220, Airbus delivered 620 planes last year compared to 345 for Boeing. 

“The A220 is a terrific aircraft, but to claim it gives Airbus a lead in market share against the Boeing 737 is misleading,” said Ian McAllister, a Boeing spokesperson. “The 737 remains the highest-selling and most delivered jet in the single-aisle market, and we ended 2019 with a seven-year backlog of more than 4,400 aircraft.”

The dispute highlights the intense competition between the archrivals, the world’s two largest commercial aircraft manufacturers. Airbus surpassed Boeing in annual deliveries for the first time in 2003 and the companies have traded the top spot a few times since then. But 2019 marked the largest gap in annual deliveries between them in over 15 years. 

The diverging figures were the result of Boeing’s struggles last year with the grounding and production halt of its top-selling 737 Max aircraft after two deadly crashes. Boeing delivered just 127 of the single-aisle 737 planes in 2019, down from 580 the year before, as it suspended deliveries for most of the year. Airbus, meanwhile, continued apace and delivered a record 642 of its competing A320neo single-aisle jets.

While the Max crisis gave Airbus an opportunity to overtake Boeing, analysts say the sales contest between the world’s dominant aircraft makers regularly shifts back and forth based on product cycles, geopolitical events, and other factors. With Boeing working to return the Max to service and increase its production, the race is sure to remain competitive for years to come.
