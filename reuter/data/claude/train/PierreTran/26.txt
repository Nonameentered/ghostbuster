Eurotunnel Employees Work Round the Clock to Clear Fire Wreckage in Channel Tunnel 

Employees of Eurotunnel, the company that operates the Channel Tunnel between France and England, are working 24 hours a day to clear the wreckage from a fire that broke out in the tunnel on Wednesday evening. The blaze started on a freight shuttle carrying a truck that caught fire near the French entrance to the tunnel. The fire spread quickly, engulfing several carriages of the shuttle and damaging nearly 1,000 feet of the tunnel. 

Eurotunnel halted all passenger and freight rail traffic through the tunnel immediately after the fire broke out. Over 300 passengers had to be evacuated from a passenger shuttle and led to safety. While no injuries were reported, the disruption to travel and trade is substantial. The Channel Tunnel is a crucial connection between the UK and mainland Europe, used by over 50,000 passengers and 1.6 million freight vehicles each month.

Repair crews have been working round the clock since the fire was extinguished in the early hours of Thursday morning. Over 100 employees are involved in clearing the wreckage, laying new tracks, and assessing smoke and fire damage over a quarter mile section of the north tunnel. The scale of the repairs means the tunnel may remain closed for several days as crews work to rebuild infrastructure and ensure the tunnel is safe to re-open.

The cause of the initial truck fire is still under investigation, though officials believe it may have been due to overheating brakes. The high temperatures in the fire, estimated at over 1,000Â°C, caused severe damage to the tunnel lining, tracks, cabling, and other equipment. Repairs are estimated to cost Eurotunnel tens of millions of euros.

Eurotunnel apologized for any disruption and assured customers that service would resume as soon as safety checks were completed and repairs made. Alternative ferry and rail services have been made available to passengers affected by the tunnel's closure. The re-opening of the Channel Tunnel cannot come soon enough for those relying on quick transport across the English Channel. Eurotunnel teams are working as fast as safely possible to reinstate full service.
