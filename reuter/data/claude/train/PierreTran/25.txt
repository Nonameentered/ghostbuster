Eurotunnel Seeks to Reassure Public of Channel Tunnel's Safety After Fire

A fire broke out on December 8th in a cargo shuttle belonging to the Eurotunnel truck service. The blaze occurred on the 50-kilometer English Channel tunnel that runs underneath the sea and connects France and England. The dangerous incident displaced hundreds of passengers and caused significant damage to a cargo shuttle and reinforced the concerns of many about the safety of the Channel tunnel. 

In a statement released today, Eurotunnel executives sought to reassure the public about the tunnel's safety. "We have thoroughly investigated the cause of last week's fire and have put in place additional safety checks and equipment to ensure this does not happen again," said Jacques Gounon, Chairman and CEO of Groupe Eurotunnel SE. "Over 23 million passengers have travelled through the Channel Tunnel since it opened in 1994, and safety continues to be our top priority."

The fire started on an empty cargo shuttle in the tunnel around 7:15 pm last Wednesday. All passenger and freight rail traffic was immediately suspended while French and British emergency responders put out the fire. Passengers were evacuated from trains and had to be shuttled out of the tunnel to evacuation shelters. The fire took nearly 5 hours to extinguish fully. Fourteen people, including three emergency responders, suffered minor smoke inhalation injuries. 

An initial investigation points to an issue with batteries onboard the cargo shuttle that overheated and ignited other flammable materials. Eurotunnel stated that they have banned the transport of all lithium batteries through the tunnel until further safety reviews have been completed. Additional fire detection sensors, equipment, and crew training will also be put in place to improve emergency response times.

The Channel Tunnel is the world's longest undersea tunnel, with sections running up to 75 meters deep under the sea floor. While there have been safety concerns about fires and accidents in the confined space of the tunnel, Eurotunnel officials maintain that their safety record over the past 25 years of operation is excellent. Still, last week's fire was a frightening reminder of the risks inherent in high-speed underground rail travel between the UK and mainland Europe. With Brexit on the horizon, the tunnel's importance for trade and tourism makes its safety an ongoing priority. Eurotunnel continues to review and improve their safety procedures to maximize the security of all their passengers and cargo.
