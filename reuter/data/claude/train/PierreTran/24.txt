Eurotunnel seeks to reassure public about safety of Channel Tunnel after fire, but minor fire mars PR effort  

Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel rail link between Britain and France, sought to reassure the public about the safety and security of the tunnel yesterday after a truck fire disrupted traffic earlier this week. However, a minor fire on a freight shuttle late yesterday threatened to undermine Eurotunnel’s public relations push.

On Wednesday, a fire broke out on a truck carrying cardboard and pulps on a freight shuttle traveling from Folkestone to Calais. The fire activated safety systems that halted shuttle traffic for several hours. While the fire was contained to the truck and put out, thick black smoke filled parts of the tunnel. The event revived memories of deadly fires in the tunnel in 1999 and 2006 and raised questions about its safety.

In an effort to reassure travelers, Eurotunnel brought media into the tunnel yesterday to demonstrate safety procedures and systems. CEO Jacques Gounon said the tunnel’s fire detection systems, bulkhead doors, and air extraction pumps all worked well during this week’s fire. “The recent incident, whilst disruptive, has demonstrated once again the efficiency of our safety systems,” he said. Gounon said Eurotunnel safety standards exceed international requirements. Over 60 million passengers have used the tunnel since it opened in 1994, and the company has an “excellent safety record,” Gounon said.

However, shortly after the media event concluded yesterday, a minor fire started on another freight shuttle carrying a truck loaded with paper products. Smoke again filled parts of the tunnel, though the fire was quickly extinguished and contained to the one truck. No injuries were reported, but shuttle service was halted for several more hours. 

 The two fires in two days will likely do little to alleviate safety concerns, especially those of nervous passengers. And they threaten to undermine Eurotunnel’s message that the tunnel is extremely safe and secure. The company continues to face questions about how it can prevent future fires and whether more can be done to limit disruptions. Rival ferry companies have already begun recommending their services as an alternative for those wishing to travel between Britain and France, citing shorter travel time and an “unparalleled safety record.”

Eurotunnel has now launched an internal investigation into the two fires and has vowed to review safety procedures to determine any necessary changes or improvements. But with peak travel season fast approaching, Eurotunnel faces a difficult task in rebuilding public trust in the Channel Tunnel. Two minor incidents have shown how vulnerable the tunnel is to disruption, despite the company’s insistence that it prioritizes safety. For many, memories of past catastrophes in the tunnel may continue to eclipse Eurotunnel’s public relations campaigns touting its safety record and measures. The next few months will prove crucial as Eurotunnel works to reassure customers during the busy summer travel season.
