Airbus Consortium in Dispute Over Future Shape to Compete With New US Rival, Boeing-McDonnell Douglas Merger  

The European aircraft manufacturing consortium Airbus is facing internal disputes over how to restructure itself to compete effectively against Boeing following the recent merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The $13.3 billion merger combines two of the three largest aircraft manufacturers in the world and creates a formidable competitor for Airbus.

Airbus was formed in 1970 as a consortium of European aerospace companies to compete with US aircraft manufacturers. It has been very successful, capturing more than half the market for large commercial jetliners with its A320 and A330 aircraft. However, the merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas makes Boeing a much larger company with more resources and capabilities. Boeing will also gain McDonnell Douglas's advanced military aircraft expertise, which some analysts argue will allow Boeing to cross-subsidize the development of new commercial airliners.  

Airbus's management wants to streamline its consortium structure into a single integrated company to match Boeing. However, its four shareholder companies—Aérospatiale of France, British Aerospace, CASA of Spain, and DASA of Germany—each want to maintain control over jobs and workshare. There are also concerns that single integration may reduce competition within the consortium that has driven innovation. The shareholder companies have competing views on how to balance these factors.

Negotiations have been ongoing for over six months without resolution. The delays are causing concern in European governments and the aerospace industry about losing further ground to the new Boeing giant. There are also fears that the continuing uncertainty could prompt airline customers to defect to Boeing. Airbus's order book and market share have already been slipping in recent years.

Airbus's CEO Jean Pierson warned that the consortium must establish a leadership position to match its competitor or risk being marginalized in the global market. However, achieving agreement on ceding more control to the central Airbus organization from the current shareholders has proven difficult. People close to the negotiations say all sides remain entrenched in their positions. Breaking the deadlock and finding a compromise to put the consortium on a solid footing for competition with Boeing in the 21st century will require deft diplomacy and statesmanship to overcome the competing national and corporate interests involved. The future shape and success of Airbus may hang in the balance.
