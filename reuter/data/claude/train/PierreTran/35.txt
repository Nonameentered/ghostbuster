French Government to Sell Thomson-CSF through 1986 Privatisation Law, Decision Delayed Until 1997

The French government has announced plans to fully privatize Thomson-CSF, the state-owned defense electronics group, through France's 1986 privatization law. However, the final decision on the sale has been delayed until early 1997 due to political concerns and negotiations with employee representatives.

Thomson-CSF is a highly successful defense and aerospace company with annual revenues of over $5 billion. It supplies electronic systems and equipment for aircraft, ships, ground vehicles and missiles to the French military and other armed forces around the world. The French government currently owns 56% of Thomson-CSF shares, with private investors holding the remaining 44% of shares.

Proposals to privatize Thomson-CSF have been discussed for over a decade but faced opposition due to its strategic importance to France's defense capabilities and concerns over foreign investors acquiring control. The government has now decided to proceed with selling its majority stake through a "private placement" with selected investors under the 1986 privatization law. This law allows the government to sell shares through direct negotiations rather than a public offering. 

The decision to move forward with the sale was made after reaching an agreement with Thomson-CSF employee representatives to protect jobs for five years. However, the final approval of the sale has been pushed into early 1997 to allow further consultation and because of political sensitivities around the upcoming French presidential and parliamentary elections.

If approved, the sale of the government's 56% stake is expected to raise over $3 billion for the state. The government has not yet announced details on potential investors but has said that a consortium of French companies is the preferred option to ensure Thomson-CSF remains under "patriotic" ownership. The sale would be France's largest privatization since major industrial groups like Rh√¥ne-Poulenc and Pechiney were privatized in 1993.

The privatization of Thomson-CSF would mark a major step in France's gradual opening of its defense industry to market forces and private capital. While sensitive defense groups like Dassault Aviation are likely to remain under state control, Thomson-CSF could serve as a model for possible future privatization in the defense sector.
