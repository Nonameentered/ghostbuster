Canal Plus and Nethold Merge to Create One of the World's Largest Pay-TV Groups   

French media giant Canal Plus Group today announced a merger agreement with Dutch telecommunications firm Nethold NV in a deal valued at $12 billion. The merger will combine Canal Plus's premium pay-TV operations across France and Africa with Nethold's broadband internet and pay-TV businesses in the Netherlands and parts of Central Europe. The new company, to be called MediaCo Group, will have over 50 million subscribers in 30 countries, making it one of the largest pay-TV operators in the world.

The merger comes amid growing competition in the pay-TV and streaming media sectors in Europe. Major US players like Netflix and Hulu have been expanding into new markets, while telecom firms have been bundling streaming services with broadband and mobile phone plans. The combined company will have increased scale and resources to compete, with a content budget of over $3 billion to invest in movies, TV shows, sports, and original programming.

"This merger makes strategic sense in the current media landscape," said Pierre Lescure, CEO of Canal Plus Group. "By combining forces with Nethold, we will be in a stronger position to provide the best premium entertainment experiences to our subscribers wherever they are."  Under the terms of the all-stock deal, Nethold shareholders will own 45% of the new MediaCo Group, with Canal Plus shareholders owning the remaining 55%. The companies expect to achieve substantial cost savings and synergies worth â‚¬500 million within two years of the merger closing.  

Regulators are likely to scrutinize the deal closely, given the potential impact on competition in pay-TV and broadband markets across Western Europe. If approved, the merger is expected to close in Q3 of next year. The new company will be headquartered in Amsterdam, though Canal Plus will retain its headquarters and studios in Paris. The deal marks one of the biggest mergers of European media companies in recent years.
