Airbus Consortium Signs Agreement to Restructure as Single Corporate Entity  

The consortium that owns European aircraft manufacturing giant Airbus signed an agreement today to restructure and consolidate into a single corporate entity owned by three key shareholders. The historic move is aimed at simplifying Airbus's governance and ownership structure, improving operational efficiency, and positioning the company for future growth.

Airbus was founded in 1970 as a consortium of aerospace companies from France, Germany, and Spain. The consortium structure has been in place for the past 48 years, but has led to increased complexity as Airbus expanded globally and diversified into new business areas like helicopters, defense, and space technology. 

The new agreement, signed in Paris today by the French government's Paribas Aérospatiale company, the German Daimler Stiftung, and the Spanish Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) foundation, dissolves the Airbus consortium and transfers full ownership of Airbus to a new commercial entity with its own governance structure. The three companies will each hold equal stakes in the new entity.

"This is a transformational moment for Airbus that will allow us to operate in a more integrated, agile and competitive manner," said Airbus CEO Tom Enders. "With a single ownership and governance structure, we can reduce complexity and focus on industrial success and long-term value creation."

The deal is subject to regulatory approvals in France, Germany, and Spain, but the ownership transfer is targeted to be completed by the end of 2020. No job losses or changes are expected as an immediate result of the restructuring. Airbus employs over 133,000 people in dozens of locations around the world, including major engineering and manufacturing hubs in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; and Madrid, Spain.

While the new commercial entity will be owned equally by the three companies, governance changes are aimed at establishing a "normal" corporate structure with a single Board of Directors and voting structure. The French and German governments are expected to maintain and potentially increase their influence over Airbus's long-term strategic direction, while the Spanish government plans to sell its stake, valued at over €2B, within the next few years.

The restructuring comes amid trade tensions with Airbus's main rival, Boeing, and the breakdown of the WTO-authorized government support structures that until recently provided development funding for Airbus's aircraft projects. As an independent commercial entity, Airbus will aim to diversify its funding sources and gain more financial independence long-term, while still benefiting from close ties to European governments and space agencies. Airbus Defense and Space, as well as helicopter subsidiaries, will also transition to the new ownership structure.

Airbus is the largest aerospace company in the world measured by revenue and commercial aircraft deliveries. The restructure agreement caps an incredibly successful period for Airbus and positions the firm well for the future as it competes and collaborates with global partners on next-generation aircraft, autonomous flight technologies, space exploration, and more over the decades to come.
