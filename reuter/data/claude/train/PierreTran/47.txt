Canal Plus to Merge with Nethold to Create One of the World's Largest Pay-TV Groups

French media company Vivendi announced today that its subsidiary Canal Plus Group will merge with Netherlands-based Nethold, owner of the Ziggo pay-TV platform. The merger will create one of the largest pay-TV operators in Europe with over 20 million subscribers across 10 countries. 

The new company, to be called Canal Plus Nethold Group, will combine Canal Plus’s operations in France and Africa with Ziggo’s cable TV and internet services in the Netherlands. Vivendi will own 60% of the new company, while the remainder will be owned by a consortium of private equity firms that currently own Nethold.

The merger reflects the trend of consolidation in the pay-TV industry as companies seek to gain scale and leverage content over larger viewer bases. “This merger will allow us to be one of the top pay-TV and content groups in the world,” said Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine. “It will also allow us to better monetize our hit shows and sports rights in more countries and to have more leverage with major U.S. studios when purchasing content.”

The new company will have annual revenues of over €7 billion and be able to invest over €1 billion in new content. It aims to further expand across Europe, both through additional mergers as well as entering new markets like Poland, Italy and the UK. “With 20 million subscribers, we will be able to compete even more effectively with large global streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+,” said de Puyfontaine.

However, the merger is likely to draw close regulatory scrutiny, especially in France and the Netherlands. Critics argue that it will limit consumer choice and may lead to higher prices. “This deal needs to be examined closely to ensure fair competition and pricing,” said a spokesperson for France’s media regulator. Vivendi has pledged that the merger will not result in any layoffs or price increases for at least two years.

The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. While 2020 has seen a slowdown in dealmaking due to the COVID crisis, pay-TV media deals have continued as big players look to scale up and take advantage of undervalued assets. If approved, Canal Plus Nethold Group would likely look to make additional acquisitions to bolster its position across Europe.
