France's National Audit Office Criticizes Lack of Competition in Water Supply Market Dominated by Two Companies

The French National Audit Office has issued a report criticizing the lack of competition in France's water supply market, which is dominated by just two companies—Veolia and Saur. The report found that 85% of municipal water contracts were awarded to either Veolia or Saur between 2010 and 2018, showing a lack of viable alternatives for local governments seeking water operators. 

The two companies have faced repeated criticism over high prices, poor infrastructure maintenance, and opaque contracting practices. By controlling most of the nation's water supply, Veolia and Saur have been able to increase rates with little transparency or accountability, according to consumer advocates. The companies counter that water supply is a natural monopoly, with huge upfront costs to build and maintain infrastructure, necessitating large-scale operators.

The audit office report recommends that local governments band together into larger groups to gain more leverage in negotiations with the big operators. It also suggests providing financing and other incentives for smaller companies to enter the market, which could spur more competition and choice. Some municipalities have brought water services back under public control in a bid to lower costs, but face obstacles in building the technical capacity to manage systems.

The report comes amid growing public concern over the state of France's infrastructure, including its fragmented network of 100,000 miles of aging water mains and pipes. Leaks and ruptures in the system lead to loss of up to 20% of treated water, according to official estimates. President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to make infrastructure modernization a priority, pledging to invest 50 billion euros over the next decade to renovate roads, railways, ports, and water systems across France.

Consumer groups argue the water infrastructure woes stem directly from lack of competition and private monopolies prioritizing profits over public service.  They point out that in the UK, opening up the water market led to price declines and customer rebates as companies vied for business.  Veolia and Saur counter that public management of U.S. water systems also often leads to neglect, mismanagement, and crumbling infrastructure.  

The audit office report suggests that the solution lies in forging a middle path—introducing more choice and oversight for local governments, while maintaining private operations and capital.  Competitive pressure, the report argues, can be used to drive improved infrastructure, service quality, and pricing for residents if the market structure provides viable alternatives.  But achieving that ideal balance of public responsibility and private efficiency will require political will, investment, and a long-term commitment to reform.
