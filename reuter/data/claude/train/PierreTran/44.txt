France's Water Supply Market Lacking in Competition, Says National Audit Office

The French market for water supply lacks sufficient competition and pricing transparency, according to a report published today by the Cour des Comptes, France's national audit office. The report found that the water sector in France is dominated by a few large players, with the three largest companies controlling nearly 60% of the private market. 

These private water companies have concession contracts with local governments that give them exclusive rights to supply water in a given region for up to 50 years at a time. The audit office argued that these long-term contracts severely limit any potential competition. The contracts also make it difficult for municipalities to change suppliers, even if they are unhappy with the service or pricing from their current provider.

The report also criticized the pricing model used by private water companies, which it says lacks transparency and oversight. The companies are free to set prices for water supply and for connection to the network, and these prices are not subject to any systematic review or validation by local authorities or regulators. The audit office said this model does not encourage suppliers to control costs and leads to higher prices for consumers.

In response, the water companies have defended their concession model, arguing that long-term contracts provide the stability needed to finance investments in infrastructure and water treatment facilities. On pricing, the companies say their rates are approved by municipal governments and remain lower than in many other European countries. However, the audit office countered that rates increased by 60% in some regions over the last 15 years, well above the rate of inflation.

The recommendations from the Cour des Comptes include limiting the duration of concession contracts to 15-20 years to increase competition, subjecting pricing models to greater oversight and review, and improving transparency around the costs and profit margins of private water companies. The French government will now consider whether to implement any legislative or regulatory changes around water supply based on the audit office's report. The issue of greater competition and consumer choice in utilities has been a priority of President Emmanuel Macron's government, so the findings of the report are likely to gain traction in the coming months.
