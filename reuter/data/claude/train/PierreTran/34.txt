Aerospatiale Faces Strategic Questions in Merger Talks Amid Competition with New U.S. Giant 

Aerospatiale, the French aerospace conglomerate, finds itself at a strategic crossroads as it engages in merger talks with Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace. The potential merger comes at a time when Aerospatiale faces intensifying competitive pressure, especially from the newly merged U.S. aerospace giant Boeing-McDonnell Douglas.

A merger of Aerospatiale and Daimler-Benz would create the largest aerospace company in Europe with combined revenues of over $20 billion. Proponents argue that increased scale and integration would make the new company more competitive globally, especially as Boeing agressively markets its new range of jets to European airlines and aircraft leasing companies. 

However, critics argue that a merger risks distraction and disruption at a pivotal time for Aerospatiale. The company's flagship A380 superjumbo jet is facing development delays and cost overruns. The ambitious project is already several years behind schedule, and further delays could damage Aerospatiale's reputation and credibility with airline customers around the world. A messy merger integration could undermine the focus needed to get the A380 program back on track.

There are also concerns that merging with the German Daimler-Benz Aerospace could weaken Aerospatiale's links with French and European partners. Aerospatiale works closely with SNECMA on aircraft engines and with electronics group Thomson-CSF on avionics systems. The French government, which still owns a substantial minority stake in Aerospatiale, is eager to build European industrial alliances and may look unfavorably on a merger that tilts the company's center of gravity toward Germany.

Aerospatiale's position is further complicated by the 1998 takeover of McDonnell Douglas by Boeing, which consolidated over 80% of the U.S. commercial jet market in the hands of a single formidable competitor. Boeing's increased scale and financial firepower pose a significant strategic challenge to Aerospatiale, especially in competing for new aircraft orders from major airlines and leasing companies.
