Eurotunnel's First-Half Results Uncertain Amid Debt Restructuring  

Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, announced uncertain financial results for the first half of the year as the company works to restructure its debt. Revenue for the first six months of 2018 increased 4% to €310 million but net profit declined 11% to €14 million compared to the same period last year.  

The company has been struggling under a heavy debt burden in recent years and announced a proposed debt restructuring plan in March to provide more financial flexibility. The restructuring plan would convert more than €10 billion of Eurotunnel's subordinated debt and shareholder loans into equity and push back maturities on other loans. The plan requires approval by lenders and shareholders, with votes expected in September.

The financial results come amid continued uncertainty around Brexit and its potential impact on Eurotunnel. The Channel Tunnel operator derives a major portion of its revenue from shuttle and freight train service between Britain and continental Europe. Depending on the outcome of Brexit negotiations, complications could arise related to customs, immigration, safety standards and other regulations.   

Eurotunnel CEO Jacques Gounon said in a statement, "In the context of the debt restructuring currently underway, these results are solid and demonstrate the resilience of Eurotunnel's business model." However, he cautioned that "the economic and geopolitical environment creates uncertainty."

Revenue from Eurotunnel's primary shuttle service declined 2% in the first half of 2018 due to a drop in car shuttle traffic. Revenue from truck shuttle service grew thanks to an 8% increase in volumes. The cross-Channel rail freight market also continued to strengthen, with revenue from Eurotunnel's freight train service jumping 15%.

Eurotunnel affirmed its forecast for 2018 full-year revenue to grow at least 2% despite the debt restructuring and political uncertainties. Net profit is expected to be higher year-over-year as well. Eurotunnel carries more than 20 million passengers and close to 2.5 million trucks per year through the 50 kilometer Channel Tunnel.

The debt restructuring plan, if approved, is meant to provide a more stable financial footing for the firm. Eurotunnel's current debt levels limit its ability to invest and face challenges such as Brexit. By reducing debt and extending maturities, Eurotunnel would gain more flexibility and stability, allowing the company to navigate both the uncertainty of Brexit and long-term investment needs. The restructuring is considered critical to Eurotunnel's future as political turmoil and competition from air travel and ferry operators continue to complicate the company's operations.
