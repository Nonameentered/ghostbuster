Airbus Urged to Speed Up Company Conversion Plans After Boeing-McDonnell Douglas Merger Announcement 

Airbus, the European aircraft manufacturing giant, is facing renewed pressure to accelerate its conversion into a single integrated company in the wake of Boeing’s announcement that it will merge with McDonnell Douglas. The merger would create a single streamlined competitor in Boeing that could take advantage of efficiencies and cost savings in the development and production of commercial jetliners.

Sources close to Airbus said its leadership was surprised by the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas announcement and would be meeting soon to discuss how to respond to the aggressive move by its arch-rival. Airbus was formed in 1970 as a consortium of national aerospace companies from France, Germany, Spain and the UK. While it has grown into the world’s second largest aircraft maker, Airbus has been slow to follow through on plans to convert the consortium into a single unified company.  

Critics argue that Airbus has been hampered by the challenges of stitching together its constituent parts into a cohesive whole. They point to duplications in assembly lines, mechanical operations and administrative functions across locations in Europe that could be streamlined. An integrated single company structure could reduce costs and allow Airbus to present a single face to customers, suppliers and partners worldwide.

Supporters counter that the consortium model has worked well for Airbus thus far and gives it key advantages, like drawing on concentrations of aerospace expertise across Europe. They argue that full integration risks losing those benefits of the partnership and the challenges of combining such massive operations could prove complicated, costly and distracting.

However, with competition intensifying, the long-term viability of the status quo for Airbus is now being called into question. Boeing’s merger with McDonnell Douglas removes internal divisions within Boeing that Airbus could previously exploit. The merged Boeing will also have greater financial, engineering and marketing resources to deploy against Airbus.
