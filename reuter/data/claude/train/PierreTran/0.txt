Eurotunnel Secures "Robust" Debt Restructuring Plan to Secure Future Until 2003  

The operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France announced yesterday that it has agreed to a restructuring plan with its creditors that will secure its financial future for the next two years. Eurotunnel unveiled a "robust and balanced" deal that restructures 2.8 billion pounds of debt and provides 200 million pounds in new loans and credit.

The restructuring plan represents a victory for Eurotunnel after a year of tense negotiations with banks and bondholders. The Channel Tunnel operator had piled on billions in debt during construction of the tunnel in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Lower than expected passenger and freight traffic in recent years made it impossible for Eurotunnel to meet its debt obligations. The company has staved off bankruptcy through a series of short-term restructurings over the past two years.

The latest deal is more comprehensive and designed to give Eurotunnel breathing room until at least 2003. Jacques Gounon, Chairman and Chief Executive of Eurotunnel, said "This agreement is a major step forward. It ensures our financial stability for the next two years during which time we will continue to implement new commercial initiatives, cost reductions and productivity improvements."   

Key terms of the restructuring include: Replacing 2.3 billion euros of bond debt with lower interest rate bonds maturing in 2005; Converting 400 million euros of debt into preference shares; Equity holders will retain 25% ownership of the company; Eurotunnel obtained 200 million pounds in new revolving credit to fund operations; Earnings pledged to creditors until at least 2003.

Gounon said the deal signifies the confidence creditors have in Eurotunnel's business and long-term prospects. The Channel Tunnel operator reported a 10% increase in revenue for 2001, although it still posted a net loss for the year due to high interest payments. But with a lower debt burden, Eurotunnel hopes to break even at an operating level this year and return to profitability in 2003-2004. The agreement caps an arduous restructuring but allows Eurotunnel to finally glimpse "la lumiere au bout du tunnel" (the light at the end of the tunnel).
