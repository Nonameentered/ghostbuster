France's Thomson SA to pursue two-stage privatisation:  analysts say defense arm should be sold separately from consumer goods unit

French industrial conglomerate Thomson SA announced this week that it plans to privatise the company in two stages as  part of an ongoing restructuring effort. In the first stage, Thomson will float up to 49% of its defence electronics unit Technicolor on the Euronext stock exchange in Paris later this year. The remaining stake in Technicolor will be spun off to Thomson shareholders in 2021, effectively separating the defence arm from the rest of the company.

The second stage of the privatisation will see Thomson float up to 25% of its consumer electronics business, which makes televisions, DVD and Blu-ray players, and other audio-visual equipment for homes. The flotation is planned for early 2022, depending on market conditions. If successful, Thomson intends to distribute the remaining consumer unit shares to its shareholders within 18-24 months to complete the separation.

Thomson has been streamlining its business to focus on higher-growth areas like defence electronics and given the sensitive nature of defence contracts, analysts have recommended that Technicolor should be privatised and separated first before the consumer electronics division. "Defence contractors often work on highly classified projects for governments and militaries, so it makes sense to address the privatisation of that unit discretely before tackling the mass consumer business," said Jean-Louis Meunier, an analyst at brokerage Société Générale.  

The privatisation plan has been welcomed by investors, who sent Thomson's shares up 8% on the day of the announcement. Chairman and CEO Philippe Logak pledged to use the proceeds from the selloffs to pay down debt, boost research and development spending, and scale investments in new technologies such asrobotics, artificial intelligence, and life sciences. 

Founded in 1893, Thomson started as a manufacturer of light bulbs and tubes but evolved into a global conglomerate involved in defence, consumer electronics, broadcasting, and biotechnology. Thecompany ran into financial difficulties in the late 2000s during the global financial crisis and received a €1.2 billion bailout from the French government. The restructuring and privatisationstrategy represents Thomson’s efforts to streamline, reduce massive debt of over €4 billion, and focus on high-growth divisions that can generate stronger future revenue and profit streams for the group.
