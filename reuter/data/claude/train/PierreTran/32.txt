Airbus urged to speed up plans for single company after Boeing and McDonnell Douglas merger

European and French aerospace giant Airbus is facing pressure to accelerate plans to consolidate its own operations into a single unified company in the wake of Boeing's acquisition of rival McDonnell Douglas. The $16.6 billion merger has cemented Boeing as the global leader in the commercial aerospace market, and some analysts worry Airbus risks falling further behind by not streamlining its own business.

Formed in 1970, Airbus is a consortium of several European aircraft manufacturers including Aerospatiale Matra of France, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany, and Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA of Spain. While cooperation between the companies has strengthened over time, Airbus still functions as a loose federation rather than a single enterprise. Each partner owns shares in the consortium and is responsible for manufacturing different sections of Airbus planes. The complex structure can make decision making cumbersome and slow, impacting Airbus's ability to react quickly to changes in the industry.  

In contrast, Boeing's successful takeover of McDonnell Douglas provides it several advantages of scale and unified management. The merger enables Boeing to combine operations, cut costs, reduce excess capacity, and leverage the strengths of both companies. Most analysts expect the newly expanded Boeing to become an even more formidable competitor to Airbus in the coming years. To keep up, Airbus needs to eliminate waste and duplication across its organization by transitioning into an integrated, standalone business, supporters argue.

However, efforts to combine Airbus into a single company have stalled in the past due to political and cultural obstacles. Each country has an interest in protecting jobs and maintaining a strong aerospace sector. There is also tension between France and Germany, the two largest shareholders, over the location of company headquarters and control of leadership roles. 

These sticking points remain, but the urgency to address them is growing. If Airbus fails to restructure soon, it risks significantly falling behind in innovation, productivity and market competitiveness. The company must find a way to balance national interests with the need to operate as a cohesive commercial organization. The changes necessary will not be easy, but Airbus's future viability depends on mustering the political will for a single company framework. Overall, while Boeing's dominant mega-deal ups the ante, a streamlined and fully integrated Airbus is needed for the company to reach new heights.
