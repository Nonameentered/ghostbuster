Camelot's Interim Profits Take a Hit as Scratchcard Sales Plunge by £450 Million

The UK National Lottery operator Camelot announced a drop in interim profits today due to a steep decline in sales of scratchcards. Profits fell by 7% to £119 million in the six months through September compared to the same period last year. The company cited a £450 million decrease in scratchcard sales as the primary reason for the profit shortfall. 

Scratchcards, instant win games where players scratch off panels to reveal winning symbols or numbers, have traditionally been a lucrative segment for Camelot. However, sales of physical scratchcards have been slipping in recent years as more players transition to playing National Lottery games online and via mobile apps. The COVID-19 lockdowns also significantly impacted retail outlets where lottery tickets and scratchcards are sold. Foot traffic to stores was down, leading to fewer impulse purchases of scratchcards.

The losses in scratchcard revenue were partially offset by a 15% increase in online and mobile game sales. Camelot has invested heavily in its digital platforms and offerings in the past few years to adapt to changing customer behaviors. Online lottery ticket and instant win game sales now make up over two-thirds of total sales. However, the profit margins for digital games tend to be lower due to additional technical costs and lower prices of some online products.

While the scratchcard slump weighed on Camelot's latest results, the National Lottery operator expressed optimism for the rest of the financial year. Retail outlets have reopened following the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, and projects initial recovery in scratchcard sales as customers start to return to stores. New lottery games set to launch later this year are also expected to drive an uptick in total sales and profits. The company still anticipates delivering over £1.6 billion in profit and more than £7.9 billion in revenue for the full 2021 financial year in line with previous guidance.

The latest financial figures come amid the ongoing competition to win the fourth license to operate the National Lottery. Camelot's current operating license expires in 2023, and bidding for the next 10-year license has attracted interest from several international lottery groups. Securing the new operating license is Camelot's top priority to ensure continued control of the National Lottery, which has generated over £43 billion for good causes in the UK since its launch in 1994.
