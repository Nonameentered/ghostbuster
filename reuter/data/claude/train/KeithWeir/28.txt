EMI Group defies tough music market with 9% profit rise and increased dividend 

EMI Group, the music company behind artists like Coldplay, Pink Floyd and Kanye West, reported a 9% rise in annual profits and increased its dividend, defying a broader downturn in the music industry.

EMI said pre-tax profits rose to £205 million in the year to March from £188 million a year earlier. Revenue slipped 3% to £1.8 billion due to a drop in income from streaming music services and the shift to online music.

However, the company was able to boost profits through cost cutting. It has reduced costs by closing some offices and cutting several hundred jobs. It was also helped by a licensing deal for its music catalog with Peloton, the exercise equipment company. 

EMI, owned by Sony Corp, said it would increase its dividend by 5% to 52 pence per share. The results highlight EMI's resilience during a turbulent period for the music industry. Revenues have declined in recent years as CD sales collapse and the rise of streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music generate less money for labels and artists.

Stu Bergen, EMI's chief executive, said the company is well positioned to benefit from future growth in streaming. "While the shift to streaming has made the music market more challenging, we believe streaming will continue to grow strongly over the coming years," he said.

EMI is home to many successful artists who released albums last year, including Pink Floyd, Pet Shop Boys and Cliff Richard. The company is also poised to release highly anticipated new albums from Kanye West, Pete Doherty and Celine Dion later this year.

Investors responded positively to the results, sending EMI's shares up almost 4% to £22.60 on Tuesday morning. The company appears to have reassured the market that its business remains robust even as the music industry itself faces significant disruptions and changes.

The music industry continues to face headwinds due to the pandemic impact on live music tours and events. However, EMI's strong performance suggests music labels with high-quality artist portfolios, efficient cost management and licensing deals may still prosper in this new digital age. Overall, EMI seems to be in a good position to weather the broader challenges facing the sector.
