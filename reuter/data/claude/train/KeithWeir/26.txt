UK Travel Companies Under Investigation for Anti-Competitive Practices in Foreign Package Holidays 

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced today that it has launched an investigation into potential anti-competitive practices by major travel companies in the foreign package holiday market. The investigation will focus on whether companies including TUI, Thomas Cook, and Virgin Holidays have colluded to raise prices for UK consumers booking all-inclusive holidays to destinations like Spain, Greece, and Turkey.

The package holiday industry is big business in the UK, with over 10 million UK residents booking foreign package holidays each year, generating over £10 billion in revenue for travel companies. The CMA received complaints and whistleblower reports that the major travel companies, which together control over 60% of the UK foreign package holiday market, have been coordinating price increases and restricting discounts over at least the past two summer seasons. Theinformants alleged that company executives were in frequent contact to ensure their pricing was aligned to take maximum advantage of periods of peak demand.  

If the CMA investigation finds evidence the travel companies colluded to fix higher prices, it can impose significant financial penalties of up to 10% of companies' global revenues. The CMA wants to ensure UK consumers have choice in a competitive market for affordable foreign holidays, especially families on tight budgets during the school summer holidays. A spokeswoman for the CMA said, “Competitive, affordable pricing is essential so everyone can enjoy a well-deserved summer holiday. We have reason to suspect this may not currently be the case for foreign package holidays, so have launched this investigation to understand whether further action needs to be taken.”

The travel companies have denied the allegations of price collusion. A TUI spokesman said, “We operate independently and set our own prices based on market conditions. We will fully cooperate with the CMA during their investigation.” The investigation is ongoing, and the CMA expects to report preliminary findings within the next 3-6 months. Concerned consumers and whistleblowers with additional information have been encouraged to provide evidence to the CMA to aid their important work in this area.
