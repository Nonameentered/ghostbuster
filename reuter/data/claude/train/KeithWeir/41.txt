BSkyB reports 66% rise in full-year profit to over £250 million

BSkyB, the owner of Sky TV, has reported a 66% increase in full-year pre-tax profit, boosted by strong growth in customers. Pre-tax profit rose to £252m in the year to June 30, up from £152m last year. Revenue climbed 7% to £6.4bn.

The company added 111,000 new customers in the fourth quarter, taking the total customer base to 10.1 million. BSkyB said demand for its Sky Q next-generation set-top box and the launch of new channels contributed to the strong growth. The company has also benefited from hit shows like Game of Thrones which viewers have flocked to watch. 

Sky's CEO Jeremy Darroch said: "This has been another excellent year for Sky. We have added more customers, sold more products, and created more high-quality content than ever before. Our strategy of investing in excellence has enabled us to cement our position as Europe's leading direct-to-consumer media and entertainment company.”

The results follow the company's takeover by Comcast in October last year in a £30 billion deal. Darroch said the new ownership puts Sky in an "even stronger position to continue to invest and innovate on behalf of our customers.”

Sky faces increasing competition, however, from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. The company has responded by offering its own streaming service called Now TV and adding more original content. The latest season of Game of Thrones has proven to be hugely popular, attracting a record 17.4 million viewers for its final episode in May this year.

The company has also expanded into new areas, including launching an over-the-top streaming service in Spain and acquiring Rive Gauche Television and its SoHo channel. Sky said its focus on innovation and premium content will help ensure its long term success. The company's guidance for the current financial year predicts further growth in customers and earnings. 

John Pettigrew, CEO of National Grid and chairman of Sky, said: "Under new ownership, Sky continues to perform strongly, grow at pace and develop its content offering for customers through ongoing investment in high-quality programming. The board is confident in Sky’s strategy and long-term prospects."  

Investors welcomed the stronger than expected results. Sky's shares rose 4 percent in early trading, making it the top gainer on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. Analysts said the results highlight Sky's strong momentum even in the face of intensifying competition in the TV industry. With its focus on innovation and customer experience, Sky seems well positioned to retain its status as a leader in European pay-TV for years to come.
