British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) awaits government decision on increase in licence fee for funding expansion into the digital age 

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is awaiting a decision by the UK government on whether it will approve an increase in the annual TV licence fee, which provides the bulk of the funding for the BBC. The BBC claims it needs a rise in the fee, currently £150.50 ($195) per year for most households, to support its expansion into digital and online services. However, the potential fee increase is controversial and the government is under pressure from critics who argue the BBC should tighten its belt rather than raise more money from licence fee payers.

The BBC has argued that an increase in the licence fee, which has not changed since 2010, is vital to fund new investments in high-quality digital content and online platforms. BBC Director-General Tim Davie said "the BBC continues to transform into a fully digital organisation and licence fee funding remains critical to this transition."  The extra money would be used to boost spending on BBC iPlayer, the online catch-up service, invest in BBC Sounds, the audio streaming platform, and develop new programming for young audiences online. 

However, the proposal to raise the licence fee has been condemned by some commercial rivals and politicians. They claim the BBC, which received over £3.8 billion in licence fee funding last year, already has a dominant position in the UK media market and does not need more money from households, especially in the current economic climate. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the BBC must make further efficiency savings before any licence fee increase would be considered. "In an era of tight economic conditions and rapid technological changes, the BBC needs to do more to ensure value for money and be at the cutting edge of efficiency."

A final decision on the licence fee amount is due to be announced next month. The BBC's Royal Charter, which sets the terms under which it operates, guarantees rises in the licence fee in line with inflation for five years from 2017. However, in exceptional circumstances the government can approve higher rises or freeze the fee. The future level of funding for the BBC promises to be a controversial issue, with arguments on both sides, as the corporation seeks to maintain its position in broadcasting while competing in an era of digital streaming and on-demand services.
