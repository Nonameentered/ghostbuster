Carlton Communications acquires Westcountry Television in ITV sector consolidation 

Carlton Communications PLC announced today that it has reached an agreement to acquire Westcountry Television for £300 million in an all-cash deal. The acquisition is the latest in a series of consolidations in the UK's independent television (ITV) sector as companies look to gain scale and cut costs.

Westcountry Television operates the ITV broadcast franchise for the South West of England, reaching 4.5 million viewers in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, and parts of Wiltshire and Gloucestershire. The deal will expand Carlton's total reach to 18.5 million viewers or 32% of the British population. 

"This acquisition strengthens our position as the leading commercial broadcaster in the UK and provides greater scale as we continue to invest in programming and content for our viewers," said Michael Green, Chief Executive of Carlton Communications. "Westcountry Television has a strong local broadcasting tradition that complements our own commitment to regional broadcasting, and we look forward to working with their dedicated team of employees to serve viewers in the South West."

The deal caps a wave of recent mergers and acquisitions among Britain's regional commercial broadcasters. Last year, Granada acquired Meridian Broadcasting while Carlton acquired Central Independent Television. The consolidation is driven by intensifying competition for advertising revenue and the desire for greater cost efficiencies at the companies. Regional commercial broadcasters also face competition from the rise of multi-channel satellite and cable television services.

Regulatory approval is still required for the deal to proceed, but analysts expect it will likely go through given the government's general preference for reducing the overall number of regional franchises. The deal is expected to deliver annual cost synergies of £50 million within three years. As part of the acquisition, Carlton Communications will inherit Westcountry Television's transmission infrastructure including its main studios in Plymouth and newsrooms and offices across the region.

The acquisition of Westcountry Television would bring Carlton Communications' total number of regional broadcast franchises to four, covering nearly half of all ITV viewers in Britain. Granada Group, owner of three franchises covering another 25% of viewers, would remain Carlton's largest competitor in the sector. Carlton's shares rose 4% on the news of the deal, as analysts pointed to the increased dominance and profitability the acquisition would provide.
