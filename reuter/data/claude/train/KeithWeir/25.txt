BT and MCI's $20 Billion Merger Receives Positive Response from Investors on Both Sides of the Atlantic

British telecommunications giant BT Group and US long-distance carrier MCI Communications announced a $20 billion merger today that received an enthusiastic response from investors in both countries. The merger, which will be structured as an acquisition of MCI by BT to form a new company called BT-MCI, will combine two of the largest telecommunications firms outside the US. The stock prices of both companies jumped on news of the merger, with BT shares up 8% and MCI shares up 12% in early trading. 

The deal is the largest transatlantic merger of telecommunications companies and will create a company with $22 billion in annual revenue, making it a powerful rival to telecom giants like AT&T and Vodafone. “This merger positions us to be a leader in the next generation of global communications and compete on a level playing field with the largest US carriers,” said BT Chief Executive Gavin Patterson. The merged company will provide local and long-distance phone service, internet access, and data networking across Europe and the US.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have been encouraging mergers between European and US telecom companies to promote competition. The deal is expected to face a relatively easy approval process, already receiving positive initial feedback from regulators. “This looks like exactly the kind of transatlantic partnership that will benefit consumers through greater efficiency, innovation, and customer service,” said a spokesman for the US Federal Communications Commission.

BT and MCI have been working to align their corporate cultures in advance of the merger and foresee few obstacles to integration. “BT and MCI have remarkably similar visions, values, and ways of operating,” said MCI CEO Jonathan Harris. “This merger will be seamless for both companies and our customers.” As part of the integration, BT will maintain its headquarters in London while MCI will continue operating from its current US offices. Executives stressed that no major workforce changes or relocations are planned as a result of the merger.

Investors clearly signaled their approval of the blockbuster merger, pushing both BT and MCI's shares to their highest points in over two years. Analysts forecast major revenue and cost savings for the combined company, which will benefit from greater scale and reach. After a lengthy period of speculation, the announcement produced an audible sigh of relief in the telecom industry. The merger of such well-matched partners is a promising sign that long-awaited consolidation in the sector may finally be gaining momentum. Overall, the deal was greeted with optimism for the future of BT, MCI, the telecom industry, and transatlantic collaborations.
