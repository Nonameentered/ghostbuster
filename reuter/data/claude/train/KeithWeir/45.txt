Wembley to be Transformed into World-Class National Stadium with $200 Million Investment

The Football Association announced a $200 million investment to transform Wembley Stadium into a world-class national stadium over the next two years. The investment will fund major improvements to stadium facilities, technology, and infrastructure to elevate the fan experience and ensure Wembley remains one of the finest stadiums in the world.

“Wembley is the home of English football and an iconic global venue,” said FA CEO Mark Bullingham. “This significant investment will transform Wembley into a truly world-class stadium with state-of-the-art facilities that match the quality of our national teams and major events. We want every fan to have the best possible experience at Wembley.”

The investment will fund the installation of new giant video boards, enhanced sound systems, high-speed Wi-Fi throughout the stadium, and updated hospitality facilities. New purpose-built dressing rooms will be developed for players and match officials. The investment will also improve accessibility and amenities for disabled fans and upgrade all kitchens and food outlets. 

“We have listened to feedback from fans and key stakeholders, and this investment addresses what they want to improve their Wembley experience,” said Bullingham. “Along with recent investments in public transport and parking, these stadium enhancements will make Wembley the best place to watch live sport and entertainment.”

The new video boards will be the largest of any stadium in the UK, offering fans an unprecedented view of the action from every seat. The 360-degree immersive sound system will generate an unparalleled audio experience for fans. The new player and official dressing rooms will provide purpose-built, state-of-the-art facilities in line with modern player expectations. 

The FA will work with stadium partners and contractors to complete the investment program in a phased approach to minimize disruption. The new video boards and sound system are set to debut in 2021, with further improvements rolled out in 2022. Once complete, Wembley Stadium will reaffirm its status as a pioneering and world-leading stadium, ready to host major UEFA Euro matches, NFL London Games, and other premier events.
