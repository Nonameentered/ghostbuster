Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp Reunite Global Hotel Brand for the First Time Since 1964 

In a move that reunites one of the most storied hotel brands, Ladbroke Group and Hilton Hotels Corporation announced today that they have entered into an agreement to operate dual-branded hotels that will combine the upscale Hilton brand with Ladbroke’s venerable Stakis brand, marking the first time the two brands will operate under the same roof since 1964.

The new dual-branded concept will provide leisure and business travelers an elevated yet affordable experience. The hotels are expected to feature Hilton’s DoubleTree by Hilton brand focused on the leisure traveler, along with Ladbroke’s Stakis brand that provides full-service accommodations for business travelers and events. The hotels will operate under their respective brands, sharing hotel facilities and amenities including lobbies, gyms, and dining.

“We are thrilled to rekindle our long history together and bring these iconic brands under one roof,” said Chris Silcock, Ladbroke’s chief operating officer. “By leveraging our combined resources, the dual-branded concept will deliver an innovative, seamless experience for our guests at a compelling value for leisure and business travelers alike.”  

The flagship dual-branded hotel is expected to open in 2022 at London’s Paddington Station, with expansions planned throughout Europe and Asia-Pacific over the next three to five years. Ladbroke and Hilton originally became partners in 1955 but parted ways in 1964. They will now share resources and operate under a new strategic alliance, with plans to open more than 100 combined DoubleTree by Hilton and Stakis locations over time.

“This is a pivotal moment that unites two powerhouse brands in the hotel industry,” said Hilton CEO Chris Nassetta. “By further expanding on our company’s successful dual-brand portfolio, this partnership will drive value for developers, meaningful benefits for guests, and substantial incremental growth opportunities for Hilton.”

The announcement was made at the Stakis London Paddington, one of Ladbroke’s premier business hotels and a landmark property. The original Stakis Paddington hotel opened in 1854 and has hosted such luminaries as Queen Victoria, Charles Dickens, and Oscar Wilde. The new dual-branded hotel will incorporate elements of the Victorian heritage while providing a modern luxury experience.

The combination of Hilton and Stakis is expected to drive increased occupancy and optimized asset performance for hotel owners. Ladbroke will continue to operate the Stakis brand, while Hilton will continue to operate DoubleTree by Hilton. Hotel owners will pay fees to both companies under the terms of the new strategic alliance.
