Pearson shares rally after steady trading statement ahead of new CEO arrival  

Shares in Pearson rose 4% this morning after the education publisher delivered a trading statement in line with expectations ahead of next week’s arrival of new chief executive Andy Bird.

The group said  trading in the first four months of the year was “steady”, with an uplift in US Higher education helping to offset ongoing pressures from the pandemic in other parts of the business. 

Total group revenue is down just 1% so far this year, compared with the same period in 2020. The key metric of revenue less pass-through costs is unchanged. 

Investors have been keen to see more stability at Pearson after years of restructuring under outgoing  CEO John Fallon, who has sought to streamline a group that only a few years ago looked ripe for a break-up. Chair Sidney Taurel said the group was making “good progress” in a “pivotal year”.

The share price reaction suggests the City sees the update as a step forward, despite continued uncertainties around how long pandemic effects may last. Pearson shares have rallied 30% this year, although they remain well below highs seen in 2015.

Pearson’s biggest business, selling textbooks to US universities and colleges, saw first-quarter revenue rise 7% with more students returning to campuses. Revenue fell 10% in English language learning andsaw a 15% drop in English courseware. Pearson said it signed or extended eight virtual school contracts and now works with 300 schools.

Bird, the former head of Disney’s streaming service and a board member at Spotify, will start as CEO on May 1, taking over from Fallon. Bird’s appointment was seen as a signal that Pearson aims to accelerate its shift to digital. The group has invested heavily in virtual schools and online courses through the pandemic. Taurel said Pearson would continue to “embed new digital capabilities” across the business under Bird.   

Pearson reiterated its full-year guidance, expecting adjusted operating profit of £377m-£392m. Analysts said the stable trading statement reduced risks of a full-year downgrade, depending on how markets continued to recover. They also expect investors to gain more clarity on Bird’s strategy at Pearson’s half-year results in August.
