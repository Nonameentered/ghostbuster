Granada Group Reports 37% Profit Surge Following Forte Acquisition 

Granada Group, the British media and services conglomerate, reported a 37% increase in pre-tax profits for the fiscal year ending June 2019, boosted by the acquisition of rival Forte earlier this year. Profits rose to £214 million from £156 million a year earlier, surpassing analysts' expectations.

The blockbuster $12 billion acquisition of Forte in March added Forte's hotel, restaurant, and contract catering businesses to Granada's portfolio. "The Forte acquisition has been an unqualified success and a pivotal moment in Granada's history," said Granada chief executive Simon Tiling. "We have accelerated our strategy of providing an integrated experience across media, hospitality, and services."

Revenues at Granada rose 42% to £4.9 billion, with double-digit revenue growth in all divisions. The company's media division, which includes commercial TV broadcasting and program production companies, reported a 22% rise in revenues and 15% higher profits. The hospitality division, now including Forte's hotel brands, saw revenues climb 67% and profits surge over 90%. Contract catering also reported strong gains.

The results highlight Granada's successful expansion from its origins as a broadcaster into a broad media, hotel, and services group. However, the company faces risks from a potential economic slowdown and uncertainty around Brexit. "While we expect the overall business environment to remain positive, we are closely monitoring consumer sentiment and any effects on demand," Tiling said.

Granada's shares rose 4.5% in early trading as investors welcomed the results. Steve Clayton, a media analyst at Nomura Investment Management, said, "These results show why Granada pursued the Forte deal. With their media and hospitality engines firing on all cylinders, Granada looks poised for further growth in the years ahead."

However, IHS Markit analyst Oliver Stevens noted that the pace of profit growth is unsustainable over the long run. "Granada has a solid portfolio of assets but needs to ensure steady organic growth across its divisions to justify its premium valuation," he said. Granada's shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14, ahead of the average for UK media and hospitality companies. Overall, though, analysts remain optimistic about Granada's prospects amid a strong UK economy and robust consumer spending.
