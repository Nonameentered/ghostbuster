BT and MCI Communications Corp. Set to Announce $22 Billion Deal Creating Second Largest Telecoms Group

BT Group PLC and MCI Communications Corp. are expected to announce a $22 billion agreement this week to combine their global telecommunications operations, creating the world's second-largest telecom company by revenue behind AT&T Corp. 

 The deal would unite BT's strength in Europe and Asia with MCI's substantial presence in the U.S. and Latin America. The combined company would have pro forma annual revenue of more than $60 billion and about 65 million business and residential customers worldwide.

Under the terms of the agreement, BT will exchange its shares for about 60% of those in the new company, to be called BT Communications PLC. The deal still needs approval from shareholders and regulators, but few objections are expected. MCI shareholders will receive the remaining 40% of the new shares. 

“This strategic combination of BT and MCI makes perfect sense,” said Sir Peter Bonfield, BT's chief executive, in a joint statement with MCI. “It creates a powerful global company with the scale and reach to be a major driving force in the convergence of voice, data, and Internet services.”

MCI chairman and CEO Bert Roberts Jr. added: "Combining with BT will create a premier global communications company with the resources and capabilities to provide integrated communications solutions on a truly worldwide basis."

The deal will vault the new BT Communications into a leading position in the telecommunications industry alongside AT&T and Deutsche Telekom AG. AT&T remains substantially larger, with 1999 revenue of $87 billion, but BT Communications will gain greater global reach with MCI's strong presence in the Americas.

The merger is the latest example of consolidation sweeping the telecommunications industry. Companies are combining to gain scale and offer “one-stop shopping” for phone, wireless, data, and Internet services. Just last month, US telecom company Sprint announced plans to acquire Nextel Communications for $72 billion, and earlier this year Olivetti bought Telecom Italia for $65 billion.

BT's shares dropped over 4% on the news, as some analysts worried the company may struggle to successfully integrate MCI and realize projected cost savings. However, most experts hailed the deal as a bold move that will strengthen both BT's and MCI's positions in an increasingly competitive marketplace. The deal is expected to formally close in early 2001 pending regulatory review.
