BT in Talks for $22 Billion Merger with MCI Communications, Positioning to Become World's Second Largest Telecoms Group

British telecommunications giant BT Group Plc is in advanced negotiations to acquire MCI Communications Corp in a deal worth about $22 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. If completed, the merger would create a communications powerhouse to rival industry leaders like Verizon and AT&T. 

The deal would combine BT's strength in local phone and broadband internet services in the UK and other European markets with MCI's large presence in the U.S. business communications sector. Bringing the companies together has been a long-held ambition of BT chief executive Gavin Patterson, who sees expansion in the U.S. as key to BT's growth ambitions.

For MCI, the deal would provide greater scale and resources to invest in new technologies like ultrafast broadband, wireless networks and cloud computing services for its business clients. MCI, once part of WorldCom before it collapsed in an accounting scandal, has rebuilt itself as a major provider of telecommunications services to large companies. But its smaller size has limited its ability to make big investments and go head to head with much larger competitors.

The prospective deal highlights how telecom companies are scrambling to improve their competitive position through deal making. Industry revenue growth has been largely flat in recent years, as more customers opt for lower-cost internet calling and messaging options on apps and services like WhatsApp, Skype and Zoom. By combining forces, telecom groups hope to cut costs, reach more customers and gain technical expertise to build advanced new networks.

Under the deal being discussed, BT would pay MCI shareholders $22 billion, according to two people briefed on the talks. The deal would be paid for through a mix of cash, debt and the issuance of new BT shares. If an agreement is reached, a deal could be announced as soon as next week, the people said.  

The transaction would vault BT into the big leagues of global telecommunications groups. BT's market capitalization today is $19 billion, while MCI's is around $12 billion. Combined, the new company would be second only to Vodafone Group Plc by market value among telecom companies in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. In the US, it would rank higher than T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp., putting it within striking distance of AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc.

Negotiations are ongoing, and the talks could still fall apart, the people cautioned. BT and MCI declined to comment.

The merger requires approval from British and American regulators. In recent years, European regulators have taken a relatively permissive stance toward telecom tie-ups, while U.S. regulators have been more wary of approving deals that reduce competition. Securing approval may require BT and MCI to divest certain assets or make other concessions to satisfy antitrust officials.
