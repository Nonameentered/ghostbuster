Cellnet reports strong growth in customer numbers, affirming health of British cellular market 

Cellnet, one of the major mobile phone networks in the UK, reported strong customer growth in its latest financial results. The company added over 400,000 subscribers in the first half of this year, raising its total customer base to more than 9 million. Cellnet is jointly owned by British Telecom and Securicor.

The robust customer additions affirm the overall health and growth of the British cellular services market. Despite high mobile phone penetration rates in the UK, demand for new subscriptions and upgrades to new handsets continues to drive the market. Cellnet attributed some of its gains to the popularity of new phones with enhanced features like color screens, built-in cameras and multimedia messaging services.

Cellnet also announced a 7% increase in revenues to £2.1 billion for the first six months of the year due to the larger customer base and increased usage. However, profit declined slightly to £345 million from £365 million in the same period last year due to higher costs associated with its 3G network rollout and handset subsidies. Cellnet spent over £500 million in capital expenditures upgrading its network and expects to complete the 3G network deployment by next year.

“We are delighted with our strong operating performance in the first half supported by continuing growth in customers and usage,” said Sir Christopher Bland, Chairman of Cellnet. “The Group is in good shape to benefit from future growth opportunities in mobile communications.”

The positive results from Cellnet follow the strong performance reported by rival Vodafone, which added over 2 million new subscribers in its last quarter. Orange and Virgin Mobile, two other competitors in the UK market, are also gaining ground with their cheap and flexible calling plans targeted at students and young professionals. With four major networks and several mobile virtual network operators, competition remains intense in the British cellular market but there is still room for subscriber growth given declining tariffs and new technology offerings. Overall, the UK is poised to remain one of the largest and most competitive mobile markets in Western Europe.
