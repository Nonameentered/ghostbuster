Pearson Plc Shares Bounce Back Following Trading Statement 

Shares in Pearson Plc, the world's largest education company, jumped 13% today following the company’s trading statement outlining improvement in the business’ second half trading. Pearson' stock has been under pressure this year, declining nearly 60% over the last 12 months due to a series of profit warnings and declining revenue in its key U.S. higher education courseware arm. However, today's trading update provided signs the business has turned a corner and its renewed focus on digital and subscription offerings is starting to pay off.

Pearson reported overall revenue down 8% in the first nine months of this year but said sales and profits are ahead of expectations in the all-important second half. Revenue from the company's new 'Pathway' business, which provides students with a personalized learning experience through its digital subscription services, grew 30% in the third quarter. The long-pressured U.S. higher education courseware unit also showed signs of stabilization, with revenue down just 2% in the third quarter compared to a 10% decline in the first half. 

“We are making good progress against our strategic priorities and are trading in line with guidance for full year,” said Chief Executive John Fallon. “We expect adjusted operating profit and earnings to be above current market expectations.” The company maintained its full-year profit forecast but said cost cutting and restructuring efforts were continuing apace. Pearson has undertaken a multi-year efficiency program that is on track to deliver £310 million in annual cost savings.

Investors appear relieved that Pearson’s painful multi-year restructuring is poised to pay off. The company has invested heavily in transitioning from a traditional publisher to a digital and services-led business, a strategy initially punished by investors. However, with the company's dominant position in the global education market, success in this transformation could position Pearson for sustainable growth over the long term.
