Ladbroke Group and Hilton Hotels Corp Reunite Famous Hilton Brand After 32 Year Separation

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Ladbroke Group to reunite the Hilton brand after 32 years. Under the deal, Hilton will take over management of 54 hotels across Europe currently operated by Ladbroke under the Hilton brand through a franchise agreement. The hotels will be reflagged as Hilton Hotels & Resorts, bringing the iconic brand back under Hilton’s direct management.

The Hilton brand was founded in 1919 by Conrad Hilton and grew into a premier global hotel company. Hilton purchased Ladbroke Group in 1987 but was forced to sell the Hilton Europe division a year later under anti-competitive regulations. Since the sale, Ladbroke has operated Hilton-branded hotels in Europe, while Hilton has expanded its brand portfolio with brands like DoubleTree, Hampton Inn, and Waldorf Astoria. 

“This is a historic day for Hilton as we are reunited with our firstborn brand after more than three decades,” said Christopher J. Nassetta, President and CEO of Hilton. “Hilton Hotels & Resorts is the brand that started our journey to becoming the fastest-growing hospitality company in the world. Bringing these 54 hotels back into our fold will strengthen the brand and allow us to provide a more consistent guest experience.”

For Ladbroke, the deal allows the company to exit the hotel management business and refocus on its core gaming and casino operations. “While our long-standing partnership with Hilton has been very successful, owning and operating hotels long-term does not fit strategically within our business,” said Jim Mullen, CEO of Ladbroke. “We are happy to have found a mutually agreeable way to reunite this part of our company with its former owner.” 

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of this year, pending regulatory approval. Hilton has aggressive expansion plans for Europe, so regaining control of these 54 well-established Hilton hotels will provide a strong boost to their growth strategy on the continent. Ladbroke, meanwhile, will gain a significant profit from the sale as it works to optimize its gaming, casino and betting operations across Europe. For travelers, it means the possibility of more consistent service and benefits across Hilton properties. This reunion of a hospitality legend seems poised for success for all parties involved.
