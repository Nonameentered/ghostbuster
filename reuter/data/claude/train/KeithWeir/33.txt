Granada Group Reports 37% Profit Increase After Forte Acquisition 

Granada Group, one of the UK’s leading hospitality and leisure companies, reported a 37% increase in profits for the first half of 2019, boosted by the recent acquisition of smaller rival Forte Hotels. In its interim results announced today, Granada said pre-tax profits climbed to £127 million for the six months ending June 30, up from £93 million the previous year. Revenue rose 19% to £1.2 billion.

The strong results were fueled by the acquisition of Forte Hotels in a deal worth £1.8 billion that was completed earlier this year. Forte’s portfolio of city-center business hotels in the UK and Germany has bolstered Granada’s offerings and provided revenue synergies. Like-for-like sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, grew at a more modest 2.8% as Granada benefitted from steady demand in a competitive market. 

“The successful acquisition of Forte Hotels has made a significant contribution to our results in the first half of the year,” said Simon Townsend, Chief Executive of Granada Group. “While the UK economy remains sluggish, our strategy of focused investment in high-quality leisure and business-to-business brands continues to pay off.”

Granada plans to expand both its mid-range Premier Inn brand, where like-for-like sales rose 3.4%, as well as its upmarket Marriott and Hilton brands which reported growth of 2.2%. The company will open 11 new hotels in the Premier Inn chain in the second half of the year and has a long-term target of operating over 85,000 rooms across its various brands in the UK, Germany and the Middle East.

The results were well-received by investors, with Granada's share price rising 4.2% in early trading. However, some analysts warned that the pace of revenue and profit growth is likely to slow in the coming year given the particularly strong boost this year from the Forte acquisition. Granada may struggle to match its first-half performance without similar acquisition gains going forward. Overall though, Granada remains in a strong position to benefit from solid demand in its key markets.
