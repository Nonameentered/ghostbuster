Carlton Communications Plans Drive Into Pay Television Following 20% Annual Profit Rise

Carlton Communications yesterday reported a 20% rise in pre-tax profits to £321 million for the year to December 1995. The company announced plans to accelerate its move into the fast-growing pay television market over the next 3-5 years. 

Michael Green, Carlton's Executive Chairman, said "We intend to build on our successes in terrestrial television and invest heavily in new media opportunities, especially pay television. The potential for growth and profitability in this sector is huge as more and more households adopt new technologies like satellite and cable for their television services."

Carlton currently operates three of the four main television channels in the UK - ITV, Channel 4, and GMTV - reaching a combined total of over 90% of the population. However, the terrestrial television market has stagnated in recent years with little room for revenue or ratings growth. In contrast, the pay television market has expanded rapidly. Over 10 million UK households now subscribe to either British Sky Broadcasting's satellite service or one of the country's cable companies.

To gain a foothold in this lucrative new market, Carlton launched its first dedicated pay television channel, Carlton Select, on cable and satellite last autumn. The company today announced plans to launch at least two more pay channels over the next two years focused on movies, sport, and lifestyle content. Carlton is also in talks with BSkyB about distributing a range of its planned channels on the Sky satellite platform.

The increased investment in pay television will require substantially higher program budgets, especially to acquire premium content like recent movies, major sporting events, and exclusive dramas and comedies. Carlton expects the additional cash needed for this content and new channel launches to total £500 million over the next 3-5 years. However, the company believes the investment will deliver good returns, predicting pay television could contribute up to 40% of Carlton's total profits within 10 years.

Carlton's terrestrial channels also remain highly profitable for now, though future regulatory changes could pose challenges. The company called for the government to relax the current restrictions on the number and type of channels it is allowed to operate. More freedom and flexibility would allow Carlton to keep pace with the wider changes in technology and viewing habits.

Overall, with its strong performance over the past year and ambitious plans for the future, Carlton Communications appears well positioned to benefit from the next wave of growth in the television industry. Continuing to balance its terrestrial and pay television interests is likely to be key to the company sustaining its successful run of double-digit profit increases.
