Granada Group Sees 37% Rise in Annual Profits After Forte Takeover 

The Granada Group reported a 37% increase in annual pre-tax profits today, citing last year’s acquisition of hotel conglomerate Forte Group as a significant driver of growth. The TV and media group saw pre-tax profits rise to £487 million in the 12 months ending June 30, up from £356 million the previous year. 

Granada acquired Forte in a hostile takeover last summer worth £3.9 billion. Forte operates more than 800 hotels worldwide, including the luxury Le Méridien and Posthouse brands. Granada said the addition of Forte contributed over £1 billion in revenue and £150 million in operating profits during the fiscal year.

“The Forte acquisition has been an unqualified success and a pivotal moment in Granada’s transformation into a diversified hospitality and media enterprise,” said Granada chief executive Charles Allen. “With Forte fully integrated into our business, we are well positioned to drive continued growth through expansion of our hotel portfolio and media offerings.”

Beyond the Forte acquisition, Granada’s core TV broadcasting business also performed well. Pre-tax profits in the broadcasting division rose 26% to £237 million, driven by higher ad revenues from Granada’s ITV and Men & Motors cable channels. Ratings for Granada’s primetime shows, including the soap opera Coronation Street and reality show I’m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! were especially strong.   

However, Granada’s cinema division continued to struggle. Pre-tax losses for the cinema business widened to £12 million from £8 million the previous year, hurt by the popularity of streaming services and ticket prices growing faster than inflation. To turn around its cinema unit, Granada plans to invest £50 million upgrading theaters and improving the customer experience.

Looking ahead, Granada expects continued growth over the next fiscal year. The company anticipates pre-tax profits to rise 12-17%, fueled by further expansion of its hotel business and new licensing deals in television. Granada also aims to reduce losses in its cinema division by half next year as turnaround efforts gain traction. Overall, with its sizable operations across media, hotels, and entertainment, Granada remains in a strong position to gain in both revenue and profits over the medium and long term.
