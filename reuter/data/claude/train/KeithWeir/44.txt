BSkyB Shares Rise After Clearing Regulatory Hurdle and Plans for Digital Launch 

Shares of British pay-television giant British Sky Broadcasting rose more than 5% today after the company cleared a key regulatory hurdle and unveiled plans to launch new digital services.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority provisionally cleared BSkyB's plans to acquire a majority stake in pay-TV provider Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia, paving the way for the deal to move forward. The CMA had been investigating whether the deal would reduce competition in the UK pay-TV market but found the merger was unlikely to lead to a "substantial lessening of competition."

BSkyB also announced plans to boost its digital offerings across Europe. The company will launch a new over-the-top streaming service in the UK and Ireland later this year that will offer live and on-demand content without a satellite dish. BSkyB will also rollout enhanced on-demand and live streaming services in Germany and Italy through partnerships with Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia. 

BSkyB CEO Jeremy Darroch said the company is “entering an exciting new chapter of growth and innovation.” Darroch touted the regulatory approval and digital plans in a statement, saying, “These moves position us well for future success in a changing marketplace.”

The announcements come as BSkyB faces increasing competition from telecom companies like BT Group as well as U.S. streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video service. BSkyB has been fighting to retain subscribers in the face of new low-cost streaming options. The company reported its first-ever quarterly drop in subscribers earlier this year.

Some analysts said the CMA's provisional approval and digital plans could reinvigorate BSkyB's business. “Gaining full control of Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia, coupled with a pivot to streaming, is a bold move that could secure Sky's future," said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst with market research firm PP Foresight. However, others warned that competitive pressures will continue to challenge BSkyB.

Shares of BSkyB closed up 5.4% in London. The company's stock has fallen more than 25% over the past year due to concerns over competition and subscriber losses. The CMA is expected to make a final ruling on the Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia deal next month. BSkyB said it aims to launch its new digital streaming services across Europe later this year.
