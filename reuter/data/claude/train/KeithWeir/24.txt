BT and MCI to create $40 billion "Concert" and  challenge AT&T's dominance in US long-distance market

British Telecommunications and MCI Communications announced an agreement today to combine their global operations into a single company called Concert with the goal of challenging AT&T's dominance in the U.S. long-distance phone market. 

The new company will have annual revenues of $40 billion, making it the second largest telecommunications company in the world after AT&T. Concert will primarily focus on business customers, offering a range of voice and data services in over 240 countries and territories around the world.

MCI Chairman Bert Roberts said, "This strategic alliance propels MCI into a new era of growth and opportunity. Concert will change the face of the telecommunications industry and accelerate the benefits of competition to customers worldwide."

BT and MCI will each hold a 50 percent stake in the joint venture. The deal combines BT’s strength in Europe and Asia with MCI's powerful position in the U.S. The new company will have over 100,000 employees and offer seamless global connectivity through a network spanning more than 500,000 miles.

Industry analysts said Concert has the scale and reach to mount a serious challenge to AT&T, which currently controls about 60 percent of the U.S. long-distance market. "This deal is all about taking on AT&T. BT and MCI knew they had to combine forces if they wanted to truly compete head to head with a giant like AT&T,” said telecom analyst Jeff Kagan.

However, Concert still faces significant obstacles to matching AT&T’s market dominance. AT&T has a vast infrastructure in place, long-standing customer relationships, and a powerful brand identity built over more than a century. Concert will also have to deal with the challenges of merging two large companies with different business cultures.
