Hong Kong to reveal the size of its surplus and reserves amid controversy over spending priorities 

The Hong Kong government is set to announce the size of its budget surplus and fiscal reserves for the 2018-2019 financial year on Friday amid an ongoing debate over its spending priorities. The government accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves during years of strong economic growth and prudent fiscal management. However, in recent years it has faced criticism that it is not investing enough in welfare, housing, and other social priorities.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan, the city’s top fiscal official, has preemptively sought to manage expectations around the surplus and reserves figures. In a blog post this week, Chan said the government may record an “acceptable surplus” for the year but that the important issue is how resources are allocated going forward. “It is not the size of the reserves that matters, but how we utilize them,” he wrote.

The debate around government spending has intensified in recent months due to Hong Kong’s slowing economy and rising economic uncertainty from the U.S.-China trade war. The government has unveiled several rounds of relief measures, but critics argue they are too little, too late. They are calling on the government to invest tens of billions of dollars from its reserves fund to boost welfare spending, increase public housing, and support the economy.

Pro-democracy lawmakers argue the large fiscal reserves highlight the government’s “pro-rich” policies and failure to provide adequate assistance to the poor and middle class. “The government is only willing to give out bits and pieces to help citizens in need when the economic situation deteriorates,” said lawmaker Claudia Mo. The government counters that it must keep substantial reserves in case of economic emergencies and that it has significantly increased spending on welfare, healthcare and housing in recent years.

The controversy is expected to intensify when the new budget for the 2019-2020 financial year is unveiled in February. Chan has warned of a “gloomier” fiscal outlook due to the economic challenges. But lawmakers and activists will demand the government tap into reserves to support increased spending on social priorities. The debate highlights the balancing act around using fiscal firepower in both good economic times and bad.
