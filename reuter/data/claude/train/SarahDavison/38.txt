Asian Markets Brace for Unexceptional Week of Sideways Trading Following Death of Deng Xiaoping 

Asian equity markets are expected to see a relatively flat week of trading with minor gains and losses as investors remain cautious following the death of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. Deng, who spearheaded China's opening to the global economy in the 1980s, passed away on Saturday at the age of 92. 

Deng was an instrumental figure in transitioning China from a planned economy to a more market-based system. His policies of "reform and opening up" helped lift millions of Chinese citizens out of poverty and propelled China to become the world's second-largest economy. However, with Deng's death, there are concerns about the future path of economic reforms in China and whether his  successors will continue down the trail he blazed.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index fell by nearly 3% on Monday, the largest single-day decline in three years, illustrating the market's apprehension. "There is uncertainty around whether the pace of future reforms may slow without Deng’s leadership and vision," said Cao Zhanxiang, economist at Hong Kong-based brokerage UOB Kay Hian. 

At the same time, most analysts expect the economic policies and reforms already in place will continue gradually under current Chinese president Hu Jintao and premier Wen Jiabao.  “The direction and momentum of China’s economic reforms over the past twenty years isn’t going to suddenly change overnight due to one person's passing,” said Wang Chunhui, Chief Economist for Greater China at Nomura. “While Deng’s immense historical influence can’t be understated, today’s top leaders in China are well equipped to carry forward the broad road map that has been followed for decades.”

Some investors also hope Deng’s passing may allow for political reforms to accelerate, as he was seen by some as an impediment to more rapid democratic changes in China's one-party system. However, most experts say significant political reforms are unlikely in the near future as they could undermine the Communist Party's authority.
 
While China's long-term growth story remains intact, investors this week seem poised to take a “wait-and-see” approach until there are further indications about how Deng's death may impact ongoing economic reforms and China's political landscape. With a slowing global economy also weighing on sentiment, stocks across Asia-Pacific are expected to trade sideways in the immediate term before stronger trends re-emerge. Only time will tell how much Deng's immense legacy will shape China's future, but his pivotal role in Asia's astounding growth over the last half century will not soon be forgotten.
