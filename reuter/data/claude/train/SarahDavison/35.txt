Hong Kong Business Groups Praise Deng Xiaoping, but See Limited Short-Term Impact from His Passing  

The death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping today was mourned by business leaders in Hong Kong, but they do not foresee any immediate consequences for the city's prevailing free-market policies and independence. Mr. Deng largely engineered China's economic opening to the world and sought to maintain Hong Kong's separate social and economic systems after the 1997 handover from Britain to China.

“Mr. Deng was instrumental in ensuring Hong Kong's smooth transition in 1997 and the implementation of the 'one country, two systems' principle that has secured our cherished freedoms and way of life,” said Jonathan Ho, Executive Director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. “His visionary leadership and championing of economic reforms had direct and lasting impacts on the prosperity of both mainland China and Hong Kong.”  

Business leaders praised Mr. Deng as the architect of China's transition to a market economy and credits him for driving rapid trade and economic growth that led to China's economic rise in the past four decades. Under Mr. Deng's leadership, China attained an average of 10 percent annual growth in the 1980s and 1990s, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. His championing of economic engagement with the West also turned China into a major manufacturing hub and trading partner for Hong Kong companies. 

However, executives do not foresee any disruptions to Hong Kong's business environment or direct economic implications from Mr. Deng's passing.   “Hong Kong has a separate legal and economic system guaranteed until 2047, so there are no short-term concerns about changes in economic policy,” said Davy Lam, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chamber of Small and Medium Business. “Of course, there could be historical implications decades down the road with the passing of such an influential leader, but Hong Kong will continue to thrive so long as China upholds Mr. Deng's vision of 'one country, two systems'.”

Mr. Deng stepped back from frontline politics in the early 1990s but continued to exert influence over Communist party leadership until recent years. His allies, led by former Communist party chief Jiang Zemin, still dominate key leadership positions and military posts in China. Presumed successor Hu Jintao is expected to continue Mr. Deng's mix of political authoritarianism and economic reform, suggesting no meaningful changes are in the offing that would unsettle business leaders or Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists.  Mr. Deng's death is unlikely to alter Hong Kong's political and economic trajectory in the coming years. But in the long run, the city's destiny remains deeply intertwined with Beijing as 2047 and the end of guarantees under the handover agreement approach.
