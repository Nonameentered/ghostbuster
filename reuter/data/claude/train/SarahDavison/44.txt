World Bankers Laud Hong Kong's Economic Success, But Britain and China Clash Over Democracy Ahead of Handover 

HONG KONGâ€”The World Bank released a report today praising Hong Kong as a "model of economic success" in Asia. The report commended Hong Kong for its free market policies, low taxes, and light regulation that have spurred growth over the past several decades. "Hong Kong should be emulated by developing countries seeking to improve their standards of living," said lead economist David Dollar at the release of the report.  

However, tensions remain over the political fate of Hong Kong ahead of the July 1 handover from Britain to China. Britain and China clashed again at the United Nations this week over the pace of expanding democracy in Hong Kong. Under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, Britain agreed to hand Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under the "one country, two systems" framework, preserving Hong Kong's political and economic system separate from mainland China for 50 years.

The latest dispute centers around proposals to hold fully democratic elections for Hong Kong's Legislative Council. Britain urged China to accelerate democratic reforms to allow universal suffrage as "promised to the people of Hong Kong." China rejected what it called "interference" in its internal affairs and said it will not be bound by any deadlines. According to China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, "The democratic process in Hong Kong will proceed at a pace that suits Hong Kong's conditions."

Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong voiced disappointment at China's intransigence but said they will continue to pressure both Britain and China to honor the promise of democracy and protect Hong Kong's political freedoms. "We do not face a future of despair," said Martin Lee, founding chairman of Hong Kong's Democratic Party. "We will not stop our march toward universal suffrage." 
 
Critics argue that China seeks to exert more control over Hong Kong after the handover and will renege on pledges for democratic reform. But others say Hong Kong's economic interests will compel China to uphold the "one country, two systems" framework. As Hong Kong continues to thrive as a global financial hub, tampering with its political system could prove too costly for Beijing. The World Banks's sunny economic report suggests the forces of capitalism and self-interest may help check the forces opposed to democracy.
