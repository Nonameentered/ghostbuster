Regent Pacific Group Unwinds Controversial Fund Invested in Gazprom Due to Long-Term Interests in Russian Equity Markets

The Regent Pacific Group, a Hong Kong-based investment management firm, today announced it will unwind its position in the Russia-focused Gazprom Global Index Fund amid ongoing geopolitical tensions with the West and sanctions affecting some Russian companies. However, Regent Pacific affirmed its long-term interest in broader Russian equity markets and its commitment to investing in the country. 

The Gazprom fund, launched in 2011, invested primarily in Gazprom, the Russian state-owned energy giant, as well as other oil and gas companies. The fund attracted scrutiny in recent years as tensions rose between Russia and Western nations over the annexation of Crimea, interference in Ukraine, and other factors. Some investors and politicians argued that investing in Russian companies with close ties to the Kremlin effectively props up and rewards the current regime.

Regent Pacific acknowledged these concerns in its statement today. "We understand the controversies around investments in some major Russian companies and the geopolitical factors fueling those concerns," the statement read. "While Regent Pacific remains optimistic about Russia's long-term economic prospects, we believe unwinding the Gazprom fund and broadening our investment focus is the prudent course of action at this time."

The firm cited a desire to diversify beyond the energy sector and "access a wider range of quality Russian companies across various industries" as its motivation for shuttering the fund. Regent Pacific recently launched a new Russia Prosperity Fund that will invest in consumer goods, telecommunications, and financial services companies in addition to some energy firms. The new fund has already attracted over $250 million in capital, suggesting continued strong investor interest in Russia despite tensions.

Some analysts view the move as a savvy one that will boost Regent Pacific's long-term position in Russian markets. "The Gazprom fund was always a controversial strategy that limited itself to just one company and sector," said Ivan Sviderski of the Moscow-based investment research firm Veritas Capital.  "The new broader fund is a much more balanced approach that is better equipped to capture upside and manage risk over the long run, regardless of the political situation."

However, other experts argue that any investments in Russian companies still carry substantial risk given a business climate closely tied to Kremlin interests.  "This seems more like a PR move than anything substantive," said Helena Stevens, a senior analyst with the London-based Eurasia Group. "At the end of the day, large Russian companies remain deeply entangled with the state and vulnerable to geopolitical shocks. Regent Pacific's investors would be naive to think a rebranding changes that reality."

The ultimate impact of Regent Pacific's move remains to be seen. For now, the firm appears confident in the long-term promise of Russian public equity markets, even as risks and headwinds persist. With broader investments but still substantial exposure, Regent Pacific is set to remain a prominent player in Russia for years to come.
