Investing in Asian Telecommunications Stocks Full of Hazards, Analysts Warn 

Investors considering Asian telecommunications stocks should proceed with caution, warn industry analysts. While the massive populations and growing middle classes in countries like China and India suggest huge potential, telecoms in these markets face risks and uncertainties that could jeopardize stock prices.

Chinese telecom giants like China Mobile and China Unicom have benefited from providing mobile and internet services to hundreds of millions of Chinese. However, the Chinese government maintains tight control over telecoms and could enact new regulations that impact business models and profitability. The government sees telecoms as a strategic sector and has in the past issued surprise directives that have upended business plans.

Meanwhile, Chinese consumers have become accustomed to very low service costs, limiting how much telecoms can charge for plans and services. Raising prices significantly could lead customers to switch carriers or drop service altogether. China’s slowing economy also poses risks if consumer spending on telecom services declines. 

India’s telecom market erupted into chaos in 2016 with the entry of deep-pocketed Reliance Jio, owned by India’s richest man. Jio offered dirt-cheap mobile data and free voice service for months, grabbing tens of millions of subscribers but decimating the profitability of incumbents like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. While Jio’s predatory pricing has moderated, Indian telecoms remain caught in a price war that has slashed margins. 

Consolidation may provide some relief. Vodafone and Idea merged to gain scale, and Airtel acquired several smaller carriers. However, the Indian market may not be able to support so many players, suggesting more shakeups to come. Meanwhile, Jio continues to use its vast resources to gain market share, raising uncertainty for other players.

Government policy is another wild card in India. Like China, India sees telecoms as crucial infrastructure and maintains strict control and regulation of the sector. Policy changes have impacted foreign investment in Indian telecoms and the rollout of new technologies like 5G. Red tape also slows the deployment of new cell towers, widening India’s digital divide.  

In other parts of Asia, markets like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia offer potential but also risks around regulation, competition, and slower economic growth. Meanwhile, mature telecom markets in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan offer stability but little growth.  

While Asian telecom stocks may appear attractively valued, analysts urge caution. “There are too many unknowns, especially around government policy and competition, to make a confident case for most telecom stocks in China and India right now,” says Daiwa analyst Mark Schwartz. For investors seeking Asian telecom exposure, Schwartz recommends diversifying across multiple countries and hedging risks by investing in related technology companies and carriers outside the region. With so much uncertainty on the horizon, analysts say boring can be good when it comes to Asian telecom stocks.
