Foreign Investment Key to Upgrading China's Road Infrastructure, Says SBC Warburg

China needs to attract more foreign investment and expertise to overhaul its road infrastructure, according to a new report from SBC Warburg, a leading Asia-focused investment bank. The report estimates that China needs to spend at least $60 billion per year for the next 10 years to upgrade its highways, bridges and tunnels to meet global standards.   

While China has the world's second largest road network, much of it is decades old and struggling to meet the demands of the country's booming vehicle traffic and logistics industry. According to SBC Warburg, vehicle traffic in China has increased 15-fold since 1990 but road construction has increased at less than half that pace. The result is clogged highways, overburdened bridges and intersections that gridlock for hours each day.

To bridge the infrastructure gap, the Chinese government has set ambitious goals to nearly double the length of highways and expressways to 5 million kilometers by 2035. However, lack of technical experience and know-how means China is struggling to keep up with its own road development targets. "China has the ambition but lacks the technical skills and machinery to overhaul its road infrastructure at the pace needed," the SBC Warburg report said.  

Attracting foreign investment from multinationals and overseas infrastructure funds could help address the shortfall in expertise and technology.  The Chinese government has taken steps toward greater openness, like removing foreign ownership restrictions on infrastructure projects and offering tax incentives and subsidies for foreign investors. Several major international players have already committed billions to Chinese transportation deals, including US-based Carlyle Group and Singapore's GIC sovereign wealth fund.

SBC Warburg said more needs to be done to attract long-term private capital to infrastructure. "China's road development would benefit from increased public-private partnerships and new financing structures that share risk and reward," the report said. It also called on China to standardize its bidding process to increase transparency and make road projects more investor-friendly.

If China upgrades its road infrastructure to developed nation standards, it could significantly boost economic growth. The report estimated that for every 10% improvement in road connectivity, China's GDP could increase by 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points per year due to lower costs of moving goods and people. High-quality road infrastructure is also important for China's transition from an export-based economy to one driven by domestic consumption and services.

In summary, the SBC Warburg report makes a compelling case that China needs to ramp up foreign investment and expertise to overhaul its inadequate road infrastructure. By improving connectivity and mobility, China can unlock substantial economic and social benefits that strengthen its position as an economic superpower in the coming decades. Overall, the massive opportunities in China's infrastructure are attracting interest globally - and for good reason.
