California Pension Funds Eye Long-Term Investments in Asia 

Some of California's largest public pension funds are looking to Asia for long-term investment opportunities. The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), two of the biggest pension funds in the U.S. with a combined value of over $600 billion, are allocating more of their investment portfolios to Asian markets.

CalPERS, which manages pension funds for over 1.5 million California public employees, plans to invest up to $4 billion in Asian infrastructure over the next five years. The pension giant sees opportunity in Asia's rapidly growing cities and middle class. "Urbanization and population growth in Asia are driving the need for more infrastructure, like transportation, water, and utilities,” said CalPERS infrastructure portfolio manager John Holloway. “We want to capture the long-term growth potential of infrastructure assets in Asia to benefit CalPERS members for decades to come."

CalSTRS, which oversees retirement funds for nearly 930,000 teachers, is also increasing investment in Asia. The pension fund recently opened new offices in Shanghai and Mumbai to help identify and evaluate investment prospects across China and India. "We see Asia, especially China and India, as a key driver of global economic growth in the 21st century," said CalSTRS chief investment officer Christopher Ailman. "By expanding our presence in the region, CalSTRS aims to build relationships and expertise that will provide our members risk-adjusted returns over the long run."

Some analysts, however, warn that there are risks to investing pension funds in Asian markets. "Political, regulatory and currency risks are higher in Asia compared to Western markets," said David Neal, a senior pension fund strategist. "Pension funds betting big on Asia could generate strong returns but also face potential losses due to lack of transparency, capital controls, and other risks in China and other Asian economies."  

Proponents counter that the risks of investing in Asia are manageable if funds take a long-term approach and partner with experienced fund managers and local partners on the ground. CalPERS and CalSTRS invest in Asia primarily through external fund managers and by co-investing with local partners. The pension giants are also increasingly focused on sustainable and responsible investing in Asia.  By managing risks and taking an active role as long-term investors, California's pension funds aim to benefit from the growth opportunities in Asia for decades to come. Overall, the move marks a shift to more diversified global portfolios for public pensions in America's most populous state.
