Fate of Filipina maids in Hong Kong uncertain ahead of Chinese rule handover

Over 300,000 domestic helpers from the Philippines currently work in Hong Kong, making up a significant portion of the territory's foreign labor force. Most are women employed as live-in maids, caring for children and performing household duties. However, as Hong Kong prepares to transition from British to Chinese rule in 2047, the fate of these Filipina maids hangs in the balance. 

Under British administration, Hong Kong's economy and way of life have been deeply influenced by Western liberal values. Domestic workers have enjoyed certain protections and rights, including a minimum wage, standard work hours, and mandatory days off. But after the handover to China, Hong Kong's laws and regulations may come under pressure to align more closely with China's system. And China's labor laws offer few guarantees for domestic workers.

"We are very worried about 2047," said Eni Lestari, chairperson of the Asian Migrants Coordinating Body, an alliance of migrant worker groups. "The British gave us basic rights and protections, but China may want to 'mainland-ize' Hong Kong's policies. Our standard of living could go down."

There are concerns China may scrap the minimum wage for domestic workers, increase the maximum number of working hours, and reduce the number of mandatory rest days. Such moves would make it even easier for employers to exploit maids and violate their basic rights, Lestari said. 

Some Filipina maids have already reported deteriorating working conditions as China exerts more influence in Hong Kong. "My current employer is pro-China and she thinks Filipina maids are mere servants," said Marie, a domestic helper from the Philippines who asked to be identified only by her first name.  "She makes me work from 6 am to 11 pm with no breaks. I only got one day off in the past month. I'm worried this will become the norm after 2047."
