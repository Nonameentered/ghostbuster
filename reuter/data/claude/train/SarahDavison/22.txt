Jardine Fleming Escapes Further Sanctions After Scandal, Business as Usual

The Hong Kong-based investment bank Jardine Fleming escaped further regulatory penalties today after widespread failures in its risk management and compliance procedures were revealed last year. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced it will take no further action against the firm after Jardine Fleming agreed to a set of remediation steps proposed by the regulator. 

The decision comes after a 2019 report by the SFC found extensive issues with how Jardine Fleming monitored employee trading, ensured compliance with anti-money laundering laws, and managed other risks. The report revealed that senior managers had little oversight into traders’ activities and failed to act on multiple red flags. However, SFC officials said today that Jardine Fleming has been cooperative and committed to reform.

“Jardine Fleming recognised the seriousness of the issues identified and has taken substantive steps to strengthen its risk and compliance frameworks under close supervisory oversight and monitoring by the SFC,” said Ashley Alder, the SFC’s Chief Executive Officer. “We expect the firm to continue its efforts to effect change and rebuild trust through the consistent implementation of a risk and compliance culture.”

The SFC report last year rattled confidence in Hong Kong’s investment banks and added to a string of corporate scandals that have raised doubts over the city’s reputation for strong governance and regulation. However, some analysts say the decision to avoid further disciplinary action against Jardine Fleming may indicate a more pragmatic approach aiming to balance enforcement with the overall stability and competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  

“The SFC recognises the need to hold firms accountable for significant failures but also values rehabilitation and giving companies a chance to learn from mistakes,” said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of advisory firm Quinlan & Associates. While the scandal dealt a blow to Jardine Fleming’s credibility, he added, “Their business remains largely intact, and clients and counterparties are still staying loyal, taking a longer view.”

Barring further compliance issues, Jardine Fleming appears poised to move past this chapter and continue business as usual serving its roster of corporate clients and institutional investors across Asia. The firm declined to comment on the SFC’s announcement today.
