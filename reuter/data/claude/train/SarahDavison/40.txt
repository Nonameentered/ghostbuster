Hong Kong's Economy Strong Ahead of Chinese Sovereignty Transition, Says Financial Secretary Donald Tsang  

Hong Kong's economy is in a strong position as the city prepares to mark the 20th anniversary of its handover from British to Chinese rule on July 1, the city's financial secretary said Tuesday. 

In a speech to the legislature, Donald Tsang said Hong Kong has a "solid economy" with low unemployment, reasonable inflation and export growth. Government estimates released Tuesday showed Hong Kong's economy grew at a faster-than-expected rate of 3.8% in the first quarter of this year. 

"The current-term government has been striving to leverage Hong Kong's traditional strengths, proactively integrate into the overall development of the country, and identify new growth areas, with a view to promoting Hong Kong's continuous economic development over the long run," Tsang said.

Tsang said Hong Kong's links with mainland China continue to strengthen, citing the completion of infrastructure projects like the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. At the same time, Tsang said Hong Kong aims to establish itself as an international center for financial services, transportation and trade.

The upbeat economic assessment comes as Hong Kong prepares to mark 20 years since Britain handed sovereignty of the city to China on July 1, 1997. The handover anniversary is a chance for China to showcase its vision for Hong Kong's role, even as fears grow that Beijing is tightening its grip on the city.

Tsang said the government will invest in boosting Hong Kong's competitiveness and support "new economic drivers" like technology, aviation, Chinese medicine and environmental protection industries. However, he warned of downside risks like rising trade tensions between China and the United States, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and volatility in global financial markets.

"We need to stay vigilant in monitoring the situation and be prepared to introduce appropriate measures when necessary to maintain the stability and competitiveness of our financial system," Tsang said.

The Hong Kong government is forecasting gross domestic product growth of 2% to 3% for 2019, a slowdown from 3% growth in 2018. The city's economy has been buffeted recently by the U.S.-China trade war, slowing tourism from mainland China and global market volatility.

However, Tsang said Hong Kong's economic fundamentals remain strong, and he expressed confidence in the city's resilience. "The current-term government will continue to adopt a prudent and pragmatic approach, monitor the risks and challenges in the external environment closely, and introduce appropriate measures in a timely manner to support enterprises and stabilize the economy," he said.
