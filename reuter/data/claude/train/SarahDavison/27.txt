Hong Kong gears up to welcome the Year of the Ox amid rising political tensions 

Hong Kong is preparing to ring in the Lunar New Year amid a tense political climate. The city is decked out in red decorations to welcome the Year of the Ox, but celebrations this year will be more subdued as the city grapples with the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and political unrest.

Typically, Hong Kong sees throngs of shoppers and revellers during the Lunar New Year festival. This year, however, authorities are urging the public to avoid crowded gatherings to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. Hong Kong has seen a recent surge in cases, reporting over 100 new infections a day. Many families will stay home for reunion dinners instead of dining out at restaurants. Cultural events have also been scaled back. 

The political situation also looms over the festivities. In 2020, Hong Kong saw massive pro-democracy protests and clashes with police. The events of last year and the subsequent crackdown by authorities have intensified the divisions in the city. Recently, 47 pro-democracy activists were charged with subversion under the controversial new national security law imposed by Beijing. Critics see it as an attempt to quash dissent in Hong Kong.

Some Lunar New Year fairs and markets have political protest artwork on display. At Victoria Park, yellow posters call for the release of detained activists. Pro-democracy restaurant Ah Tung in the Tsim Sha Tsui district plastered protest slogans on its windows. Owner Tam Wai-ho said he wants to keep the spirit of resistance going during the festival. 

Not all Hong Kongers agree with these defiant gestures, though. Pauline Lee thinks politics should be set aside for the holidays. "Chinese New Year is a time for family and being together. We should cherish these traditions instead of bringing this negativity," she said. 

The Year of the Ox is meant to signify hard work, positivity and stability. Whether Hong Kong can achieve that in 2021 remains to be seen. The city faces a long road to economic recovery and reconciliation. Still, for now Hong Kong presses on to usher in the Lunar New Year, even if celebrations are not as boisterous. The festive spirit lives on through cherished rituals with loved ones at home.
