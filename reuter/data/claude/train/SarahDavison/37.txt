Hong Kong stocks make lightning-fast recovery after initial dip on news of Deng Xiaoping's death  

The Hong Kong stock market swiftly recovered from an initial drop following news of the death of China's former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. The benchmark Hang Seng Index opened almost 3% lower on news of Deng's passing but rapidly regained ground to end the day down just 0.3%. 

Deng, who was 92 years old, passed away in Beijing late on February 19th after a long illness. He had been China's de facto leader for much of the 1980s and early 1990s and was widely credited with pioneering economic reforms that spurred China's rapid economic growth and opened up the country to global trade and investment.

Investors had feared that Deng's death could create political uncertainty and slow the pace of reform.  Hong Kong stocks, which benefit significantly from China's economic rise, were poised for a sizable drop at the market open.  "There were worries reforms might stall without Deng's leadership and guidance," said Mark Wu, head of research at Hong Kong Asset Management Corp. 

However, statements from Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and other leaders emphasizing that economic policies would remain unchanged calmed skittish investors. Leaders praised Deng's role in "opening up" China's economy but said reforms would continue apace. "The fundamentals supporting Hong Kong's prosperity and stability remain unchanged," Zhu said in a statement shortly after markets opened.

Investors took heart, leading stocks to bounce back quickly from the early morning losses. Property developers and casino stocks, which are closely tied to the mainland economy, led the rebound.  "It appears the market has confidence China's leadership will continue Deng's pro-business policies," said Jackson Lee, a director at China Everbright Securities in Hong Kong. 

Deng had retained significant influence over politics in China even after resigning from his last official post in 1990. Though out of the public eye for the last several years due to health issues, Deng's opinions still carried substantial weight with China's leadership.  His advocacy for integrating China into the global economy shaped the policies of his successors, including current president Jiang Zemin.
