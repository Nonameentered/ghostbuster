Mixed Reviews on Thailand's Efforts to Boost Market Confidence with Tougher Finance Sector Rules

The Thai government's efforts this week to strengthen regulation of the financial sector and boost investor confidence received mixed reactions from analysts and industry groups.

On Monday, Thai officials announced several new rules aimed at increasing transparency and oversight in the banking, insurance, and securities sectors. The measures include stricter rules on reporting non-performing loans, tightening controls on dividends and executive pay at state-owned companies, and giving the Securities and Exchange Commission more authority to investigate fraud and insider trading. 

The moves are a response to slowing growth in Thailand's economy and a series of high-profile scandals that have undermined trust in the country's financial institutions over the past year. However, some experts argue the new rules do not go far enough to address systemic issues in the sector.

"These measures are a step in the right direction but more needs to be done to really strengthen governance and risk management across Thai finance,” said Sarah Ng, a specialist in Southeast Asian financial markets at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. “The rules still leave a lot of discretion with agencies and companies, and there are not enough specific penalties spelled out for violations.”

Banking groups objected to some of the requirements, particularly a new rule forcing banks to report delinquent small business loans after just 60 days instead of the current 120 days. “This will create an inaccurate view of asset quality in the banking system and unfairly undermine confidence in banks,” said Chartsiri Sophonpanich, president of the Thai Bankers Association.

However, investor groups praised the new rules as an important signal of the government's commitment to reform. The Thai Investors Association pointed out that stricter auditing and more transparent reporting would benefit companies in the long run by reducing risk premiums and boosting portfolio inflows.

“The measures are very positive and what we have been pushing for,” said Banyong Pongpanich, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Thailand. “Thai companies need to aim for higher governance standards to become more competitive and attractive to investors.”

The new rules underscore a growing recognition that Thailand must strengthen its financial sector to maintain its status as a leading economy in Southeast Asia. While the measures may have some short-term costs, most experts agree that greater transparency and oversight will improve Thailand's resilience to economic shocks in the future. The key will now be rigorous enforcement and a commitment to continual improvement and reform.
