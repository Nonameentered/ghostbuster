Taiwanese Business Leader Invites Top Chinese Policymaker to Visit Island, Beijing Mum on Acceptance  

TAIPEI, Taiwan—Terry Gou, the head of Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn, announced today that he has invited top Chinese policymaker Liu He to visit Taiwan. Liu serves as Chinese Vice Premier and is Beijing’s top economic adviser and trade negotiator. 

The invitation comes as cross-strait tensions have been rising over the past year. Beijing continues to pressure Taipei both economically and militarily to push for reunification with mainland China. However, the administration of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has refused to endorse Beijing’s position that Taiwan is a province of China. 

Gou, who maintains close ties to Chinese leaders, said the invitation to Liu was meant as an opportunity “to promote understanding and exchanges between mainland China and Taiwan.” Speaking at a press conference, Gou argued that more cooperation between Beijing and Taipei would benefit both sides and the region.

“Peaceful relations and economic cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan are important for global trade and technology supply chains as well as regional security,” Gou said. However, he insisted that the invitation was made in his private capacity and not on behalf of the Taiwanese government or his company, Foxconn.

The Taiwanese government has not yet responded formally to Gou’s invitation. Officials in Tsai's administration have worked to balance their rejection of Beijing's political demands with a desire to maintain stable economic relations. There are concerns that Gou's invitation could undermine Taiwan's sovereignty if Liu were to accept.

In Beijing, officials offered no public comment on whether Liu would accept Gou's offer to visit Taiwan. At a regular press briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said only that Beijing's position on Taiwan remained unchanged. The spokesperson called for Taiwan to accept the so-called “1992 Consensus” that recognizes Taiwan as a province of China.
