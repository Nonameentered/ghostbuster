China Vows to Reduce Influence of Buddhism in Tibet, Prioritizing Socialism Over Religion  

The Chinese government announced new policies aimed at reducing the influence of Buddhism in Tibet and reaffirming the Communist party's control over all aspects of life in the region. The policies call for "Sinicizing" religion in Tibet by aligning Buddhist teachings more closely with Communist party doctrine. They also aim to curb the number of Buddhist monks and nuns, limit donations to monasteries, and gain greater control over the selection and education of religious leaders.

The policies were announced this week by the United Front Work Department, an organ of the Communist party devoted to controlling religious and ethnic minorities. They represent an escalation of long-standing efforts by Beijing to supplant Tibetan Buddhism with allegiance to the Communist state. “Religious beliefs cannot override laws and regulations,” the new policy statement said. It called for “integrating religious doctrines into Chinese culture” and “telling Buddhist followers the true essence of religion is love, kindness and tolerance, not certain scriptures, doctrines and sects.”

Tibetan Buddhist monks joined the exiled Dalai Lama in expressing dismay at the Chinese policies. “This is a violation of religious freedom and human rights,” said Lobsang Choephel, a monk living in Dharamshala, India. “The Chinese government wants to manipulate and control our spiritual path. But Buddhism teaches us to think for ourselves and follow the truth.” The Dalai Lama accused China of "total disregard for the thousands of years of cultural heritage" in Tibet. But he called on Tibetans to continue practicing "patience, tolerance and compassion.” 

China seized control of Tibet in 1950 and has long sought to curb the influence of Tibet's Buddhist institutions, which hold moral authority among Tibetans. But experts said the new policies represent an unprecedented level of intervention in Tibetan Buddhist affairs. “This really affects the heart of Tibetan identity," said Robbie Barnett, a Tibet expert at Columbia University. “China is now micromanaging religious life in a way that undermines Tibetan autonomy at the deepest level.”

The policies come amid tightening state control in Xinjiang, another predominantly Muslim region in western China, and follow the recent disappearance of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. China named its own Panchen Lama in 1995 and critics believe he is being held in incommunicado. “China just wants a puppet version of Tibetan Buddhism that follows the Communist party line,” said Lobsang Sangay, President of the Tibetan exile government. “But coercive control over matters of faith will only engender greater resentment and conflict."
