China to Crack Down on Lawless Officials: Parliament Vows to Intensify Supervision of Executives and Judiciary Branches

The National People's Congress, China's parliament, announced plans today to increase oversight of government officials and the judiciary to strengthen rule of law and crack down on corruption. The new measures are aimed at ensuring officials "exercise power responsibly" and safeguarding the authority of the Communist party, according to the parliament's spokesman Zhang Yesui. 

The plans include establishing a new national supervisory commission that will have investigative powers over executives at all levels of the government as well as judicial officials. The commission will have the authority to inspect government agencies, investigate corruption allegations, and detain officials for questioning. Some see this as an expansion of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign that has disciplined over 1 million officials in the past five years.

"There is still a long way to go to comprehensively establish a law-based government," Zhang said. "We must intensify supervision to ensure that all public servants use their power properly and responsibly."

The new commission will combine separate anti-corruption bodies into a single organization with greater authority. Some critics argue this move risks expanding the Communist Party's control and creating a "super-agency" with broad and unchecked powers. But supporters counter that it will make anti-corruption efforts more efficient and effective.

"The key is whether the new watchdog has real teeth to bite off the challenges posed by corruption and abuse of power," said Yang Weidong, a law professor at China University of Political Science and Law. The new policy is meant to strengthen the leadership of President Xi and reassert the absolute authority of the Communist Party according to some observers. But others see it as an important step to enhance regulatory oversight, standardize disciplinary procedures, and advance judicial fairness.

The policy announcement comes as Beijing prepares for a major leadership reshuffle later this year. The new supervision commission is expected to be formally approved at the annual meeting of China's parliament next month. If approved, it would mark a milestone in President Xi's drive to deepen political control and remake China's governance model under the firm leadership of the Communist Party.
