Chinese dissident Wang Dan appeals against jail sentence for subversion 

Prominent Chinese political dissident Wang Dan has filed an appeal against his prison sentence for "subversion of state power," according to his lawyer. Wang received a four-year jail term in January this year in connection with his peaceful political activism and outspoken critiques of the Chinese Communist government.

Wang was a key leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests and has already spent a total of 15 years in prison for his political activism. His most recent conviction and sentencing has been seen as evidence of the increasingly hardline stance of the Xi Jinping government toward any form of dissent or challenge to Communist party rule.

Wang's lawyer Li Fangping said he submitted the appeal to the Beijing High People's Court on Tuesday. Speaking after filing the appeal, Li said "Wang Dan's speech and participation in social activities are protected by the Chinese constitution, so his conviction and sentence were unconstitutional." Li argued that Wang's activities were non-violent and he should not be punished simply for peacefully expressing a political opinion.

Wang was first detained by authorities in May 2019 and held for six months before being formally arrested in November 2019 on charges of subversion. His case was heard in secret in January this year and the conviction and sentencing announced soon after, raising concerns that he did not receive a fair trial. Wang immediately insisted upon his innocence and expressed his intent to appeal the verdict. 

In a statement, Wang said at the time "For the past 30 years, I have dedicated myself to promoting non-violent democratic change in China...I have done nothing to harm national interests or security." Wang has long advocated for democratic reforms in China, in contrast to the authoritarian model of rule favored by the Communist party leadership.

Human rights groups have condemned Wang's latest conviction and called for his immediate and unconditional release. "Wang Dan has been unjustly imprisoned solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by international human rights law," said Amnesty International's China researcher Dorian Lau. "He should never have been prosecuted or imprisoned in the first place."

There is little optimism, however, that the appeal process in China's opaque judicial system will result in Wang's conviction being overturned and his release from prison. The appeals process mostly serves to uphold the authority of the Communist party's handling of political cases. Wang looks set to serve at least another three years of his four-year sentence, the latest phase of a lifelong struggle for greater political freedom in China.
