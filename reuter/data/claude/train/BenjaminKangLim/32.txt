Chinese Dissident Wang Dan's Appeal Against 11-Year Sentence to Be Considered Ahead of U.S. Secretary of State's Visit

By Your Assistant

Wang Dan, a leading Chinese dissident and student leader during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, is set to have his appeal against an 11-year prison sentence heard this week. The timing coincides with an upcoming visit by U.S. Secretary of State to Beijing. Wang was sentenced in July of last year for "inciting state subversion" due to his pro-democracy writings and activism. 

Wang, 44, was one of the most visible leaders of the student movement that occupied Tiananmen Square for weeks in 1989, calling for political reforms. After the bloody military crackdown on June 4, 1989, Wang was named No. 1 on the Chinese government's most-wanted list. He went into hiding for a year before being arrested in 1990 and serving almost 5 years in prison.

Upon his release in 1998, Wang continued to advocate for democracy and human rights in China. He wrote and published articles critical of the Chinese Communist Party, gave interviews to foreign media, and connected with other dissidents and activists. In 2017, he was once again detained by Chinese authorities for his speech and writings, culminating in his conviction and sentencing last year.

Wang's appeal at the Beijing High People's Court is attracting international attention, given concerns over China's human rights record and crackdown on political dissent under President Xi Jinping. U.S. officials are expected to raise Wang's case during next week's visit. Secretary of State has signaled that human rights will be on the agenda for discussion with Chinese leaders.

In a statement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson urged other countries not to interfere in China's internal affairs and judicial sovereignty. However, rights groups argue that Wang's harsh sentence for non-violent activism violates China's own laws and obligations under international human rights law. 

"Wang Dan has been unjustly imprisoned again simply for peacefully advocating for democracy and human rights," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "His appeal is a test of whether China's judiciary has any independence and integrity left."

Wang's supporters and friends also worry that the conditions of his imprisonment are putting his health at serious risk. During his previous stint in prison in the 1990s, he suffered from a series of medical conditions due to poor nutrition, hygiene, and health care. Wang's appeal this week is seen as a pivotal moment in a long struggle for human rights and democracy in China that has spanned decades. All eyes will be on the appeals court to see if it follows the party's orders or shows leniency given the international spotlight on the case.
