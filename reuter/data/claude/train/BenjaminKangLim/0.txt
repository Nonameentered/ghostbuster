Beijing assures Taiwan over fears of island's security after lift of direct trade ban 

Beijing sought to reassure Taiwan that its security would not be affected by China's decision to lift a ban on individual Chinese tourists traveling to the island. The move to allow direct flights and visits between the two sides for the first time in 60 years has raised concerns in Taiwan about its ability to monitor travelers and prevent security risks.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office said there was "no need to worry" about any impact on Taiwan's security. It said only Chinese living on the mainland would be allowed to visit and that all tourists would have to join pre-approved group tours. Taiwan would be given passenger lists in advance and Chinese tourists would not be allowed entry into "sensitive" areas.

The ban was imposed by Beijing during the Cold War to isolate Taiwan's then authoritarian government. Its lifting fulfills a pledge made by Chinese President Xi Jinping in January as part of a bid to win over Taipei's political elite and public. China still considers Taiwan as a province awaiting reunification, by force if necessary.  

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen welcomed the move but said that "national security" would remain a top priority during reviews of applications by Chinese tour groups. Her independence-leaning government remains wary and perceptions of threats from China run high in Taiwan.

Surveys show most Taiwanese would prefer limiting numbers of Chinese tourists to 100 per day. But the island's tourism industry hopes the first waves of independent travelers will boost the economy. China previously only allowed organized group tours to Taiwan, a restriction that failed to satisfy the curiosity of most mainland citizens.

“We hope people from both sides can exchange ideas and understand more about each other,” said Chiu Chui-cheng, a spokesman for Taiwan's Policy Planning and Development Committee. “But we will evaluate the situation closely and make sure our national security is guaranteed.”  

Taiwan received a record high of more than 770,000 mainland visitors in 2016 but only about 300,000 were individual tourists. Most came on package tours run by Chinese state-backed providers. Laws prohibit most Chinese independent travelers from going abroad.

The new policy permits residents of 47 mainland cities to apply for individual entry permits to Taiwan. But some analysts warn China may use the tours to advance political goals and gather intelligence. "There is no question they will send some spies over here," said Wang Yu-Ze, a political scientist at Taiwan's Soochow University.
