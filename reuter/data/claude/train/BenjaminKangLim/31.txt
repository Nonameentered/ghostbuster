China to Defrock Radical Monks in Tibet in 5-year Crackdown to Uproot Influence of Dalai Lama 

The Chinese government announced today a new 5-year plan to crack down on Buddhist monks and nuns in Tibet deemed to hold "radical" or "separatist" views that threaten national security. The plan calls for officials to defrock and expel from monasteries those who express support for the Dalai Lama or Tibetan independence. 

“Some monasteries in Tibet have been infiltrated by those with radical views who promote ‘Tibet independence’ and worship the 14th Dalai Lama,” said Wu Yingjie, the Communist Party chief of Tibet, at a press conference. He said the crackdown was needed to “uproot the influence of the Dalai clique.”

There are an estimated 500,000 monks and nuns in Tibet, making Tibetan Buddhism a pillar of traditional Tibetan culture. But China views some monks, especially those who remain loyal to the Dalai Lama, as a threat. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, fled to India in 1959 amid a failed uprising against Chinese rule. He remains a revered figure for Tibetans and advocates greater autonomy for Tibet.

Under the new plan, teams of government officials will be stationed in all monasteries to monitor monks and nuns for signs of “disloyalty” such as keeping photos of the Dalai Lama, secretly listening to radio broadcasts from India, or refusing to denounce the Dalai Lama. Those found disloyal will be forced to leave their monasteries and will face additional punishment. 

“The Communist party is striking at the very heart of Tibetan identity and faith by controlling and regulating Buddhist monasteries in this way,” said Tenzin Choephel, a researcher at Students for a Free Tibet. “Tibetans see this as a threat against the survival of Tibetan Buddhism itself.”

The crackdown is the latest sign of China’s hardening stance on Tibet under President Xi Jinping, who has emphasized national security and military control over the region. Last month, China also banned secular civic groups from organizing in Tibet in what activists see as a move to stamp out any dissent or political activism not directly controlled by the Communist Party.  

The bold move is likely to raise tensions with Tibetans in Tibet and fuel criticism from rights groups abroad. But with unrest in Hong Kong highlighting the divide between Communist ideology and calls for democracy, China appears willing to take an iron fist approach to quash any separatist sentiments in Tibet.
