Sons of Beijing's Disgraced Communist Party Boss Detained for Economic Crimes

The sons of Chen Xitong, Beijing's disgraced former Communist Party chief, have been detained on suspicion of economic crimes, according to anonymous sources cited by Chinese state media this week. Chen Xiaotong and Chen Xiaodong were taken into custody recently for unspecified corrupt business activities, the sources claim. 

Chen Xitong served as Beijing's party secretary, the top leadership position in the city, from 1992 to 1995. He was purged from the party leadership in 1995 and sentenced to 16 years in prison on corruption charges in 1998. His downfall was seen as a victory for then-party leader Jiang Zemin to consolidate power in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.

Chen Xiaotong and Chen Xiaodong had extensive business interests spanning property development, logistics, and investments. With their powerful family political connections, they amassed huge wealth during China's economic boom in the 1990s and 2000s. Their detention now appears to be part of a renewed anti-corruption drive by current party leader Xi Jinping targeting the offspring of senior officials, known as "princelings."

According to the anonymous sources, Chen Xiaotong and Chen Xiaodong used their family influence for unfair business advantages, abused public funds, and engaged in predatory investment practices that caused "huge economic losses." The terse announcement of their detention provided no details about the specific charges or allegations against them. But observers suggest their wealth and status as princelings likely made them targets in Xi's far-reaching anti-graft campaign.

"Xi Jinping is shrewdly going after 'princelings' and their corrupt business empires to win public support for his anti-corruption drive," said Cai Xia, a retired professor at the Communist Party school in Beijing.  "By tackling economic crimes and private sector corruption, not just government officials, Xi shows that he's sincere about cleaning up the party and Chinese business."

Xi's anti-corruption campaign has punished more than 1.5 million officials since 2012. Critics argue it also provides a way for Xi to purge political rivals and tighten his grip on power. The detention of officials' children and business leaders further demonstrates the vast scope and arbitrary nature of the campaign, but also the dominance of political patronage and family connections in China's economy. 

Chen Xitong's own fall from grace in 1995 exposed the lavish lifestyles and corrupt wheeling and dealing of China's political elite in the post-Tiananmen era. The fate of his sons now puts Xi's campaign and the party's self-proclaimed mission to stamp out corruption within the most privileged families under the spotlight. For ordinary Chinese, it provides a glimpse into the complex networks of power and money that still entwine China's corridors of power, even today.
