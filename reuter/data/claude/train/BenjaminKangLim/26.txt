Taiwanese business leader urges Beijing to resume talks for fear of losing investor confidence 

The chairman of one of Taiwan's largest business groups urged Beijing to resume bilateral talks and cooperation agreements with Taiwan, warning that deteriorating cross-strait relations threaten to undermine investor confidence.

Morris Chang, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), said China risks damaging its own economy by ratcheting up pressure on Taiwan. China has cut off talks with Taiwan since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen in 2016 and has intensified military exercises in the Taiwan Strait.

"Deteriorating relations across the Taiwan Strait is not good for the economy of Taiwan or for the economy of China," Chang said in an interview. He called for the resumption of talks on bilateral investment protection and dispute resolution agreements that stalled after Tsai took office.

Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party have not accepted Beijing's stance that Taiwan is a province of China. China has responded by squeezing Taiwan's international space and ramping up efforts to poach away Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies. 

Chang said Taiwan businesses remained keen to invest in China due to its huge consumer and labor market, but cross-strait tensions had made them more cautious. "People get worried, and when people get worried investments slow down," he said. 

TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, has invested $3.7 billion in China since 2005 and has nearly 3,000 employees across multiple facilities in China. Its latest Chinese plant opened in Nanjing in 2016.

While investments by Taiwanese companies in China have declined in recent years due to rising labor and production costs, China remains the top destination for investments from Taiwan, with $71.4 billion as of the end of 2018, according to Taiwan government data.

Some analysts argue China cannot afford to cut economic ties with Taiwan entirely given how deeply their economies are interdependent. But Beijing continues to pressure Taiwan and has not renounced the possible use of force against the self-ruled democratic island.

Chang said the uncertainty and ongoing tensions were damaging for both sides of the Taiwan Strait. "It is harmful to the Taiwan economy and the China economy, too," he said. "So the sooner they resume some talks, the better for both economies."
