China's Supreme Court Upholds Suspended Death Sentence for Son of Political Elite for Bribery 

Beijing, China - China's Supreme Court today upheld the suspended death sentence conviction of Che Qiang, the son of a former deputy governor, on charges of bribery and embezzlement. The court ruled that Che's connections to political elites would not permit him to escape justice for corrupt acts that amounted to over $15 million.

Che was convicted in 2018 for taking bribes, embezzling public funds and abuse of power while serving in various government positions in Hunan province. Prosecutors proved in court that Che used his political connections and influence to secure promotions and government infrastructure and development projects for companies that provided him cash, luxury goods, and travel. 

The younger Che grew up as the son of Che Zuoxing, a former deputy governor of Hunan province. The father was also convicted on corruption charges in 2017 and given a life sentence. The son seemed poised to follow in his father's political footsteps, rising from a local housing department official in his mid-20s to become the director of the Huaihua Municipal Housing and Urban Bureau by age 35.  

Che was found guilty of abusing that position to embezzle around $3.8 million in public infrastructure funds. He also accepted over $11 million in bribes from 2006 to 2016, according to prosecutors. The bribes came in the form of cash, jewelry, travel expenses and entertainment. In exchange, Che used his influence to help the bribers obtain land deals, building projects, and gain government subsidies and loans.

The Supreme Court's ruling to uphold the suspended death sentence means that Che will spend the rest of his life in prison if he commits no other offenses during a two-year suspended sentence. The conviction of such a high-profile figure highlights President Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption campaign that has targeted elite figures. 

Some analysts argue the campaign also serves to strengthen Xi's power.  "There is no doubt that this case shows no one is exempt from punishment for corruption, but it also reminds political elites that loyalty to Xi is the best protection," said Ding Jingpeng, a political researcher at Beijing's Renmin University. 

The Supreme Court said in its ruling that Che's crime was "extremely serious" and deserved severe punishment regardless of his political connections. The court rejected Che's appeal and said the facts were clear, the evidence was concrete, and the lower court verdict was accurate. Che's political elite status did not put him above the law, the court said. The ruling suggests Xi's anti-corruption drive may be expanding its scope to focus on the political sphere as much as the business realm.
