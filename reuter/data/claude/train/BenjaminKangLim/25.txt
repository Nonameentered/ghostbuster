Former First Lady of China Sells Antique Collection to Help Impoverished Mothers

Peng Liyuan, the former First Lady of China, announced today that she will be auctioning off portions of her extensive antique porcelain collection. The collection, which includes rare pieces of imperial porcelain and vases from the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, is expected to fetch tens of millions of dollars at auction. Proceeds from the sales will be donated to Peng Liyuan Charity Foundation to fund programs helping impoverished mothers and their children in rural China.

"While I have treasured these antiques for many years, my heart breaks for the mothers struggling to raise their children in the poorest parts of China," said Peng in a statement. "No antique vase or porcelain bowl is more valuable than empowering these women and providing opportunities for their children."

Peng has long been an advocate for women and children's causes in China. After her husband Xi Jinping became the President of China in 2013, Peng gave up her successful singing career to take on the role of the nation's First Lady. She used her position to draw attention to public health issues like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and hepatitis B. Peng also championed programs promoting rural education and providing skills training for women to improve their job prospects. 

While Peng's husband remains the President of China, her title changed from First Lady to "Chairwoman" after Xi's re-election last year.   No longer obligated by her previous ceremonial duties, Peng has pledged to redouble her charitable efforts. She established the Peng Liyuan Charity Foundation in 2019 to consolidate her philanthropic work. The foundation supports programs across China that align with Peng's goal of empowering women, helping the rural poor and improving public health.

The antique auctions are the foundation's first major fundraising initiative under Peng's leadership. Some of the most valuable pieces from her collection will be on display at the Forbidden City Cultural Palace in Beijing for public viewing before being auctioned next month. Peng hopes that allowing people to appreciate the beauty of these cultural relics will raise awareness around her charitable causes and encourage donations from across Chinese society.  

Overall, Peng Liyuan's selfless act demonstrates her compassion for China's most vulnerable populations. Through her creative fundraising and decades of philanthropic work, she has become a inspiring example of how to leverage one's position and resources to enact positive change. The donations from her antique collection will help lift up marginalized communities and combat poverty for generations to come.
