South Africa Abandons Taiwan, Recognises China: Beijing Claims Victory in Diplomatic Tug-of-War  

South Africa has officially cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of recognizing the People's Republic of China. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the change in diplomatic relations in a televised address, citing the "One China principle"  and the need to strengthen economic ties with China.

The move marks a victory for China in its long-running campaign to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. Beijing claims Taiwan as a province of China and has been actively working to reduce the number of countries that recognize Taiwan as an independent nation. China had been increasing pressure on South Africa to switch relations for many years.

Taiwan now only has diplomatic relations with 15 countries, most of which are small states in Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The loss of South Africa as a diplomatic ally is a significant blow. Taiwan had provided generous aid and assistance to South Africa over the years, but it could not match the geopolitical and economic clout of China.

South Africa is China's largest trading partner in Africa, and China is South Africa's biggest trade partner globally. Bilateral trade between the two countries was over $20 billion last year. In his address, Ramaphosa said recognizing China would provide a "strategic boost" to South Africa's economy and open up more trade and investment opportunities. 

Beijing warmly welcomed Pretoria's decision. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said China "highly appreciates" South Africa's commitment to the One China principle and that it would strengthen ties between the two countries. The move solidifies China's foothold as South Africa's most important global partner after the West.

The decision is a blow to the United States as well. The US had hoped that South Africa would maintain ties with Taiwan and not succumb to Chinese pressure, given South Africa's position as a representative of liberal values on the global stage. The diplomatic shift highlights China's ascendance on the continent at the expense of Western influence.

In Taipei, there is disappointment but not surprise. The government remains defiant, saying Taiwan is an independent sovereign country that will continue to seek out good partners on the global stage. But as China continues to coerce more countries to cut ties, Taiwan's international space keeps shrinking.
