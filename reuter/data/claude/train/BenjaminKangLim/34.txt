Dissident Wang Dan's Appeal Rejected, 11-Year Prison Sentence Upheld by Chinese Court

BEIJINGâ€”Wang Dan, a prominent Chinese dissident and student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, had his final appeal rejected by a Beijing Court on Friday. The decision upholds Wang's 11-year prison sentence for "inciting subversion of state power." 

Wang has already served 9 years of his sentence. His early release and appeal for a reduced sentence on medical grounds were denied. Supporters fear the rejection of his final appeal signals the Chinese Communist Party's unwillingness to forgive prominent critics, even decades after the events of 1989.

Now 46, Wang suffers from a variety of ailments, including high blood pressure, a heart condition, and digestive issues according to his lawyer Mo Shaoping. "Wang Dan's health has seriously deteriorated during his unjust imprisonment," Mo said in a statement, "The court's decision today amounts to a death sentence, just a slow and agonizing one."

Wang rose to prominence as a student leader during the 1989 protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. He was number one on the government's "most wanted" list after the military crackdown on June 4, 1989 and was imprisoned until 1998. Wang continued to speak out against the Chinese government upon his release, resulting in his 11-year sentence in 2008 for co-authoring an open letter calling for political reforms. 

"By not reducing Wang Dan's cruel sentence, the regime hopes to intimidate and silence dissent in the lead up to the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre," said Human Rights Watch China Director Sophie Richardson. "But it will only highlight the injustices of China's authoritarian government and inspire renewed calls for accountability."

The court's decision comes amid an ongoing crackdown on civil society under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The rejection of Wang's appeal reinforces beliefs that Xi's tightening grip on power leaves little room for dissent or calls for reform, even from non-threatening critics like Wang. Wang now faces the grim prospect of remaining imprisoned in harsh conditions with little access to medical care for two more years.
