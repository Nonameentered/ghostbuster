Seven-Year-Old Chosen as Tibet's Second Holiest Monk Celebrates Anniversary in Beijing 

Beijing, China - Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the 7-year-old boy chosen by the Dalai Lama as the 11th Panchen Lama, one of Tibet's highest-ranking religious leaders, celebrated the 25th anniversary of his selection today in Beijing. The Chinese government, which claims sovereignty over Tibet, rejected the Dalai Lama's choice and instead installed their own Panchen Lama. The whereabouts of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima have been unknown since his disappearance at age 6.

The Dalai Lama announced the selection of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th Panchen Lama on May 14, 1995, in keeping with Tibetan Buddhist tradition. However, within days, the Chinese government took the boy and his family into custody and appointed their own choice as Panchen Lama. Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of blasphemy and says they have the authority to make such religious decisions in Tibet.

“The selection of the Panchen Lama is a matter that falls within China's sovereignty,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. “The central government's measures to recognize and enthrone the reincarnated soul boy go exactly with religious rituals and historical conventions.”

Exiled Tibetans and human rights groups have long called on China to prove that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima is still alive and safe. “We are extremely concerned that authorities continue to refuse to provide any credible information,” said Amnesty International in a statement. The disappearance of the Panchen Lama as a child is seen by many as emblematic of China's repressive control over Tibetan Buddhism.

The anniversary was marked in Beijing with religious ceremonies attended by the government-appointed Panchen Lama and other senior religious figures. There were no public events to mark the date in Tibet. The region remains extremely tightly controlled, with limited access to foreign media. The Dalai Lama continues to campaign from his exile in Dharamshala, India for greater religious freedom and autonomy for Tibet.
