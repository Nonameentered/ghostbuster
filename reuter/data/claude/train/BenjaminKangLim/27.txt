China's Exports Climb 23.3% in October, Expected to Continue Through H1 1997 

China's exports surged in October, jumping 23.3% from a year earlier to $71.2 billion, according to data released Tuesday by China's General Administration of Customs. The strong export growth highlights the strength of China's factories and economic recovery as major trading partners emerge from the pandemic.

October's export growth quickened from 10.2% in September and beat economists' expectations of an acceleration to just 12.3%. The sharp rebound suggests foreign demand for Chinese goods is holding up better than expected, despite a resurgence of coronavirus infections in many Western countries and excess inventory of some goods like medical equipment and household appliances.  

With virus cases in check and factories ramping up, China's economy has gained momentum in recent months driven by strong domestic consumption and fixed-asset investment. GDP expanded a better-than-expected 4.9% in the third quarter from a year earlier. The country is on track to be the only major economy to report positive growth this year.

Bucking the global trend, China's manufacturing sector has showed signs of strong recovery. An official survey of factory activity indicated the sector expanded at a faster pace in October. Export orders and production rose, pointing to improving external demand. The purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector rose to 51.4 in October from 51.5 in September.  

According to economists, China's exports will likely continue to grow at a double-digit pace in the coming months as demand for Chinese-made goods like electronics products, furniture and toys is expected to surge during the year-end holiday season in Western markets. If current trends hold, China's exports could increase 10-15% on average in the first half of 1997, providing crucial support for the country's growth.

The recent export figures will ease concerns about slowing global demand and downside risks to China's nascent economic recovery. As major trading partners emerge from lockdowns, China's export machine looks set to gain further momentum boosting prospects for solid economic expansion next year. Overall, China's trade picture looks bright heading into 1997 with exports and imports outpacing expectations.
