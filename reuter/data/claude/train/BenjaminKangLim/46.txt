China's Plan to Curb Blind Investment in Provinces Hindered by Defiant Regional Authorities, Economists Say 

Beijing's push to rein in excessive investment and unsustainable debt growth across Chinese provinces and local governments is facing resistance, according to some economists. Despite policy directives from the central government aimed at curbing blind investment in infrastructure and speculative real estate projects, some regional authorities continue to promote investment-driven growth.

The central leadership issued policy guidelines last year to slow investment across the country and make the economy less reliant on debt-fueled spending on roads, railways and residential construction. The guidelines called on local governments to curb investment in projects with low economic returns and high debt levels. However, some provincial authorities seem to be dragging their feet in implementing these policies, worried about the impact of slower growth on their economies.

"There is a misalignment of interests between the central leadership and local officials," said Ming Zhang, an economist at China Center for International Economic Exchanges. "The central directives aim for high-quality growth but local governments just want maximum growth to meet their GDP targets." 

In Hunan province, for example, the government earlier this year approved six new rail projects worth over $73 billion, despite several existing railways suffering from very low ridership. In Hainan, the provincial government eased restrictions on purchasing second homes, contrary to the central government's policy of tightening controls on speculative property investments. 

Some economists argue that the defiance from local authorities shows the limits of the central leadership's power. "There is no effective mechanism to make sure policy directives from Beijing are strictly followed at the provincial and municipal levels," said Ting Lu, an economist at Nomura based in Hong Kong. "Local officials have too much incentive to keep boosting investment to hit growth and job creation targets." 

To really gain traction for their policy goals, Beijing may have to put in place more stringent oversight of local authority budgets, borrowing and investment activities. Tougher enforcement mechanisms and penalties for non-compliance may also be needed to guide regional economies to a more sustainable growth path, experts say. Short of that, central plans to curb investment and debt will likely continue to face obstacles from local ambitions.
