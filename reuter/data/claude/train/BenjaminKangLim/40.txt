China's breakaway Catholic Church ordains 50 new priests 

The Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association ordained 50 new priests this weekend in a show of strength amid ongoing tensions with the Vatican. The ordinations took place in Beijing's Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception without approval from the Holy See.

The Chinese Communist Party cut ties with the Vatican in 1951 and established the Patriotic Catholic Association to oversee Catholics in China. The Association does not recognize the authority of the Pope and appoints its own bishops. There are an estimated 12 million Catholics in China split between the underground church loyal to the Pope and the state-sanctioned Patriotic Catholic Association.

The mass ordination of new priests is a bold move by the Association to assert its authority in China. "The Chinese Catholic Church is moving forward steadily under the leadership of the Communist Party," said Bishop Joseph Li Shan of Beijing, who led the ordination. The ceremony was attended by nearly 2,000 people, including government officials. 

The Vatican disapproves of the ordinations and considers the Patriotic Catholic Association illegitimate. "The ordination of Bishops without a pontifical mandate is illegal and illegitimate," said Pope Francis in a speech this month. The Pope has tried to repair relations with China, but the two sides remain at odds over who should appoint Catholic bishops in the country. 

The underground Catholic Church remains loyal to Rome but has faced persecution and pressure from authorities. Cardinal Joseph Zen, the former archbishop of Hong Kong and a prominent critic of China's religious policies, called the ordinations "a slap in the face" to the Vatican. "They do not care about the Vatican and the faithful," he said. "They only care about their control and power."

Despite Vatican objections, China appears determined to strengthen its control over organized religion. The mass ordination of priests was the largest since Beijing and the Vatican severed diplomatic ties. With no sign of reconciliation on the horizon, China's Patriotic Catholic Church is poised to ordain more priests and bishops on its own authority in defiance of Rome's wishes.
