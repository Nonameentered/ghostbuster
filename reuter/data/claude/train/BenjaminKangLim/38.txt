Bankruptcies expected to more than double in China as authorities try to weed out hopelessly indebted firms  

The number of bankruptcies in China is expected to more than double this year as regulators work to weed out hopelessly indebted companies and address systemic risks in the financial system. Bankruptcies in the first quarter of 2019 increased 54% compared with the same period last year, according to official data. 

The trend reflects Beijing's efforts to curb excessive borrowing and inefficient investments, especially in sectors like real estate, infrastructure and manufacturing. China has a relatively low corporate bankruptcy rate compared with other major economies, but policymakers want to change that by allowing more private companies to fail as part of a broader push to make markets more decisive in allocating resources.

The rising bankruptcies come as economic growth in China slows to its lowest rate in nearly three decades, due in part to the trade war with the U.S. As the world's second-largest economy loses momentum, more companies are expected to run into financial trouble, especially those that took on a lot of debt during the boom years. The default rate on Chinese corporate bonds hit a record high last year, and is set to rise further in 2019.

Regulators have acknowledged that while allowing more bankruptcies may cause short-term pain, it is necessary to reduce systemic risks and encourage more prudent lending in the economy. The fear is that if indebted companies are continually bailed out, it creates moral hazard and distorts market forces. China has had a longstanding practice of bailing out or restructuring troubled state-owned enterprises to prevent job losses and financial contagion, but this has perpetuated inefficiencies.

Private analysts estimate that China has "zombie" firms with non-performing loans making up 30-40% of banks' books but which are being kept afloat. "These zombie companies are crowding out healthier private firms' access to cheap loans," said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia at Oxford Economics.  "Cleaning them up would boost economic efficiency and the private sector."

While corporate defaults and bankruptcies have been concentrated in the private sector, loss-making state-owned enterprises are also under scrutiny. Last month, a local government financing vehicle from northern China defaulted on about US$158m worth of bonds, marking China's first default by a quasi-public fund. More state sector defaults are seen as "inevitable" to fix structural problems and reduce moral hazard.

The speed and scope at which bankruptcies increase in China, though, will depend on how aggressively policymakers push for reform. While there is recognition of the need for more market discipline, authorities also want to avoid mass job losses and the potential for social unrest. "China's pace of reform is limited by stability concerns," said Liu Guangyao, China's vice minister of finance. "We cannot see turmoil in the labor market, or turbulence in home prices." Overall, it will be crucial for Beijing to strike the right balance to put its economy on a more sustainable footing.
