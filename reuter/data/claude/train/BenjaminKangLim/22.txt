Leading Chinese dissident Chen Ziming placed under tight police surveillance after medical parole 

Chen Ziming, a prominent Chinese dissident and democracy activist, has been placed under tight police surveillance after being released on medical parole from prison last week. Chen, who suffers from late-stage pancreatic cancer, was released after serving over 7 years of an 11-year sentence for "subverting state power."

According to friends who visited Chen, his home in Beijing is being closely monitored by at least 4 police officers stationed outside his apartment building at all times. All visitors are questioned and searched, with some being turned away altogether. Chen's phone calls and internet usage are also believed to be monitored and restricted.

Chen, 62, was a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy movement and helped organize hunger strikes in Tiananmen Square. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison for his role but released early on medical grounds in 2000. He was again imprisoned in 2011 amid a crackdown on dissent and charged with subversion for co-writing a pro-democracy manifesto known as "Charter 08."

Despite his ailing health, supporters say Chen remains defiant. "He is very critical of the authoritarian policies of Xi Jinping and wants to see China move towards democratic reforms," said a friend who was permitted a short visit. "The government is worried that even in his weakened state, Chen could still be an influential voice for human rights and democracy."

However, in his brief appearances since being released, Chen has avoided openly criticizing the government or calling for political reforms. Friends say this is likely due to immense pressure from authorities warning him not to engage in "anti-government" activities if he wants to remain out of prison.

The tight controls on Chen have been condemned by international human rights groups. "Chen Ziming should never have been imprisoned in the first place for exercising his basic rights," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "The Chinese government should end its abusive restrictions on Chen and respect his rights and fundamental freedoms without further harassment after his unjust imprisonment."
