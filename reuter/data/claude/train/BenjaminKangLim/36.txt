Tibetan nun's jail term doubled to 18 years for refusing Beijing's choice as second holiest monk

A Tibetan Buddhist nun has had her prison sentence doubled to 18 years after she refused to accept China's selection of a new leader for the Kirti monastery in Ngaba, a Tibetan area of Sichuan province.

Sister Yeshe Lhadron, 49, was originally sentenced to nine years in jail in 2014 for allegedly damaging a Chinese national flag. According to rights groups, her sentence has now been extended to 18 years for continuing to protest against China's interference in religious affairs in Tibet. 

The Kirti monastery is one of the most influential monasteries in Tibetan Buddhism, second only to Lhasa's Jokhang temple. Its leadership role has traditionally been passed down through reincarnation. After the death of its abbot, the 10th Kirti Rinpoche, in December 2011, local monks identified a young boy as his reincarnation.

However, Chinese authorities rejected that choice and instead selected an adult candidate, Golog Jigme Gyatso, and installed him in the monastery. The selection of China's own candidate as one of Tibetan Buddhism's most senior figures dealt a heavy blow to Tibetans' religious rights and was seen as an attempt by Beijing to exert control over the influential monastery.

Sister Yeshe Lhadron was among hundreds of monks and nuns who staged peaceful protests against the Chinese government's interference in the monastery's succession in 2012. She was arrested in May 2014 for allegedly raising a banned Tibetan flag on the roof of her convent in Ngaba and sentenced to nine years in prison. According to the advocacy group Free Tibet, her sentence has now been extended by a further nine years for continuing to protest against China's choice of spiritual leader for the monastery while incarcerated.

The crackdown at Kirti monastery is part of a broader campaign by Beijing to stamp out displays of Tibetan identity, religion and culture. Under President Xi Jinping, China has intensified control over almost every aspect of Tibetans' lives through mass surveillance, restrictions on movement and the demolition of dwellings. The forced "reeducation" of monks and nuns who refuse to pledge loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party is also widespread, rights groups say.

Sister Yeshe Lhadron's extended sentence highlights the extreme measures China is willing to employ to crush even the most peaceful resistance to its authoritarian control in Tibet. For devout Tibetan Buddhists who see their religious leaders as sacred, acquiescing to China's demands is simply not an option.
