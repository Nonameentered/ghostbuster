Zeneca Group Plc Expects "Substantial" Sales for New Asthma and Schizophrenia Drugs

Zeneca Group Plc announced today that the company expects its new respiratory and mental health drugs to generate substantial revenue in the coming years. The British pharmaceutical giant said its new treatments for asthma and schizophrenia are demonstrating strong clinical results and market potential.

Zeneca's new asthma drug, mepolizumab, was approved last year for severe eosinophilic asthma, a difficult-to-treat form of the respiratory condition. In clinical trials, mepolizumab reduced asthma attacks by half compared to a placebo. Zeneca believes the drug's novel mechanism of targeting inflammation-causing eosinophils will make it an important treatment option for the 300,000 severe asthma sufferers worldwide, about 60,000 of whom have the eosinophilic form. The company projects more than $2 billion in peak annual sales for mepolizumab.

Zeneca's schizophrenia candidate, lumateperone, is in late-stage clinical trials and works through a different mechanism than existing anti-psychotic drugs by regulating serotonin and dopamine activity in the brain. If approved, lumateperone would be the first new type of schizophrenia drug in over 60 years. Given the urgent need for new treatments, Zeneca estimates lumateperone could reach $5 billion in annual revenue. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe next year.

"We are making excellent progress with our priority growth areas of respiratory and mental health," said Pascal Soriot, CEO of Zeneca Group Plc. "Mepolizumab and lumateperone represent medical breakthroughs that we believe can significantly improve treatment for patients. They demonstrate our ability to transform innovative science into new medicines."

Zeneca's optimism for its new drugs comes as the company faces generic competition and sales declines for several of its best-selling medications, including heartburn treatment Nexium and high cholesterol pill Crestor. Revenue and profits have been under pressure, but new drug approvals could help revitalize Zeneca's pipeline and long-term financial outlook. With other promising new drugs also in development for cancer and immunology, Zeneca is poised to enter a new era of growth.
