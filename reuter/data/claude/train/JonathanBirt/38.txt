Budgens Plc to Open 10 New Stores and Expand Presence on Petrol Station Forecourts in 1997  

Budgens Plc, the British supermarket chain, announced plans today to open 10 new convenience stores across the country over the next 12 months. The new stores will be located in the London area, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Bristol. This expansion will increase Budgens’ nationwide store count to over 250 locations.

In addition to new standalone stores, Budgens will look to partner with major petrol station operators to open “store within a store” concepts on forecourts. Budgens currently operates 50 such outlets with partners like Texaco, Shell and Esso. The company aims to double that number over the next two years. 

“Convenience stores and petrol station forecourts are a major growth area for us,” said CEO Howard Morrison. “With more people commuting and living busy lives, the demand for easily accessible, quality food and essentials is rising. Our stores provide shoppers with competitively priced products and a high level of service to meet their needs.”

To support the expansion, Budgens will invest over £50 million to open the new stores and refurbish more than 100 existing outlets. The investment will fund the rollout of Budgens’ latest “Food to Go” and “Food for Now” concepts which provide barista-made coffee, hot and cold sandwiches, salads and meal solutions for time-pressed customers. 

Founded in 1872, Budgens has successfully moved from small high street grocers into one of Britain’s leading convenience store operators. However, intense competition from major supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury’s expanding into the convenience sector has put pressure on sales growth in recent years. The company hopes this new expansion drive will boost takings and strengthen its position as an innovative leader in local convenience retail.
