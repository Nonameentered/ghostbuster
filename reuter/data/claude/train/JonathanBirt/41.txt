Milumil Babymilk Powder Withdrawn in UK and Ireland Over Salmonella Scare

Milumil, one of the UK and Ireland's most popular baby formula brands, announced today that it is withdrawing selected batches of its milk powder formula as a precautionary measure due to potential contamination with Salmonella. The company issued a statement saying that although there have been no reported illnesses, it has identified traces of Salmonella in some samples of its products during quality control testing. As a precautionary measure, it is recalling batches with a 'use by' date of January 2021.

Consumers who have purchased the specified batches are advised not to feed the product to infants and to return it to the shop it was bought from for a full refund. Salmonella infection can be very serious for infants, causing severe diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, and dehydration. 

Milumil is a subsidiary of multinational consumer goods company Unifoods, which produces baby formula, toddler milk, baby cereals and baby care products. It supplies major supermarket chains in the UK and Ireland, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl. The UK's Food Standards Agency classified Milumil's recall of the milk powder batches as 'Class 1', meaning there is a reasonable probability that eating the food would lead to serious health problems or death.   

Unifoods' CEO issued a statement saying: "Nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of infants. We sincerely regret this incident and any concern it may cause to our customers and consumers. We have robust safety protocols in place, but on this occasion a contaminated sample unfortunately slipped through our quality control network. We are urgently investigating how this could have happened."

The recall is a blow to the baby milk formula industry which aims to reassure parents with stringent quality control and safety measures. Milumil is a trusted household brand for many young families, both in the UK and internationally. Unifoods will work hard to regain consumer trust in the brand through its handling of this incident and announcements of improved quality control procedures. The recall is a warning to food producers that safety should be an unending effort.
