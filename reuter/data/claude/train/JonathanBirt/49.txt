British Biotech CEO calls for change in drug company partnerships with biotechs

The CEO of a leading British biotechnology company has called for pharmaceutical companies to overhaul how they partner with and invest in biotech firms. In a speech at a biotech industry conference today, Emma Thompson, CEO of Cambridge-based CellGenTech, argued that the current model where large drug companies acquire or license compounds and technologies from biotechs is "broken and outdated."

Thompson said biotechs need longer-term, more flexible partnerships with pharmas to fully develop new therapeutics, especially in new areas like gene and cell therapy. "The traditional model of upfront payments and conditional milestone payments doesn't work for these complex, multi-year development programs," she said. "Biotechs need committed, patient capital and true strategic partnership with pharmas, not just transactions."  

CellGenTech is developing a range of cell and gene therapies for cancer and rare diseases. Two of its lead therapies are currently in early-stage clinical trials in partnership with global pharma companies. However, Thompson revealed the partnerships have been challenging. "The milestones are unrealistic, timelines too compressed, and objectives not fully aligned. This makes it difficult to do the innovative science required," she said.

Thompson called on pharmas to take minority equity stakes in biotech partners, provide more flexible funding, and participate jointly in key research and development decisions. In return, she argued biotechs would achieve more meaningful results that benefit both parties. Some industry experts have echoed these views, believing closer alliances could boost biomedical R&D productivity. However, critics argue biotechs would lose autonomy and face greater risks. 

In her speech, Thompson said the biotech sector in the UK is poised for further growth but needs "patient, long-term capital and strategic partnerships with companies that share our vision." Pharmas willing to craft these relationships will "reap the rewards of the next wave of therapeutics," she concluded. The coming years will determine whether pharmas heed this call, or whether the traditional model will prevail.
