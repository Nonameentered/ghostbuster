Zeneca Group plc Expects Record Profits in 1996 on the Back of Strong Pharmaceutical Sales  

Zeneca Group plc, the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, announced today that it expects profits for the full year 1996 to reach record levels, driven primarily by surging sales of its key drugs. The company forecast profits before tax and one-time items of £3.2 billion, up nearly 20% from 1995. Revenues for the year are expected to rise 14% to £10.7 billion.

The strong results were led by growth in Zeneca's pharmaceutical division, where sales climbed 22% for the year. Several blockbuster drugs fueled the performance, including the proton pump inhibitor Nexium for gastrointestinal conditions, the cholesterol-lowering statin Crestor, and the asthma treatment Pulmicort. Nexium, in particular, saw sales growth of over 40% as it continues to gain market share from competitors.

“1996 was an outstanding year for Zeneca, demonstrating the strength of our pharmaceutical business and its ability to deliver innovative medicines that improve patient health around the world,” said Sir David Barnes, Chief Executive of Zeneca Group. “With a robust pipeline of new drugs and expansion into emerging markets, we are well positioned to continue achieving strong, consistent growth into the next century.”

In addition to surging pharmaceutical sales, Zeneca's agrochemical division posted modest single-digit revenue gains for the year, aided by expansion into Brazil and other developing agricultural markets. Sales of fungicides and herbicides offset weakness in the insecticide product line. Meanwhile, Zeneca's specialties unit, which includes food additives and polymer products, was roughly flat for the year. Overall, international markets accounted for 63% of total Zeneca sales, with double-digit growth rates across Latin America, Asia, and Africa.

Looking ahead to 1997, Zeneca said it expects continued momentum from new drug approvals and emerging market growth. The company forecast revenue gains of 8-12% for the coming year, with most of the increase again coming from pharmaceuticals. Zeneca also announced plans to boost its research and development budget by 15% as it seeks to launch one new product each year beginning in 1998. With strong results that topped analysts’ expectations, Zeneca shares rose over 3% in early London trading. The company is positioned to continue its steady ascent into the top ranks of global healthcare firms.
