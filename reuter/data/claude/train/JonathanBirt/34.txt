Chemical Industry in UK Set for Steady Growth in 1997, Says Trade Body 

The UK's chemical industry is poised for steady and sustainable growth over 1997, according to a new report from the Chemical Industries Association (CIA), the trade organization for chemical businesses in Britain. The CIA forecasts a 2 percent rise in chemical production in 1997, in line with the industry's long-term trend. 

"While global economic headwinds remain, the British chemical sector has shown its resilience and ability to navigate challenging market conditions," said John Dwyer, director general of the CIA. "Our member companies are investing in new plants and research and development, focusing on high-value, specialty chemicals and tapping into growing export markets."

The CIA report highlights new expansion projects from major chemical companies that will boost production and jobs. BASF, the German chemical giant, recently completed a £20 million upgrade to its acrylic acid plant in Bradford, England. Johnson Matthey and Perstorp have built new production facilities for catalysts and specialty acids, respectively. And Croda International opened a new £150 million bio-ethanol plant on Teesside.

The export market is a bright spot, according to the CIA outlook. Chemical exports from the UK rose 3.5 percent to reach £32 billion in 2016 and account for about 60 percent of total output. The top export destinations are the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, and China. British specialty chemicals, in particular, are in high demand due to their high quality.

To sustain the positive momentum, the CIA is urging the UK government to ensure the industry has access to affordable energy and feedstocks. It also wants policymakers to incentivize investment in innovation, skills training, and infrastructure. The UK chemical sector accounts for £30 billion in economic activity and provides direct employment for 115,000 workers across the country.

"With the right policy and regulatory environment, the British chemical industry can continue to grow, provide good jobs, and make a significant contribution to the overall economy," Dwyer said. The trade group will be pressing its case with government ministers over the coming months to secure support for the industry. Overall, the CIA report gives an upbeat outlook for steady, sustained growth over the coming year.
