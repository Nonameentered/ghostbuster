BOC Group's Healthcare Business Expected to Perform Flat in Current Year, Recover in Future  

BOC Group, a leading provider of medical gases and equipment in Asia, announced that its healthcare business is expected to remain flat in the current fiscal year due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic but is poised to recover in the coming years.

The healthcare segment, which accounts for nearly 55% of BOC Group's total revenue, has witnessed slowing demand for medical gases and equipment in recent months as hospitals and clinics delayed elective surgeries and non-essential treatments. Revenue from medical oxygen, used widely in hospitals for respiratory treatments, declined by 8% in the first half of the current fiscal year. However, revenue from medical devices like ventilators and patient monitoring systems rose by 12% due to increased demand for critical care equipment.  

According to Mr. James Lee, CEO of BOC Group, “The COVID-19 crisis has significantly disrupted the healthcare industry and our business. Hospitals and clinicians had to postpone many elective procedures and focus on treating COVID-19 patients. This resulted in lower demand for some of our products and services. However, we expect the situation to gradually improve as lockdowns ease, elective care resumes and vaccination rates increase.” 

BOC Group expects its healthcare business to remain largely flat for the full fiscal year but pick up pace in the next year as healthcare systems adapt to the new normal. The company is well positioned to benefit from the resumption of elective procedures which were delayed this year. It is also boosting its ventilator and respiratory care equipment manufacturing capacity to meet future demand. 

The company’s industrial and specialty gases business, accounting for 30% of total revenue, declined 15% year on year due to economic slowdown. However, BOC’s management remains optimistic about the outlook for this segment in the long term based on increased government infrastructure spending.

With its integrated medical and industrial gas operations, BOC Group has demonstrated financial resilience during the crisis. For the first half of the fiscal year, the company reported a 8% decline in net profit to $220 million while revenue decreased by 5% to $1.8 billion. BOC Group continues to generate strong cash flows and maintains a healthy balance sheet with low debt.

Barring another major outbreak, BOC Group expects its businesses to recover in the coming year as economic activity picks up. With its leadership position in Asia's medical and industrial gas markets, BOC is poised to benefit as key end markets return to growth. Overall, despite short term challenges, BOC Group remains in a solid position to create value for shareholders over the long run.
