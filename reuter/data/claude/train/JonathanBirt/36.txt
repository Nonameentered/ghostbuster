Enviromed Plc shareholders stage bloodless coup  

In a surprise move today, minority shareholders of Enviromed Plc succeeded in replacing the majority of the board of directors, effectively staging a bloodless coup against the long-serving leadership of the medical technology firm.

Led by activist investor Gregory Lane of Springwater Capital, the group of shareholders assembled over 40% of the voting rights and passed a resolution eliminating five of the nine board positions at Enviromed, including the positions of Chairman, CEO and CFO. The remaining board members resigned in protest, leaving the company completely rudderless. 

Mr. Lane said the actions were necessary to save Enviromed from "shortsighted and self-interested" leadership that had seen revenues and market share decline over the last three years. â€œ shareholder value has been eroded due to mismanagement, lack of innovation and strategic missteps. We need a completely new vision at the top to realize the potential of this once great company."

Enviromed's stock rose over 12% on news of the boardroom coup, with many investors anticipating the new leadership will explore strategic options including a sale of all or part of the company.

The ousted Chairman, Simon Morley, called the actions of the shareholders "completely outrageous" and vowed to fight the changes. However, legal experts said the shareholders appeared to have acted within their rights and the thresholds for passing special resolutions were met according to Enviromed's statutes.

Mr. Lane announced his intention to take over as interim Chairman while a search is underway for a new CEO and independent directors. He said his goal was to "inject new life into Enviromed" and hinted changes may include exploring merger and acquisition options as well as internal restructuring.

The drama at Enviromed is a rare example of a successful shareholder revolt in the medical technology sector. While shareholder activism has risen in recent years, most companies have averted radical changes through negotiation and some concessions to activist demands. Enviromed appears to have badly misjudged shareholder sentiment, leading to the rather unceremonious dumping of a board that had served for over a decade.

Mr. Lane and his allies will now face the challenging task of reviving the fortunes of a company that was recently considered an 'also-ran' in most of its key market segments. Whether the new leadership proves any more effective at unlocking Enviromed's potential will determine if today's victorious coup ultimately benefits the company and its investors.
