Medeva's Hepatitis B vaccine and treatment test results leads to share price surge 

Shares in UK biotech firm Medeva PLC surged more than 25% today after the company announced positive results from late-stage trials of its hepatitis B vaccine and treatment. Investors reacted enthusiastically to the news, driving Medeva's stock up to a 52-week high.

Medeva reported that its Phase 3 trial of a new recombinant hepatitis B vaccine showed it was 95% effective at preventing chronic hepatitis B infection. The randomized, double-blind, controlled study involved more than 3,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe. Medeva said the results were highly statistically significant and meant its vaccine was one of the most effective hepatitis B vaccines currently available. 

"These outstanding results demonstrate Medeva's ability to develop highly innovative and much-needed vaccines," said Medeva CEO Jane Henderson in a statement. "We believe our hepatitis B vaccine can make a real difference in tackling this devastating disease that affects millions worldwide."

Medeva also announced positive topline results from a Phase 2 trial of its oral antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B. The trial showed that the treatment led to a sustained loss of hepatitis B virus in over 60% of patients after 24 weeks of therapy. The treatment was also well tolerated, with no patient experiencing a serious adverse event.

Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. The World Health Organization estimates more than 250 million people worldwide have chronic hepatitis B, with about 620,000 people dying every year as a result.

Dr. Mark Travers, an analyst at investment bank Stifel, said in a note to clients today: "These results are a real breakthrough and suggest Medeva could completely transform the hepatitis B treatment landscape. Its vaccine is highly effective and would take substantial market share, while an oral antiviral option for chronic hepatitis B would fill a major unmet need and open up a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity. Medeva remains significantly undervalued in our view."

Other analysts also raised their price targets for Medeva shares on the back of the announcements. Medeva said it now plans to submit its hepatitis B vaccine candidate for approval by the European Medicines Agency and will begin discussions for approval with other regulators around the world. It also intends to advance its oral antiviral treatment into a Phase 3 trial program.

Medeva was founded in 1992 and currently has a market capitalization of around $1.2 billion. As well as hepatitis B, the company has vaccine and drug candidates in its development pipeline for conditions including hepatitis C, herpes, and shingles.
