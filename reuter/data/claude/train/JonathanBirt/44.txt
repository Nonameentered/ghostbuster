Two Cambridge Biotech Firms to Go Public: Cambridge Antibody Technology Group and Bioscience Innovation Centre  

Two biotechnology companies based in Cambridge, UK announced plans today to launch initial public offerings on the London Stock Exchange. Cambridge Antibody Technology Group, a leader in antibody drug discovery and development, aims to raise £200 million. Bioscience Innovation Centre, an incubator focused on new therapies and medical technologies, seeks to raise £150 million.  

Cambridge Antibody Technology Group (CATG) was founded in 1989 and is a pioneer in the development of antibody drugs. The company has multiple drugs in late-stage clinical trials, including treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. “We've built a robust pipeline of innovative antibody drugs over 30 years and an IPO will provide funding to advance our most promising candidates through clinical trials and regulatory approval,” said Simon Moore, CEO of CATG. 

The Bioscience Innovation Centre (BIC) was started in 2000 as a partnership between the University of Cambridge and private investors. BIC acts as an incubator for startups, providing lab space, business support, and seed funding for new biotech companies. “Many groundbreaking ideas emerge from academic research but struggle to secure private funding to translate into new companies,” said Amanda Fisher, Director of BIC. “Our goal is to bridge that gap and enable more scientific discoveries to become new therapies and technologies. An IPO will allow us to invest in more early-stage startups and maintain Cambridge's position at the forefront of biotech innovation.”

Biotech companies require extensive funding to turn promising science into new drugs and medical technologies. Public listings have become an attractive option, giving companies more financial resources while allowing public investors to participate in the potential upside of scientific advances. If approved, the IPOs would make CATG and BIC two of the largest publicly listed biotech companies in Britain and support the broader life sciences ecosystem in the Cambridge area, which employs over 15,000 people. The region is recognized as one of the top biotech hubs globally, with world-class research hospitals, universities, and a highly skilled workforce.

Investors have reacted positively to the planned IPOs based on the innovative work coming out of Cambridge. But biotech remains a risky field, and there are no guarantees that the new funding will translate into commercial success and profits. CATG and BIC join a handful of other Cambridge biotechs that have gone public in recent years, highlighting the momentum of Britain's broader biotechnology industry.
