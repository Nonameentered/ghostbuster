Shareholders Stage Bloodless Coup at Enviromed  Plc, US Company Selfcare Inc's CEO Ron Zwanziger Appointed Non-Executive Chairman of New Board  

In a surprise move, shareholders of Enviromed Plc, a leading UK medical devices company, ousted the incumbent board of directors today in favor of a new slate of directors proposed by US-based Selfcare Inc, a healthcare and wellness company. The shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of removing the existing six-member board and replacing them with a new six-member board that will include Ron Zwanziger, the CEO of Selfcare Inc, as non-executive chairman.

The shareholder action signals an abrupt change in direction for Enviromed, which has struggled in recent years amid increased competition and pricing pressures. The company's share price has declined nearly 25% over the past two years, even as the broader UK healthcare sector has performed well. Selfcare Inc, on the other hand, has seen its share price triple over the same period on the back of strong sales of its connected fitness trackers and nutritional supplements. 

In a statement, Mr. Zwanziger said, "We are delighted Enviromed's shareholders have supported this change in leadership. Selfcare believes there are tremendous opportunities for growth at Enviromed through investment in new technologies, expansion into new markets, and a refreshed vision for the future of the company. We look forward to working with stakeholders to revitalize Enviromed and unlock shareholder value."

The ousted board members expressed disappointment in the shareholders' decision. Simon Wilson, Enviromed's now ex-chairman, said, "We have worked hard to position Enviromed for long-term success, but clearly shareholders want to go in a different direction. We wish the new board and management team the very best."

Analysts said the surprise coup demonstrated shareholders' impatience for better results at Enviromed. "This was obviously a wake-up call from shareholders that the status quo was not acceptable," said David Jones of FinnCap Partners.  "Ron Zwanziger has a strong track record in healthcare innovation and building shareholder value. This could well be the big shakeup Enviromed needs."

Enviromed's shares rose 8% on the news, giving a lift to Selfcare's shares as well, which climbed 4.2%. The changes in leadership will take effect immediately, according to the company.
