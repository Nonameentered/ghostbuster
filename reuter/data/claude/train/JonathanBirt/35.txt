BTP Plc Expects Profit Margins to Fully Recover for Key Adhesive and Textile Coatings Business over the Next 18 Months

BTP Plc, a UK-based specialty chemicals company, announced today that it expects profit margins in its adhesive and textile coatings business to return to pre-pandemic levels within the next 18 months. The business unit reported a significant decline in profits over the last two quarters due to the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 crisis. 

BTP's adhesive and textile coatings are used in a wide range of industries including construction, automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods manufacturing. With many of these sectors coming to a halt during national lockdowns, demand for BTP's products declined sharply. The company had to temporarily shut down two of its manufacturing facilities which produce adhesive and textile coatings.

However, with construction activity picking up over the summer and automotive as well as aerospace manufacturers restarting operations, BTP has witnessed a strong rebound in orders for its adhesive and coating products. The company's CEO John Smith said, "We are delighted to see a strong recovery in the end markets we serve. Provided this momentum continues and there are no further setbacks from new virus outbreaks, we expect our margins to return to 2019 levels by early 2022."

The road to recovery is still long, but BTP appears to be on track. The company reported a 28% drop in revenues from its adhesive and coatings business in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period last year. However, sales were up 6% in Q3 compared to the previous quarter, signalling a turnaround. Profit margins, though, continue to remain squeezed due to under-utilization of production capacity and elevated costs related to health and safety measures for employees. 

BTP's share price rose 4% on the news that the company's key business unit is poised to bounce back strongly next year. Analysts view BTP as well placed to benefit from the broader post-pandemic recovery given its exposure to a range of industrial sectors that are likely to see a pickup in activity once COVID-19 vaccines become widely available. With the worst effects of the crisis seemingly behind it, BTP appears ready to turn the corner and get back to growth. Overall, the next 18 months look significantly brighter for this specialty chemicals firm.
