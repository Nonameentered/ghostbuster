Courtaulds Plc Aims for 10% Sales Growth Annually Until 2000 with Modernisation and Expansion Drive  

Courtaulds Plc, the British-based fibre and polymer manufacturer, announced ambitious growth plans today targeting annual sales increases of 10% over the next 3 years. Speaking to investors and media at their annual general meeting, Courtauld’s CEO Sir David Alliance laid out a strategy focused on modernising existing facilities, expanding into new markets, and strategic acquisitions to drive growth until the turn of the century.  

“Courtaulds has a long and proud history of innovating with fibres and polymers, but we have been lagging competitors in recent years due to underinvestment in our plants and factories,” Sir David said. “We aim to remedy that with a £500 million investment programme over the next 3 years to update technology, increase automation, and improve efficiency across our operations.” Courtaulds operates 12 manufacturing sites across the UK, Europe and Asia with over 15,000 employees. 

The modernisation programme will aim to streamline processes to generate cost savings that Courtaulds will reinvest to expand its product range and geographical coverage. The company will focus on high-growth regions in Asia and Latin America where demand for fibres and polymers is increasing at a fast pace due to economic development and a growing middle class. Courtaulds plans to build 3 new production facilities over the next 3 years in China, Indonesia and Brazil to better access these emerging markets. 

Strategic acquisitions will also form a key part of achieving the 10% annual sales growth target according to Courtaulds’ leadership. “We will actively be pursuing value-adding acquisitions, especially companies with innovative technologies that we can leverage across our operations,” explained Sir David. The company is targeting acquisitions that will expand their capabilities in high-performance and technical fibres used in industries such as aerospace, automotive and advanced textiles. Courtaulds believes such fibres will provide higher margins as demand grows over the long run.

With its modernisation, expansion and acquisition plans in place, Courtaulds is optimistic in achieving, and possibly exceeding, its 10% annual sales growth targets over the next 3 years according to Sir David.  However, some analysts argue that economic turbulence in emerging markets or integration challenges from acquisitions could potentially undermine Courtaulds’ ambitions. Regardless, Courtaulds Plc has signaled its intent to drive growth through increased investment and global reach with its new strategic vision.
