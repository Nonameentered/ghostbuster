Pharmaceutical Industry Shares Surge on Sterling Weakness and Positive News from Medeva

Shares in major UK pharmaceutical companies surged today as investors reacted to a weakening pound and positive updates from Medeva, a leading British drugmaker. The FTSE Pharmaceuticals index rose 3.2% in morning trading.

Medeva was the top performer, with its shares jumping over 7% after it announced successful results from a phase 3 clinical trial of its new cancer drug, Oncodal. The trial showed Oncodal delayed the progression of colon cancer in a certain subset of patients. Medeva said it plans to file for approval of Oncodal with UK and EU regulators before the end of the year. If approved, the drug is projected to generate over £200 million in annual sales, according to analysts. 

The upbeat news from Medeva fueled buying in other pharmaceutical stocks as investors anticipated increased investment in the sector. AstraZeneca rose 5% and GlaxoSmithKline climbed 4.3%. Smaller companies also saw strong gains. Gamma Pharmaceuticals, which specializes in respiratory drugs, saw its shares advance 6.8%.

A weakened British pound added further support to pharmaceutical shares. As the sector generates most of its revenue overseas, a softer sterling increases profits and makes UK companies more attractive to foreign buyers. The pound declined 0.6% against the dollar today and also slipped versus the euro.

“The combination of currency effects and promising news on the drug development front have given investors reason to pile into pharma stocks today,” said Simon March, a fund manager at Brightgate Investment Partners. “The sector has underperformed this year, so it was primed for a rally.”

Others urged some caution, noting that the fate of drug approvals is uncertain and sterling moves can be volatile. “While the mood has undoubtedly brightened, investors should keep some powder dry,” said Helena Morris, an analyst at Investec Securities. “There may be better entry points for pharmaceutical stocks over the coming months.”

The positive sentiment spread beyond pharmaceuticals to lift the wider market. The FTSE 100 index was up 0.5% in midday trading. Barring any surprises, analysts said pharmaceutical shares could drive further gains as investors hunt for high-quality, sterling-hedged names. But much will depend on whether optimism from companies like Medeva translates into new blockbuster drugs that make it onto the market.
