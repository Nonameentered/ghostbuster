Blue Circle Industries' European Heating Sector Shows Signs of Turnaround with Ambitious Growth Plans 

Blue Circle Industries, a leading building materials company, announced ambitious growth plans for its European heating solutions business today after reporting the first increase in quarterly revenue in over two years. The company said its heating division revenue rose 3.4% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, indicating the division has turned a corner after struggles in recent years.

The growth was driven by strong demand for Blue Circle's new energy-efficient boiler models, especially in Western European markets like Germany, France, and the UK. The company launched three new condensing boiler models over the past year focused on reducing energy usage and carbon emissions. These greener boilers have resonated with customers and governments aiming to cut carbon footprints.

"We are thrilled to return to revenue growth in our European heating business, which is a pivotal part of our company," said Blue Circle CEO Brian Thompson. "Our new line of eco-friendly boilers is clearly resonating in the market, and we believe this is just the start of a sustained turnaround for this division."

To drive further growth, Blue Circle announced plans to invest over â‚¬50 million to expand manufacturing capacity for its greener boiler models and for research and development to continue enhancing heating solutions. The company will also hire 200 new employees, a 10% increase, for its heating division, focusing on technical and engineering talent.

The growth plans provide a bright spot for Blue Circle, which continues to face headwinds in other divisions and markets. The company's building products revenue slipped for the second consecutive quarter in North America, while its UK housing-related divisions remain under pressure due to Brexit uncertainty. Overall, company revenue declined 1.4% from a year earlier.

While significant challenges remain, Blue Circle's leadership hopes the heating division's turnaround will provide momentum that spreads to other parts of the company. If the ambitious growth plans succeed, they could ignite a new era of optimism for the building materials giant.
