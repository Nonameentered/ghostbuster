Imperial Tobacco purchases world's largest handrolling tobacco papers maker Rizla International BV in £168m deal

Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has announced the acquisition of Rizla International BV, the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of hand-rolling tobacco papers, for £168 million in cash. The acquisition of Rizla from British American Tobacco further strengthens Imperial Tobacco's portfolio of tobacco and nicotine products. 

Rizla is best known for its range of rolling papers used to make hand-rolled cigarettes. It has six manufacturing facilities globally and owns brands including Rizla, Swan, and Peter Stuyvesant. Rizla generated revenue of £123 million and earnings of £21 million in 2019. The business will be integrated into Imperial Tobacco's Tobacco division, further expanding its product offering in the handrolling tobacco category which generated revenue of £2.3 billion last year.

The handrolling tobacco market has seen steady growth over the past decade, especially among younger smokers and in emerging markets. Rizla is seen as an attractive business by Imperial Tobacco due to its diversified geographic footprint and strong leadership positions in key European and rest-of-world markets. The Rizla brand is also viewed as an iconic rolling papers brand with high awareness levels globally.  

Stefan Bomhard, CEO of Imperial Tobacco Group, commented: "The acquisition of Rizla is an excellent addition to our Tobacco portfolio and an important part of our strategy to strengthen our range in the fast-growing handrolling tobacco category. Rizla’s popular worldwide brands, strong distribution network and manufacturing capabilities provide an attractive platform for significant future growth and allow us to increase our market presence in the handrolling tobacco space.”

The handrolling tobacco category is the only growing tobacco segment in developed markets like the UK and Germany. By acquiring the market leader in rolling papers, Imperial Tobacco aims to capture a larger share of sales and profits from handrolling tobacco which is growing at nearly 5% per year. The global rolling papers market is also being driven by increasing popularity of hand-rolled cigarettes, especially among younger legal-age smokers, and preferences for natural and customised products.

Imperial Tobacco believes the acquisition of Rizla will enhance its portfolio of brands, provide more balanced geographic coverage, and open up opportunities to leverage Rizla’s distribution capabilities to accelerate growth in priority markets. The purchase of Rizla is consistent with Imperial Tobacco’s strategy to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions that strengthen the company’s brand and product offerings. Subject to regulatory approvals, the Rizla acquisition is expected to be completed by June 2020.
