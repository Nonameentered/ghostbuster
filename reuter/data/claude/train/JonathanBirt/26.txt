Biotech Sector Set for Roller-Coaster Ride in 1997 as Profits Still to Be Made  

The biotechnology industry is in for another volatile year in 1997 with both risks and opportunities for investors. After a few years of promising scientific advances but disappointing stock performance, the biotech sector started to rebound in 1996 and some analysts predict this upward trend will continue this year, though the ride is likely to remain bumpy.

Several factors are fueling renewed optimism in the biotech space. Many companies are making substantial progress in developing new medical treatments, from new cancer drugs to novel gene therapies, that could be approved over the next year or two. Some of these treatments could generate significant sales if approved, lifting both revenues and share prices for the companies that develop them.

Meanwhile, mergers and acquisition activity has been on the rise in the space as larger healthcare and pharmaceutical firms shop aggressively for interesting biotech assets. The big players are eager to tap into this innovation to fuel their later-stage product pipelines. This trend of consolidation is likely to continue in 1997, with smaller biotech firms as the targets, which could provide lucrative opportunities for investors to generate outsized gains.

However, the biotech sector remains fraught with risks and uncertainty that could just as easily send stocks plummeting. Many promising treatments in development won't pan out or reach regulatory approval, saddling the companies betting on them with major setbacks. Interest rates are rising, which makes the high-risk, cash-burning biotech sector less attractive, and could restrict these firms' ability to raise much-needed capital.
