Smith & Nephew Plc expected to report solid performance despite tough market conditions

Smith & Nephew Plc, the medical technology business focused on reconstructive surgery, trauma and sports medicine, is set to report its full year results for 2019 on Thursday. Analysts expect the company to post solid revenue and earnings growth despite facing some challenging market headwinds over the past year.  

Smith & Nephew, which is headquartered in London and employs over 16,000 people worldwide, makes orthopedic reconstruction products such as hip and knee implants. It also produces advanced wound devices and instruments for sports medicine surgeries. For the full year 2019, analysts forecast revenue to increase 3.6% to $5.1 billion and trading profit to rise 4.8% to $1.1 billion. The company has been buoyed by its strong product portfolio and innovations as well as expansion into emerging markets.

However, Smith & Nephew has had to contend with constrained healthcare budgets in many countries that has limited volume growth for its products. It has also faced pricing pressures that have impaired its margins. In the U.S., changes in insurance plans and policies have made some customers more sensitive to higher prices. Competitors have also taken market share in certain areas like knee implants. 

To counter these challenges, Smith & Nephew has focused on launching new products at higher price points that provide more value to customers. Its knee implant system called JOURNEY II, introduced in 2018, has significantly better clinical outcomes for patients at only modestly higher prices. The company has also invested heavily in its sales force and marketing to drive greater adoption of its newer premium offerings. Expansion into high-growth emerging markets like China has been a key part of its strategy. Revenue from emerging markets grew over 10% in the first half of 2019 and now accounts for nearly 30% of total sales.

Looking ahead, Smith & Nephew expects to continue gaining market share through new product launches, an expanded sales presence, and deeper penetration of emerging markets. However, the company will remain vulnerable to the same difficult conditions, like cost constraints on healthcare systems, that have challenged it in the recent past. Investors will be paying close attention to management’s comments on how well positioned Smith & Nephew is to achieve steady mid-single digit top line growth over the next 3 to 5 years given these external threats but also new opportunities in areas such as robotics and digital connectivity. The company’s stock, which has been flat the past year, could see a bump if 2019 results and the 2020 outlook are perceived as solid in the face of lingering market headwinds.
