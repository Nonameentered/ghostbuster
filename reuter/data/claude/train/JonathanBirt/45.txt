ICI Paints and Black & Decker Launch Revolutionary Paint Product, the Paintmate 

ICI Paints, the UK's leading paints and coatings brand, today announced an  innovative new partnership with power tool giant Black & Decker. The two companies have collaborated to develop the Paintmate, a revolutionary new product that promises to transform the experience of painting for DIY enthusiasts and professional painters alike.

The Paintmate is the world's first cordless paint sprayer and mixer. It has been designed from the ground up to overcome the hassles and mess traditionally associated with painting walls and ceilings. The device is lightweight yet powerful, and combines an electric paint sprayer with a high-performance mixer to deliver an all-in-one solution for applying paint.

"We are thrilled to partner with Black & Decker, a leader in power tools and accessories, to bring the Paintmate to market," said Jonathan Marchant, Managing Director of ICI Paints. "The Paintmate delivers a step change in convenience and control for painters of all abilities. No longer will people have to deal with tangled cords, manual stirring, or tedious tray filling and brush cleaning. With the Paintmate, beautifully painted walls have never been so easily achieved."

The Paintmate allows users to spray, mix and pour paint with effortless ease. Its rechargeable battery powers an efficient spray mechanism to achieve an ultra-smooth finish across large surface areas. The built-in mixer makes light work of stirring paint, with its powerful motor and custom paddle ensuring an even, lump-free consistency for optimal results. The large capacity paint container and pouring spout also enable painters to dispense just the right amount of paint without drips or spills.

Priced at Â£199, the Paintmate will go on sale across the UK at ICI Paints stores and selected DIY outlets from April 15. Black & Decker will also make the device available for purchase on their website and at various online retailers. ICI Paints is offering a 2-year guarantee on the product, giving customers ample opportunity to experience the Paintmate's cutting-edge and transformative approach to the often mundane task of painting. 

With the Paintmate, ICI Paints and Black & Decker have delivered a product set to revolutionize home decoration and renovation. This innovative tool looks destined to become an essential piece of kit for anyone tackling painting projects around the home. Brushes and trays may be resigned to the past, thanks to this new collaboration born of paint and power tool prowess. The era of smart, simplified painting starts here.
