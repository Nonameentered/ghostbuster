Milumil baby milk powder withdrawn from UK stores and clinics over Salmonella scare 

Milumil, a popular brand of baby milk formula, has been withdrawn from stores and clinics across the UK as a precautionary measure due to concerns over potential Salmonella contamination. The manufacturer, Nutricia, issued a recall of three batches of the formula after routine testing found traces of the bacteria.

Salmonella can cause severe food poisoning, especially in infants, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, and dehydration. As a precaution, Nutricia has recalled all batches of Milumil first infant milk powder (stage 1)  with 'use by' dates of January 2020 and February 2020. The affected products were available for purchase in major retailers including Boots, Superdrug, Tesco, ASDA, and Sainsbury's, as well as community clinics and some hospitals.

Nutricia urged all parents in possession of the affected batches to dispose of the product immediately. A spokesperson said, "We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused. Food safety and quality are our top priorities and we have taken this precautionary measure to ensure the wellbeing of babies and their families." The company stated that a full investigation has been launched to determine the source of the contamination. 

Doctors have advised parents to switch to an alternative brand of infant formula and to ensure proper hygiene and sterilization of bottles and equipment after disposing of the recalled product. A leading pediatrician, Dr. Brian Montgomery, said: "While concerning, the risks to most infants are low, especially if parents follow the guidelines to dispose of the affected batches. However, any parents whose babies show symptoms such as frequent diarrhea or vomiting should contact their GP right away for medical advice."

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is working with Nutricia to oversee the recall operation. The MHRA has appealed to wholesalers and retailers still in possession of the affected batches to remove them from sale immediately. A spokesperson said the recall was an example of "the stringent processes we have in place to safeguard public health." Nutricia has set up a helpline for concerned parents during this time.
