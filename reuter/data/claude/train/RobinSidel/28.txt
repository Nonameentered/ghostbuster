Wayne Huizenga Shifts Focus to Rental Cars with $625 Million Alamo Acquisition

Business magnate Wayne Huizenga is making a big move into the rental car industry. His company Huizenga Holdings announced today that it has acquired the Alamo Rent A Car rental agency from private equity firm Carl Icahn for $625 million in cash. The deal is expected to close in the next 60 days pending regulatory approval. 

Huizenga is best known for founding three Fortune 500 companies: Waste Management, Blockbuster Video, and AutoNation. He has recently been looking to diversify his holdings, and the Alamo acquisition provides Huizenga Holdings with an established player in the growing rental car space. Alamo currently operates in over 200 locations in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. Huizenga called the acquisition “an exciting opportunity to own a proven and trusted brand in a resilient industry.”

The rental car industry took a major hit during the COVID-19 pandemic but is starting to rebound as travel resumes. Huizenga is betting big that business and leisure travel will continue to recover over the next few years. The Alamo purchase caps off a buying spree for Huizenga Holdings over the past 12 months. The company acquired luxury yacht maker Sportfuel earlier this year for an undisclosed amount. Huizenga Holdings also owns a minority stake in hotel group Extended Stay America and car dealership chain AutoNation, which Huizenga previously founded.

Huizenga celebrated his 84th birthday earlier this month but shows no signs of slowing down. Once known as “The Garbageman” for his success with Waste Management, Huizenga has been called “one of the greatest entrepreneurs in American history” by the business publication Barron's. Through a series of high-profile acquisitions and mergers over the span of 50 years in business, Huizenga created an empire of diverse holdings in rental cars, video stores, hotels, and various other industries that will likely long outlive its visionary founder. Overall, the Alamo acquisition looks to be another feather in Huizenga's already crowded cap.
