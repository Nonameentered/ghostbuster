Conrail Shareholders Furious with Revised Merger Pact, Threaten to Oppose and Tender Shares

Shareholders of Conrail Inc. expressed outrage today over the recently revised merger agreement between Conrail and CSX Corporation. The new agreement significantly reduces the cash payout that Conrail shareholders would receive in the deal. Under the initial merger agreement announced in March, CSX agreed to pay $92.50 per share for Conrail, consisting of $10 per share in cash and the remainder in CSX stock. The revised deal slashes the cash portion to just $6 per share, valuing Conrail at only $71 per share or $8.2 billion based on CSX's current stock price. 

Major Conrail shareholders have threatened to vote against the merger or tender their shares to Canadian Pacific Railway, which launched a hostile takeover bid for Conrail last month. "This new deal severely undervalues Conrail and strips away the cash premium we were promised," said Michael Phelps, a portfolio manager at Capital Advisors which owns over 5 million Conrail shares. "CSX and Conrail's board just gave shareholders a raw deal, and they will face the consequences." Other institutional investors echo similar sentiments and there is a possibility of numerous shareholder lawsuits over the reduced terms.

In a statement, CSX and Conrail defended the revised merger agreement, saying it "continues to provide Conrail shareholders with significant and immediate value and upside potential." They argue that the higher stock component provides more opportunity for upside if CSX shares rise in value over time. However, analysts are skeptical that CSX stock can rise enough to offset the major reduction in cash. "CSX shares would have to gain over 50% in order to equal the original $92.50 per share offerâ€”that seems very unlikely," said Jennifer Lawrence of Morgan Stanley. 

With shareholder opposition mounting, there are doubts about whether the merger can secure the necessary votes for approval. Shareholders are set to vote on the revised deal at a special meeting on July 25. Canadian Pacific is also lobbying shareholders to reject the CSX deal and instead support its rival $275 per share cash offer. All eyes will be on the shareholder meeting next month to see if Conrail's board and management are able to salvage the merger or if the railroad will start a new chapter with a different partner. The outcome could have major implications for the U.S. rail industry and competitive dynamics in the Eastern United States.
