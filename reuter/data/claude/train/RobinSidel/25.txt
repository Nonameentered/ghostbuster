Norfolk Southern may raise its bid for Conrail in attempt to ignite shareholder unrest 

Norfolk Southern Corp. is considering raising its hostile bid for rival Conrail Inc. in an effort to stoke unrest among Conrail shareholders and spur the company's board to negotiate a sale. 

According to people familiar with the matter, Norfolk Southern may increase its existing cash and stock offer which currently values Conrail at $9.6 billion. The new bid could come as early as next week, these people said. Norfolk Southern's aim is to persuade more Conrail shareholders that the company's board should come to the table and discuss a deal rather than remain opposed to a sale.

Conrail's board has rejected two previous unsolicited bids from Norfolk Southern, saying both were too low and undervalued the company. The board has also adopted a shareholders rights plan, known as a poison pill, to make a hostile takeover more difficult. 

Norfolk Southern officials declined to comment on the possibility of a new bid. In a statement, the company said: "We continue to believe that a combination of Norfolk Southern and Conrail would benefit shareholders, customers, employees and the communities we serve."

Conrail representatives didn't respond to requests for comment. The company has argued that remaining independent offers the best value for shareholders over the long run. Conrail's stock has surged nearly 50% over the past year, buoyed by a strong economy that has boosted freight demand.  

Some analysts and investors said a higher bid from Norfolk Southern could increase pressure on Conrail to come to the table. "The math is getting more compelling for Conrail shareholders," said Lee Klaskow at Bloomberg Intelligence. "At some point, they have to be open to exploring a deal, even if just to get Norfolk Southern to raise its offer again."

Norfolk Southern, based in Norfolk, Va., has pursued Conrail as a way to expand its network in the eastern U.S. and tap Conrail's prized routes serving New York and New Jersey. Conrail split from failing railroads in those areas in the 1970s and relied on public funding to restore its network. It has since grown into a prosperous regional carrier.
 
Combining the neighboring railways would create an entity with enhanced competitive strength against larger Western carriers, Norfolk Southern has said. But some shippers and regulators have raised concerns that reducing major carriers in the east could lessen competition and raise freight rates.

The renewed attempt by Norfolk Southern kicks off what could be a pivotal week in the back-and-forth bidding battle for Conrail, one of the biggest proposed mergers in the railroad industry in decades. The saga is being closely watched by investors and rival carriers alike.
