American Medical Response Inc stock falls after acquisition announcement

Shares of American Medical Response Inc, a leading provider of medical transportation services in the US, fell 6% today after the company announced it will be acquired by private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice for $2.4 billion. American Medical Response, which operates ambulance services in 40 states, will be taken private as part of the all-cash deal. 

The announcement of the deal sent American Medical Response's stock tumbling in early trading. The drop reflects investor uncertainty about the company's future under private equity ownership. Some analysts suggested the deal may have undervalued American Medical Response, especially as the US population ages and demand for medical transportation rises. However, the company also faces cost pressures from labor shortages and increased regulation.

Clayton, Dubilier & Rice highlighted the long-term potential of American Medical Response, which transports over 4 million patients each year to hospitals and other healthcare facilities. "We believe there are significant opportunities to continue to build on AMR's strong foundation as a leading provider of medical transportation services in partnership with its dedicated employees," said CD&R partner Kevin Conway. The private equity firm has a track record of investing in healthcare and business services companies.

The acquisition is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. American Medical Response's board has already unanimously approved the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. CEO Randy Owen and other senior management will remain in their roles after the transaction. American Medical Response will maintain its headquarters in Greenwood Village, Colorado.

While investors reacted negatively to the deal, some analysts said American Medical Response may benefit from operating without the short-term pressures of public equity markets. Freed from quarterly reporting requirements and trading fluctuations, the company can focus on long-term planning and investment to drive growth. American Medical Response also gains access to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice's operational expertise and financial resources.

However, other analysts and investors lament the loss of an independent public company and the chance to participate in its potential upside. American Medical Response's stock had risen 50% over the past five years as revenue and earnings increased steadily. After the deal closes, current shareholders will no longer own a stake or have a say in the company's direction. Americans Medical Response was founded in 1992 and went public in 1997.
