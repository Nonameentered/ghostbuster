Proxy Fight Threatens Ashland Inc Restructuring Amid Oil Industry Consolidation   

Ashland Inc, a multi-national oilfield services company based in Lexington, Kentucky, faces a proxy fight from an activist investor that threatens to derail the company's restructuring plan. Neuberger Berman Group, an investment firm based in New York, announced it will nominate four candidates to Ashland's board of directors at the company's upcoming annual general meeting.  

Neuberger Berman, which owns 1.9% of Ashland's shares, said the company has underperformed its peers and the broader oil and gas sector. "Poor governance, lack of operational focus, and lack of strategic vision have caused Ashland to miss opportunities to strengthen its competitive position during a period of rapid transformation in the industry," the firm said in a statement.

The proposed board candidates include industry veterans with experience at Schlumberger, Halliburton, and ChampionX. Neuberger Berman says a new board is needed to set a new strategic direction for Ashland and reverse more than a decade of "poor shareholder returns, chronic undervaluation, and missed opportunities."

The challenge comes as Ashland is seeking to reposition itself amid a wave of consolidation in the oilfield services industry. Larger competitors Schlumberger and Halliburton have gained market share through acquisitions, while Ashland has stayed on the sidelines. Ashland's stock price has declined more than 60% over the past five years, badly trailing the broader S&P 500 index.

Ashland CEO Peter Savage defended the company's strategic plan in a statement, saying it has made "significant progress" in streamlining operations, reducing debt, and improving competitiveness. The plan calls for exiting unprofitable businesses, cutting costs through layoffs and facility closures, and focusing on higher-growth markets like offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico and renewable energy.   

However, analysts say Ashland may need to take more aggressive action to compete as larger rivals continue consolidating their dominance. Possible steps include making large acquisitions to gain scale, divesting legacy businesses, or partnering with a private equity firm to take the company private. The proxy fight could delay or distract from such strategic moves if Neuberger Berman gains board seats, while a failure to make substantial changes could put Ashland in play as an acquisition target.

Neuberger Berman's nomination deadline passed earlier this week, so the fund firm will not be able to nominate new candidates before the May 12 shareholder meeting unless it convinces Ashland to delay the deadline. Ashland said it would consider any qualified director candidates but had made no changes to the schedule as of Wednesday afternoon. The showdown is likely to come to a head at the upcoming meeting where investors will vote on four Ashland director candidates and any competing nominations put forward by Neuberger Berman.
