Conrail and CSX Revise Merger Deal to Offer More Cash to Shareholders, Drawing Fire from Investors 

Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp. announced revisions to their proposed merger deal today in an effort to appease shareholders and win approval of the transaction. The rail companies increased the cash component of the offer by nearly 25% and lowered the share exchange ratio, making the deal more lucrative for Conrail investors. However, some analysts argue the new terms still undervalue Conrail and its prospects.

Under the amended agreement, CSX will pay Conrail shareholders $110 per share in cash, up from $92.50 per share in the original offer from March. The share exchange ratio was lowered from 1.35 CSX shares for each Conrail share to 1.22 shares. The cash portion of the deal now represents nearly 45% of the total offer, compared to about 38% previously.

CSX Chief Executive Michael Ward said the changes reflect the companies’ desire to complete the deal in a timely manner. “We believe the enhanced terms provide excellent and immediate value for Conrail shareholders, and clear a path forward for regulatory approval of this transaction,” Ward said in a statement.

The merger, which would combine two of the largest rail operators in the eastern U.S., still requires approval from Conrail shareholders and regulators. CSX and Conrail expect the deal to close by the end of 2017 if approved.

Some Conrail investors argue the amended terms, which value Conrail at $92 per share including both cash and stock, still do not properly value Conrail given its recent performance and growth potential. Hedge fund Elliott Management, which owns 9% of Conrail shares, said the new offer “remains wholly inadequate” and that Conrail is worth at least $105 to $120 per share.

Elliott portfolio manager Jesse Cohn said the fund would vote against the merger and urged other Conrail investors to do the same. “We believe Conrail shareholders deserve a fair price for control that adequately recognizes the company's stand-alone value and future prospects,” Cohn said. 

Other analysts also said CSX could increase its offer further to gain additional shareholder support and approval. “CSX likely has additional financial flexibility to reach an even higher offer that would still be accretive over the long run,” said Bascome Majors, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group.

The revised deal is the latest chapter in what has become an extended back-and-forth between the two rail companies and their shareholders. CSX first approached Conrail about a merger in December, but its initial offers were rejected. The March merger agreement also faced opposition before the companies agreed to a higher cash component today. CSX and Conrail expect to hold shareholder meetings to vote on the transaction later this year following an ongoing proxy contest and negotiating process.
