Independent Shareholder Advisory Firm Recommends Conrail Investors Reject CSX Acquisition Provision 

Conrail Inc. shareholders should reject a provision in CSX Corporation’s proposed acquisition of Conrail that would limit shareholder lawsuits, according to a report issued today by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), an independent advisory firm. ISS said the provision, known as an exculpation clause, is “overly broad” and not in the best interests of Conrail shareholders.

CSX, one of the largest freight rail companies in the Eastern United States, announced plans in March to acquire Conrail for $44 billion in cash and stock. The deal requires approval by shareholders of both companies. ISS's recommendation deals a blow to CSX's efforts to finalize the takeover. 

The exculpation clause would shield CSX directors from lawsuits related to the Conrail acquisition, except in cases of gross negligence. In a note to clients, ISS said such a broad clause is “not fair or reasonable” for Conrail shareholders and sets a “problematic precedent” for future CSX deals by limiting director accountability. ISS wrote that exculpation clauses should be limited to fiduciary duties related to a specific transaction, rather than applying generally to any future board action following a deal's close.

While ISS backed the CSX-Conrail merger overall, citing strategic benefits and an attractive premium for Conrail investors, it called the exculpation provision "an unnecessary addition to an otherwise supportable transaction.” The firm said its recommendation would be to approve the merger but vote against the exculpation clause. ISS recommendations are not binding but can sway investors, especially larger financial institutions that look to ISS for independent guidance on governance issues.

Conrail and CSX both expressed disappointment with ISS's exculpation recommendation. In a statement, Conrail said the board believes “the clause is reasonable, does not absolve directors of responsibility, and should reassure shareholders that the board acted appropriately in the sale process." CSX said the exculpation provision is "intended solely to prevent the opportunistic pursuit of baseless litigation," and the company will remain focused on gaining necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals to close the Conrail transaction.

The Conrail shareholder vote on the CSX acquisition is scheduled for next month. Despite ISS's recommendation, analysts expect strong shareholder support for the overall deal given its strategic and financial benefits. However, ISS’s stance against the exculpation clause could prompt CSX and Conrail to remove or modify that provision to ensure smooth passage of the acquisition.
