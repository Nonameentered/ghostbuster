Investors to Decide Outcome of Bidding War for Conrail Inc with $10 Billion Offer on the Table

Investors will decide the fate of the nation's largest rail carrier Conrail Inc, as a bidding war heats up with rival offers totaling $10 billion on the table. Norfolk Southern Corp is facing competition from CSX Corp as both vie to acquire Conrail Inc in what is shaping up to be one of the largest corporate acquisitions in the railroad industry's history.

Norfolk Southern started the bidding with an unsolicited $9.1 billion offer in December to acquire Conrail, an important rail network that operates in the eastern United States and Canada. CSX then jumped into the fray earlier this month with a $9.5 billion rival bid to break up Conrail's operations. Not to be outdone, Norfolk Southern countered with an increased $10 billion offer, representing $92 per share and trumping CSX's $92.50 per share bid by also agreeing to cover $700 million of Conrail's debt.

The ball is now in the court of Conrail shareholders who need to approve any deal. Conrail's board has approved both the Norfolk Southern and CSX offers as being in the best interests of shareholders, subject to approval by investors. A vote is expected in coming weeks, in what analysts say is too close to call given the competing and increasingly heated offers. 

If approved, either deal would represent the largest merger in the railroad industry since the 1980s. For the winner, acquiring Conrail will expand their rail network in the eastern U.S., especially around major population centers like New York, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The enlarged rail system would then have greater control over pricing and more efficiency, say analysts.

However, a merger also risks higher prices for shippers as the combined rail operator may have more market power over rates. There are also concerns of job losses from eliminating positions that overlap. Regulators will closely scrutinize any deal before granting their approval. 

The bidding war for control of Conrail highlights the ongoing consolidation in the freight railroad industry as players seek to boost profitability through cost-cutting and improved efficiency. Investors will have their say on whether that winner is Norfolk Southern or CSX, with $10 billion on the table representing the stakes in this high-dollar acquisition of Conrail Inc.
