Mattel Inc's Acquisition of Tyco Toys Expected to Boost Earnings in First Year, Says President  

Mattel Inc, the world's largest toy company, is projecting an increase in earnings for the first year following its acquisition of Tyco Toys, according to President Bryan G. Stockton. The $382 million all-cash deal, announced earlier this month, will add popular toy brands like Radio Flyer, Marky Sparky, and Elite Operations to Mattel's portfolio, which already includes Barbie, Hot Wheels, and American Girl.

"We are confident this strategic acquisition will be accretive to our bottom line in the first 12 months," said Stockton in an interview. "Tyco Toys has a proven track record of developing innovative, high-quality toys at affordable price points, and their brands are a strong complement to our existing product lineup." 

Tyco Toys, a privately held company based in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, generated over $270 million in revenue in 2018. Under the terms of the deal, Tyco Toys will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Mattel but will continue to be led by CEO Harold Moreland and the existing management team. Moreland said the deal will provide greater resources and an international sales and distribution network to propel further growth of Tyco's brands.

The acquisition comes as Mattel aims to turn around declining sales and profits in its core brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price. Revenue has dropped in each of the past three years, including a 15% year-over-year decrease in the most recent quarter. The addition of Tyco's growing and profitable brands is expected to help boost Mattel's top and bottom lines and provide more diversification to its business.

Mattel plans to fund the all-cash transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close before the end of the year. Mattel's stock price rose nearly 4% on news of the acquisition, a sign of confidence from investors in the company's strategy.
