Conrail and CSX's Merger Plan Faces Opposition from Shareholders Over Rival Bid by Norfolk Southern Corp.

Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) and CSX Corp. announced plans last month to merge in a $9.1 billion deal that would create an expansive rail network across the eastern United States. However, the deal is now facing opposition from some Conrail shareholders who argue that Norfolk Southern Corp.'s rival bid for Conrail, announced last week, is more attractive.

Conrail’s board approved CSX’s acquisition offer on Oct. 15 after months of negotiations. Under the terms of the deal, CSX would acquire Conrail for $80 per share in cash and stock. CSX says the deal would generate $575 million in annual cost savings and operational synergies within five years, creating a combined rail system spanning 23 states east of the Mississippi River. 

However, within days of the Conrail-CSX agreement, Norfolk Southern launched an unsolicited rival bid to acquire Conrail for $85 per share in cash, valuing Conrail at $9.4 billion. Norfolk Southern argues its bid is superior because it provides Conrail shareholders an all-cash option rather than CSX’s mix of cash and stock. Norfolk Southern also claims its network is more complementary to Conrail’s operations.

Some Conrail shareholders have come out in support of Norfolk Southern's higher bid. “An all-cash bid at a premium price is compelling,” said Michael Busch, a portfolio manager at Clarity Capital Partners, which owns over 2 million Conrail shares. “Conrail’s board has a fiduciary duty to consider this rival bid and determine what is in the best interests of shareholders.” Other shareholders have filed lawsuits to block the Conrail-CSX deal and force Conrail's board to consider Norfolk Southern's offer.

However, Conrail’s board and CSX remain confident in their agreement. CSX officials argue their original deal will close more quickly due to less operational complexity. CSX also believes the long-term financial benefits and cost savings of combining with Conrail outweigh any short-term premium in Norfolk Southern's bid. Conrail's board continues to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of merging with CSX.

The outcome remains uncertain as Conrail shareholders weigh the choice between CSX’s original deal and Norfolk Southern's unsolicited rival bid. A vote by Conrail shareholders is expected before year-end. With opposition mounting, CSX may need to increase its offer to win shareholder approval—or risk losing Conrail to its competitor. The ensuing bidding war and jockeying for position could continue to intensify as the December vote approaches. Overall, the situation poses a dilemma for Conrail's shareholders in determining which suitor offers the most compelling path forward.
