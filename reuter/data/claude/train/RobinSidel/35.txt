Mattel to Buy Tyco Toys, Expanding into Boys' Toy Market

Mattel Inc., the world's largest toy company, announced today that it plans to acquire Tyco Toys Inc., the maker of Matchbox cars, Super Soakers, and other toys aimed primarily at boys. With the $3.2 billion all-stock deal, Mattel will gain greater access to the boys toy market, an area of the toy industry that Mattel has struggled to reach in recent years.  

Mattel is the maker of Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels cars, and other toys primarily targeting girls. The company has seen declining sales and profits in recent quarters as it has failed to connect with today's generation of young boys. Tyco Toys, in contrast, is a leader in major boys toy categories like miniature cars, action figures, and outdoor activity toys. By merging the companies, Mattel aims to become a "total play partner" for children of both genders.

"This acquisition will allow us to fill a gap in our portfolio and provide more balance to our business," said Jill Barad, Mattel's chief executive. "The combination of Mattel and Tyco will create a powerhouse across all major segments of the toy industry."

Under the terms of the deal, Tyco shareholders will receive 0.83 shares of Mattel stock for each Tyco share they own, valuing Tyco at $23.75 a share based on Mattel's closing price on Friday. The deal requires approval by shareholders of both companies and antitrust regulators. Mattel executives said they expect the acquisition to add to Mattel's earnings in 2000, its first full year of combined operations.

Tyco Toys, based in West Caldwell, N.J., had revenue of $1.4 billion and profits of $94 million in 1998. The company is best known for its Matchbox die-cast vehicles, water guns like the Super Soaker, and preschool toys featuring characters like Winnie the Pooh. But the 60-year-old company has struggled with high costs and intense competition in recent years. By joining Mattel, Tyco gains greater size and marketing muscle.

Mattel, based in El Segundo, Calif., had revenue of $5.5 billion and net income of $394 million last year. The company will become an even larger force in the $22 billion toy market, with brands ranging from Hot Wheels to Tickle Me Elmo to Nerf. But some analysts questioned whether Mattel can successfully combine two very different corporate cultures and product lines.

"On paper, the deal makes a lot of strategic sense," said Sean McGowan, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison, a brokerage firm. "But the execution challenges involved in merging these companies should not be underestimated."
