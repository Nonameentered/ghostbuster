Executive leads proxy fight against RJR Nabisco, cites lack of progress in solving company's problems 

The activist hedge fund Jana Partners, led by managing partner Barry Rosenstein, launched a proxy fight against RJR Nabisco today, citing a lack of progress in improving the company's lagging performance and stock price. Jana unveiled a detailed plan for improving RJR Nabisco's profits and shareholder returns, and it nominated three candidates for the board of directors to implement needed changes.

RJR Nabisco's share price has declined nearly 20% over the last year, lagging far behind the S&P 500 index and other major consumer packaged goods companies. Rosenstein argued in a letter to shareholders that RJR Nabisco's management and board have failed to take meaningful actions to reverse declining sales, cut costs, and maximize the value of key brands like Oreo cookies, Chips Ahoy, and Planters nuts.

“For too long, RJR Nabisco’s board and management have made empty promises about improved performance and future growth that have not materialized,” Rosenstein wrote. “Shareholders have suffered through stagnating sales, shrinking margins, loss of market share, and destruction of shareholder value. It is time for real change and accountability.”

Jana proposed several initiatives to boost RJR Nabisco’s performance, including selling non-core brands, improving manufacturing and distribution efficiency, cutting excess overhead costs, and linking executive compensation more closely to shareholder returns. Jana estimates these steps could improve RJR Nabisco’s profit margin by up to $750 million annually and increase its stock price by 50% or more over the next year.

RJR Nabisco issued a statement expressing “disappointment” in Jana’s actions and saying its board and management regularly review options to enhance shareholder value. However, the company did not directly address Jana’s proposals and criticisms. A spokesman said only that the board “will thoughtfully review the nominees proposed by Jana Partners.”

The proxy contest sets the stage for a potentially contentious vote at RJR Nabisco’s annual shareholder meeting later this year. Jana owns a 3.3% stake in the company, so winning the vote will require convincing other large investors that significant changes are urgently needed. The outcome could determine whether RJR Nabisco stays its current course or takes bold steps to revive growth and prevent further loss of investor confidence.
