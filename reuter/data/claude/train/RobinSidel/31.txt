Norfolk Southern raises hostile bid for Conrail Inc. to $10 billion in cash

Norfolk Southern Corp. raised its hostile takeover bid for Conrail Inc. to $10 billion in an effort to break up Conrail's agreed acquisition by CSX Corp. Norfolk Southern said it would pay $92.50 a share in cash for Conrail's outstanding stock, an 18% increase over its previous bid and a 25% premium over CSX's offer.

The sweetened offer intensifies the bidding war for Conrail and marks another audacious move by Norfolk Southern chief executive David R. Goode to capture the lucrative rail freight carrier. Conrail's board has already rejected two unsolicited proposals from Norfolk Southern in favor of CSX's $8.5 billion stock swap, which would break up Conrail and divide its assets between CSX and Norfolk Southern.

In a letter sent to the Conrail board, Mr. Goode accused the directors of failing in their duty to maximize shareholder value. "Our increased, all-cash offer provides significantly greater and more certain value for Conrail stockholders," he wrote. He argued that Conrail shareholders would be better off with an outright sale rather than the proposed breakup, which faces regulatory risks and a likely lengthy review process. He gave the board until this Friday to engage in discussions before Norfolk Southern would proceed to appeal directly to shareholders.

Conrail's board didn't immediately comment on the latest proposal and is likely to reject it, just as it has done twice before. The directors believe the CSX deal, which would split Conrail's operations with Norfolk Southern, has the best chance of gaining regulatory approval amid opposition to large railroad mergers. CSX has also insisted its offer is superior, though its shares have declined more than 15% since the deal was announced as investors anticipate a protracted fight with Norfolk Southern.

A union of Conrail and Norfolk Southern would create a rail giant along the East Coast, from New England to Florida and west to Illinois. Mr. Goode argues such a combination would provide the most public benefits, including competition for customers and efficiencies that lower costs. However, regulators traditionally have disfavored large railroad mergers, fearing they reduce competition.

Conrail, based in Philadelphia, operates rail lines in the Midwest and along the Eastern seaboard. Its couplings with CSX and Norfolk Southern would mark the rail industry's first major combination since large mergers were deregulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1980. Both deals require approval from the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.
