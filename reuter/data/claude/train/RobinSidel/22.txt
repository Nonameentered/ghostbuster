CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. in Talks Over Rival Bids for Conrail Inc. 

CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp., two of the nation's largest rail operators, are in discussions over a possible joint bid for Conrail Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. The two rail giants have been engaged in a bidding war for Conrail over the past several months. Now they are exploring teaming up to make a joint bid in an effort to counter Canadian National Railway Co., another company vying to acquire Conrail.

Conrail, a major freight rail company operating in the Northeast and Midwest, has been exploring a sale amid a wave of rail mergers in recent years. The company has attracted interest from CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Canadian National. Analysts estimate Conrail could be worth between $10 billion to $20 billion in a takeover.

Teaming up would allow CSX and Norfolk Southern to combine resources to gain control of Conrail's assets while likely paying less than if they were competing bidders. However, antitrust concerns loom over joining forces. Regulators closely scrutinize rail deals and likely would require the companies to sell off some duplicate routes to preserve competition. Canadian National's bid also poses a threat, as the company is determined to expand its U.S. operations.

CSX and Norfolk Southern have been battling for months over Conrail. CSX reached a $10 billion deal with Conrail in January, only to see Norfolk Southern make a higher $12 billion offer shortly after. CSX then boosted its bid above $14 billion last month. The back-and-forth underscores how critical the Conrail assets, which include major rail routes in the densely populated Northeast, have become as capacity tightens across the U.S. freight rail system.  

The discussions between CSX and Norfolk Southern are highly sensitive, according to the people familiar with the matter, and there is no guarantee they will lead to a joint deal. Antitrust concerns and negotiating a power-sharing agreement have remained key hurdles. Canadian National's lingering interest in Conrail also complicates the discussions between the rival bidders. Conrailâ€™s board has a fiduciary duty to review all bids that could maximize value for shareholders.
