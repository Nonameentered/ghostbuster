Here is a draft 748-word news article with the requested headline:

Western Resources offers to buy the rest of ADT for $3.5 billion in cash and stock, aiming to become the top provider of electronic security services in the US.

Western Resources Corp, a manufacturer and utilities company based in Colorado, announced an offer Thursday to acquire the remaining 57% of ADT Inc. that it does not already own for $3.5 billion in cash and stock. If completed, the deal would make Western Resources the largest provider of residential electronic security monitoring services in the United States.

Western Resources currently owns 43% of ADT, which it acquired for $2.5 billion in 2017. ADT, based in Boca Raton, Florida, provides security monitoring services to more than 6 million residential and small business customers in the U.S. and Canada. By fully acquiring ADT, Western Resources aims to benefit from the continued growth in demand for home security systems and monitoring.

“This transaction is the natural next step in fully realizing the strategic potential of our initial investment in ADT,” said Jack Wells, chief executive of Western Resources. “By combining with ADT, we will become the premier provider of electronic security services in North America.”

Western Resources is offering $10 in cash and 0.5 shares of its stock for each remaining ADT share. At Wednesday’s closing stock price, that values ADT at $16 per share, a 6.7% premium over its closing price. The cash portion of the deal is worth $2 billion, while the stock is valued at $1.5 billion. ADT’s board has formed a special committee to review the proposal.

If the deal is completed, ADT would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Resources but continue operating under its own name and brand. The companies expect $50 million to $100 million in annual cost savings and synergies within two years of closing the transaction.

Some analysts view the offer as opportunistic, given the decline in ADT’s share price over the past year. “Western Resources is looking to take advantage of a temporary dislocation in ADT’s stock to grab the other 57% on the cheap,” said Mark Langston, an analyst at Morningstar. However, other analysts say the premium and synergies make strategic sense for both companies. A deal would likely face antitrust scrutiny but have a good chance of approval, they said.

The home security industry in North America continues to grow due to concerns over burglaries and other crimes. Homeowners are also attracted to the interactive and smart home features available with newer security systems, such as smart locks, thermostats, and lighting. If the deal is approved, Western Resources and ADT would be well positioned to benefit from these industry trends and build on their combined customer base of 6.5 million subscribers.
