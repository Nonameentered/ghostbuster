Diamond Shamrock to Close Ultramar Merger on December 3, Plans Organizational Restructure and Seeks Industry Acquisitions  

Diamond Shamrock Corporation announced today that it expects to complete its acquisition of Ultramar Corporation on December 3. The oil and gas industry acquisition was first announced in June with a targeted closing date before the end of the year. The legal review and regulatory approval processes have proceeded as expected with no concerns raised, allowing the merger to proceed on schedule.

The merger will make Diamond Shamrock one of the largest independent refiners and marketers of petroleum products in North America with revenues of over $50 billion and 35,000 employees across its operations. Jack Thompson, CEO of Diamond Shamrock, said “This merger brings together two highly complementary organizations and we are excited to combine our resources to better serve customers and communities, while delivering strong and stable returns to our shareholders.”

With the merger finalized, Diamond Shamrock plans to undertake a strategic restructuring to align the new organization under common leadership and optimize key functions. This will involve consolidating business units, streamlining management roles, and integrating support functions such as human resources, IT, and finance. Some job redundancies are expected, however Diamond Shamrock plans to minimize impacts through natural attrition and by re-training employees for new roles where feasible.  

The restructuring is designed to generate annual cost savings of $500 million within 18-24 months of closing the deal. These savings will strengthen the financial position of the combined organization going forward. Meanwhile, Diamond Shamrock will continue its growth-through-acquisition strategy, actively seeking further opportunities to develop its refining, marketing, and transportation assets across North America.  

The merger with Ultramar and ongoing restructuring program reaffirm Diamond Shamrock’s position as an industry leader focused on operational excellence, customer service, and shareholder returns. With its larger scale and resources, Diamond Shamrock appears well positioned to navigate industry cycles and compete globally long into the future. Overall, this significant move marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Diamond Shamrock.
