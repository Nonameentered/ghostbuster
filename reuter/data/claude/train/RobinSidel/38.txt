Conrail and CSX Battle Unhappy Shareholders as They Attempt to Proceed with $8.6bn Merger Plan 

Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp. are facing opposition from some shareholders as they seek to complete their proposed $8.6 billion merger deal. The all-stock deal, announced in April, would combine two of the largest railroad operators in the eastern U.S. However, the merger is contingent on approval from shareholders and U.S. regulators.

A group of Conrail shareholders have come out against the deal, arguing that the exchange ratio in the merger undervalues Conrail. The shareholders, who collectively own over 5% of Conrail stock, urged the railroad operatorâ€™s board to abandon the deal with CSX. They argued that Conrail should either renegotiate the deal with CSX to obtain a higher stock price for Conrail shares or pursue other options to enhance shareholder value.

On the other hand, CSX remains committed to the merger and considers the deal to be in the best interests of both companies and their shareholders. CSX officials argue that the deal would provide significant synergies, with the potential for over $1.8 billion in cost savings. The merger would also enable the combined company to provide improved rail freight service to customers across 23 eastern U.S. states.

The opposition from Conrail shareholders introduces uncertainty as the deal now requires approval from at least two-thirds of shareholders at both companies. While CSX shareholders are expected to approve the deal at a meeting later this month, Conrail would need the support of at least some dissatisfied shareholders to meet the two-thirds threshold. If shareholders vote down the deal, it would mark a major setback for both Conrail and CSX as they look to grow market share and boost profitability.

Regulators also still need to approve the merger, though CSX and Conrail expect the review process to be completed in 2023. The potential loss of competition is expected to be a focus of the regulatory scrutiny. CNBC rail analyst Jim Cramer noted, "The regulators will take a hard look at this deal as it will reduce the number of major rail carriers, so approval is not a given." 

Conrail and CSX have 60 days to renegotiate the terms of the deal to address shareholder concerns before either company can walk away without penalty. CSX stated that it still believes in the strategic rationale of the merger but would consider improving terms if that's needed to secure regulatory and shareholder approval. The outcome of this merger battle and the fate of this deal is being closely watched by analysts and investors in the rail transport sector.
