Mattel to acquire Tyco Toys Inc. for $755 million, expanding market share in boys' toys  

Toy giant Mattel Inc. announced today that it has reached an agreement to acquire rival toy company Tyco Toys Inc. for $755 million in cash. The deal will significantly expand Mattel's offerings in the market for boys' toys, where Tyco is a dominant player. 

Tyco Toys is best known as the maker of RC vehicles, action figures, and foam dart blasters under brands like Air Hogs, Die Cast Machines, and Laser X Blasters. The company has licenses to produce toys based on hit entertainment properties like Marvel's The Avengers, Jurassic World, and video games like Fortnite. Tyco's toys generated over $500 million in revenue last year.

"The acquisition of Tyco Toys will be highly complementary to Mattel's portfolio and help accelerate our growth, particularly in the Boys division," said Ynon Kreiz, Chairman and CEO of Mattel. "Tyco's capabilities in RC and foam toys, strong licenses, and its talented team are valuable additions as we execute our strategy to become an IP-driven, high-performing toy company."

Mattel has sought to turn around its fortunes after a series of missteps in recent years. Sales of traditional toys like Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars have declined as children gravitate to digital entertainment options. Under Kreiz, who took over as CEO two years ago, Mattel has cut costs, eliminated jobs, and refocused its efforts on key franchises and growing segments like boys' toys, collectibles, and licensed products. The Tyco acquisition is the largest in Mattel's history and a key plank of Kreiz's turnaround strategy.   

Tyco Toys was founded in 1967 by Denver entrepreneur Frank Tyers and grew into a powerhouse in the 1980s and 1990s under the leadership of CEO Art Imperato. In recent years, however, the company has struggled with the transition to online retail and competition from challenger brands. Founding family members were seeking an exit, according to a person familiar with the deal. Mattel's acquisition of the entire company will take Tyco private after more than 50 years as an independent toy maker.

The deal is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to close in the second half of this year. Mattel said it expects Tyco to boost earnings per share by $0.02-0.05 over the next 12 months. Mattel's board of directors unanimously approved the transaction.
