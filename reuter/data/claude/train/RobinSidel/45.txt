Shareholder advisory firm recommends rejection of key provision in Conrail acquisition by CSX 

Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended that CSX shareholders vote against the rail operator’s executive compensation plan tied to its pending acquisition of regional rail carrier Conrail. ISS argued that the compensation awards for CSX executives are excessive given the size and complexity of the $30 billion Conrail acquisition. 

CSX announced plans in April to acquire Conrail to expand its rail network in the eastern United States. The deal would make CSX the largest rail operator in the region but requires approval from shareholders and regulators. As part of the acquisition, CSX proposed a new executive compensation plan that would award bonuses and incentive payments to top executives upon completion of the deal.

ISS took issue with both the size and structure of the executive compensation plan in a report issued to its clients last week. The proxy firm estimated the plan could result in more than $60 million in payouts to CSX’s CEO and other top executives for closing the Conrail deal. “The cost of the proposal is not aligned with shareholder interests and sets a troubling precedent in the railroad industry,” ISS said in its report.

A spokesperson for CSX defended the executive compensation plan as “completely aligned with shareholder interests” in enabling the company’s growth strategy. “The Conrail transaction is the largest acquisition in CSX’s history and a transformational moment for the company. The compensation plan was designed specifically around this milestone to reward executives for successfully executing such an important deal,” the spokesperson said. 

However, some CSX shareholders have echoed ISS’s concerns about the plan. “The bonuses seem disproportionate to the work required to simply close an acquisition, especially one that has a high likelihood of approval and where much of the complexity will come after the deal in integrating the two companies,” said Simon Billings, a portfolio manager whose firm owns over 200,000 CSX shares.

CSX’s acquisition of Conrail requires approval from shareholders at a special meeting on July 19. ISS’s recommendation makes it more likely that shareholders will vote against the executive compensation plan, though approval of the overall deal appears likely. Some shareholders may support the acquisition itself while voting down the executive pay packages tied to the transaction.   

The outcome of the votes could depend on the views of large institutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, which combined own over 30 percent of CSX stock. CSX may need to make revisions to its executive compensation plan to assuage shareholder concerns before the final votes are counted. Either way, the deal to expand CSX’s network through the acquisition of Conrail is expected to move forward following the shareholder meeting barring any unexpected regulatory hurdles.
