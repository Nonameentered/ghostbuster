Boeing-McDonnell Douglas union sets off wave of consolidation in defense industry

Aerospace and defense giant Boeing announced its acquisition of rival McDonnell Douglas yesterday in a $13.3 billion all-stock deal, sending shockwaves through the defense industry. The combination of these two leading contractors will make Boeing the world's largest aerospace company, with more than $48 billion in annual revenue.

The deal is the largest in a wave of consolidations in the defense sector following the end of the Cold War. With military budgets declining, key companies have been looking for ways to gain scale and cut costs. McDonnell Douglas had been posting losses the past three years as demand for fighter jets and other weapons systems dried up. By joining forces, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas expect to save $3 billion over the next three years through synergies and job cuts. 

Boeing chief executive Phil Condit called it a "transformative" deal that would accelerate growth and position the combined company for the future. "Only the strongest, most globally competitive companies will thrive in this competitive new environment," he said at a joint news conference with McDonnell Douglas chairman John McDonnell. McDonnell said the deal made sense for shareholders and for America's defense industrial base. "Teaming with Boeing is the best possible solution to the challenges facing McDonnell Douglas," he said.

Investors cheered the news, pushing up shares of Boeing by 5.2 percent and McDonnell Douglas by 4.4 percent in trading yesterday. Rivals Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman also saw their stock prices rise on expectations of further consolidation. However, the deal faces scrutiny from regulators in the U.S. and Europe over potential anti-competitive effects. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are the only two U.S. producers of large commercial jet aircraft, though industry experts noted their product lines are largely complementary.

The combination comes five years after Boeing's unsuccessful attempt to acquire McDonnell Douglas. Boeing's stronger position today and pressure on McDonnell Douglas helped clinch the deal, though McDonnell will continue to operate under its own brand and remain based in St. Louis. The new Boeing will have its corporate headquarters in Chicago and Seattle.

Boeing expects the acquisition to close by the end of the year, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. The new Boeing would have more than 215,000 employees, a backlog of $71 billion and annual revenues exceeding those of its nearest rival, Lockheed Martin, by 50 percent. The blockbuster deal demonstrates the powerful impulse towards consolidation in an industry striving to remain dominant in an era of stiffer international competition and declining government defense spending.
