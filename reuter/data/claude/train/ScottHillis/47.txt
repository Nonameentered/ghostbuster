China Warns Taiwan Against Seeking Independence, Threatens Disaster

Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen was warned by China not to seek independence for the democratic island as China considers Taiwan as a breakaway province that must eventually be brought under its control. Tsai, who received a second term as president with a landslide victory last month, has sought to distance Taiwan from China's influence and has refused to accept China's claims of sovereignty over the island. 

China's defense minister Wei Fenghe issued stern warnings against Taiwan seeking independence at a security conference in Singapore. "If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity," Wei said. "China will never allow the secession of any part of its territory."

Wei's comments follow a pattern of aggressive threats from China as it attempts to isolate Taiwan and discourage other countries from providing political or military support. China has long considered Taiwan a province that will eventually be under Beijing's control, by force if necessary. Taiwan has continued to strengthen ties with the United States, its primary military ally and arms supplier.

Tsai won re-election by a wide margin in January on a platform of standing up to China and defending Taiwan's sovereignty. Under Tsai's first term, China cut off official communication with Taiwan and pressured international companies and organizations to list Taiwan as a province of China. Tsai's government has pursued deeper ties with the U.S. and like-minded democracies in Asia and around the world.

China has stepped up military patrols around Taiwan and last year conducted its largest ever joint air and sea drills around the island. Analysts say China has also expanded its disinformation and hacking campaigns to undermine Tsai's government and influence Taiwan public opinion. The U.S. sold $2.2 billion in arms to Taiwan in 2019 and a further $620 million in early 2020, angering China. President Trump has sought closer ties with Taiwan but under his administration the U.S. still does not formally recognize Taiwan as an independent nation. 

Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu responded that Taiwan would not succumb to threats and intimidation from China. "We will continue to strengthen our self-defense capabilities to deter China," Wu said at a press conference. He also thanked global democratic partners for rallying behind Taiwan in support of its democratic values. Wu said Taiwan looks forward to cooperating with allies to establish a "democratic coalition against China's authoritarian expansionism."
