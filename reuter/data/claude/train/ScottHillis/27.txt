Mass relocation of Chinese villages as Three Gorges dam project progresses 

The construction of the massive Three Gorges Dam across the Yangtze River in China has required the relocation of over 1 million people as entire towns and villages have been submerged under the rising waters of the reservoir. The 600-foot high dam is designed to generate hydroelectric power, increase the river's shipping capacity, and help control flooding along the Yangtze River valley. However, its construction has been controversial given the monumental disruption to communities along the river.

According to Chinese government statistics, over 13 cities, 140 towns, and 1352 villages have been completely or partially flooded by the Three Gorges reservoir. The total area of submerged land amounts to over 600 square miles. The relocation of over 1 million residents from these areas is one of the largest forced human resettlements in history. The majority of displaced peoples have been given new homes and land with government subsidies, however the loss of ancestral homes and land has been deeply traumatic. Surveys of relocated groups show high levels of dissatisfaction and difficulties adapting to new communities.

The city of Fuling in Sichuan province is one of the largest cities requiring relocation, with nearly 300,000 people being moved to newly constructed towns upriver. Liu Jialing, an elderly Fuling resident, told the New York Times "We had to move – we had no choice – but we miss our old home. The government wanted the power from the dam, so the people had to make sacrifices." The relocation has fractured close-knit rural communities that have lived along the Yangtze for centuries.  However, some younger relocated residents have embraced the economic opportunities in their new towns.

The Three Gorges project was first approved in 1992 and construction began in 1994. The dam project itself was completed in 2006. Additional displacement of over 100,000 people may be required due to rising water levels in the coming decades. Proposals to build adjacent dams have stalled due to the public's concerns over resettlement. While the dam has achieved its aims of power generation and flood control, the enormous social costs of mass relocation suggest that all alternatives need to be carefully considered for future large-scale infrastructure projects. Overall, the Three Gorges Dam relocation program represents both a remarkable feat of social engineering as well as a sobering lesson about the human consequences of megaprojects.
