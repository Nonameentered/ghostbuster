U.S. Military Honours Airmen Killed in World War Two with Repatriation Ceremony in China 

The U.S. military held a repatriation ceremony today in Shenyang, China to honour the service and sacrifice of 80 American airmen who were killed during bombing raids over Japan in World War Two. The airmen's remains had been buried in China after their B-29 bombers crashed between 1943 to 1945.

Military officials from the U.S. and China gathered to pay their respects as the remains of the airmen were loaded into military transports to be flown to Hawaii for identification. From there, they will be returned to their families across the U.S. for burial with full military honours. 

"These brave men made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country," said General Mark A. Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was in attendance at the ceremony. "We are fulfulling our nation's promise that no service member will be left behind."

The planned bombing missions from air bases in China and India were some of the earliest U.S. aerial campaigns against Japan in WW2. The B-29s struck at the heart of the Japanese empire, but the long-range missions were perilous. Dozens of bombers crashed or were shot down, leaving crew members stranded in remote areas of China with little chance of rescue.

Local Chinese villagers aided many of the downed U.S. airmen and buried those killed in crashes. After the war, attempts were made to recover the remains but many could not be found until recent years. Advances in research, DNA matching, and partnerships with Chinese officials have made it possible to finally identify and return these service members.

"We are grateful for the help of our Chinese partners in making this possible," said General Milley. "These Airmen represent the very best of the Greatest Generation."

The repatriation of WW2 remains from China has been an ongoing mission. Previous ceremonies in 2017 and 2019 also saw the return of hundreds of U.S. service members. The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) continues to investigate missing service members with the aim of giving closure to families and fulfilling a promise to leave no one behind.
