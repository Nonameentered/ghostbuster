Russian Swimmer Breaks European Record to Spoil Chinese Women's Clean Sweep at World Cup Series Finale

Yekaterinburg, Russia â€“ Russian swimmer Arina Surkova stunned the crowd at the FINA World Cup series finale in Yekaterinburg by breaking the European record in the 50m breaststroke and spoiling China's bid for a clean sweep of all events. 

The 21-year-old Surkova swam a time of 29.66 in the semifinals of the 50m breaststroke to lower her own European mark set earlier this year. She then clocked 29.84 in the final to claim the gold medal, finishing ahead of Chinese swimmers Tang Xueqing (30.12) and Yu Yiting (30.51).

Surkova's victory denied China a sweep of all 14 events at the meet. The Chinese squad had dominated through the first three days of competition, winning 23 total medals including 12 golds.

"I didn't expect to break the European record here," Surkova said. "But I have been preparing for this meet and felt in good shape. Winning the gold medal against such strong competitors from China is a big accomplishment for me."

China's Yu had set a new Asian record of 29.99 in semis before Surkova responded with her European mark in the very next heat. But the Russian held off a late charge from Yu and Tang in the final to stand atop the podium. 

"I'm a little disappointed to lose my Asian record but Arina just swam unbelievably fast," Yu said. "She deserved this win today. It will only motivate me to train harder to take the record back."

The victory continued an impressive meet for Surkova, who also earned silver in the 100m breaststroke earlier in the competition. She broke through in 2019, winning two gold medals at the European Championships and the World Championship title in the mixed 4x100m medley relay.

With one event remaining, China had already secured the team title at the meet. The Chinese squad ended with 26 total medals including 14 golds across the three days of competition in Yekaterinburg.

But for one night, Arina Surkova reigned supreme and achieved a landmark accomplishment for European swimming in spoiling China's bid for a perfect finish at the FINA World Cup series finale. Her stunning performance in the 50m breaststroke final proved once again that records are meant to be broken, even by significant underdogs. And Surkova will now rest assured as the fastest female breaststroker in European history.
