China Warns Communist Party Members Against Corruption and Differing Political Views 

The Chinese Communist Party's anti-graft watchdog issued a warning to all 90 million party members to "firmly resist corruption and resist negative and decadent ideas." The warning was issued ahead of the party's 19th National Congress next month where President Xi Jinping is expected to consolidate more power.

The warning reiterates Xi's twin campaigns against corruption and to tighten ideological control over the party. In a statement, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CDIC) said that failure to toe the party line or evidence of corruption would not be tolerated. "We must consolidate the political orientation of arming the minds of cadres and party members with the party’s rigorous political discipline,” the CDIC said.

Xi has overseen a widespread anti-corruption campaign that has led to the downfall of more than one million officials across all levels of the party's vast bureaucracy. Critics argue the campaign is more about eliminating political rivals than actual reforms. The focus on ideological orthodoxy is aimed at silencing dissent and differing views that could undermine Xi's authority. 

The CDIC said party members must "strengthen their political accomplishments, adhere to political discipline, be in line with the Central Committee with comrade Xi Jinping as the core.” The call for ideological obedience comes as Xi moves to amend the party constitution to enshrine "Xi Jinping Thought" as a guiding philosophy alongside Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the Three Represents of Jiang Zemin.

Elevating Xi's philosophy to such prominence underscores his status as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Analysts believe Xi will seek to stack more political allies on the Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top leadership body, at the Congress to help implement his agenda over the next five years. Xi currently dominates the seven-member Standing Committee but will need unwavering support from new members if he pushes ahead with economic reforms that could slow China's growth.

The CDIC’s warning is the latest sign that Xi demands total loyalty and discipline from party officials. At a time when Xi is poised to tighten his grip on power, he wants to ensure there are no dissenting voices or corrupt actors within the ranks that could threaten his authority and influence. The message is clear that Xi alone will steer China through challenges at home and abroad as party officials rally around their "core leader".
