China says Deng Xiaoping's health remains stable 

Beijing, China - The Chinese government released a statement today indicating that former leader Deng Xiaoping's health remains stable and unchanged. The 92-year-old Deng, who led China's economic reforms starting in 1978, has been ill in recent years and rarely makes public appearances. However, officials insist his condition is not deteriorating.

"Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health condition remains stable and unchanged. He continues to receive high-quality medical care and attention. There are no significant changes to report," said a brief statement issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The committee oversees the party leaders and government officials responsible for Deng's care and well-being.

Deng led China following the death of Chairman Mao Zedong in 1976. He spearheaded economic and political reforms that moved China away from orthodox communist policies toward a model of socialist market economy and an opening to the global market. His policies resulted in significant economic growth and prosperity in China. He is still revered as the "Architect of Modern China."

While Deng retired from active leadership in 1992, he continued to influence policymaking behind the scenes for several years. His rare public appearances often moved markets and prompted speculation about his health and longevity. However, details on Deng's medical condition are typically kept secret. The latest statement is likely aimed at tamping down rumors without disclosing further information.

"The party wants to reassure people that Deng is still alive and his legacy lives on," said Chang Wu, a political scientist at Renmin University in Beijing. "But they release only the bare minimum to avoid fueling speculation or revealing too many details, which they see as a private matter."

Deng last appeared publicly in a photo release 18 months ago. While frail, analysts said he appeared alert and in stable condition for a man of his advanced age. The new statement suggests his condition has not changed appreciably since then, despite his advanced years. The party committee gave no details on Deng's specific illness or condition but said he continues to receive comprehensive health monitoring and care. Barring further statements, Deng's health and status remain shrouded in secrecy as is typical in China.
