Jailed Chinese Dissident Wang Dan Suffering from Severe Health Problems in Cold Prison  

Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement who has been imprisoned in China for more than 25 years, is reportedly suffering from severe health issues due to the harsh conditions of his confinement. According to his sister Wang Lingyun who was able to briefly visit him, Wang Dan's health has seriously deteriorated in the frigid prison facility in northern China. 

Wang Dan, now 50 years old, was first imprisoned in 1989 for his role in leading the student movement. He served five years before being released, but he was re-arrested in 1995 for continuing to speak out for democratic reforms. He is currently serving his third sentence in Jilin Prison, located in one of the coldest parts of northern China. The lengthy imprisonments in dire conditions have taken a heavy toll on Wang Dan's health, his sister reports.

Wang Lingyun said her brother suffers from a number of medical issues that have not been properly treated, including severe headaches, back pains, dental issues and a heart condition. The prison cells lack any basic heating, exposing inmates to extreme cold in the winter. According to Wang Lingyun, her brother's health problems have been exacerbated by the frigid temperatures, isolation, lack of medical care and frequent harassment and punishment by prison authorities.

"He is frail and gets sick easily now," Wang Lingyun wrote in a statement posted online. "I hope the prison authorities will grant him medical parole as soon as possible, so he can reunite with his family and receive medical treatment." Chinese authorities have ignored calls from human rights groups to release Wang Dan on humanitarian grounds.

The news about Wang Dan's declining health has renewed calls for his immediate release. “Keeping a prisoner in such inhumane conditions and denying them medical treatment amounts to cruel and degrading punishment,” said Frances Eve, the deputy director of research at Chinese Human Rights Defenders. There are growing concerns that if Wang Dan does not receive medical care soon, the harsh prison conditions may threaten his life.
