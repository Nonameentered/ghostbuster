China Revives Call to Wipe Out Poverty by End of Century to Placate Backward Hinterland 

The Chinese government this week reaffirmed its long-standing goal to eliminate absolute poverty in the country by the year 2100. Speaking at a meeting of the National People's Congress, Premier Li Keqiang said "eradicating poverty is a solemn promise made by the Communist Party to the people. We must fulfill this promise and lift the remaining 50 million people out of poverty by the end of the century through sustained economic growth and targeted poverty alleviation efforts."

The pledge to end poverty comes as China's economy is slowing after decades of breakneck growth. Growth in 2019 is expected to slow to around 6.2%, down from 6.6% last year. Slower growth poses challenges for poverty relief as jobs become scarcer and economic opportunity lessens, especially in China's inland rural areas. Over the last 40 years, China's rapid economic rise lifted some 850 million people out of poverty. But uneven development has left behind pockets of severe poverty, particularly in western regions like Xinjiang, Tibet and Yunnan. 

The government's call to renew the fight against poverty is aimed partly at addressing discontent in these rural hinterlands where economic growth has lagged. By again highlighting poverty alleviation, the Communist Party aims to assure these populations that they have not been forgotten. The Party is also eager to demonstrate progress on eliminating poverty as the 100th anniversary of its founding approaches in 2021. 

However, experts question China's metrics for determining who counts as impoverished, and some believe the actual number of people living in poverty is higher than official statistics indicate. Critics argue the government sets the poverty line too low, at around $1.10 per day, making it easier for authorities to claim success. A more accurate poverty line would be between $5 to $7 dollars per day. The government's heavy focus on authoritarian social policies and internment camps in places like Xinjiang also undermine its poverty alleviation goals. Sustainable progress in China's poorest areas ultimately requires both economic opportunity and greater political freedom and human rights.
