China Pledges to Support Hong Kong's Foreign Trade Expansion After 1997 Handover 

HONG KONG - China has pledged to continue supporting Hong Kong's foreign trade development after the city is handed over from Britain to China in 1997. Speaking at a press conference today, Chinese official Li Peng said China will uphold Hong Kong's status as an independent customs territory and support its participation in international trade organizations and agreements under the "one country, two systems" principle.

Hong Kong is one of the world's leading trading hubs, with total trade volume of over $676 billion last year. There have been concerns that trade may be disrupted during the handover process. Li Peng's comments are aimed at reassuring the international business community that Hong Kong will continue to thrive as a trade and logistics center after returning to Chinese sovereignty.   

According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984, Hong Kong's existing economic and trade systems will remain unchanged for 50 years after 1997. This means Hong Kong can continue to determine its own trade policies, apply its own tariffs, and sign trade deals with other economies independently. Hong Kong traders and businessmen have built connections with partners around the world over the past century, and any major changes may undermine Hong Kong's attractiveness as a premiere trading port.

Li Peng promised that China will respect Hong Kong's status in international trade organizations like the World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and other multinational trade alliances. This means Hong Kong traders and companies can continue to enjoy low tariffs and other benefits when conducting business with major trade partners worldwide after the handover.

While China's promise is reassuring, much remains uncertain as the actual transfer of sovereignty approaches. How the "one country, two systems" principle will work in practice is still being determined. The business sector is adopting a cautiously optimistic attitude, with many choosing to observe if and how the Chinese government will honor its pledge after assuming control of Hong Kong in less than 500 days. Overall, China's statement is a welcome signal, but the real test of its commitment to Hong Kong's open trade regime lies ahead after July 1, 1997.
