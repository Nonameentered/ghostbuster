Communist Party Chief in Tibet Vows to Boost Patriotic Education to Combat Hostile Western Forces and Exiled Spiritual Leader, the Dalai Lama  

The Communist Party Secretary in Tibet, Wu Yingjie, vowed this week to strengthen "patriotic education" in schools to counter what he referred to as "separatist" influences from Western forces and the Dalai Lama. Speaking at a meeting of senior party officials, Wu said ideological education must be intensified to "guide Tibetans to identify with the great motherland, Chinese nation, Chinese culture, the Communist Party of China and socialism with Chinese characteristics."

Wu claimed that "hostile foreign forces" led by the United States, as well as the "Dalai clique" in exile, continue to promote "separatism" and spread reactionary propaganda to undermine stability in Tibet. The chief target of his remarks was the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism who fled into exile in India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. Beijing continues to denounce the Dalai Lama as a "dangerous separatist" despite the religious leader's stated goal of greater autonomy rather than independence for Tibet.

To counter these supposed threats, Wu said schools in Tibet must strengthen Mandarin Chinese language study and "education on the motherland, the Chinese nation and Chinese culture." He called for vigilance against infiltration from "separatists" and continuing an "arduous and persistent" patriotic education campaign. Wu also urged local authorities to "prevent and contain illegal religious activities" which could pose a "threat to stability." 

Human rights groups have long criticized the Chinese government's patriotic education campaigns in Tibet for forcing Tibetans to reject the Dalai Lama and pledge loyalty to the Communist Party. The initiation of these campaigns coincided with major crackdowns on political dissent and religious freedom in Tibet in the late 1990s and 2000s. Critics argue such indoctrination violates cultural rights and freedoms of belief and religion guaranteed under international law. However, Beijing claims patriotic education has been vital for national unity and harmony in Tibet.

The new calls for intensified ideological education suggest tighter control will continue in Tibet despite hopes for a more lenient policy under China's current leadership. Wu's hardline stance appears aimed to silence any dissent or calls for greater political and religious freedom as Communist authorities remain deeply wary of potential threats to their power, both within China and from abroad.
