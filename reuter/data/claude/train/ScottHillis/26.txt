China's Coal Sector Needs Foreign Investment and Technology to Modernize, Say Industry Officials and Foreign Businessmen 

China's coal industry, the world's largest, needs massive amounts of foreign investment and technology upgrades to modernize production, according to industry officials and foreign businessmen. Despite China's ambitious renewable energy goals, coal is expected to remain the dominant source of power for decades. 

"China's coal mining industry faces significant challenges, including low efficiency, lack of safety, and heavy pollution," said Wang Jianguo, the head of China's National Coal Association at a press conference. "We urgently need to upgrade technology, improve efficiency and cleanliness, and only cooperation with international partners can help us achieve that."

China has abundant coal reserves, but much of its production comes from small, outdated mines that operate with little regard for safety or the environment. Deadly mining accidents are common, and coal pollution contributes to China's choking airpocalypse. The Chinese government has pledged to shut down small, inefficient mines, but replacing that production capacity will require major investments to scale up larger, modern mines.

Several foreign mining companies and equipment manufacturers see significant opportunities in China's coal industry. "China will drive global coal demand for the foreseeable future, so upgrading productivity and safety of mines through technology and equipment sales is a huge business opportunity," said John Thompson, CEO of UK-based mining equipment maker Redpath. His company recently won a contract to help mechanize and upgrade a coal mine in Shanxi province.

Other companies are investing directly in mining operations through joint ventures with Chinese SOEs. "By partnering with a local state-owned coal company, we gained access to untapped reserves and the opportunity to build a modern, efficient mine from scratch using the latest mining equipment," said Pierre Lebel, CEO of South African mining firm Exxaro. The company recently began operating a $1 billion coal mine in Inner Mongolia, China's largest coal-producing region, in partnership with state-owned Datong Coal Mine Group.

Continued foreign investment and technology upgrades can help transform China's coal industry into a less polluting, more efficient sector, in line with China's goal to build an "ecological civilization." said Jiang Zhaoli, deputy director of the China Coal Technology & Engineering Group. "New investments can introduce best practices for increased mechanization, coal seam gas utilization and mine reclamation." With massive shale gas reserves as well, foreign partners can also help China transition to less carbon-intensive fuel mixes over time. But first, the country needs to grapple with modernizing an industry that still employs over 3 million people and produces nearly 4 billion metric tons of coal each year.
