Mixed reviews for documentary praising China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping 

A new documentary film celebrating the life and legacy of Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader in the 1980s, has received mixed reviews since its release last week. The two-hour film, titled "Architect of Reform," was produced by China's state broadcaster CCTV to commemorate the 120th anniversary of Deng's birth.

The documentary lauds Deng as the visionary leader who spearheaded China's era of "reform and opening up" and set the country on a path to prosperity after the tumult of the Cultural Revolution. It highlights Deng's bold economic reforms, including establishing special economic zones, breaking up agricultural collectives, and allowing private enterprises and foreign investment. These moves unleashed China's rapid economic growth, with GDP rising from $147 billion in 1978 to $2.2 trillion in 1997.

However, critics argue the film takes an overly rosy view of Deng's complex and controversial legacy. It glosses over the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters around Tiananmen Square in 1989 and does not mention other political reforms Deng resisted. It also fails to acknowledge the human costs of Deng's radical economic changes, including massive layoffs from state-owned enterprises and increased inequality.

Independent historians have described the documentary as hagiography intended to shore up the ruling Communist Party's prestige. They argue it seeks to attribute China's present-day prosperity solely to the wisdom of its authoritarian leaders.

The mixed reactions reflect the polarized views on Deng's outsized impact on China's development. While he undoubtedly unleashed economic forces that lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, his insistence on authoritarian political control still shapes China's one-party system today. The debate around "Architect of Reform" highlights how China is still grappling with Deng's complex legacy decades after his rule.
