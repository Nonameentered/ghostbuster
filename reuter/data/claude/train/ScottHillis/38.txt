China Posts Trade Surplus of $12.24 Billion in 1996, Defying Earlier Predictions of a Deficit

China posted a trade surplus of $12.24 billion in 1996, according to figures released by the customs administration on Friday. The strong performance was a surprise for many analysts, who had predicted a trade deficit for China of up to $10 billion for the year due to slowing export growth and increased imports. 

The trade surplus boosted China's foreign exchange reserves to a record $137.6 billion, strengthening the nation's ability to defend its currency against market forces. According to official figures, China's exports grew by 17.5 percent last year, while imports rose by 21 percent. The trade surplus with the United States was $29.6 billion, 36 percent higher than in 1995, underscoring the continued dependency of the Chinese economy on exports to the large U.S. market.

The strong trade figures rebut predictions by some analysts earlier in the year that China's surplus would disappear due to several economic factors. In particular, the pace of export growth had slowed from over 20 percent in 1995 to low single digits in some months last year, raising concerns about weakening external demand. At the same time, imports were expected to surge due to increased domestic demand in China's fast-growing economy and higher global commodity prices.  

The trade report shows that China's exporters have held onto their competitive edge despite rising costs, higher environmental standards, and pressures to improve wages and labor conditions. The Communist government has made boosting exports a top priority. Heavy government investment in export infrastructure and a weak currency have helped Chinese factories keep price tags low.  

Going forward, analysts say China's trade surplus is likely to remain in place as domestic consumption and imports struggle to keep up with the nation's export strength. However, the surplus is poised to stabilize at a lower level as global demand cools and as China opens its markets further to foreign goods and services. The trade figures reinforce perceptions of China as an economic powerhouse that continues to generate substantial trade surpluses through competitive exports and industrial policies, despite external pressures for liberalization and reforms.
