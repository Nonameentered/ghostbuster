Chinese President to Meet with Russian Leader for Summit on Arms Reductions and Strategic Partnership

Beijing, China - Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week for a summit aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership between the two nations. The leaders are expected to discuss arms control, trade deals, and cooperation on regional security issues.

According to Chinese officials, Xi and Putin will sign several agreements to expand bilateral trade and investment. They will also review progress on major energy deals, including the Power of Siberia natural gas pipeline that began delivering Russian gas to China last year. Military officials from both sides will explore potential arms reduction talks to follow up on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that expired earlier this year.

The meeting comes amid tensions between China and the West. The U.S. has pressured its allies not to use telecommunications equipment from Chinese tech giant Huawei, citing national security risks. The U.S. is also engaged in a protracted trade war with China. Russia, too, remains under Western economic sanctions for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Closer cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is seen as a counterbalance to U.S. global influence.

"The meeting will consolidate the strategic partnership that exists between China and Russia in the current international scenario," said Wang Yi, Chinaâ€™s Foreign Minister, at a press briefing. The partnership is "not targeted at anyone but serves the long-term interests of both countries and the international community."

The summit marks the 69th time Xi and Putin have met since 2013 and comes just weeks after Xi's visit to North Korea, demonstrating the importance of strategic partnerships to China's regional interests. While China and Russia will likely avoid formalizing an alliance, their alignment on issues like North Korea's denuclearization and the civil war in Syria boosts both leaders on the global stage. The meeting is set to begin on Tuesday in Moscow, where Xi and Putin will have a private meeting followed by broader discussions with military and diplomatic officials.
