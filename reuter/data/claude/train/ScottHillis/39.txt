U.S. forensics team heads to China to recover remains of World War Two bomber crew  

A team of forensic anthropologists from the U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has arrived in China to recover the remains of crew members from a B-24 Liberator bomber that crashed during World War Two. The bomber went down in the mountains of Guangxi Province in southern China on March 25, 1945 after being hit by anti-aircraft fire.

The B-24 had taken off from Kunming and was on a bombing mission over Japanese targets in French Indochina. The crash site was found last year by one of the DPAA's partner organizations at the site of an old village in a remote valley. The team had been tipped off by local residents who spoke of an old aircraft crash that had been a landmark for decades. The site at first appeared almost undisturbed but locals had collected small pieces of aircraft wreckage and some human remains over the years. However, large sections of the B-24 were found buried in the mud at the crash site, as well as personal effects of some of the crew members. 

Records indicate the B-24 had a crew of 11 servicemen – 6 officers and 5 enlisted men. However, due to the rugged terrain and lack of roads, the site was not investigated after the crash. The families of the lost crew were notified that their loved ones were missing in action and presumed dead. For over 70 years, their final resting place remained a mystery.

The recovery mission began last week to exhaustively examine the crash site and excavate human remains, aircraft wreckage and personal artifacts. The team is painstakingly sifting through mud and debris around the wreckage by hand. Because the crash site has been disturbed over the years, the work is complex. But officials are hopeful they can identify most or even all of the crew, bringing closure to families who have waited decades for answers.  

Three members of the crew were from Idaho, two from California, two from Texas, and one each from Washington, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The remains will be flown back to the DPAA’s laboratory in Hawaii for identification using DNA references from family members and by examining military dental records.  The artifacts from the site may also provide vital clues to confirm identities.  

Once identified, the remains will finally receive a proper burial with full military honors. The families of these lost servicemen will gain a sense of closure after so many years of uncertainty and longing. For the DPAA team, recovering the remains of missing service members from World War Two has been an ongoing mission for decades. But as time passes and witness accounts fade, their work has become increasingly difficult. Discoveries like the B-24 crash site represent rare opportunities to fulfill the pledge to bring these American war heroes home.
