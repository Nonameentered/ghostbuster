Conflicting Views at APEC Summit: Pacific Powers Push for Free Trade, China Seeking Soft Loans

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit this weekend saw leaderstake diverging positions on global trade and economic cooperation. Leaders from major Pacific powers like the U.S., Japan,and Australia pushed for advancing free trade agreements and market-based reforms. Meanwhile, China aimed to leverage the summit to promote its Belt and Road Initiative and pursue strategic investments and soft loans across the region.

In opening remarks, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence criticized "unfair trade practices" and "intellectual property theft", veiled criticisms of China’s economic policies. Pence promoted bilateral free trade deals with Japan and South Korea as models for the region. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison similarly emphasized "open markets, free trade and global connectivity". Leaders of the U.S., Japan, Australia and other major economies are aiming to advance the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade deal, from which Trump withdrew the U.S. in 2017.

In contrast, Chinese President Xi Jinping touted China’s $2.5 trillion Belt and Road Initiative which funds infrastructure and development projects in Asia, Africa and Europe. Xi pledged $60 billion in financing for Belt and Road projects over the next three years. While China bills the initiative as a platform for win-win cooperation, critics argue it is a vehicle for China’s strategic influence and risks saddling developing nations with unsustainable debt. Ahead of the APEC meetings, Xi hosted side summits to advance Belt and Road deals with Pacific leaders. 

The diverging views reflect an emerging geopolitical rift between Western powers and China's authoritarian model of state-backed capitalism. Western leaders are aiming to counter China’s rising influence in the region through private sector-led economic partnerships as well as strategic alliances like the newly formed "Quad" security grouping of the U.S., Japan, India and Australia. China has criticized such alliances as a "Cold War mindset" that threatens regional stability.

The split was on display in the summit’s closing communique. Western leaders succeeded in including language on "fair competition", "anti-corruption" and "debt sustainability"—implied critiques of China. But China earned inclusion of its catchphrases like “common destiny” and "win-win cooperation." The communique’s conflicting messages reflect how APEC has become a platform for geopolitical maneuvering over a shared vision for regional trade and growth. After 30 years promoting free trade and economic integration, APEC faces challenges from rising protectionism and deepening great power competition.
