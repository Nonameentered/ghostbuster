China defends proposal to roll back civil liberties in Hong Kong

The Chinese government today defended proposed national security legislation that would curb civil liberties in Hong Kong, stating that the new laws are necessary to protect China's national security in the face of growing unrest.

The proposed legislation would bypass Hong Kong's legislature and allow China's ruling Communist Party to draft national security laws that could criminalize acts like subversion and sedition. Critics argue this would effectively end the "one country, two systems" arrangement that has guaranteed Hong Kong's civil liberties and political autonomy since Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997.

In a press conference today, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the proposed laws are needed to close “obvious legal loopholes and deficiencies” in Hong Kong that threaten China's national security. “No country will allow secession, subversion and terrorist activities on its own territory,” Zhao said. He added that China is acting within its rights to draft such laws under the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution.

Pro-democracy activists and politicians in Hong Kong vehemently disagree and have called the proposals “the end of Hong Kong.” “This is the end of one country, two systems,” said pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong. “They are trying to turn Hong Kong into just another Chinese city.” Even some moderates and pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong have voiced concerns, arguing the move will further polarize the territory and damage its economy.

Western governments have also criticized the proposed legislation. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the move would be a “clear violation” of China's obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration which paved the way for Hong Kong's return. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus urged China to "reconsider its disastrous proposal” which risks “damaging the territory's autonomy and the Hong Kong people's freedoms.”

Passage of the proposed legislation appears virtually assured given China's control of Hong Kong's government, but pro-democracy activists have vowed large-scale protests to voice their objections. The controversial move threatens to raise geopolitical tensions between China and Western governments at a time of already high tensions and growing rivalry.
