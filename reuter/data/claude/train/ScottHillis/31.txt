China Sentences Democracy Activists to Hard Labour for Up to Three Years 

A Chinese court sentenced three prominent pro-democracy activists to up to three years of "reeducation through labor" today for "disturbing social order," in the latest crackdown on political dissent in China. The sentences were handed down by a court in Guangzhou against Yang Tianfu, Wei Xuehui, and Zhou Jianxiong, who were arrested in April for organizing rallies calling for democratic reforms.

The three men were convicted of "gathering a crowd to disrupt public order" for organizing demonstrations on the outskirts of Guangzhou. They had called for an end to censorship, the release of political prisoners, and free elections in the Communist nation. The sentences ranged from 18 months to three years in a "reeducation through labor" camp, a type of detention that allows authorities to imprison people outside the criminal system.

The harsh sentences are the latest sign of a broad effort by Chinese authorities to quash any political organizing and dissent. In recent months, China has rounded up and imprisoned hundreds of human rights lawyers, journalists, and activists. The crackdown appears directed at stamping out any growth or spread of China's rights defense movement and civil society organizations pushing for democratic reforms.

"These sentences are a chilling warning to others that any overt political activism will not be tolerated," said Wang Qiushi, an activist with the China Democracy Party who lives in exile. "The Communist Party is trying to silence anyone calling for meaningful political changes." 

The convictions and sentences sparked outrage among international human rights organizations, which have long criticized China's use of extrajudicial detention like "reeducation through labor" to imprison critics outside the regular court system. "These activists did nothing more than peacefully protest for democratic reforms," said Amnesty International in a statement. "Their unjust sentences demonstrate the ruthless and arbitrary nature of China's repression."

The sentences come amid a visit to China by the US Secretary of State, highlighting ongoing tensions over China's human rights record. The US State Department issued a statement saying it was "deeply disturbed" by the sentences, which "contradict China's international commitments to uphold civil and political rights." There are calls from US lawmakers for the issue to be high on the agenda in talks with Chinese leaders.
