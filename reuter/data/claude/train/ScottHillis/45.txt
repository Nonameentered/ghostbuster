China Wins Pledge from Guatemala Not to Support Taiwan's UN Bid 

China has secured a commitment from Guatemala not to support Taiwan's bid to regain status as an observer at the United Nations, in a diplomatic victory showing Beijing's influence over countries that still recognize Taiwan.

Guatemala was one of only 15 countries that still maintained formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. But last month, Guatemala's new president Alejandro Giammattei pledged to switch relations to Beijing. After meeting with the Chinese foreign minister this week, Guatemala confirmed it would follow China's wishes and not back Taiwan in its push to participate in U.N. agencies.

Taiwan has sought to uphold its remaining diplomatic alliances even as China pressures countries to cut ties. Taiwan lost two Latin American allies in the past year, El Salvador and Nicaragua. China accuses Taiwan of being a province that must be reunified, by force if necessary. Taiwan says it is an independent democratic country called the Republic of China.

For decades, China and Taiwan have competed for diplomatic recognition, with China offering economic inducements to countries to ditch ties with Taiwan. The battle has intensified since Tsai Ing-wen was elected Taiwan's president in 2016. China suspects Ms. Tsai of pushing for Taiwan independence, though she says she wants to maintain the status quo.

The loss of allies leaves Taiwan more isolated on the global stage as China uses its growing economic and military power to isolate the island. The U.S. continues to sell arms to Taiwan for self-defense under the Taiwan Relations Act. But the U.S. recognizes Beijing rather than Taipei under the One China policy. Taiwan may face an uphill battle getting the support from remaining allies for future bids to participate as an observer in U.N. organizations like the World Health Assembly. The loss of Guatemala highlights how China is willing to go to greater lengths to peel away whatever partners Taiwan has left.
