North Korea Faces Severe Food Shortage as Harvest Leaves Two Million Tonnes Short, Red Cross Official Warns  

North Korea is facing a severe food shortage after its harvest fell well short of expectations, leaving the country two million tonnes in deficit, an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has warned. 

North Korea’s harvest this year brought in 4.1 million tonnes of food, well below the 6.1 million tonnes required to feed the country’s 25.5 million people, according to Shahab Shayan, IFRC's operations manager in Pyongyang. The shortfall is largely due to droughts, flooding, and heatwaves over the spring and summer that hampered crop growth in a country that already struggles to produce enough food.

“The situation is very concerning, Shayan said. “Many parts of the country have been affected by droughts, flooding, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events this year. This has had a significant impact on harvests and the humanitarian situation is expected to worsen over the coming months, especially for children and pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly and people with disabilities.”

Shayan said the Red Cross is scaling up its operations in North Korea to provide food, money, and disaster relief to the most vulnerable people affected by the shortages. The organization aims to help 500,000 North Koreans – mainly children, pregnant women, the disabled, and elderly. However, its efforts are hampered by a lack of funding and resources.

The dire food situation is the latest in a series of shortages that have plagued North Korea. The country is under tight international sanctions due to its nuclear weapons program. Extreme weather and a lack of agricultural technology and infrastructure have also made it difficult for North Korea to produce enough food to feed itself. According to UN estimates, 40 percent of the population is chronically short of food.

North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un said in April the country faced a "worst-ever situation" due to the COVID-19 pandemic and international sanctions. The country closed its borders early in the pandemic, straining supply lines. North Korea is seeking food, fuel, and other aid to address shortages, but the international community says the country must give up its nuclear weapons first before sanctions can be eased. With harvests falling short and winter approaching, the coming months could bring new hardships for many North Koreans struggling in precarious conditions.
