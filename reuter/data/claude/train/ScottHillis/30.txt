China's State-Owned Heavy Industries and Defence Sector Suffering Massive Losses, But Reform is Slow 

China's state-owned enterprises, especially in sectors like heavy industry, defence, and engineering, are facing significant financial difficulties and losses. However, government-led reforms to overhaul these ailing behemoths are progressing at a glacial pace due to political and social sensitivities.

According to recent analyses by investment banks like UBS and Credit Suisse, majority state-owned enterprises in steel, coal, shipbuilding, and defence manufacturing recorded combined losses of nearly $50 billion last year. The losses were the result of massive overcapacity, reliance on government subsidies, and inefficient management practices. Despite government initiatives launched five years ago to reform state-owned enterprises and make them more market-driven, little has changed on the ground.

The defence sector is an acute example. China State Shipbuilding Corporation and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, two major state-owned contractors for the Chinese military with over half a million employees, have suffered losses for years and rely largely on government handouts. Reform would require major layoffs and consolidation of China's military-industrial complex, which could pose political risks and face public opposition.  

In other sectors like steel, government orders to cut overcapacity by up to 150 million tonnes have been resisted by regional governments and state-owned steelmakers. Local governments have propped up many of these failing state-owned mills and depend on them to provide jobs and tax revenue.  Closing them is seen as too politically sensitive despite the huge losses and debt incurred. 

While private companies have become the driving force of China's economy, state-owned behemoths still dominate 'strategic' sectors like heavy industry, defence, banking, telecommunications, and energy. They often control the commanding heights of the economy, but their profitability and productivity have declined over the decades compared to private competitors. 

 Reformist officials and economists argue that bolstering the free market and private sector should be priorities, even in strategic sectors. But vested political interests and public concerns about job losses and stability mean that China's lumbering state-owned enterprises are likely to remain a drag on the economy for years to come, accumulating more losses and further reform will be slow. Overall, China's modest success in reforming state-owned enterprises demonstrates the difficulties in overhauling these political and economic giants despite their glaring financial troubles.
