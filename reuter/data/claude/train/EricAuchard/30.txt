Shiva Corp Stock Rises Amid Acquisition Speculation in Network Equipment Industry 

Shares of Shiva Corp, a maker of telecommunications network equipment, rose as much as 11% on Monday amid speculation that the company could be an acquisition target. Shiva's stock price jumped to $82.35, its highest level since August, before closing at $81.12, up 9.2%. 

The rally came after Emcor Digest reported that several private equity firms and companies in the network equipment sector have expressed interest in acquiring Shiva. The company has a market capitalization of $12 billion but has seen slowing growth in recent quarters. An acquisition could help the buyer gain access to Shiva's portfolio of routers, switches, and security products used by communication service providers and large corporations to build and manage their networks.

Shiva and industry peers have faced economic challenges in the past year. Carriers have reduced spending on network infrastructure as they invest in emerging areas like 5G wireless technology and mobile broadband. Revenue at Shiva slipped 3% in the latest quarter, while profits declined 12%. Despite its slowing growth, Shiva continues to generate strong cash flow, with free cash flow up 18% last quarter. That could make the company an appealing target, especially for a strategic buyer looking to gain scale and cut costs through synergies.

Private equity firms are also showing greater interest in the network equipment sector due to depressed valuations and opportunities for consolidation, according to Emcor Digest. Private equity has been acquiring more technology companies as leaders like Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, and F5 Networks trade at relatively high valuations. An acquirer could accelerate Shiva's move into areas like software-defined networking, cybersecurity, and edge computing where revenue and profits are growing more quickly.

Shiva declined to comment on the report of potential takeover interest. The company said it is focused on its long-term strategy to deliver innovative solutions to customers and enhance shareholder value. However, analysts said an offer of $90 to $100 per share, or a premium of at least 15-20% over the current stock price, could win the backing of Shiva's board. 

Any deal is far from certain, and there have been false alarms about acquisitions of Shiva before. But with private equity showing greater appetite for network technology deals and industry consolidation heating up, analysts said this round of reports seems more credible. Investors appear to agree, sending shares of networking companies higher across the board on Monday amid the speculation of bigger buyouts to come.
