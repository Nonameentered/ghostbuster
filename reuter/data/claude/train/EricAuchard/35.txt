Semiconductor Equipment Stocks Surge on Signs of Chip Industry Bottoming Out  

Shares of semiconductor equipment companies jumped today on indications that the slump in the global chip market may be coming to an end. Applied Materials, KLA Corp, and Lam Research—three of the largest semiconductor equipment manufacturers—all rose between 5 to 10% in early trading. The rally reflects optimism that semiconductor sales may have hit a trough after a steep decline over the past year.   

The semiconductor industry has been battered by a slowdown in global smartphone sales, weaker auto production, and general economic uncertainty. Global semiconductor revenue declined 15% in 2019, according to industry body SEMI, as chip makers scaled back orders for new equipment. However, January sales appear to show initial signs of stabilization. South Korean chip maker SK Hynix today reported first quarter revenue that topped analysts’ estimates. Its shares rose over 3% on the news. 

“We think the worst is likely behind for the semiconductor downcycle,” said Hans Mosesmann, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. “Commentary from companies like Hynix points to a recovery in memory chips, and other sectors like analog and logic should follow.”

The positive guidance has fueled hopes of a broader turnaround in the $470 billion chip market. Any uptick in demand would directly benefit semiconductor equipment makers, who supply the advanced tools and machines needed to manufacture computer chips. Applied Materials, the world’s largest equipment supplier, said it expects 2020 sales to remain largely flat, an improvement from its previous forecast of a decline. Executives noted that foundry customers now appear cautiously optimistic about chip market conditions in the second half of the year.

However, the nascent rebound remains fragile and subject to risks. Much will depend on the extent to which the global economy emerges from the COVID-19 crisis, and whether new technologies like 5G networks and artificial intelligence fuel an acceleration in chip demand later this year. Industry analysts also cautioned it is too early to say for sure if the first quarter sales bump reflects a trend or a temporary blip.  

Semiconductor stocks have tended to closely track the ups and downs of the overall chip market. Today’s strong performance suggests equipment companies and their investors believe the downturn that has plagued tech's most cyclical sector may finally be in the rearview mirror. But as the sector begins the long climb back, all eyes will be on demand trends to determine if expectations of a recovery can translate into an actual rebound and sustained growth.
