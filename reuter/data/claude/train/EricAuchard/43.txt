Flextronics CEO Expects Revenues to More Than Double in Fiscal 1998

In comments to analysts today, Flextronics CEO Michael Marks said that he expects the company's revenues to more than double in the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 1998. Flextronics, a global provider of electronic manufacturing services, posted revenue of $1.8 billion in fiscal 1997. Marks projected revenue of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion for fiscal 1998, representing growth of 106% to 133% year over year.   

Marks attributed the stunning growth to recent acquisitions as well as strong demand from Flextronics' existing customers. In the past year, Flextronics has acquired four companies: Microflex Soluções em Eletrônica Ltda, a Brazilian provider of electronic manufacturing services; Chassis Systems International, a US-based chassis and enclosure manufacturer; Teleric, an electronic systems manufacturing services company with operations in Ireland, Czech Republic and Malaysia; and MCMS Holdings Inc, a US-based provider of design, manufacturing, and testing services for printed circuit board assemblies and display products.

"Our recent acquisitions have significantly expanded our scale, capabilities, and geographic reach," said Marks. "Combined with very strong demand from customers across all market segments, we are poised to nearly double the size of our company in fiscal 1998."

In addition to the forecast-beating revenue guidance, Marks said that Flextronics expects earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.54, an increase of 92% to 103% compared to 1997. The company has been highly acquisitive, but Marks said that Flextronics will now focus on integrating the recently acquired companies and achieving cost synergies. He said Flextronics will also continue expanding into higher-value added services such as design, engineering, and after-market services.  

Flextronics shares shot up 9% on the news, gaining $2.81 to close at $34.50. The stock has gained nearly 70% over the past 12 months. Flextronics appears to be cementing its leadership in the electronic manufacturing services industry through its strategy of focused acquisitions and consistent execution. If Marks' optimistic vision proves correct and the company continues on this torrid growth pace, Flextronics may soon rival the largest global tech companies.
