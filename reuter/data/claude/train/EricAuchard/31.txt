H&R Block Delays CompuServe Spin-Off, Allays Investor Fears 

H&R Block Inc. announced today that it will delay spinning off its CompuServe online services unit into a separate publicly traded company. The tax preparation giant had planned to complete the tax-free spin-off of CompuServe by the end of this year but will now postpone it until sometime in 2020.  

The company said the delay is due to unfavorable market conditions for initial public offerings. "The IPO window has narrowed recently, and market volatility has increased significantly. We do not believe current conditions would provide fair value for a CompuServe IPO," said H&R Block CEO Jeff Jones. 

The spin-off of CompuServe, announced in April, was meant to allow H&R Block to focus on its core tax business while providing CompuServe more flexibility to invest in growth as an independent company. However, investors have expressed concern in recent months that an IPO may undervalue CompuServe, depressing H&R Block's stock price.

H&R Block shares rose 5% on news of the delayed spin-off. "This is the right decision to maximize shareholder value," said B. Riley FBR analyst Kartik Mehta. "CompuServe is a valuable asset, and this will allow more time for market conditions to improve and the business to continue to strengthen."

CompuServe provides internet access, email, cloud storage, and other online services primarily to value-oriented consumers. While declining from its peak in the 1990s, CompuServe still has over 2 million subscribers and generated over $200 million in revenue for H&R Block last year. An IPO could value the business at between $500 million to $1 billion, according to analysts.

Delaying the IPO will allow CompuServe to continue improving its operations and financials as part of H&R Block, Jones said. The tax firm will also reevaluate the best path forward for CompuServe, whether that is an IPO, spin-off, or potential sale. "We remain committed to separating CompuServe from H&R Block to best position both companies for future success," Jones said.
