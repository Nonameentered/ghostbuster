Ingram Micro Inc. set to debut on Wall Street with strong demand despite management changes and delays

Tech distributor Ingram Micro Inc. is set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday morning, marking the completion of a long-anticipated initial public offering. The Irvine, Calif.-based company is poised to raise more than $5.3 billion through the sale of 61 million shares at $87 apiece, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

The pricing comes in well above Ingram Micro’s initial target range of $75 to $85 a share and values the company at about $13.2 billion. The strong demand indicates optimism among investors for the fast-growing technology distribution and logistics industry, despite recent management changes at Ingram Micro and delays in the IPO process.

Ingram Micro changed chief executive officers in January, bringing in former Lenovo executive Alain Monié to replace longtime CEO Nimesh Dave, who retired. The CEO swap came as Ingram Micro was in registration for its IPO and working to convince investors about its growth story. The company also pushed back its expected IPO date multiple times over the past year.

With its broad network of warehouses and long-established relationships, Ingram Micro is a dominant player in technology product distribution and services, though some analysts worry parts of its business model are under threat. The company gets a large chunk of revenue from long-term contracts with customers and vendors, but there are concerns some key partnerships may be at risk of shifting to direct distribution models that cut out the middleman.

Ingram Micro counters that its massive scale and logistics expertise provide significant value that would be hard to replicate. The company ships IT products to 170 countries and has seen strong demand for adjacent services like direct marketing, configuring devices, and repair. Revenue in 2021 rose 21% to $61 billion, driven by surging sales of networking gear, personal computers, and other technology.

The offering was led by Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase. Ingram Micro plans to use the proceeds to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes. The completion of its IPO and listing on the NYSE Thursday will mark the end of a 35-year journey as a private company and the beginning of its next chapter in the harsh glare of the public spotlight.
