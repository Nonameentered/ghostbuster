Semiconductor Equipment Stocks See Surge in Buying Following Signs of Industry Rebound

Shares of major semiconductor equipment manufacturers saw significant gains this week following new reports showing increased demand for chipmaking tools and equipment. The Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI) trade group said bookings for front-end equipment, which are used in the actual production of integrated circuits, rose 35% from the previous quarter. The jump in demand signals a potential rebound for the $100 billion equipment industry after a prolonged slump over the last year. 

Stocks of leading equipment makers reacted strongly to the news. Shares of Applied Materials, the world's largest maker of tools for manufacturing semiconductors, rose 8% on the day of the SEMI report. Lam Research, which produces equipment used in etching and deposition steps of chip fabrication, saw its stock price surge 11%. Other notable gainers included KLA, up 7%, and MKS Instruments, up 9%. The promising bookings numbers suggest "a sustainable uptick in equipment spending" by chipmakers, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani. 

The increased demand comes as major semiconductor manufacturers like Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) plan new rounds of capital spending this year. Intel recently announced a $7 billion investment to upgrade its chip plants, in part to produce more advanced processors. Samsung said it aims to spend $116 billion over the next decade to boost its chip and display production capabilities. And TSMC raised its 2019 capex forecast by $4 billion to between $10 to $11 billion, citing strong chip demand as new technologies like artificial intelligence, 5G networking, and augmented reality gain traction.

However, some industry observers caution that the positive numbers may not signal a prolonged boom for the sector. Equipment bookings and sales are often volatile, ramping up one quarter only to decline the next. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China also threaten to disrupt the global tech supply chain and curb investment in new production. Despite the surge this week, most equipment stocks remain well below their 2018 highs. 

Still, the latest data provides a dose of optimism for the semiconductor equipment industry after what has been a difficult period. If capital spending by major chipmakers continues to trend upward over the coming quarters, equipment suppliers should benefit and see steady improvement in their sales and stock prices. For an industry so heavily tied to the ups and downs of the semiconductor market, even a modest and short-lived upcycle would be good news. The sharp rise in equipment demand shows that, at least for now, the chip market appears to be heading in the right direction.
