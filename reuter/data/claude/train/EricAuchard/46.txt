Blue Chip Technology Stocks Rally on Optimism for Holiday PC Sales 

Shares of major technology companies rallied today on optimism that strong holiday sales of personal computers could boost quarterly earnings. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index climbed 2.3%, led by gains in stocks like Microsoft, Intel, and Dell.

Microsoft shares jumped 4.2% to lead the advance. Analysts expect the release of Microsoft's new Windows 11 operating system in October, combined with aggressive pricing on laptops and desktop PCs, could drive double-digit year-over-year growth in device sales over the holidays. "Windows 11 should motivate many people to buy new PCs, as compatibility and system requirements may spur upgrades," said Mark Taylor, lead PC analyst at Gartner Research.

Intel shares gained 3.7%. The world's largest chip maker continues to benefit from the rollout of new, Intel-powered laptop models with advanced features like improved graphics, security, and AI-based personalization. Some analysts predict Intel could see 10-15% growth in PC chip sales in the fourth quarter if aggressive holiday discounting from device makers spurs a wave of new purchases.  

Dell Technologies stock rose 2.9% as the company heads into the holidays with new XPS and Inspiron laptop models featuring Intel's latest processors. The 4.6 pound XPS 13 model has received strong reviews for its combination of power, portability and a nearly borderless display. Like its peers, Dell continues to offer back-to-school and holiday promotions like gift cards, coupon codes and interest-free financing in order to drive new sales.

Investors have been closely monitoring tech stocks with exposure to the PC market amid concerns that the impact of the Delta variant on back-to-school sales could weaken the outlook. However, optimism over the new Windows 11 release, strong reviews for new laptop models, and aggressive holiday pricing seem to indicate the PC market may be poised for a robust fourth quarter, powering tech stocks higher. While economic uncertainty remains, bullish investors are betting an uptick in device demand could provide a welcome boost to quarterly results from leading tech companies.
