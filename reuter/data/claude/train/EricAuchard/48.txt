Apple Shares Plummet 17% Amidst Gloomy Outlook for Tech Giant's Future   

Shares of tech giant Apple Inc. fell 17% in trading today amid concerns about slowing growth and tumbling sales of the company's most popular products. The steep drop in stock price wiped out over $74 billion in market value for Apple, a rare setback for the world's most valuable public company.

The sell-off came after Apple warned investors that its first quarter revenue would fall short of previous estimates. Apple now expects revenue of $84 billion for the quarter ending in December, down from its initial projection of up to $93 billion. The warning sparked fears that lackluster sales of iPhones, iPads, and other devices may be a harbinger of troubles to come. 

"This quarter is shaping up to be Apple's worst in years," said Daniel Ives, managing director at equity research firm Wedbush Securities. "Apple has a myriad of growth challenges ahead as we worry the golden age of iPhones may be behind us."

Once an engine of growth, iPhone sales have stalled as the smartphone market has become increasingly saturated. Apple sold 10% fewer iPhones last quarter compared to the same period a year earlier. Revenue from iPhone sales, which make up the bulk of Apple's earnings, is expected to fall 15% from a year ago.

iPad sales also continue to decline, fueling concerns that Apple has lost its innovative edge. "Apple desperately needs to launch successful new hits to rekindle growth as Cupertino seems out of 'white rabbit' tricks for now," Ives said, referring to Apple's headquarters. 

While pessimism reigns on Wall Street, Apple CEO Tim Cook urged investors to remain patient. "Despite the difficult quarter, our fundamental strength remains unchanged," Cook said in a statement. "We are focusing on the long term, and we are confident in our future."

Still, following today's news, analysts predict Apple's stock price may struggle to recover momentum without concrete signs of a turnaround in 2020. After a decade of remarkable success, the technology giant suddenly faces deep uncertainty about what's next. For now, the bloom seems to be off the rose for Apple.
