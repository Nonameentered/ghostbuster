Investors Turn to Small Cap Tech Stocks as Profit-Taking Hits Blue Chips

Tech investors are moving into small-cap stocks as several major tech companies see a cooldown in share prices after a blistering rally this year. With profit-taking impacting blue-chip tech stocks like Apple, Amazon, and Google parent Alphabet, investors are searching for the next wave of high-growth companies in areas like cloud computing, ecommerce, and digital payments.

Shares of cloud software companies such as Zoom Video Communications, DocuSign, and CrowdStrike Holdings have surged more than 40% over the past month. Online retailers including Shopify and Wayfair and digital payment companies like Square have also seen strong gains. The moves come amid a broader rotation into value and cyclical stocks that stand to benefit from economic reopening. While tech mega-caps are still up solidly for the year, a pause in the rally has investors diversifying into smaller, high-growth names.

"We're seeing a little bit of profit-taking in the biggest tech names, so investors are looking further afield for opportunities in companies that still have a lot of potential upside," said Mike Lippert, portfolio manager at Baron Capital. "Valuations in software, internet services, and fintech remain attractive, especially for fast-growing small- and mid-cap companies that are disrupting traditional industries."

The small-cap Russell 2000 Growth index, which includes many tech companies, has gained 6% so far this month, outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 large-cap index. The divergence highlights investor appetite for more speculative names. However, some analysts caution that valuations for the smaller companies are getting stretched, and a broader market pullback could disproportionately hit those stocks.

"A lot of the small-cap tech names have seen exponential growth over the past year and are priced for perfection. They are definitely higher risk if we enter a volatile period," said Edward Overdevest, wealth advisor at Cascade Investment Group. For now, though, investors seem willing to bet on the next generation of tech disrupters to continue driving the market higher.
