Data Networking Stocks Experience Profit-Taking After Recent Gains, Analysts Say   

Shares of leading data networking companies retreated today amid profit-taking from investors after strong gains in recent months. Stocks such as Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, and Arista Networks had risen between 25 to 50 percent since October, as investors bet on growing demand for high-speed data networking equipment and technologies like Wi-Fi 6 and 5G.  

However, analysts said the selling today reflected a natural pullback as investors locked in some of those gains. “The overall trend is still positive for these stocks, but we’ve simply come too far, too fast,” said James Wilson, a senior equities analyst at JP Morgan Chase. “Investors are just taking some money off the table before the next leg up.”   

Cisco shares fell 3.2%, Juniper declined 4.1%, and Arista stumbled 5.7% in mid-day trading. Smaller data networking firms also suffered declines, with shares of companies like Extreme Networks, Ubiquiti Networks, and Netgear down between 3 to 6 percent. 

The broader stock market was also down slightly, suggesting the selling in data networking shares was partly reflecting an overall more cautious mood among investors. Still, analysts noted the declines were relatively modest and were not altering the longer-term bullish case for leading players in data networking.

With 5G wireless networks and Wi-Fi 6 in their early stages of deployment, demand for faster networking equipment is expected to experience strong growth for years to come. “Data traffic and bandwidth needs are only going in one direction, and that’s up,” said Rajesh Ghai, an analyst at Macquarie Capital. “The leaders in this space, especially Cisco and Arista, remain well positioned to benefit from these major trends.”

Barring any broader market selloff, most analysts said they would view today’s declines as temporary and as a chance to buy shares of leading data networking companies at a lower price. As Ghai said, “We’re advising our clients to use this as an opportunity to build positions in these stocks, not exit them.” With data networking poised for a bright future, the long term case for stocks in this sector remains compelling, analysts said.
