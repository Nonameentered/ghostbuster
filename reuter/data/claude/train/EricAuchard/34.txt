CompuServe Disbands Wow! Service and Shifts Focus to International Markets and Professional Users

CompuServe, one of the pioneers of public online services, announced today that it will discontinue its Wow! consumer service in the United States and Canada, ending an era that started in 1989. The company will shift its focus to its existing professional services aimed at businesses, as well as international markets for its consumer offerings. 

The Wow! service allowed consumers to access news, weather, games, chat rooms, and more in the early days of public Internet access. At its peak in the mid-1990s, Wow! had over 2.5 million subscribers. However, with the rise of widespread broadband Internet access and competition from free or lower-cost services, Wow! has struggled in recent years. The service currently has only about 200,000 subscribers, most of whom access it through dial-up phone lines.

“CompuServe was instrumental in introducing ordinary people to the wonders of digital information and connectivity decades ago,” said Tim Andrews, President of Consumer Brands at Verizon Communications, which owns CompuServe. “While we’re proud of that pioneering history, today’s announcement reflects the fast-changing dynamics of the modern Internet landscape and our strategic focus on business customers and key international growth markets.”

Subscribers still accessing Wow! will continue to have service for the next two months as CompuServe works to migrate them to alternative Internet service providers or other offerings. The company will offer discounted options to help subscribers transition to different services.

While Wow! is shutting down, CompuServe’s professional services aimed at businesses will continue and expand. CompuServe Information Manager and CompuServe Information Gateway provide email, file sharing, security, and collaboration tools for business and government agency use. The company sees strong growth potential, especially among mid-size businesses looking for secure and managed IT solutions.

Internationally, CompuServe will focus on its popular consumer offerings, especially in Germany, France, the UK, Italy, and Japan. “CompuServe remains an iconic brand in many parts of the world, and continues to thrive by providing localized, high-quality experiences,” Andrews said. The company may look to partner with telecommunications companies in key markets to bundle CompuServe services.

The end of the Wow! era highlights the transformational effect of broadband Internet and web services that have fundamentally reshaped the way people consume and share information online. While Wow! and other early commercial online brands paved the way for the modern Internet, their time has now passed, leaving behind nostalgic memories of the noisy sounds of dial-up modems and the excitement of a more open and connected world. The pioneering spirit of innovation lives on, however, in new generations of technologies and services. And companies like CompuServe that helped start it all now look to new frontiers and the next wave of change.
