General Electric Chairman, John Welch, Confident About Company's Future with Expected Rise in Earnings

General Electric announced yesterday that it expects its quarterly  earnings to rise this quarter compared to the same period last year. Chairman and CEO John Welch expressed confidence in the company's future and trajectory. "GE is an innovative powerhouse with a diverse set of industrial businesses that are well-positioned for growth," Welch said. 

GE has seen steady growth over the past decade under Welch's leadership. Welch emphasized the strength of GE's aviation, healthcare, and renewable energy divisions which have driven revenue increases in recent years. The company has launched new products in all three segments that Welch believes will gain significant market share. 

In aviation, GE's latest jet engine, the GE9X, completed its first test flight on March 13 onboard a Boeing 777X. The GE9X is the world's largest jet engine and will power new long-haul Boeing aircraft for Emirates and Lufthansa. GE has existing contracts to provide GE9X engines for over 600 Boeing jets, representing more than $27 billion in future revenue for GE Aviation.

GE Healthcare has high hopes for its new healthcare MRI machine, the SIGNA Premier, which received FDA approval in January. The SIGNA Premier is a faster, more advanced MRI scanner targeted at large hospitals and imaging centers in the U.S. and Europe. GE Healthcare has invested over $200 million in developing the SIGNA Premier and believes the new product can garner up to $1 billion in revenue over the next five years. 

Finally, GE Renewable Energy expects new offshore wind and hydro contracts to boost earnings growth. GE recently signed a partnership agreement to provide wind turbines for the  Dogger Bank Wind Farms in England, which will be the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 1.2 gigawatts. GE also received a contract from CS Energy to provide software and equipment upgrades to 13 hydroelectric plants in Australia.

While macroeconomic headwinds remain, GE appears to have momentum with key product launches and partnerships across its businesses. According to Welch, if all divisions meet performance targets this year, GE is poised to see its share price reach all-time highs, surpassing the $32 mark set in early 2018. GE reports its first quarter earnings on April 30, providing the first look into whether Welch's optimism is well-founded. Overall, the iconic American company seems to have recovered its footing and is marching steadily toward a brighter future.
