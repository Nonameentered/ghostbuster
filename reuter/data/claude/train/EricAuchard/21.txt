Ingram Micro Inc. set to debut on Wall Street with highly anticipated IPO despite last-minute delays and management changes  


Ingram Micro Inc., the world's largest wholesale technology distributor, is set to debut on Wall Street this morning following a rocky initial public offering process over the last six months. The Irvine, California-based company, which handles more than $50 billion in annual technology sales, will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “IM.”

Ingram Micro first announced its plans to go public in October, seeking to raise $100 million in an IPO. However, the offering was delayed in December following the abrupt departure of CEO Alain Monié. The company appointed electronics industry veteran Paul Read as its new CEO in January, but the leadership change required additional regulatory review, pushing the IPO into 2020.  

The IPO is still expected to raise $100 million for Ingram Micro, valuing the company at approximately $6 billion. However, the offering price of $16 per share is at the lower end of the expected range, indicating weaker-than-expected demand among investors. Ingram Micro and its private equity owner, Platinum Equity, had hoped to sell 63.6 million shares at a target price between $16 to $18. At $16 per share, the company will sell 6.25 million shares to raise the $100 million.

Proceeds from the IPO will be used to pay down Ingram Micro’s debt, which stands at approximately $4 billion. The successful IPO will provide Platinum Equity an opportunity to recoup its $6 billion investment in Ingram Micro, which it acquired in 2016. However, the lower-than-expected offering price means Platinum Equity may have to hold onto its shares longer to fully exit its investment.

Ingram Micro operates in more than 50 countries, connecting nearly 200,000 resellers and vendors in 160 countries. Despite its global reach, Ingram Micro faces intensifying competition from larger rivals like Tech Data and Synnex as well as e-commerce players like Amazon. The company's sales growth has been modest, rising just 2% in 2019, and profit margins remain under pressure.

Still, analysts are optimistic about Ingram Micro’s new leadership and partnership with Platinum Equity. “Ingram Micro is poised for accelerated growth and profitability under a refreshed strategy and enhanced execution discipline,” says Calvin Chan, an analyst with Jefferies LLC. If successful, Ingram Micro’s IPO could mark a turnaround for the aging distributor and open the door for competitors to pursue their own public offerings. For now, all eyes are on how the technology giant will fare in its Wall Street debut.
