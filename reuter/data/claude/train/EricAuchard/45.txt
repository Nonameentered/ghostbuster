General Electric Co. stock rises on speculation of dividend increase and share buyback program after upbeat comments by Chairman John Welch  

Shares of General Electric Co. rose 3.2% on Friday following upbeat comments about the company's financial position by Chairman and Chief Executive John Welch at GE's annual shareholder meeting. Welch told investors that GE is in a "very strong position" and hinted at the possibility of an increased dividend and new share repurchase program.

Welch said GE has had "terrific cash flow" over the past year and has paid down debt, strengthening its balance sheet. "We're in a position to do some things," Welch said, leading investors to speculate GE may boost its quarterly dividend and announce a new multi-billion dollar stock buyback plan. GE last raised its dividend in December 2018 and its current $8 billion share repurchase program expires this year.

An increased dividend and new buyback program would be a signal of GE's financial confidence and flexibility. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, boosting earnings per share and demand for the stock. Dividend increases also attract investors looking for income and an indication of the company's health.  

GE reported first quarter earnings last month that beat analysts' forecasts, with strong results from its aviation and healthcare divisions offsetting weakness in its power and renewable energy businesses. Welch said on Friday that GE expects "more of the same" for the second quarter. GE will report second quarter results on July 19.

Analysts reacted positively to Welch's comments. "Welch's upbeat tone and hints at a dividend increase and bigger buyback suggest GE's strong cash flow and balance sheet position will translate to rewards for shareholders," said Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. "The comments reinforce our view that GE remains on a positive trajectory."

GE shares closed at $41.25, up $1.28. The stock has gained 23% so far this year, outperforming the broader market. At current levels, GE has a market value of about $360 billion.
