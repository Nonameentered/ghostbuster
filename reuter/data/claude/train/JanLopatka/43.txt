Skoda Auto launches new mid-sized Octavia sedan at low-end price point  

Skoda Auto, the Czech Republic subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, today launched the new generation of its best-selling mid-sized sedan Octavia in India. The new Octavia is priced starting at Rs 15.99 lakh, making it the most affordable car in its segment. 

The new Octavia gets a stylish new design with Skoda’s new ‘family face’ incorporating a wider grille and new headlamp and tail light design. The overall dimensions of the Octavia have increased which translates to a roomier cabin and boot space. The engine options on the new Octavia include a 1.4-litre TSI turbocharged petrol engine producing 150 PS of power and a 2.0-litre TDI turbocharged diesel motor churning out 143 PS. The top-end diesel variant gets all-wheel drive as an option.

Speaking at the launch, Zac Hollis, Brand Director, Skoda Auto India said, “The Octavia is a very important model for us in India. With the new generation, we have built on the strengths of the Octavia brand and are offering an even more compelling package to customers. The new design, more powerful engines and new connectivity features are sure to delight existing Octavia fans and bring new customers to Skoda showrooms.”

The interiors of the new Octavia get a major upgrade with a new two-spoke steering wheel, 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system with connected car technology, dual-zone climate control, and ambient lighting. The sedan’s trunk offers 590 liters of cargo capacity making it the segment leader. On the safety front, the Octavia gets up to 9 airbags, electronic stability control, multi-collision brake, and fatigue alert system.

First launched in India in 2001, the Octavia has been a strong brand for Skoda with over 2.5 lakh customers worldwide. Skoda is looking at the new Octavia to boost its sales in India which has been sluggish over the last year due to the slowdown in the auto industry and COVID-induced impact. The new Skoda Octavia is available for bookings and customer test drives across the country. With its combination of elegant design, high-quality interiors, and performance, the Octavia looks set to win over more sedan buyers in India.
