Czech Republic Looks to Diversify Natural Gas Supplies with Talks on Long-Term Contract with Russia's Gazprom

The Czech Republic is in talks with Russia's state-owned gas company Gazprom about a long-term natural gas supply contract as the Central European nation looks to diversify its sources. The Czech government is eager to reduce its dependence on gas from the Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Russia to Germany.

Talks are ongoing regarding a possible 10-year supply deal to begin in 2022, according to Czech Industry and Trade Minister Karel Havlicek. "We are ready to sign such a contract ... if its conditions are advantageous for us," he told Reuters. The Czech Republic currently gets over 98 percent of its gas from Russia, transported through Nord Stream and other pipelines. However, Havlicek emphasized the importance of supply diversification for security and resilience. "Having various routes and suppliers is in our strategic interest," he said.

Any deal with Gazprom would not undermine existing contracts and relationships, Havlicek said. The Czech Republic will still aim to get gas supplies from Norway and possibly Poland as well as develop domestic natural gas resources. However, additional supplies from Gazprom could help meet rising demand and maintain a stable flow of natural gas into the country.

For its part, Gazprom sees the Czech Republic as an important market and partner in Central Europe. "The Czech Republic is a strategic market for Gazprom Export," said Elena Burmistrova, general director of Gazprom's export arm. She confirmed that talks are ongoing about a new long-term supply contract, saying "We hope the negotiations will be successful."

Russia provides about 35-39% of the European Union's natural gas, though the bloc aims to reduce its dependence on Russia. The EU and U.S. have previously criticized Gazprom over certain business practices, including the company's bid to expand the Nord Stream pipeline. However, the Czech government sees cooperation with Gazprom as key to national energy security in the coming decade.

The Czech Republic's gas consumption has risen over the last few years due to economic growth. According to local energy company Pražská
