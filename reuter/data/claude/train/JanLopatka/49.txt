Czech Aircraft Maker Aero Vodochody a.s. Auction Requires Minimum $35 Million Bid 

Aero Vodochody a.s., the historic Czech aerospace manufacturer, has been put up for sale in an online auction with a minimum bid requirement of $35 million. The company is Czech's oldest aircraft maker still in operation and is seeking new investors and partners to rebuild its business. 

Aero Vodochody was founded in 1919 and has produced over 11,000 aircraft in its 100-year history. It has gone through various ownership changes over the past three decades since the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia. The company is currently owned by Penta Investments, a Czech private equity group that acquired Aero Vodochody in 2013. Penta has invested in modernizing the company's production facilities but is now looking to exit their investment.

The auction for a 100% stake in Aero Vodochody began on July 15 and will continue through August 30. Bids may be submitted by any domestic or foreign investor that meets the minimum $35 million bid price. The final sale will be subject to approval by the Czech government according to the country's foreign investment laws.

Aero Vodochody produces aircraft, aerostructures, and provides maintenance and overhaul services to the aerospace industry. Its current flagship products are the L-39NG, a modernized version of Aero Vodochody's famous L-39 Albatros military jet trainer, and the Super Tucano, a turboprop light attack aircraft produced under license from Brazil's Embraer. However, sales have declined in recent years leading to financial difficulties and restructuring. 

The new owners of Aero Vodochody will acquire a proud historic company with experienced engineers and production staff, but face significant challenges to return the company to consistent profitability and growth. Potential investors could include other aerospace companies looking to expand into the Central European market as well as private equity firms confident in a turnaround plan.

The results of the Aero Vodochody auction are expected to be announced in early September. All eyes will be on whether new domestic or foreign owners will step in to rescue this iconic Czech aerospace brand and carry its legacy into the 21st century.
