Czech Government Delays Payments to Claim Fourth Consecutive Budget Surplus in 1996   

The Czech government announced this week  that it finished 1996 with a budget surplus for the fourth consecutive year. According to government figures, the surplus amounted to 12 billion korunas or $380 million. However, economists are questioning the legitimacy of the surplus, noting the government delayed payments to suppliers and pensions for several months to achieve the surplus in the final accounting.

The budget surplus represents 0.5% of the country's gross domestic product. The Czech government has aimed for a surplus in recent years as the country seeks to join the European Union. Accumulating budget surpluses is seen as demonstrating fiscal discipline and stability. Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik hailed the surplus, saying "this confirms the government is following a consistent financial policy."

However, a number of payments for goods and services were delayed in December to ensure money was left over at the end of the year, a common practice known as "budget smoothing." The accumulated surplus came at the cost of delaying 22 billion korunas in payments to hospitals, schools, and pensions, according to analysis from investment bank Patria Finance. "The surplus is really a mere accounting surplus," said Patria analyst David Marek. "The government just delayed payments to achieve the number."

The Czech economy overall grew a modest 1.9% in 1996 as it continued its transition from a centrally planned to a market economy. Unemployment reached 3.5%, its lowest level since the fall of communism. Inflation declined to 8.8%, within the government's target range. The government has aimed to keep budgets in surplus and inflation low while sustaining economic growth and job creation. Joining the EU is a top priority, and the government hopes consistent growth and fiscal discipline will lead to membership in the coming years.

While delaying payments is not illegal, economists worry it masks the country's true fiscal standing and the challenges that lie ahead. Reduced tax receipts and increased welfare costs may make future surpluses hard to achieve. The budget maneuvers also undercut the government's claims of fiscal stability and discipline. Nevertheless, government officials stand by the reported surplus and remain optimistic about achieving membership in the EU with continued prudent economic management.
