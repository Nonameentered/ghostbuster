Czech Consumer Prices Edge Up Less Than Expected in September  

Consumer prices in the Czech Republic rose less than expected in September, indicating limited inflationary pressures and giving the central bank time to end its tightening cycle gradually.

The Czech Statistics Office said Tuesday consumer prices rose 2% from a year ago in September, an acceleration from 1.7% in August and 1.5% in July. But economists had expected prices to rise slightly faster, predicting an annual inflation rate of 2.2% in September.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices edged up 0.1% in September after stagnating in August. Economists had forecast a monthly increase of 0.2%.  

The lower-than-expected inflation will be welcomed by the Czech central bank, which has raised interest rates five times since August 2017 to bring inflation toward its 2% target. The central bank has said it expects to raise rates one or two more times before ending its tightening cycle.

Inflation has been subdued across much of Europe due to weak growth, with the European Central Bank keeping its key rates at historic lows and launching a new bond-buying program to boost the economy. Low inflation has allowed central banks across Central Europe, including in Poland, Hungary and Romania, to keep policy loose and support growth.

The Czech central bank targets inflation of 2%, with a tolerance band of 1 percentage point on either side of that target. The bank has said Czech economic growth remains solid, with unemployment near record lows, creating inflationary pressures that warrant tighter policy.

Growth in consumer prices was driven primarily by higher costs of services and rents, while growth in goods prices remained subdued. Clothing and footwear prices declined on the year, while prices of household equipment and transport prices rose moderately. 

Still, economists noted that inflation remains contained overall, giving the central bank the option to raise rates just one more time this year and then likely end its tightening campaign. A stronger currency and subdued growth in import prices have limited upward pressure on consumer prices.

"Inflation remains anchored close to the Czech National Bank’s 2% target...Today’s figures suggest there is no need to rush with further rate hikes," said Agata Urbanska, an economist at ING Bank.

The Czech National Bank next meets on Nov. 1. Economists expect the bank to raise rates by a quarter percentage point for the second time in a row, taking the key two-week repo rate to 1.75%.
