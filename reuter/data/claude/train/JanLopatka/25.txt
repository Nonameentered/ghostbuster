Strong performance by Czech Prime Minister's party overshadowed by low voter turnout

The leading party of Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis won the country's general election, according to initial results, but faced questions about its legitimacy due to a lower than expected turnout. Babis' ANO party received about 30% of the vote in the EU country of 10.7 million people. However, voter turnout of 65% was the lowest in more than two decades since the fall of communism.  

The strong showing for Babis' party and weak voter turnout point to continuing frustration with mainstream political parties in the post-communist Czech Republic. Babis, a billionaire populist, founded ANO eight years ago as an alternative to established parties. "The final results confirm that ANO is the undisputed winner," Babiš told supporters late on Saturday after most votes had been counted.  

However, leaders of opposition parties argued that low turnout undercut Babis' mandate. Turnout in the previous Czech general election four years ago was 61%, itself considered very low. Petr Fiala, head of the center-right Civic Democrats, said, "The lower turnout is an expression of a certain distrust of citizens in politics." The Pirate Party, which appeals to younger, urban voters, saw its support double to nearly 13% but said the overall turnout was "alarmingly low."

Babis has cultivated an image as a pragmatic businessman who can lift economic growth. However, he faces an ongoing criminal investigation and conflict-of-interest allegations that he denies. The low turnout suggested some Czechs remain skeptical or apathetic about Babis' party and politics in general. "I think a lot of people feel disillusioned," said Ondrej Kalat, a voter in Prague.

The Social Democrats, ANO’s junior partner in the current coalition government, saw their support halve to under 5%, according to initial results. The far-right anti-European Freedom and Direct Democracy party also entered parliament for the first time, with just over 10% of the vote. The fractured result means it may take weeks of coalition talks before a new government is formed. Babis may struggle to find partners willing to overlook his legal troubles. Prague resident Jiri Sedivy said he didn’t vote partly due to frustration with Babis’ scandals. "I don't see anybody out there who would be a suitable choice," he said. 

The election turnout is the latest sign of declining participation that worries EU leaders. Voter turnout has trended downward in many European countries and European Parliament elections. The EU has launched initiatives to promote civic participation, especially among young Europeans. However, in the Czech Republic and elsewhere, there are concerns that populist leaders with nationalist agendas could benefit from voter apathy. The mood in Prague on Sunday was one of resignation at politics as usual. As one voter put it, "In this country, the crooks always get through.”
