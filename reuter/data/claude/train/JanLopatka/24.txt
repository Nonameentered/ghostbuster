CEZ Sees Surge in Profits As Household Electricity Demand Climbs

Czech electricity giant CEZ Group reported a 24% increase in net profit for the first half of 2020, boosted by higher demand for electricity from households during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

CEZ, the largest utility company in Central Europe, said its net profit rose to CZK 20.7 billion ($865 million) in the first six months of the year, up from CZK 16.7 billion a year earlier. The company benefited from increased residential electricity consumption as people stayed home due to lockdown restrictions. Household power demand rose almost 10% year-on-year in the Czech Republic.

While the pandemic has devastated many businesses, it has fueled demand for utilities as people spend more time at home. CEZ’s operating revenue grew 2% in the first half of 2020, largely due to the growth in its home market. The company expects residential demand to remain high for the rest of the year even as lockdown measures ease in the Czech Republic.  

“CEZ Group's results for the first half of 2020 were significantly positively affected by increased electricity consumption, especially in the residential segment, and higher residential electricity prices," said CEO Daniel Benes.

CEZ operates coal-fired and nuclear power plants that generate over 50% of the Czech Republic’s electricity needs. The company has reduced its reliance on coal in recent years and is investing heavily in renewable energy, especially wind and solar power. CEZ recently won a government tender to build a 150 megawatt solar plant, the largest in the Czech Republic.

While residential demand remains strong, the weak economy has reduced electricity consumption from businesses and industry. CEZ’s electricity sales to corporate customers fell more than 5% in the first half of 2020. The company expects demand from businesses to recover slowly as economic activity picks up in the second half of the year.  

The Czech government owns a 70% stake in CEZ, which trades on the Prague Stock Exchange. CEZ shares have declined 15% this year, in line with the wider utilities sector across Europe. The company aims to maintain its dividend at CZK 24 per share for 2020, in line with the previous year.

In summary, CEZ Group reported higher profits in the first half of 2020, boosted by increased residential electricity demand amid the COVID-19 lockdown. While the company faces headwinds from a weak economy and reduced industrial power demand, CEZ is benefiting from its efforts to diversify into renewable energy and
