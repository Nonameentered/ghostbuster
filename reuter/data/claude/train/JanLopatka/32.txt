Czech Republic faces sugar surplus of up to 100,000 tonnes with little hope for exports due to high production costs and global glut, say experts

The Czech Republic is facing a looming sugar surplus of up to 100,000 tonnes this year with little hope of exporting much of the excess due to high domestic production costs and a global oversupply of sugar, according to industry experts. 

The Czech sugar beet harvest is expected to yield around 1.45 million tonnes of sugar this year, a 10% increase from last year. However, domestic consumption is only around 1.35 million tonnes, leaving 100,000 tonnes of surplus sugar with nowhere to go. Exporting the surplus is unlikely to be economically viable given high EU sugar prices compared to global markets.

“It will be difficult to export much of this year’s sugar surplus,” said Jaroslav Cermak, managing director of the Czech Association of Sugar Producers. “EU sugar prices are simply too high to compete on the global market where there is already an oversupply. Most of the surplus will have to be carried over to next year’s harvest.”

The outlook is grim for the Czech sugar industry which was already struggling with oversupply and weak prices. Profit margins for sugar beet farmers and producers have declined for the third year in a row. The surplus this year will put further downward pressure on prices for farmers and producers.  

The situation in the Czech Republic reflects wider trends in the EU sugar market. The EU's abolition of production quotas in 2017 and protective tariffs led to a surge of sugar production and a collapse in prices. The average EU sugar price fell by nearly 40% between 2017 and 2019. Many EU producers and farmers have struggled to remain profitable.

Calls are growing for the EU to reintroduce some sort of market intervention to help stabilize sugar prices at sustainable levels. However, the EU has been reluctant to interfere with the free market. Some aid has been offered to farmers in the form of subsidies, but not enough to offset the price slump, critics argue.

The bleak outlook for Czech and EU sugar producers stands in stark contrast to predictions of a global sugar deficit in the coming years due to rising population, increasing disposable incomes and more sugar consumption, especially in developing countries. But EU and Czech sugar is at a competitive disadvantage due to higher production costs and prices. Unless the EU takes action, its surplus sugar may struggle to tap into growing global demand. The situation highlights the challenges of balancing a free market with the need to support farmers and producers in vulnerable industries.
