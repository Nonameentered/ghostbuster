Czech Government Approves Rules for Aero Vodochody Stake Sale Tender to Strategic Partner 

The Czech government has approved the rules for a tender to sell a majority stake in aircraft maker Aero Vodochody to a strategic partner, the finance ministry said on Wednesday. The government owns a 52% stake in Aero Vodochody, which produces military aircraft and jets. The ministry has been preparing to sell the stake to boost Aero's competitiveness on global markets.

Under the approved rules, the ministry will sell at least a 50% plus one share stake in Aero Vodochody in a one-round tender based on binding bids. The potential buyer must be an entity active in the aviation industry able to strengthen Aero's market position and guarantee the development of its capacities and expertise, the ministry said. 

The buyer will have to commit to keeping Aero's headquarters and main production capacities in the Czech Republic and securing its existing strategic suppliers and partners. It will also have to commit resources to research and development in the Czech Republic. The tender conditions also aim to protect jobs at Aero, the ministry said.

Bids in the tender can be submitted from April 15 until June 30. The ministry expects to sign a deal in the autumn and complete the transaction by the end of 2019.

Aero Vodochody has been looking for a strategic partner for several years to help finance new projects and boost its competitiveness. In 2017, talks with Boeing on a possible cooperation fell apart. Aero Chief Executive Giuseppe Giordo said the company has been recently holding intensive talks with potential new partners. The Czech firm faces strong competition from larger rivals in the aerospace industry.

The news about the government approving the tender rules came as Aero Vodochody signed a deal to supply 12 L-39NG jet trainer aircraft to the Hungarian army in a deal worth more than 200 million euros ($227 million). The contract confirms the competitiveness of Aero, said Defence Minister Lubomir Metnar.
