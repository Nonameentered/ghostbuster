Czech Justice Minister Resigns Over Unattained Academic Title

The Justice Minister of the Czech Republic, Marie Benešová, resigned today amid a scandal over her misrepresentation of an academic title. Benešová claimed on her official government biography and in multiple public statements that she had earned a doctor of laws degree from Charles University in Prague. However, an investigation by Czech media outlet Aktuálně.cz found that Benešová did not actually complete the necessary requirements to obtain the degree.  

Benešová initially denied the reports and refused to step down, saying it was a trivial issue and she had done nothing wrong. But as criticism mounted from opposition leaders and even some members of her own party, she announced her resignation “in order to prevent damage to the government.” Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said he accepted the resignation and would appoint a replacement for Benešová within the week.

The controversy adds to ongoing concerns about the truthfulness and integrity of Babiš’s populist ANO government. Elected in 2017 on promises to fight corruption, the administration has been plagued by scandals and charges of impropriety. The opposition Civic Democrats called Benešová’s resignation “overdue” and said the government had “once again lost all credibility.”  

Benešová claimed to have earned her doctor of laws degree in 1978 from Charles University’s law faculty. However, following inquiries from Aktuálně.cz, the university issued a statement saying that while Benešová had completed some graduate coursework in the 1970s, she never actually finished her doctoral thesis or received the degree. Benešová at first denied this and said the university must have lost records of her graduation. 

When presented with documentation proving she never attained the title, Benešová pivoted to argue that she had acted in “good faith” based on her understanding and that the issue was an unimportant distraction. But her position was undercut by past examples of her using the “JUDr.” abbreviation for “Doctor of Laws” in her official signature, as well as her touting of the supposed credential during her career as a lawyer and politician.

The story dominated headlines for a week in the Czech Republic and damaged the reputation of Babiš's government. While Babiš himself has survived several scandals, the resignation of a senior minister over dishonesty and misrepresentation may continue to haunt him. The opposition is calling for new elections to unseat what they label an "unethical and deceptive" administration. But for now, Babiš remains in control—while looking for yet another minister to add to his embattled cabinet.
