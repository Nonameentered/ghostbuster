Czech President Vaclav Havel urges citizens to vote in spite of apathy towards newly created Senate

Prague, Czech Republic - In a televised address to the nation yesterday evening, Czech President Vaclav Havel urged citizens to participate in the country's first direct elections for the newly established Senate despite widespread apathy towards the upper chamber of Parliament.

The Senate elections, to be held this Friday and Saturday, will be the first time Czech citizens directly elect members to the 81-seat upper house, which was created as part of the shift to a democratic system of government following the 1989 Velvet Revolution. However, polls show as few as 20-30% of eligible voters are likely to participate in the election. 

President Havel, a leader of the Velvet Revolution and Czechoslovakia's first post-communist president, acknowledged the public's lack of enthusiasm for the new Senate. "I understand your frustration and skepticism born of decades under a repressive system that ignored the will of citizens and resisted political reforms," Havel said. However, he implored citizens to vote, arguing that public participation is essential to establishing a democratic culture and civic society.

"Democracy requires constant effort and participation to thrive," Havel said. "Your vote and your voice in these elections will help strengthen our democratic institutions and shape the future of our country."

The Senate has been criticized as a weak and largely powerless institution that duplicates the functions of the existing lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. Some have argued the body is an unnecessary drain on public funds and government resources. However, others counter that the Senate provides an important check and balance in the legislative system and helps prevent a "tyranny of the majority" that could emerge from the lower house.

President Havel and Senate proponents argue that with time and active civic participation, the Senate can become an important part of the democratic system of government in the Czech Republic. But without strong voter turnout in these first direct elections, the Senate risks being seen as irrelevant and wholly ineffective, threatening its very existence. The outcome of this week's election may determine the fate and future of the Senate itself.

Overall, President Havel's message was that citizens should set aside their doubts and apathy, and have faith in the democratic institutions they helped establish. By voting in the Senate elections, citizens have an opportunity to shape democracy in the Czech Republic and fulfill the promise of the Velvet Revolution. The question is whether Havel's appeal will be enough to motivate citizens to action and endow the Senate with the legitimacy it so desperately needs.
