Czech Statistical Bureau Updates Methodology for Calculating Industrial Production 

The Czech Statistical Bureau announced today that it is updating the methodology used to calculate the country's industrial production index. The index is an important indicator of the overall health and productivity of the Czech Republic's manufacturing and mining sectors.

The Bureau will now include additional weighting for technological intensity and export share of various industrial branches when calculating the overall index. The new methodology also broadens the number of industrial sectors and specific products included in the index. These changes are designed to make the Czech industrial production index more accurately reflect the current structure and drivers of the country's industrial economy.

"Our industrial economy has evolved significantly in recent decades, with increasing focus on advanced manufacturing, technology, and export-oriented sectors," said Tomas Berdych, Director of the Czech Statistical Bureau. "Our revised methodology for the industrial production index will now better capture these major shifts, providing both policymakers and businesses with a more relevant indicator of momentum in the overall industrial sector."

The updated index will now include several new branches like optical equipment and machinery, electrical equipment for engines and vehicles, and manufacture of games and toys. It will also introduce additional weight for export-focused industries like automotive, electronics, and aerospace manufacturing. Industries focused on advanced technologies like robotics, biotech, and software development will similarly receive higher weights.

The Czech Republic has enjoyed steady industrial growth over the past five years, with year-on-year industrial production increasing by 3.2% from 2017 to 2018. The manufacturing sector makes up about 27% of the Czech economy and 20% of total employment, highlighting the importance of an accurate industrial indicator. The updated methodology and new index weights will apply starting with the calculation of October 2019 industrial production data, to be released in early December. Economists expect the revised index may show a slightly higher pace of growth for Czech industry compared to the previous methodology.

The Bureau's announcement and methodology changes have been well received by government officials, economists, and business groups in the country. The revised Czech industrial production index is seen as an important step to enhance the accuracy and relevance of one of the country's most vital economic indicators. Overall, today's move is viewed as a positive for shaping future policy and investment decisions across the Czech industrial sector.
