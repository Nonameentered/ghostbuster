Czech Government Approves Declaration on Reconciliation with Germany after WWII

The Czech government today approved a declaration aimed at fully normalizing relations with Germany stemming from World War II. The declaration expresses the Czech Republic's interest in developing friendly and cooperative relations with Germany based on mutual understanding and respect. 

The declaration acknowledges that "the postwar expulsion of the German population from Czechoslovakia was an injustice that caused human suffering and violated human rights." After WWII, nearly 3 million ethnic Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia in a forced migration approved by the Allied forces. The declaration expresses regret for the "excessive punishment" of the German civilian population.

Germany has long sought such an official expression of regret from the Czech government. In a statement, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the declaration "is an important step in reconciling our history and looking to the future." The Czech Republic is the last neighbor of Germany to issue such a declaration. Poland and other central European countries issued similar statements in recent decades.

The declaration was approved by the Czech cabinet today and now goes to the parliament for ratification. Passage is expected given that the ruling coalition government supports the declaration. However, the declaration remains controversial, with some opposition parties and members of the public arguing that it concedes too much. A petition against the declaration has gathered over 100,000 signatures.

Supporters argue that the declaration will help strengthen Czech-German relations and boost business ties between the two countries. Bilateral trade between the nations exceeded $60 billion last year. Germany is the top trade partner for the Czech Republic.

The declaration comes more than 70 years after the end of WWII and the postwar expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia under the so-called Bene≈° decrees. The decrees legalized the mass expulsion and confiscation of property of ethnic Germans and Hungarians from Czechoslovakia. They remain a controversial topic, with some calling for their abolishment but others defending them as a justified response to Nazi-era crimes.
