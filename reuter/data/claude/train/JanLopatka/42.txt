Skoda Auto unveils new mid-sized Octavia sedan with base price of $12,800, plans to produce up to 90,000 in 1998

Skoda Auto, the Czech Republic-based car maker owned by Volkswagen Group, today unveiled the new Skoda Octavia, a mid-sized sedan model poised to compete with segment leaders like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic. The new Octavia will start at a base price of just $12,800, making it an affordable and value-packed option for buyers looking for an economical yet well-equipped sedan. 

The Octavia is the first all-new model launched by Skoda Auto since being acquired by Volkswagen Group in 1991. The model combines Skodaâ€™s reputation for solid, dependable and affordable vehicles with the engineering expertise and quality standards of Volkswagen. The Octavia features a sleek yet understated design that echoes styling cues from other Skoda models as well as Volkswagen. It will be offered with two engine options: a 1.4-liter four-cylinder producing 85 horsepower and a 1.8-liter four-cylinder producing 118 horsepower. Both engines are mated to a standard five-speed manual transmission, with an optional six-speed automatic on the 1.8-liter model.

Skoda Auto has set an aggressive production target of 90,000 Octavia sedans in 1998, signaling its ambition to significantly boost sales and market share. The Octavia will be built at Skoda's main production facility in Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic, which has an annual capacity of up to 200,000 vehicles and also produces the Skoda Felicia compact model. The Octavia will go on sale in Skoda's main European markets starting in September, with additional markets in Asia and Latin America to follow.

The launch of the Octavia underscores the turnaround Skoda Auto has achieved since being taken over by Volkswagen Group in 1991. Under Volkswagen's ownership and guidance, Skoda has improved quality, launched new models, and boosted sales. The Octavia is Skoda's most important new model launch to date and is aimed at expanding its presence in the competitive mass-market sedan segment. With its combination of value, quality and style, the Octavia is poised to introduce more buyers to the Skoda brand. Overall, Skoda appears well on its way to achieving its goal of producing 500,000 vehicles per year by 2000.
