Czech opposition blame party chairman for poor showing in Senate elections 

The opposition Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) is blaming its chairman Jan Hamacek for the party's poor performance in last weekend's Senate elections. The CSSD won only one of the 27 Senate seats up for election, continuing a string of recent losses and fueling concerns about the party's direction ahead of next year's parliamentary election.

Party members and political analysts pointed the finger squarely at Hamacek, saying he has failed to articulate a clear vision for the party or galvanize support around key policy issues. The CSSD has been in turmoil since finishing a distant sixth in May's European Parliament election, the party's worst result in over 30 years. Hamacek has lacked strong leadership, said CSSD Senator Martin Dite. "We had no message, no clear campaign strategy, and that is the responsibility of the party leadership."   

The lone bright spot was former Justice Minister Helena Valkova's victory in the party's traditional stronghold in northern Bohemia. But even there, she won by only a three-point margin. Incumbents from Hamacek's own faction lost seats in Prague and Brno. The defeats continue the CSSD's steady erosion since winning national elections in 2012 and suggest the party has lost touch with its base.

President Milos Zeman, the CSSD's former leader, called Sunday's results "a disaster" and demanded the party hold an extraordinary congress to resolve its leadership question. However, Hamacek ruled out stepping down. He said the losses were "not catastrophic" given low voter turnout and that the party is still well-positioned for next year's crucial polls. 

Political scientist Jiri Pehe disagreed. He said the CSSD appears exhausted, lacking purpose or motivation. "The party seems stuck in the past and unable to adapt to today's issues like migration or the digital economy," Pehe said. "Mr. Hamacek has been unable to turn things around and these election results show that a leadership change is needed to have any chance of success in 2020."

Hamacek's defenders argue the party's decline began years before he took over last year and that more time is needed to implement reforms and re-focus its message. But with its poll numbers continuing to sag, the CSSD's opponents see little hope of a renaissance under the current leadership. The election results suggest that without swift action, the party risks losing its place as the main center-left rival to Prime Minister Andrej Babis' ANO movement.
