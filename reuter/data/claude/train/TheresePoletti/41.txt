IBM Reorganizes Global Sales and Services Businesses Under Single Brand Name 'IBM Global Services'

Tech giant IBM announced today that it is reorganizing its global sales and services businesses under a single brand name called IBM Global Services. The move is designed to provide a simplified experience for clients engaging with IBM's services offerings. 

IBM Global Services will replace the existing IBM Global Business Services and IBM Global Technology Services businesses. The new organization will have a single leadership team and operate under a single brand to provide clients with a simplified experience. IBM hopes the rebranding will make it easier for clients to understand, access and benefit from IBM's services offerings in areas like cloud, data, AI, security, and quantum computing.

"Adopting IBM Global Services is the next step in the company's transition to a platform-centric approach to hybrid cloud and AI," IBM said in a statement. By providing an integrated experience under one brand, IBM Global Services is aimed at helping clients in all industries and geographies modernize infrastructures, innovate processes and customer experiences, and transform their businesses."

The reorganization will align IBM's services businesses around five pillars: Strategy & Transformation, Applications, Hybrid Cloud, Infrastructure, and Security & Resiliency. The new structure is designed to drive growth and deliver value to IBM clients by applying cross-disciplinary expertise across the pillars. 

IBM Global Services currently has expertise in more than 175 countries and a robust ecosystem of global partners. The business primarily delivers expertise in global high-value services areas like application and enterprise platform services in software engineering, cloud migration, systems integration, program management, security, and data services. IBM hopes that integrating these capabilities under one brand will make it simpler for clients to tap into the full scale of IBM's expertise and partnerships.

The rebranding of IBM Global Services is not accompanied by any workforce reduction, IBM said. All existing agreements with clients will remain in place and global delivery centers and research labs will continue normal operations. The transition to IBM Global Services will be completed by the end of 2020.
