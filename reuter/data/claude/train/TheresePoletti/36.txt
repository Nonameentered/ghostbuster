Home Internet Use More Than Doubles in Last Year: 
11 Million U.S. Households Now Online, Says Study by PC-Meter

A new study released today by PC-Meter, an Internet analytics firm, found that home Internet use in the United States has more than doubled over the past 12 months. According to the study, 11 million households in the U.S. now have Internet access at home, up from just 5 million households in 2020.  

"The growth in home Internet adoption has been simply staggering," said Jenny Chang, lead analyst at PC-Meter. "High-speed broadband networks have expanded to more areas, devices have become more affordable and capable, and people have discovered how useful the Internet is for communication, education, entertainment, and more."

The PC-Meter study found several other trends in home Internet usage. Households are going online more frequently, with the average household using the Internet 17 hours per week at home, up from 12 hours per week in 2020. Streaming media, social networking, and online shopping were the most popular activities.

Laptops and smartphones remain the most common devices for accessing the Internet at home. However, smart speakers, tablets, and connected TVs are also contributing to more time spent online. "The proliferation of Internet-enabled devices has made the web more accessible and immersed people in a digital lifestyle," Chang said.

While home Internet usage has spiked in all age groups, the largest increases were seen in older Americans. Internet use at home doubled among those over age 65, a sign that the technology is becoming more mainstream and accessible to people of all ages.  

Overall, Americans seem to increasingly view home Internet access as an essential utility, according to PC-Meter's survey data. When asked about the importance of Internet connectivity at home, 87% of respondents said it was "very" or "extremely" important for everyday life. 

"The home Internet boom shows no signs of slowing down," Chang concluded. "As more people get online, access faster broadband networks, and adopt the latest connected devices, we expect home Internet usage to continue its rapid ascent."
