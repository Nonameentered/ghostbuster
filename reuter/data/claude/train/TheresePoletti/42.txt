Electronic Commerce Grows, but Security Concerns Remain a Hurdle for 1997 

Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, has grown substantially over the past year as more businesses and consumers conduct transactions online. However, security concerns remain a significant barrier preventing even faster adoption according to a new survey.

The survey of 500 small and mid-sized businesses in the US found that over two-thirds now have a website, up from just over half two years ago. Of those with a website, 80% now enable customers to make purchases directly on their site, up from 60% last year. 

"It's clear that e-commerce has moved into the mainstream," said John Smith, President of the research firm that conducted the survey. "Most businesses recognize that an online presence and the ability to sell directly on their website is critical to remaining competitive."

However, security concerns still pose a challenge for many businesses. Over 40% of businesses surveyed said worries about security and fraud have made them hesitant to sell online. And over a quarter said that security issues have directly prevented potential customers from making a purchase on their website.

The most common security concerns cited include worries about customer payment information being compromised, fraudulent orders, and website hacking. To address these concerns, the majority of businesses conduct security audits of their website, use SSL encryption to protect payment information, and have a privacy policy posted on their site. However, smaller businesses often lack resources to fully address security risks.

"For e-commerce to reach its full potential, security needs to be a top priority," said Smith. "Businesses must invest in strong security measures and communicate their security standards clearly to customers."

Customer demand is also driving e-commerce growth, especially among younger generations. Over 80% of consumers under 35 years old have made an online purchase in the past year compared to just over 60% of those over 35. Mobile commerce is also expanding quickly, with nearly two-thirds of under-35 consumers using their smartphone to make a purchase in the past month compared to just a quarter of older consumers.  

While e-commerce and m-commerce are taking an increasing share of retail sales, they still make up a minority of total sales. E-commerce sales are projected to account for 10-15% of total US retail sales in 2017, up from 8% in 2016. However, growth is slowing as the market reaches maturity.
