Computer Makers Expected to Report Solid Fourth-Quarter Earnings Despite Stronger Dollar  

Major computer makers are expected to announce solid fourth-quarter earnings results over the next few weeks, even as a strengthening U.S. dollar threatens to dampen sales and profits. While a rising dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive for foreign buyers, technology companies have been able to partly offset currency headwinds through price increases and hedging strategies. 

PC giants HP Inc., Dell Technologies Inc., and Lenovo Group Ltd. are all forecast to post revenue and profit growth for the final three months of 2020, according to analysts. The PC market has experienced a revival during the coronavirus pandemic, with many people working and studying from home. Global PC shipments rose 3.6% year over year in the fourth quarter, research firm Gartner estimated.

However, Wall Street expects the pace of sales and earnings increases to slow from the third quarter. HP, which reports quarterly results on Feb. 25, is projected to post earnings per share of 50 cents, up 8% annually, with revenue increasing 4.4% to $15.4 billion. In the third quarter, HP's earnings jumped 29% and revenue 9%. 

Dell, reporting March 4, is forecast to record EPS of $1.63, up 22%, on revenue of $24.5 billion, a rise of 6.7%. In the third quarter, Dell's EPS surged 54% and revenue climbed 3.5%. Currency headwinds are estimated to reduce Dell's fourth-quarter revenue by over $300 million compared with a year earlier. To limit the impact, Dell has raised U.S. product prices and hedged currency positions.

Lenovo, the world's largest PC maker, is set to announce Feb. 3 results showing EPS up 15% at 82 cents and revenue 7% higher at $15.8 billion. Lenovo in the third quarter posted a 22% EPS gain and 15% revenue increase. While less exposed to currency fluctuations due to its heavy presence in China, Lenovo still faces cost pressures from a stronger dollar.

Overall, the major computer makers are dealing with a tight supply of components like microprocessors that could curb sales in coming quarters. But with PC demand still elevated, especially in the commercial segment, the companies remain on track to report a solid end to 2020 despite economic uncertainty and the drag from higher costs due to a rising U.S. currency.
