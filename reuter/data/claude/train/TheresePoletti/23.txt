Thomson Matches EchoStar Price Cut, Shaking Up the Satellite TV Industry  

The satellite TV industry was sent reeling today as Thomson, the second largest satellite TV provider, matched a recent price cut by its main competitor EchoStar. Effective immediately, Thomson is slashing the price of its popular satellite TV packages by up to 25% and reducing equipment fees for new customers. The move is a bold bid by Thomson to gain market share and put pressure on EchoStar, which announced a similar round of price cuts just two weeks ago.

The price cuts will have the biggest impact on Thomson’s mid-tier satellite TV plans, which now start at just $29.99 per month for over 200 channels. Thomson is also throwing in free premium channels like HBO and Cinemax for the first year and waiving fees for installation and satellite equipment for new customers. The promotions have the potential to save consumers hundreds of dollars per year on satellite TV services and equipment costs.  

“This is an unprecedented move in the satellite TV space and we’re redefining value for the American consumer,” said Mike Thompson, CEO of Thomson Satellite TV. “We are determined to grow our business through affordability and unmatched entertainment choice. Our new lower prices and extra features showcase why Thomson is the smart choice for satellite TV viewers.”   

Analysts say the dueling price cuts could significantly hurt revenues and profits for both EchoStar and Thomson, at least in the short term. However, by slashing prices the companies are betting they can attract enough new budget-conscious subscribers to offset the lower rates over the long run. The moves also reflect the broader competitive pressures facing cable and satellite TV companies from online streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, which continue to gain popularity.

“This is risky for both EchoStar and Thomson but they really have no choice if they want to remain competitive,” said Dan Rayburn, a media analyst with Frost & Sullivan. “Satellite TV companies have to do something bold to stand out as streaming services ramp up their content libraries and sign up more and more subscribers.”  

Satellite TV remains the most popular pay TV option in the U.S. with over 40 million total subscribers across EchoStar, Thomson and smaller providers. However, growth in the industry has slowed in recent years as more Americans cut the cord in favor of streaming services, which often offer similar content libraries at lower prices. EchoStar and Thomson are hoping their new discounted rates will convince some consumers to stick with satellite, or even switch from cable TV and streaming to satellite.

Both EchoStar and Thomson said the lower prices are permanent, so consumers looking for an inexpensive satellite TV option may want to act soon to lock in the promotional rates and extra features before they disappear. The dueling discounts serve up an early victory for satellite TV viewers in what could shape up to be a prolonged price war. Subscribers willing and able to switch between providers may find themselves eligible for new promotions and perks for the foreseeable future.
