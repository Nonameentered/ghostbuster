IBM to Acquire Children's Education Software Publisher Edmark for $80 Million in Cash  

Tech giant IBM announced today that it has agreed to acquire Edmark, a privately held developer of educational software for children, for $80 million in an all-cash deal. The acquisition will expand IBM's offerings for the K-12 education market and accelerate Edmark's global growth.

Edmark, founded in 1980 and based in Redmond, Washington, is best known for its interactive software tools to help children build skills in reading, math, science and problem solving. Its popular products include Edmark Learning Program, Millie's Math House and Bailey's Book House. Edmark software is used in more than half of all U.S. schools and has won numerous awards, including several Parents' Choice Awards. 

"Edmark has established itself as an innovator in developing fun, engaging and effective digital learning experiences for children," said Harriet Green, general manager of IBM Watson Education. "We are excited to welcome the talented Edmark team and integrate their award-winning software into the Watson Education portfolio. Together, we will apply innovative AI technologies to create personalized learning solutions that empower students and teachers worldwide."

IBM has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence for education. Last year, the company launched IBM Watson Education, which uses AI to help teachers personalize instruction and enable lifelong learning. The acquisition of Edmark will add supplementary education content, collaborative lesson-planning tools and a strong brand presence in K-12 schools to complement IBM's existing offerings.

"We have long admired IBM's efforts in education and AI, and we're thrilled to join forces to help reimagine learning for the digital age," said Tom Tabor, CEO of Edmark. "By combining Edmark's engaging and fun software with IBM's advanced AI and cloud technologies, we can develop next-generation learning solutions to improve student outcomes around the world."

The Edmark acquisition is the latest in IBM's recent string of purchases to expand its role in the education technology market, which has grown rapidly as schools adopt digital tools. Last year, IBM bought three other ed tech companies: Tyler Technologies' Campus Solutions Division, Communispace, and TruQua Enterprises.  

Analysts said the addition of Edmark provides an established brand and talented team that will help IBM compete against Google Classroom and other ed tech rivals. The deal is expected to close within 30 days, subject to regulatory approval. Financial terms were not disclosed.
