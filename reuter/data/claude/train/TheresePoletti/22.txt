IBM Set to Unveil New Partners and Strategies for Electronic Commerce

IBM is preparing to announce new partnerships  and business strategies focused on electronic commerce at their InterConnect conference this week. According to sources familiar with the company's plans, IBM will reveal deals with major retailers, social networks, and payment processing firms aimed at making e-commerce transactions more seamless, social, and secure.

IBM's core e-commerce offerings, including its WebSphere Commerce platform and Sterling Order Management system, have enabled over $16 trillion in e-commerce transactions for brands like Lenovo, Sam's Club, and Office Depot. However, the e-commerce landscape has evolved rapidly with the growth of social shopping and mobile commerce. IBM is launching new partnerships and products to help retailers adapt.

First, IBM will announce a new partnership with Visa to integrate Visa's real-time anti-fraud technologies into WebSphere Commerce. This will allow retailers to detect and prevent more sophisticated fraud attempts during the online checkout process without compromising the customer experience. Second, IBM is partnering with Facebook to enable "social storefronts" on Facebook's platform that allow customers to browse and purchase goods within the social network. IBM's WebSphere Commerce system will power the back-end transactions for these social storefronts.  

Finally, to improve mobile commerce and in-store shopping experiences, IBM is launching a new mobile scanner and payment system with hardware partners like Verifone and Ingenico. The system allows customers to scan products with their smartphones to view recommendations and pay for goods, skipping the checkout line. Retailers Macy's and Nordstrom will be among the first to pilot the mobile self-checkout technology.

"We're crafting new e-commerce solutions as shopping continues to get more personalized, social and digital," said Harriet Green, General Manager of IBM Watson Customer Engagement. The new partnerships and technologies announced this week are designed to "keep our clients ahead of these market trends and position them for future success." The announcements at InterConnect signal IBM's commitment to enabling modern e-commerce through strategic ecosystem partnerships and continued innovation in areas like AI, cybersecurity and cloud platforms.
