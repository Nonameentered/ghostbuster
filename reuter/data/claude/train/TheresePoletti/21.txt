Thomson Shakes Up Satellite TV Market by Matching EchoStar's Sharp Price Cut 

Thomson Consumer Electronics today matched a steep price cut announced last week by rival EchoStar Communications Corp., signaling an escalating price war in the satellite TV market.

Thomson said it is cutting the price of its top-of-the-line satellite TV system by $200, to $399. The cut matches the $200 price reduction EchoStar announced for its comparable DishPlayer system last Thursday.  

The dueling price cuts highlight the intensifying competition in the market for satellite TV service and equipment. Satellite broadcasters like EchoStar and Thomson have enjoyed rapid growth over the past few years as they won over millions of customers seeking an alternative to cable TV. However, the satellite TV market is maturing, and EchoStar and Thomson now appear to be using price cuts to grab market share from each other and to fend off competition from resurgent cable TV operators.

“The price cuts suggest the days of easy subscriber growth are over in the satellite TV industry,” said John Doe, a telecommunications analyst at Big Firm LLC. “Thomson and EchoStar now have to fight for every new customer, and price is one of their primary competitive weapons.”

EchoStar started the latest round of price chopping last week, when it cut the price of its DishPlayer system to $399 from $599. At the time, EchoStar said the price cut would boost sales and allow it to beat analysts’ forecasts for new subscriber additions in the October-December quarter.  

Hours after EchoStar announced its price reduction, Thomson said it would match the cut to avoid losing customers to EchoStar. “We have to respond to the competition to protect our market position,” a Thomson spokesman said. 

Thomson's price cut comes just six months after the company lowered the price of its satellite TV hardware by $50 as part of an earlier effort to boost demand. The accelerated price competition raises concerns among analysts that profits will come under pressure at Thomson, EchoStar and other players in the satellite TV market. However, some analysts say lower prices could allow satellite companies to significantly expand their customer bases over the next year.  

Satellite broadcasters still have some advantages over cable, including access to thousands of channels, digital picture quality, and availability in many areas beyond the reach of cable. But their historically higher upfront costs have deterred some customers. More aggressive pricing policies may help overcome that obstacle and open up the market to more consumers.

Some industry watchers, though, worry that a spiral of sharp price cuts could damage the satellite industry in the long run. "There's a risk of this turning into a death spiral where the price goes down, down and down," said John Doe, an analyst at Big Firm LLC.   "At some point, the price has to hit a floor, or the industry won't be viable anymore."
