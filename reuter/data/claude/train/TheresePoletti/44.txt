Push Technology Set to Revolutionize Internet Broadcasting

A new wave of technologies referred to as "push" is poised to upend the traditional model of Internet broadcasting and enable a whole new range of personalized media experiences. The current Internet broadcasting model is largely based around consumers having to actively seek out and choose from a sea of options on media websites, apps, and channels. With push technology, media companies can deliver customized content directly to consumers based on their preferences and interests without requiring them to search and sort through options themselves.  

Several tech companies and startups are working on push technology platforms and solutions for media companies. One leading option is Bettr Broadcasting's new BettrPush service. BettrPush allows media companies to create custom viewing channels tailored to individual users that "push" specific streaming shows, podcast episodes, news clips, and other content that aligns with their profiles. For example, a sports fan could receive a customized feed of highlights, commentary, and livestreams from their favorite sports leagues and teams without having to browse through lots of unrelated options.

Push represents a "more personalized on-demand experience that feels live and lean-back," according to Bettr Broadcasting CEO Jasmine Powers. She argues that push technology will "revolutionize the way we discover and engage with new media by making the content come to us rather than the other way around." Some analysts also believe push can help revive interest in bundled media subscriptions at a time when many consumers are cutting cords and opting for more niche services. 

However, some critics argue that push technology could limit choice and diversity of options for consumers. There is also a risk of filter bubbles developing if the algorithms and personalization behind push services end up limiting users to a narrow set of viewpoints. Privacy advocates also warn that push platforms will require access to significant amounts of user data and viewing history to function, raising concerns about how media companies handle and share that data. 

Despite these concerns, many of the major media brands are investing in push technology. Bettr Broadcasting recently signed partnerships with several major sports leagues, news channels, and entertainment companies to bring push-enabled streaming and on-demand options to market later this year. The age of customized media discovery and "broadcasting without borders" is dawning. Push technology looks poised to accelerate it.
