CompuServe Dissolves Consumer Online Service Wow! to Focus on Corporate Market  

CompuServe announced today that it is shutting down its Wow! consumer online service effective June 1 to refocus the company's efforts on the corporate market. The Wow! service was launched in 1996 as a lower-cost alternative to CompuServe's flagship online service, aiming to attract more casual and price-sensitive customers. 

However, the Wow! offering struggled to gain traction against competitors like AOL, which offered Internet access and a wider range of features. Wow! peaked at just over 2 million subscribers in 1999 but has declined steadily since then. CompuServe's corporate offerings, on the other hand, have seen steady growth over the past decade.

"We appreciate the loyal Wow! customers we've served over the years, but the market for premium consumer online services has eroded as Internet access has become faster, cheaper and more ubiquitous," said CompuServe CEO Elizabeth Warren. "To position CompuServe for future success, we need to focus on the products and services that are most in demand from today's customers, and that means our suite of hosted business solutions."

The shutdown of Wow! is the latest in a series of moves CompuServe has made to redefine itself. Once known primarily as an online portal and email provider for consumers, the company shifted focus to business services starting in the mid-1990s. It launched popular offerings like hosted Microsoft Exchange email, enterprise resource planning software, customer relationship management tools and more.

CompuServe will stop accepting new Wow! subscribers immediately and will deactivate all Wow! accounts on June 1. The company has set up a website where Wow! customers can download any personal data, messages or files they wish to retain before the service shuts down. CompuServe will not automatically refund any unused subscription fees but will consider requests for refunds and credits on a case-by-case basis.

The end of Wow! marks the conclusion of an era for CompuServe, which got its start in the late 1970s as one of the first major online services for home computer users. At the time, CompuServe primarily offered access to bulletin board systems, weather and stock reports, newspapers and a handful of games. The company grew into a major force in the 1980s and 1990s but failed to keep up with the rapid changes of the Internet age. With its renewed focus on enterprise services, CompuServe hopes to emerge once again as an influential player â€“ this time targeting businesses rather than casual consumers. For Wow! customers, though, its remaining legacy will be as a relic of the early days of home computing and a simpler time online.
