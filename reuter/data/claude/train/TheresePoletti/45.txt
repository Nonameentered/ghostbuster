Personal Computer Makers Launch Flashy Multimedia PCs with New Intel Chip to Boost Consumer Sector 

The world's largest personal computer manufacturers unveiled new multimedia PCs powered by Intel's latest Core i5 processor aimed at boosting sales in the consumer market. The new PCs from Dell, HP, and Lenovo feature enhanced audio and visual capabilities, touchscreen displays, and voice recognition, banking on new technologies to spur replacement of aging home computers.

The PC industry has struggled as more consumers opt for smartphones and tablets over traditional desktop and laptop computers. According to research firm Gartner, worldwide PC shipments declined 0.9% in 2019, marking the seventh consecutive year of slowing sales. However, PC makers hope that new eye-catching and entertainment-focused PCs equipped with Intel's new Core i5 chip can revive interest, especially with students and families stuck at home during the pandemic.  

Dell's new XPS 15 comes with a 4K touchscreen, Dolby Atmos speakers, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti graphics card for gaming, starting at $1,500. HP's Pavilion 16 offers a 16-inch anti-glare screen, Bang & Olufsen speakers, and an optional touchscreen for $600 and up. The Lenovo Yoga 9i includes a rotating 4K touchscreen, pen support for drawing, and Dolby Vision for enhanced video, with models ranging from $1,300 to $2,500.

"Our new PCs are designed to captivate users with premium features for productivity, creativity, entertainment and gaming," said HP's chief commercial product officer. "We believe exceptional audio and visuals combined with the latest Intel processor will motivate more people to upgrade their outdated technology."

While the new multimedia PCs may attract some buyers, many analysts are skeptical they will significantly revitalize the market. "Flashy new PCs will not make up for weaknesses in the broader economy and changes in consumer habits," said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC. With more people remaining budget-conscious in the recession, smartphones and tablets are likely to remain the primary computing devices for most casual users. The launch of new Intel-powered PCs may provide a temporary boost, Ubrani noted, but a longer-term turnaround depends on the magnitude of economic recovery as well as the pace of technological change.
