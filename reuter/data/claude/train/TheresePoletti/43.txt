Digital Equipment Corp. Hosts Industry Analysts in Hopes of Sparking Interest in Downtrodden Stock 

Digital Equipment Corp. flew in technology industry analysts from around the country this week for a two-day event aimed at reigniting interest in the company's sagging stock price. Digital Equipment, once a towering force in the technology sector, has seen its share price decline steadily over the past decade amid competition from lower-cost rivals and a rocky transition to new product lines.

The analysts’ meeting, held at Digital Equipment’s headquarters in Maynard, Mass., featured presentations from Chief Executive Ken Olsen and his top lieutenants on the company’s product roadmap, cost-cutting efforts, and new strategic vision. Olsen acknowledged the company’s troubled recent history but said it has now turned a corner.

“Digital Equipment enters the 1990s a leaner, more focused company,” Olsen said. “We have faced many challenges, but we have overcome them through hard work and perseverance. The future is bright.”

The company hopes events like this week’s meeting can help sway analysts and investors who have grown disillusioned and doubtful over the years. Digital Equipment's share price has fallen from a high of over $190 per share in 1987 to under $50 today. The company has been losing market share in its core midrange computer market to rivals like Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell Computer.

However, Digital Equipment executives pointed to several promising new technologies and market opportunities, like Windows NT, that they hope will spur a rebound. The company recently began shipping its first Windows NT-based personal computers and will roll out enterprise servers and workstations later this year.

“Digital Equipment is no longer just about VMS and PDP-11s,” said John Smith, vice president of product marketing. “We have a robust new product roadmap and our Windows NT lineup will open up major new markets where we can compete and win.”

The company also highlighted significant cost-cutting efforts, including headcount reductions, facilities consolidation, and non-essential business unit divestitures. The restructuring has trimmed more than $1 billion in annual operating costs, executives said.

Digital Equipment clearly has more work left to regain its former perch atop the technology industry. But this week’s meeting was a first step toward re-engaging with analysts and investors, and convincing them that the Digital Equipment of old is coming back with newfound vigor. The question now is whether Wall Street and customers will give the company another look and like what they see.
