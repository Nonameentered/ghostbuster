IBM Plans to Focus on Education With $80 Million Acquisition of Edmark Corp. 

Tech giant IBM announced today that it has acquired educational software maker Edmark Corp. for $80 million in an all-cash deal. The acquisition is part of IBM's strategy to expand its presence in the education technology market and provide new tools to schools and students around the world.

Edmark Corp., based in Redmond, Wash., is best known for its award-winning interactive educational software for children. Its products cover areas such as reading, math, science and critical thinking for students from pre-K through 6th grade. Edmark's products are used by more than 30 million students and 400,000 teachers in over 150 countries. 

"Edmark has pioneered innovative education software for decades and built a trusted brand that is synonymous with quality and impact," said IBM CEO Ginni Rometty in a statement. "We are thrilled to welcome Edmark to the IBM family and combine our expertise to help teachers teach, students learn and schools improve."

By acquiring Edmark, IBM says it will be able to leverage its artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud technologies to enhance Edmark's educational software and deliver more personalized learning experiences. IBM also plans to make Edmark's products available to schools through its K-12 cloud-based education platform. 

"We are very excited to become part of IBM and tap into resources that will help us accelerate innovation in education," said Edmark CEO Greg Sherman. "Together we have an opportunity to shape the future of personalized learning and make a difference in the lives of millions of students."

The Edmark acquisition is the latest by IBM as it continues its push into industry areas outside of information technology like education, banking, and healthcare. Last year IBM spent more than $15 billion to acquire open-source software company Red Hat, marking its largest acquisition in its history. The deal highlights IBM's efforts to revive declining revenue by shifting into higher-growth sectors.

The deal between IBM and Edmark is expected to close within the next 60 days pending regulatory approval. Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
