New Multimedia PCs with Intel Chipset Expected to Boost Consumer Sector of PC Industry 

Intel Corporation today announced a new multimedia PC platform based around their latest chipset technology. The new platform is optimized for enhanced multimedia capabilities, including high-definition video playback, surround sound audio, and lightning-fast graphics. PC makers like Dell, HP, and Acer are expected to release new consumer desktop and laptop models over the next few months based on the Intel platform.

"Our new chipset architecture provides significant improvements in graphics, audio, video, and I/O performance that will enable a whole new level of multimedia experiences on the PC," said Intel's VP of the PC Client Group. "We think this will make multimedia PCs much more compelling for both consumer and business customers."

The chipset features a new high-speed interconnect called Ultrafast Interconnect with up to 6.4 gigabytes per second of bandwidth. This enables faster data transfer between components like the CPU, graphics processor, and main memory. The chipset also supports new HD audio standards for 7.1 surround sound and high-definition, multi-channel audio.  

On the graphics front, the chipset can use up to 1 gigabyte of main memory as video memory for ultra-high resolution graphics and fast frame rates. It supports playback of Blu-ray movies, real-time 3D graphics, and high-definition video streaming. These types of graphically intense applications were previously limited to high-end gaming PCs.

With the new generation of multimedia desktops and laptops based on this platform, Intel is hoping to boost growth in the consumer PC sector, which has been slowing in recent years due to the economic downturn and competition from smartphones and tablets. New multimedia capabilities and more affordably priced systems could help rekindle interest in PCs among home users.

Analysts forecast the new systems may increase consumer PC shipments by 10 to 15 percent over the next year. While multimedia features have been available on PCs before, Intel's tight integration of graphics, audio, video, and I/O in a single chipset promises a big leap in capabilities and performance. If PC makers price the systems competitively, Intel's new platform may just give the consumer PC sector the boost itâ€™s looking for.
