Computer Retailers Report Sluggish Start to Holiday Season with Weak Sales and Heavy Promotions

Some of the nation’s largest computer retailers are reporting a slower than expected start to the holiday shopping season with weak sales and heavy discounting in the early weeks of November.

Best Buy, the biggest consumer electronics chain, said U.S. same-store sales for the first two weeks of November were down compared to last year’s strong holiday period. The company did not disclose specific numbers but said sales were “below our expectations.” Best Buy pointed to a lack of “must-have” tech products this year to drive demand. 

Meanwhile, sales of personal computers, tablets, and smartphones were flat in October, while average selling prices dropped, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. The sluggish economy and consumer uncertainty have combined to weaken enthusiasm for expensive tech gadgets this season, analysts said.

In response, retailers ramped up promotions like price matching guarantees and blanket discounts of 15 to 30% off many products to lure tentative shoppers. Walmart and Target both rolled out free shipping with no minimum purchase amount, while Best Buy offered larger than usual price cuts on 4K TVs, laptops, and gaming consoles.

The heavy promotions, while appealing for bargain hunters, threaten to significantly reduce profit margins for computer retailers that were already facing cost pressures. Best Buy’s gross profit margin declined in the most recent quarter due to similar price cuts. Some analysts worry that the increased discounting will simply lead customers to hold out for even bigger price cuts as the holidays approach.

However, shoppers have been attracted to sales on certain popular tech items like smart speakers, streaming sticks, and wireless headphones. Best Buy said sales were solid for wearable fitness trackers, smart watches, and other wellness devices. And Target said its print catalog featuring deals on Apple iPads, Google Chromecasts, and Fitbit fitness trackers helped drive more people to stores.  

Some analysts remain optimistic for retailers ahead of Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the week before Christmas, which are historically among the year's biggest shopping days. Recent job growth and wage gains could also boost consumer sentiment and spending during the holidays. But others warn that heavy tech device discounting may be needed to salvage what was expected to be a modest sales increase this year at best. Overall, the early holiday results show an uneven start for the sector with no easy answers on the horizon.
