National Grid Considers Selling Majority Stake in Energis to Strategic Investors 

National Grid, the UK's largest electricity and gas utility company, is exploring options to sell a majority stake in its telecommunications subsidiary Energis, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has hired banking advisers to help find potential strategic investors interested in acquiring control of Energis, which provides internet and data center services to corporate clients.

National Grid, which is worth over £30 billion, took full ownership of Energis in 2006 as part of its acquisition of Lattice Group. However, Energis is considered non-core to National Grid's regulated gas and electricity transmission and distribution businesses. By selling a majority stake, National Grid could raise funds to reinvest in its core utility operations and infrastructure. Any deal is expected to value Energis at over £1 billion.

"We are constantly evaluating options to optimize our business portfolio and maximize value for shareholders," a National Grid spokesperson said. "At this time, we have made no decisions on any potential transactions regarding Energis."

Energis operates telecommunications networks and 10 data centers across the UK, serving clients such as Boeing, BMW, and the National Health Service. Demand for secure data storage and cloud computing services has surged in recent years with more companies shifting technology infrastructure off-premise. This could attract interest from infrastructure funds, private equity firms, and strategic technology investors in acquiring Energis.

However, some analysts argue National Grid should retain full ownership of Energis as technology and data become increasingly crucial components of energy systems and utility operations. By leveraging Energis's telecommunications expertise and data center assets, National Grid could accelerate its own digital transformation and transition to more distributed and smart power networks. Selling control of Energis could diminish opportunities to create synergies with National Grid's core business over the long run.

No final decisions have been made and National Grid may ultimately choose not to sell a majority stake in Energis following its strategic review. Any deal would be subject to regulatory approvals and not expected until later this year at the earliest. With the UK government focused on sustainability and clean energy goals, National Grid is under pressure to invest more in infrastructure supporting renewable power and electrification of transportation. The sale of Energis could generate proceeds to help fund these types of long-term investments.
