BT May Make Concessions to AT&T in $20 Billion Merger Bid

British Telecom (BT) is preparing to make substantial concessions to win approval for its $20 billion bid to acquire mobile giant AT&T, according to sources familiar with the matter. The concessions are aimed at easing concerns from regulators in the UK and United States about reduced competition if the deal were to go through. 

BT initially offered $140 per share for AT&T, valuing the company at $20 billion. However, regulators flagged concerns that the merger could negatively impact choice and pricing for consumers if it leads to a substantial reduction in competition. BT now plans to offer remedies such as divesting some assets and agreeing to wholesaling wireless capacity to rivals to satisfy the regulators.

A divestiture of assets may include selling parts of AT&T’s mobile network and spectrum to competitors. BT may also agree to provide network access to mobile virtual network operators at regulated rates. Such moves are designed to ensure competitors still have the ability to provide competing mobile and wireless services, even after a merger.

BT has been looking to expand into the US market to counter slowing growth at home. The acquisition of AT&T would give BT a substantial presence in the US for the first time and create a global telecom powerhouse with operations in Europe, the Americas, and Africa. However, the regulatory hurdles have proven higher than initially expected.

In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has raised concerns the merger could reduce competition in the mobile and broadband markets. In the US, the Department of Justice (DoJ) is worried the deal may slow the rollout of 5G networks if BT favors its own business at the expense of rivals. 

BT’s chairman Jan du Plessis said the company remained confident the deal was “pro-competitive” but is willing to work with regulators constructively. BT hopes the concessions will alleviate regulatory concerns and allow the merger to proceed, though the process may take several more months. If approved, the acquisition of AT&T would be the largest in BT’s history and reshape the global telecom landscape.
