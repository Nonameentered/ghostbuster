Misys Looking to Acquire International Firms worth up to $30 Million Each 

Misys, the UK-based banking software firm, is looking to acquire financial technology companies outside of the UK worth between $10 million to $30 million each, according to sources familiar with the company’s plans. The firm is planning an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand its global footprint and technology capabilities.

Misys was recently acquired by Vista Equity Partners, a US private equity firm, in a deal worth $2.1 billion. Vista is looking to build on Misys’ success as a provider of software to tier-two and tier-three banks and grow into new regions and market segments. “Vista did not acquire Misys to keep it as it is,” said an industry consultant familiar with Misys’ plans. “They will be looking to scale the business through both organic growth and acquisitions, particularly in high-growth markets.”

According to sources, Misys has earmarked up to $200 million for potential acquisitions to be made over the next 18 to 24 months. The firm is exploring targets in markets where it currently has a limited presence, including parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. The firm is also interested in acquiring additional capabilities in digital banking, payments processing and open banking platforms.

The acquisition strategy represents a pivot for Misys, which has grown largely through organic means over the past decade. However, the fintech sector has seen rapid gains in recent years from new startups and Misys is looking to catch up, according to analysts. “Misys has solid products and a loyal customer base, but needs to expand into new markets that are driving innovation,” said Martin Whybrow, an analyst at Celent. “Acquisitions are the fastest way to gain new capabilities and enter high-growth markets.”

Vista and Misys declined to comment on their acquisition plans. However, in a statement Misys CEO Nadeem Syed said, “We are focused on expanding our products and services into new segments and regions to best serve our clients’ needs. We will evaluate all opportunities, including potential acquisitions, that will help us advance our growth strategy.”
