Odyssey Telecommunications Nears $800m Funding Target for Satellite Launch

Odyssey Telecommunications, a Los Angeles-based startup focused on providing high-speed satellite internet, announced today that it has raised nearly $800 million to build and launch its first satellite constellation. The company has been raising funds from venture capital firms and strategic investors for the past year to finance the project, which aims to offer fast, low-latency broadband internet to consumers and businesses around the globe.

CEO Brian Chen said the company raised $450 million in a recent funding round from investors including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund and Telesat. That brings Odyssey's total funding to $790 million, just short of its target of $800 million to design, build and launch its first constellation of 50 satellites. 

"We're thrilled to have the backing of such renowned investors who share our vision of connecting the entire world with fast, ubiquitous satellite broadband," Chen said. "With this latest round of funding, we now have nearly all the capital we need to make our mission of delivering gigabit satellite internet anywhere on the planet a reality."

Odyssey plans to launch two test satellites later this year on a Falcon 9 rocket from SpaceX, Odyssey's launch partner. If successful, Odyssey will begin launching batches of 10 to 12 satellites at a time over the next 3 years until the full constellation of 50 satellites is in low Earth orbit. Each satellite will provide broadband speeds of up to 1 Gbps with latency under 100 milliseconds. 

"Satellite constellations are poised to revolutionize how the world accesses the internet," said Kathy Xue, a partner at Kleiner Perkins leading the investment in Odyssey. "Odyssey has the team, technology, and now funding to make gigabit satellite broadband a reality anywhere in the world. We're excited to partner with them to make universal access to fast internet a possibility."

The latest fundraising round provides further validation for broadband megaconstellations in low Earth orbit. OneWeb and SpaceX's Starlink have also raised billions of dollars to build massive satellite fleets and provide global high-speed internet connectivity from space. Odyssey is hoping to differentiate itself with faster speeds, lower latency and competitive pricing to reach more customers around the globe.
