Institutional Investors Threaten to Sell Up Despite Price Objections in Northern Electric Takeover Bid 

A group of major institutional investors in Northern Electric have warned the company's board of directors that they will sell their shares if the proposed takeover bid by Southern Power is rejected. The threat comes despite objections from some shareholders that the $38 per share offer undervalues Northern Electric.

Northern Electric, one of the largest power utility companies in the Midwest, received an unsolicited takeover offer in January from Southern Power, the second biggest power company in the U.S. with a market capitalization of $72 billion. Under the terms of the proposed deal, Southern Power would acquire Northern Electric for $38 per share, valuing the company at $12.8 billion.

While the Northern Electric board has yet to make a recommendation, some analysts and shareholders argue the offer is too low given Northern Electric's growth prospects and its valuable portfolio of renewable energy assets.  However, The Institutional Investor group, which holds a combined 12% stake in Northern Electric, sent a letter this week to the board urging it to accept the deal. The group did not disclose its members but is rumored to include several of the largest pension funds and asset managers.

In the letter, the group said that while the offer price could be higher, the significant premium it represents, the risks of not accepting, and the benefits of scale in the utility sector mean the takeover is in the best interests of shareholders. "Rejecting this offer could do more damage than good," they wrote. The group warned that if the deal was voted down, they would look to sell their shares to avoid the fall in price that would inevitably follow such a decision.
