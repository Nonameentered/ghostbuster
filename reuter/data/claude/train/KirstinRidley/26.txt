UK Opens Doors to 44 New Telephone Operators Ahead of Europe's Schedule 

The UK telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, announced today that it has granted licenses to 44 new telephone operators to provide services in the UK, ahead of the opening of the European Union's telecom markets next year. The new operators will begin offering landline, mobile, and broadband phone services to consumers and businesses across the UK starting next month.

The early opening of Britain's phone market is a coup for pro-competition advocates who have long argued that more choice will benefit consumers through lower prices and greater innovation.  The move stands in contrast with the slower pace of deregulation in other EU nations which plan to open markets on January 1st next year under the European Commission's telecom reforms.

Among the new entrants are a dozen virtual mobile operators, who will lease network capacity from established carriers like Vodafone, O2, and EE to provide cell phone services under their own brands. The remainder are landline and broadband operators using Openreach's network to provide home phone and internet services. Several US-based companies are launching their first European operations in Britain, including Google which received a license to operate as an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator).  

“This is an exciting day for telecoms in the UK,” said Ofcom CEO Sharon White. “Widespread competition spurs investment, drives down prices and accelerates new service offerings for consumers and businesses alike.” Ofcom received over 60 license applications and granted more new licenses today than in the previous 10 years combined in its effort to spur greater competition.

Not all are celebrating, however. The major mobile carriers who face new competition raised concerns about industry overcrowding and the potential for confusion among customers with too many choices. Analysts also worry profit margins could suffer across the board if the new operators pursue aggressive price cuts to build market share.   

The government remains confident increased competition will achieve its policy goals of enhanced innovation and affordability in telecommunications—and today's announcement is a victory for post-Brexit Britain's free market ambitions. For now, consumers will soon enjoy more options when signing up for or switching their landline, broadband or mobile service. The power is shifting to the customer as a new era of choice in UK telecoms begins.
