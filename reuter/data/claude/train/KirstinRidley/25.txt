Telefonica de Espana Dismisses Concerns of New Rivals, Expects Robust Growth

Madrid, Spain - Telefonica de Espana, Spain's largest telecommunications company, reported strong second quarter results today and expressed confidence in its growth prospects, dismissing concerns about new competitors entering the market. 

Revenue for the quarter rose 4.2% to 4.9 billion euros from the same period last year. Net income climbed 7.8% to 1.2 billion euros. The company added 344,000 new mobile subscribers and 103,000 broadband internet customers, driving gains in its core connectivity business.

"Our results this quarter demonstrate the strength of our integrated business model," said Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete, CEO of Telefonica. "While new entrants may capture some market share, we have a proven ability to gain high-value customers, upsell additional services, and generate strong cash flow and profits. We expect to continue delivering robust growth and shareholder returns for years to come."

Analysts had raised concerns that Telefonica would face intensifying competition following the entry of MasMovil and Euskaltel into the Spanish telecom market. The new rivals have targeted value-conscious consumers with low-priced service plans. Some investors feared Telefonica could experience subscriber losses and margin pressure as a result.

However, Telefonica's results suggest those concerns may have been overblown. The company added customers at a healthy clip and raised average revenue per user for both mobile and broadband services. Its low churn rates indicate most subscribers remain loyal to Telefonica despite competitive offers from new entrants.  

Telefonica also reaffirmed its full-year guidance, expecting revenue and profit growth in line with recent trends. The company plans to pay a dividend of 0.60 euros per share for the year. Telefonica's stock price rose 2.3% on the results and outlook, suggesting investor confidence in the firm's trajectory.

Continued customer additions, price increases, and stable profit margins give Telefonica visible avenues for growth even as competition emerges. With a strong balance sheet and cash flows, the company also has flexibility to make strategic investments and acquisitions to bolster its competitive position. Barring an unforeseen economic downturn, Telefonica appears poised to thrive as the Spanish economy continues its recovery from financial crisis. Overall, the latest report card validates management's view that new rivals are unlikely to materially disrupt Telefonica's winning formula.
