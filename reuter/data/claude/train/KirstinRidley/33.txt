Energis' Parent Company, National Grid, May Sell Majority Stake to Strategic Investors, Reveals Continent-Wide Deal to Slash Cost of European Telephone Calls

National Grid, the utility company that owns Energis, Britain's fourth largest telecoms operator, is in advanced talks to sell a majority stake in Energis to a group of strategic investors, according to sources close to the negotiations. The sale could value Energis at up to $15 billion and would be one of the largest European telecom deals this year.

National Grid acquired Energis two years ago but is now looking to sell in order to focus on its core regulated utility businesses. Potential buyers include Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia, and Spain's Telefonica, sources said. The buyer would gain control of Energis' high-speed fiber network that provides telephone and internet services to businesses across Britain.

In a separate announcement today, Energis revealed details of a new partnership with other European telecom companies to significantly reduce the cost of international calls across the continent. The deal, brokered by Energis, will allow residential and business customers to pay a maximum of 10 pence per minute for calls to 27 countries, less than half the current average rate. 

The chief executive of Energis, John Stanton, said: "This is a landmark agreement for Energis and for telecoms users in Britain and Europe. Eliminating the unfair margins on international calls will put money back in customers' pockets and help British businesses expand into new European markets."

The cross-Europe deal is a coup for Energis as telecom regulators have been trying for years to reduce the high costs of international calls. The agreement will likely put pressure on other operators to match the new 10 pence rate and could reshape the dynamics of Europe's $200 billion telecom market.

Shares in National Grid rose 3% on the news of the potential sale of Energis and its European calling deal. The company has been under pressure from investors in recent years to streamline its portfolio of businesses. While utility assets have stable regulated returns, telecoms is seen as volatile and capital intensive. The sale of Energis would generate cash for National Grid to invest in its core gas and electricity transmission networks in Britain and the United States.

National Grid and potential buyers declined to comment on the sale talks. But two sources close to the process said Energis could change hands within the next 4 to 6 weeks, barring any last-minute hiccups. The deal would bring an end to National Grid's short-lived foray into telecoms and tighten its focus on its traditional utility customer base.
