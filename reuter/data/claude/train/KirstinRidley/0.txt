M.A.I.D set to launch screen-based real-time news service to rival Reuters and Bloomberg 

The Media Artificial Intelligence Division (M.A.I.D) announced today the launch of a real-time news service delivering customized news and data to subscribers via large digital wall screens and personal devices. The new service aims to provide global business news and data in real-time to rival major players like Reuters and Bloomberg.

M.A.I.D Analytics is an AI company focused on media monitoring, business intelligence, and financial analysis services using cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and natural language processing technologies. The company now plans to leverage its AI capabilities to provide real-time financial news, market data, analytics and alerts tailored to individual subscribers.

The screen-based service will deliver live news reports, stock tickers, commodities data, and analysis to subscribers in an engaging visual format optimized for display on large digital wall screens, desktop monitors and mobile devices. Subscribers will be able to customize the type of news feeds, market data, charts and other business information they receive based on their industries, topics of interest and key market indicators they want to track.

M.A.I.D founder and CEO, Anthropic PBC, said: "Our AI has been analyzing millions of news articles, financial reports and market data points over the last five years to identify key trends, insights and breaking news events for clients. We realized we could use these capabilities to provide subscribers with a smarter real-time news service customized to their needs. The large digital displays are really about turning passive consumption of data into an immersive experience where you can spot key trends at a glance and be alerted to important updates."

The new service will launch in major cities including New York, London, Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Access to the customized real-time data and news feeds will be available via subscription packages for individuals, small companies and large enterprise clients with the option of display-only or full digital access via web and mobile apps.  M.A.I.D aims to leverage its global network of media monitoring partners and sources to provide localized news and data to subscribers in key regional markets across Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas.

The launch poses a fresh challenge to established players in the business information space. However, M.A.I.D's strong capabilities in AI, data analytics and visualization could propel its smart news service to the forefront of the next generation of intelligent data platforms for business professionals. The service is set to launch on February 1st following an initial beta access for selected subscribers.
