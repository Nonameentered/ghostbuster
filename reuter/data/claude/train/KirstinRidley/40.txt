Software firm Misys eyes international acquisitions worth $30 million each 

Misys, a UK-based software company, is looking to boost its growth through international acquisitions valued at around $30 million each, according to the company's CEO Nadeem Syed. In an interview, Syed said Misys aims to acquire fintech and software companies in high-growth markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America to tap into new customers and geographies.

"We are looking at opportunities that will open up new markets for us and bring in innovative solutions and talent that we can leverage across the group," Syed said. Misys was recently acquired by Vista Equity Partners, a US private equity firm, in a deal worth $2.2 billion. Syed said Misys will use the acquisition to gear up its M&A strategy and invest further in its product portfolio and technology platforms.

Over the past two years, Misys has acquired a number of companies including Turkey's Optimum, Brazil's Olmec and Cape Town-based DPL. These acquisitions have strengthened Misys' core banking, treasury and risk products and added over 500 new customers. Misys now has over 130,000 customers across 130 countries.

"Our acquisitions have been very targeted, adding new solutions and opening up high-potential markets," Syed noted. "We will continue on that path as there are some exciting fintech startups and companies in developing economies that would thrive as part of Misys."

With $30 million as an average deal size, Misys is likely to do at least 10 acquisitions to deploy $300 million earmarked for its M&A strategy, according to analysts. Fintech companies in Asia, Africa and Latin America are likely to be attractive targets given the accelerating pace of digitization in the financial services industry. Potential targets include core banking and payment companies in these regions that can benefit from Misys' scale and expertise, analysts noted.

For Misys, increasing revenues from high-growth markets is important to continue its strong growth momentum. In the financial year 2020, Misys revenue grew over 15% and over 60% of its revenues came from emerging markets. With the additional firepower from the PE acquisition, Misys aims to generate at least half its revenues from high-growth markets in the coming years.
