Hanson Plc's Shareholders Approve Final Part of Four-Way Split-Up

Shareholders of Hanson Plc, the British building materials and aggregates company, today approved the final phase of a complex four-way split of the company. The demerger, as it is known, will see Hanson broken up into four separate public companies focused on cement, building products, bricks, and aggregates.

Hanson announced plans for the bold breakup last year, saying the move would allow each new company to focus on its specific market and unlock greater value for shareholders. The company has been under pressure from activist investors to boost its lackluster share price and shake up its conglomerate structure.

Today's vote saw shareholders back the demerger of Hanson's aggregates business into a new company called Hanson Aggregates. It will be spun out with Â£2.5 billion in annual revenue, 25 quarries and 1,200 employees. The remaining Hanson Plc, to be renamed as Hanson Building Products, will retain its clay brick and roof tile operations.  

The two other pieces of the breakup, the cement company and Hanson Bricks, were approved in separate votes earlier this year and have already listed as independent companies. The cement business is now trading as Neobrick Plc, while the brick unit operates under the name Hanson Bricks.

"We are very pleased shareholders supported the final stage of Hanson's breakup. Each new company now has a clear focus and control of its own destiny," said Chris Hearne, who will remain CEO of Hanson Building Products. The other units will each have their own management teams.

Some analysts have praised the boldness of Hanson's breakup plan but others worry the separate companies may struggle on their own and lack scale. There is also concern about the complexity of disentangling links between the companies and allocating debts. 

However, Hanson believes the split will ultimately provide the incentives and focus for each unit to thrive. The company expects a 15-20% boost to shareholder value as a result of the breakup, as investors look for "pure play" ways to tap into the recovering UK building and construction markets.

The Hanson restructuring comes amid a flurry of breakups and spin-offs by UK conglomerates looking to boost shareholder returns. The company expects shares in the newly independent Hanson Aggregates to begin trading next week.
