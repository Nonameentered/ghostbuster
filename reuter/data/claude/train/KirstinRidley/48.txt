Hanson’s Energy Group to be Spun Off as Shareholders Approve Final Demerger Plank 

Shareholders of Hanson PLC, a British conglomerate, approved the company’s plan to spin off its energy division into a standalone company, Hanson Energy PLC. The demerger plan was announced last year as part of Hanson’s strategy to streamline its portfolio and focus on its core building materials and packaging businesses.

The approval from shareholders at Hanson’s annual meeting was the final step required to proceed with the demerger. Hanson Energy is now set to list on the London Stock Exchange next month as an independent energy company with a market capitalization of £8.2 billion. Hanson PLC will retain a minority stake of around 20% in the new company after the listing.

“We are pleased our shareholders support the board’s decision to demerge Hanson Energy,” said Hanson PLC Chief Executive Amanda Jordan. “This will allow both companies to focus on their strategic priorities and growth opportunities, and to allocate capital and resources accordingly.” 

Hanson Energy produces oil, natural gas and renewable energy from assets in the North Sea and around the world. It has been a strong performer in recent years, helping to offset weaknesses in Hanson PLC’s other divisions. However, Hanson’s management concluded the energy business no longer fit well with the company’s core building materials focus.

The demerger will provide Hanson Energy more flexibility and autonomy over its operations and the opportunity to use its own shares as currency for acquisitions and growth. Hanson PLC, meanwhile, will become a more specialized building materials company with forecast revenue of £18.7 billion following the demerger. Its well-known brands include Hanson Bricks, Marley Roof Tiles and Sentinel Concrete.

Investors have reacted positively to the demerger news, with shares in Hanson PLC up 3.2% in morning trading following the shareholder vote. Analysts said the demerger should help unlock shareholder value in both companies and make the businesses more attractive to investors focused on specific sectors.

“The demerger is a logical step and we see benefits for both Hanson and Hanson Energy as separately listed entities,” said James Miller, an analyst at Bank of London Securities. “The pure-play building materials and energy companies can command premium valuations as dedicated sector plays.”

The approvals at the shareholder meeting bring an end to a review and planning process that lasted more than a year. The demerger is expected to be completed within the next few weeks, turning a major chapter for Hanson PLC as it streamlines to focus on its founding building materials business. Hanson Energy embarks on its new future as an independent energy leader well positioned to capitalize on opportunities across oil, gas and renewable power markets.
