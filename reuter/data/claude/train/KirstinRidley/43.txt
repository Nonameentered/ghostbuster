British Telecom's Merger with MCI Communications Puts Culture Clash in the Spotlight 

British Telecom's $21 billion acquisition of MCI Communications has created a trans-Atlantic telecom powerhouse but also highlighted the challenges of merging two very different corporate cultures. The deal, announced last month, combines Britain's dominant fixed-line phone company with one of the largest telecom firms in the U.S. The new company, called BT Group, will have operations in 170 countries and aims to be a major player in both local and long-distance phone service and in providing data and Internet services to businesses.

However, managers say the cultural differences between the two companies may prove difficult to overcome. BT has been mostly government-owned, with a hierarchical management style and heavily unionized workforce. MCI, formerly called WorldCom, has been an aggressive upstart in the U.S. telecom market, with an entrepreneurial spirit and history of acquisitions. "Blending the cultures and values of the two organizations is going to be one of the biggest challenges in making this deal work," said Joe Damiano, a BT executive director. 

Some analysts argue the merger could slow down MCI's typically fast decision-making and blunt its competitive instincts. "BT risks smothering MCI's entrepreneurial flame," said Tom Johnson, a London-based telecom analyst. BT and MCI managers counter that the merger will create a productive hybrid, combining the stability and engineering expertise of BT with MCI's marketing savvy and ambition. MCI Chief Executive Michael Capellas has been named to lead the new BT Group, which some see as an effort to preserve MCI's culture.

The merger requires approval by U.S. and British regulators, who are concerned about reduced competition. But executives expect swift approval since the two companies have little overlap in their markets or services. BT and MCI predict costs savings of over $2 billion from the merger, mostly from combining technology systems and customer service operations. They also forecast stronger growth from offering integrated phone, data and Internet services to large business customers in the U.K., U.S. and abroad.

If BT and MCI can overcome the culture clash, analysts say the deal has significant strategic advantages. But that may be a very sizable 'if,' according to some experts. "These kind of cross-border mega-mergers often look great on paper but stumble in the execution," said Tina Wilkinson, a mergers and acquisitions specialist. "Uniting these two very different companies could prove far more challenging than BT and MCI executives realize."
