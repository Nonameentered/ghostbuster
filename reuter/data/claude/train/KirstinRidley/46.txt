Human rights activists and computer industry call for better policing of violence and pornography on the internet 

Major human rights organizations and leading tech companies issued a joint statement today calling on governments and internet service providers to do more to curb the spread of violent and pornographic content online. The groups argue that not enough is being done to protect internet users, especially children and teenagers, from disturbing and inappropriate material on the web.

The statement was signed by groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as tech giants such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. While acknowledging the importance of free expression, the organizations said internet companies and governments need to find the right balance between openness and allowing harmful content to spread unchecked. 

"The internet has enabled new forms of creativity, connection, and access to knowledge," the statement reads. "However, it has also enabled the wide proliferation of violence, exploitation, and abuse. More needs to be done to address these harms, while respecting human rights and fair process."

The groups argue that algorithms and policies are not effectively limiting the spread of violent extremist content, pornography, and images of child abuse on major platforms. They called for more human moderators, improved AI systems, and transparency reports on how companies are policing their platforms. On the government side, the groups urged policymakers to pass laws against the distribution of non-consensual intimate images and to update laws on child abuse and exploitation for the digital age.

However, others argue that increased restriction and censorship of the internet poses risks to privacy and freedom of information. "It's a slippery slope towards limiting civil liberties and access to knowledge," said Jillian York of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "While the goals of limiting harm are laudable, we must be extremely careful not to enable censorship overreach."

The issue of how to govern illicit and harmful content on the internet is a complex one with valid arguments on both sides. Balancing openness and protection is one of the central challenges of the digital age. Overall, there is consensus that more needs to be done through responsible policies and corporate accountability to make the internet a safer place, especially for the most vulnerable users. But finding the right approach that respects human rights and freedoms will require nuance, transparency, and good faith on all sides.
