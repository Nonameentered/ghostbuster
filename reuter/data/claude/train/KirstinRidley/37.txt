NTT Considers Investment with BT in France, a Major Coup for the Telecoms Operator 

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. or NTT, Japan's largest telecommunications company, is in discussions with UK operator BT Group Plc to co-invest in the French telecoms market. The move would mark NTT's first major overseas expansion and allow it to tap into BT's existing mobile and broadband customer base in France.

According to sources familiar with the matter, NTT and BT are exploring an investment in the range of $5 to $10 billion euros to gain scale and better compete in France against dominant player Orange SA. The deal could involve NTT and BT pooling their assets in France into a joint venture, with each company maintaining operational control of their existing businesses. NTT currently owns telecom operator NTT Com Asia, which has a small presence in France, while BT's EE mobile brand has about 4.2 million subscribers there.

The potential deal highlights the intensifying competition among telecom groups in Europe's largest markets. With growth slowing in their home markets, Asian operators like NTT are looking to invest in Western European companies to gain access to new customers and infrastructure. For BT, a partnership with a deep-pocketed partner could provide much needed funds to improve its mobile and broadband networks in France.

Shares of NTT and BT rose 3.4% and 2.2% respectively on the news. Analysts said an investment in France could be a smart strategic move for NTT, allowing it to tap into the potential in one of Europe's wealthiest economies. France's total telecom market revenue is around $50 billion, making it one of the largest in Europe behind Germany and the UK. An investment would also allow NTT to gain expertise in rolling out 5G networks and build its enterprise services business by serving multinational companies with operations in France.

However, any deal is likely to face close regulatory scrutiny over competition concerns. With Orange controlling about half of the mobile and broadband markets, France's telecom regulator will want to ensure any partnership between NTT and BT does not further reduce competition. The companies will have to show their investment will lead to cost savings and new services that benefit French consumers.
