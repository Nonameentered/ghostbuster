BT and NTT in Talks Over Potential Telecoms Deal

British telecommunications company BT Group is in early negotiations with Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) over a possible deal between the two companies. Sources with knowledge of the discussions say BT and NTT are exploring ways to combine their telecoms assets outside of their core home markets of the UK and Japan, respectively.

Any deal would see the two companies merge or jointly operate telecoms and mobile businesses in continental Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region. Both companies have been attempting to expand beyond their traditional geographic strongholds in recent years but have struggled with the sizeable investments required to compete with larger rivals. By partnering, BT and NTT could achieve greater scale and resources to invest in next-generation mobile and broadband networks.

Shares in BT rose 4% on the news, giving the company a market value of Â£25.8 billion ($33 billion). NTT remains a majority government-owned entity so its shares did not fluctuate on the announcement. Representatives from BT and NTT declined to comment on "rumor and speculation." However, analysts say some form of tie-up would make strategic sense for both firms. 

"BT and NTT are sub-scale in many international markets and struggle to match the infrastructure spending of companies like Vodafone and China Mobile," said James Robinson, a telecoms analyst at investment bank Canaccord Genuity. "Working together, especially when 5G requires huge investment, could propel both companies to the next level internationally."  

Any final agreement could be weeks or months away and there is no certainty a deal will be reached. However, consolidation is sweeping the telecoms sector globally as companies look to cut costs and increase investment firepower to rollout future technologies. Partnerships and mergers may be an effective way for BT and NTT to remain competitive on a global scale over the long run. Whether a joint venture or full-scale merger is on the cards is yet to be seen, but deeper cooperation between the British and Japanese telecoms giants could have significant implications for the global telecommunications landscape.
