BT and MCI aim to link up with NTT as part of Concert Plc plan

British Telecommunications (BT) and US telecom company MCI WorldCom are in talks with Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) about NTT taking a stake in their global venture Concert Plc, according to people familiar with the situation. 

The three companies are discussing NTT purchasing up to 20% of Concert, which provides global data and internet services to multinational companies. The deal could be worth up to $2 billion and help Concert expand in Asia, as well as give NTT greater global reach. The talks are preliminary and could still fall apart.

BT and MCI WorldCom formed Concert in 1999 to provide one-stop telecommunications services to global companies. Concert has so far focused on the US and Europe but wants to expand in Asia, a fast-growing market for corporate data and internet services.based in London, would likely remain the majority shareholder of Concert if a deal with NTT were reached, while MCI WorldCom would retain its existing 30% stake.

NTT, Japan's dominant telecommunications group, has been seeking more international tie-ups to compete with global rivals. An investment in Concert could help NTT win more business from Japanese multinationals operating overseas as well as foreign companies in Japan. NTT already has close ties with KDDI, Japan's number two telecom company, but a Concert deal would allow it to form links with top operators in other parts of the world.

Any deal would depend on BT and MCI WorldCom being satisfied they have enough control and influence over Concert's strategy and direction. The US and UK groups originally hoped to combine their corporate customer bases and networks to dominate the global market for business communications, but have faced more competition than expected, especially from carriers expanding out of their home regions. 

An NTT investment could help accelerate Concert's progress in Asia and put pressure on rivals like Singapore Telecommunications, or SingTel, and Hong Kong's PCCW. It would also allow Concert to provide more seamless global services to multinationals as companies increasingly relocate their back-office and technology operations to low-cost Asian countries like India.

Concert reported revenues of $960 million and a loss of $210 million in 2000, its first full year of operation. BT has a turnover of Â£20 billion, while MCI WorldCom generates sales of $30 billion and NTT $93 billion. BT's shares closed up 2.8% on the news of the possible NTT deal, while MCI WorldCom and NTT's stock were little changed.

The talks highlight how alliances between telecom companies are increasingly global amid deregulation of markets around the world. Through tie-ups, acquisitions and joint ventures, a handful of giants are emerging with the scale and reach to serve the world's largest multinationals. But forging truly global operations while keeping control of costs and quality remains a formidable challenge. An NTT stake in Concert could be an important test of whether such sprawling alliances can work.
