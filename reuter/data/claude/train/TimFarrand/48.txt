Britain refers Bass Plc's acquisition of Carlsberg-Tetley to Monopolies and Mergers Commission for investigation

The British government today announced that it has referred Bass Plc's £960 million bid to acquire Carlsberg-Tetley from Carlsberg A/S to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) for further investigation on competition grounds. The government has serious concerns that the merger will significantly reduce competition in the UK beer market. 

Bass Plc, the UK's largest brewer and owner of brands like Stella Artois and Boddingtons, announced its bid to acquire Carlsberg-Tetley in January this year. Carlsberg-Tetley is a British brewer that owns many popular ale and stout brands like Tetley's and Skol. The combined entity would control around 45% of the UK's beer market, making it by far the largest player.

The Business Secretary confirmed today that the merger would be referred to the MMC given the potential impact on competition and consumer choice in the UK beer industry. ‘The beer market is a central part of British culture and this deal risks causing a major shakeup that could impact consumers, pubs and brewers across the country. The role of the MMC will be crucial in determining if this deal can proceed while still promoting healthy competition and support for local producers,’ he said in a statement.

Bass Plc expressed disappointment at the decision and said it would fully cooperate with the MMC review. ‘We believe this transaction will truly benefit British brewing and the pub sector with increased investment and support for customers and consumers,’ a spokesperson said. However, critics argue the deal could lead to higher beer prices, job losses and reduced choice for consumers as the mega brewer exploits its dominant market power.   

The MMC now has 24 weeks to conduct an in-depth review of the acquisition's impact. It will examine various aspects like the ability of smaller rivals to compete, pricing dynamics, distribution networks, and consumer buying habits. The MMC has the power to require remedies to address any concerns identified before approving the deal. Competitors like Greene King and Marston's urged the government to refer the 'anti-competitive' deal to the regulator.

The final outcome of the MMC's investigation is uncertain but will have major implications for the competitive landscape of Britain's beer industry. For now, Bass Plc's ambitions to become the undisputed leader in UK brewing will remain on hold pending the regulator's verdict. Overall, despite the initial setback, Bass Plc remains confident it can make a compelling case for how the merger will benefit the country's breweries, pubs and consumers.
