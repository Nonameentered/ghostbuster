Imperial Tobacco Group Plc Sees Bright Future Despite Tough British Market Conditions

Imperial Tobacco Group Plc reported its half-year results today, indicating a solid performance despite challenging conditions in its home UK market. The multinational tobacco company said revenue grew 2.5% to £14.7 billion in the six months ending March 31, led by gains in emerging markets that offset sluggish demand in Britain. 

Profit declined 4% to £2.5 billion due to higher costs, but the company maintained its full-year guidance. Imperial Tobacco CEO Alison Cooper remained upbeat, pointing to the company’s diversification across geographies and its moves into alternative products like e-cigarettes and heated tobacco.

"We've made good progress against our strategy, growing aggregate market share and focusing on key markets including the US, Germany and Russia,” Cooper said. "Emerging markets also continue to perform well and now make up over 60% of our revenue."

Imperial’s results come as major tobacco companies pivot to less harmful products and new markets to insulate themselves from years of tax hikes and health initiatives aimed at curbing smoking in Western countries. The UK in particular has announced a goal of being smoke-free by 2030, accelerating the decline of traditional cigarettes.

To adapt, Imperial acquired UK e-cigarette maker Nerudia in January and plans to launch heated tobacco products in Britain this year. It is also pushing into new geographies such as Iran and Egypt and expanding in existing emerging markets like Russia, where regulation is less stringent.

In the UK, Imperial’s half-year cigarette volumes fell 9.5% amid a broader market decline of 6%. Revenue was flat on higher cigarette pricing. But earnings were down due to investments in alternative products and marketing. 

Investors appeared relieved at the results, with Imperial’s London-listed shares rising over 2.5% in midday trading. The company generates ample cash and paid an interim dividend of 42.7 pence, up 4%. With a broad global footprint and increasingly diversified product range, Imperial remains on solid footing despite the grim outlook for smoking in its British backyard. Overall, Cooper and her team seem to have matters under control during this challenging transition. As emerging markets and new products gather pace, Imperial’s best days may still be ahead.
