Kwik Save announces closure of 107 stores in radical shake-up plan to ensure future 

Kwik Save, the budget supermarket chain, today announced plans to close 107 stores in a radical shake-up aimed at securing the long-term future of the business. The closures will put around 2,500 jobs at risk.

The company said the closures were necessary to protect the rest of the business in the face of intense competition from discount retailers Aldi and Lidl. Kwik Save currently operates a network of 741 stores across the UK but has struggled in recent years to compete on price with the fast-growing German discounters.

In a statement, Matt Lomax, CEO of Kwik Save, said: "This is a tough day for the business, but these closures are necessary to ensure we have a sustainable future. The grocery retail sector is intensely competitive and we must take decisive action to turnaround our business. With regret, we are proposing to close 107 stores that are either unprofitable or in locations where we do not have a realistic chance of gaining or defending market share."

The planned closures amount to just over 14% of the Kwik Save estate. The company said it had identified stores where either profits were persistently low or locations where the population and customer base did not fit the Kwik Save model. Kwik Save will now enter a consultation period with the 107 stores and local employees, unions and shareholders on the closure plans.

The store closure plan is part of a wider turnaround strategy that will also see Kwik Save invest to price match the German discounters, revamp stores, and improve its own-brand product range. The company hopes these changes will help win back customers and make the chain more competitive in the future. 

Michael Clarke, retail analyst at Shore Capital, said: "This is a bold move by Kwik Save but ultimately necessary for long term survival. The industry is changing fast and large store estates are increasingly hard to sustain. Kwik Save now needs to ensure the remaining stores are as competitive as possible, learn the lessons from this painful experience, and hopefully emerge as a leaner and fitter business."

The announcement came as Kwik Save reported a 15% slump in profits to Â£73 million for the year ended January 2019. Like-for-like sales declined 7% over the period and the company warned of a "highly challenging" outlook for the current year. Kwik Save said it did not anticipate any improvement in sales and profits until at least the following financial year. The company's shares fell over 12% in early trading as investors reacted to the news.
