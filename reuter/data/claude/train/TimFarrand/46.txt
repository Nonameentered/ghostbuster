Grand Metropolitan Plans for Steady Growth Driven by Profits from Pillsbury and IDV  

Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British food and drinks conglomerate, announced plans for continued steady growth driven by strong profits and performance from its Pillsbury and IDV beverage divisions. The company reported pre-tax profits up 12% for the first half of the fiscal year, largely due to the success of new product launches from Pillsbury and growth in emerging markets for IDV brands like Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker whisky.

The Pillsbury division saw profits increase by 8% due to continued strong sales of its green giant frozen vegetables line and hot Just Bare chicken strips and nuggets. New product launches like Pillsbury Cinnamon Rolls also performed well, boosting sales and profits for that division. IDV profits were up 15% due to volume growth in emerging markets like India, China, Africa and Latin America. These markets now make up over 20% of total IDV sales and profits, a number Grand Metropolitan expects will continue to rise in the coming years.  

"Our strategic focus on new product innovation, expansion into emerging markets, and operational efficiency continues to drive steady results," said Grand Metropolitan CEO Stelios Hatjimarkakis. "Pillsbury and IDV remain the growth engines for our company, and we have robust plans to continue accelerating profits from these divisions over the next 3-5 years."

The company did see some challenges in its European restaurant chain division due to broader economic uncertainty across the continent. However, cost-cutting measures and some modest price increases have helped offset any major impacts. Overall, Grand Metropolitan expects to see 6-8% profit and earnings growth for the full fiscal year. 

Grand Metropolitan's share price was up 3% on the news, reflecting continued investor confidence in the company's strategic direction and leadership team. Hatjimarkakis reaffirmed the company's commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders through a steadily rising dividend and share buyback program over the next several years. With consumer demand remaining stable and a product pipeline focused on health, convenience and sustainability, Grand Metropolitan appears poised for sustainable long-term growth across its global divisions and brands.
