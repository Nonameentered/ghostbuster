Northern Foods Plc Sees Virtually Flat Profits, Blames Dairy Collapse on World Prices

Northern Foods PLC, one of Britain’s biggest food manufacturers, reported virtually flat profits for the last fiscal year. The company reported a profit of £133 million, just £1 million higher than the previous year. The results disappointed investors who had expected higher profits based on Northern Foods’ strategy to focus on value-added products with higher margins. 

The profit results were hampered by a collapse in worldwide dairy prices, which squeezed margins in Northern Foods’ dairy business. The company is one of Britain's largest producers of fresh milk, butter, and cheese. World dairy prices declined sharply in the last year due to oversupply and reduced demand in key export markets like China. Northern Foods was unable to pass on the full impact of lower prices to retailers and consumers, which significantly reduced profits in the dairy division.

“We faced extremely challenging conditions in our dairy business, with a collapse in global commodity prices putting huge pressure on our margins,” said Adam Jackson, Chief Executive of Northern Foods. “Although we took steps to reduce costs, lower prices, increase efficiency and diversify into higher-margin dairy products, we could not offset the full impact of much cheaper world dairy prices.”

Northern Foods’ bakery division fared better, with operating profits up 11% due to strong sales of artisanal and free-from bread and pastries. The company has invested in new product development to meet changing consumer tastes for artisanal, healthier bakery goods. The investment in innovation appears to be paying off, with sales of higher-margin bakery products continuing to grow.

The results point to a mixed outlook for Northern Foods. Although profits are likely to remain under pressure in the dairy business as long as commodity prices stay low, the bakery division and a move into more value-added dairy products could help boost profits over the medium term. The company must also continue cost-cutting to help offset any further commodity price declines. Northern Foods’ share price fell 2.5% on the profit results but analysts said the drop in profits had already been priced into the shares. Investors seem to believe that Northern Foods has the right long-term strategy to return to solid profit growth despite difficult conditions in world dairy markets.
