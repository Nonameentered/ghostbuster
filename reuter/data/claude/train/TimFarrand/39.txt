Scottish and Newcastle CEO Expects Improved Performance from Center Parcs in Second Half

The Chief Executive of Scottish and Newcastle, Mike Tye, said today that he expects the performance of Center Parcs to improve significantly in the second half of the financial year. Center Parcs is a UK-based holiday village operator owned by Scottish and Newcastle. 

In the first half of the year, Center Parcs saw a 10% drop in revenue and a 20% decline in operating profit compared to the same period last year. The drop in performance was attributed to a variety of factors, including the economic recession, good summer weather in the UK reducing demand for domestic holidays, and exchange rate impacts.

However, Mr. Tye said that bookings for the second half have been strong, especially for the key Christmas and New Year period. “People may have delayed their holidays or taken shorter breaks during the summer, but they still want to get away for the winter holidays,” he said. Advance bookings for the next six months are up over 15% compared to the same period last year. 

The company has also taken actions to cut costs and improve the customer experience. Center Parcs renegotiated contracts with many suppliers to lower costs and began a program to upgrade accommodation and facilities across its five UK villages. “We have enhanced our offering through investments in accommodation, restaurants, and activities while also streamlining our operations to become more efficient,” said Mr. Tye. “The combination of increased bookings and lower costs means the outlook for the rest of the year is positive.”

Despite the expected turnaround, Center Parcs’ full-year results are still likely to be down on last year’s figures. Revenue for the last financial year was £460 million, with an operating profit of £85 million. Mr. Tye said revenue this year may be 5 to 10% lower, and operating profit could decline by up to 30% from 2019 levels. “The impact of the first half will still weigh on our annual results, but the actions we have taken and the improving demand give us confidence for the future,” he noted.

Center Parcs operates five holiday villages in the UK, located in Sherwood Forest, Elveden Forest, Longleat Forest, Whinfell Forest, and Woburn Forest. The company offers short breaks and longer holidays in a rural setting with indoor and outdoor activities for families. Scottish and Newcastle has owned Center Parcs since 2020.
