Tate and Lyle's Staley unit expected to rebound from tough market conditions in North America, says CEO Larry Pillard

Larry Pillard, CEO of Tate & Lyle's Staley manufacturing division, said today that he expects the unit to recover growth over the next 6-12 months after facing difficult market conditions in North America over the past year. Staley produces food starches and sweeteners for major food and beverage companies in North America.  

Pillard cited a number of factors that negatively impacted the unit's performance in the most recent financial quarter, including reduced demand from major beverage customers due to a cold and wet start to spring and summer, as well as some supply chain issues that temporarily affected production. However, Pillard said many of these were temporary issues and the overall growth trajectory of Staley remains positive given strong consumer demand for naturally-sourced, organic and non-GMO ingredients. 

"While our Q3 results were softer than expected, we are optimistic the headwinds that impacted us this quarter will subside and give way to tailwinds that will return us to a growth trajectory," Pillard said on an earnings call with analysts. He pointed to new product launches planned by several major Staley customers in the coming months as an important growth driver, though he declined to provide specifics due to confidentiality agreements.

Staley represents about 25% of Tate & Lyle's overall revenue and profit. Tate & Lyle shares were up 2% in early trading as investors responded positively to Pillard's upbeat comments about Staley's future prospects. The unit is a key part of Tate & Lyle's strategy to accelerate growth by providing innovative natural-source ingredients to meet changing consumer tastes and preferences in North America. Overall, Tate & Lyle reported a 4% increase in sales in the most recent quarter, though profit was slightly lower due to the Staley unit's performance, but Pillard's comments calmed investor concerns about the temporary challenges facing Staley.
