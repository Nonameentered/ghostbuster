Whitbread CEO sees strong growth in consumer spending on leisure despite National Lottery effect 

The chief executive of Whitbread, Alison Brittain, has said the leisure sector in the UK is experiencing "strong growth" in consumer spending, despite the National Lottery's new scratchcard game distracting punters. Speaking to The Times, Brittain said trends in the first quarter of 2018 suggest Britons are spending more on eating out, gym memberships, and short breaks.

“We are seeing good consumer spending and demand. It's strong across all our brands. The gym membership market continues to grow in the mid to high single digits,” Brittain said. Total sales grew 6.6% in the 11 weeks to February 15, led by 9.1% growth at Costa Coffee and 7.9% at Premier Inn. 

The positive update from Whitbread comes after several months in which consumer-facing businesses warned that Britain’s high street is suffering from weakening confidence and tightening belts. However, Brittain said the fitness and dining-out markets remained strong, due in part to changing lifestyles and more experiences being shared on social media.

“Going out for dinner now competes with things like streaming Netflix. Social media means people share photos of amazing or quirky meals. This drives others to do similar things.” Fitness chains are also benefitting as gym wear becomes more fashionable and people seek out active leisure pursuits. 

Despite the upbeat report from Whitbread, some analysts remain cautious about the outlook for discretionary consumer spending. The new National Lottery Set For Life scratchcard game, which offers players the chance to win £10,000 a month for 30 years, has led to a short-term reduction in spending elsewhere, according to surveys.

Brittain acknowledged the new lottery game could be distracting customers in the short term but said overall trends remained positive. “The lottery will take some spend out of people's leisure wallets ... but if you look at the medium and long term, all the signs for the eating out and fitness markets are good.”

Whitbread, which owns Costa, Premier Inn, Beefeater, and Brewers Fayre, reported total revenue of £3.3 billion last year. Brittain said staying at a Premier Inn and eating at an on-site restaurant had become an “experience” for many guests. The gym chain PureGym, in which Whitbread owns a 25% stake, is also continuing to attract new members with its low-cost, 24-hour model.
