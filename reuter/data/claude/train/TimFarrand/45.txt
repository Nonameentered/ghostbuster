Imperial Tobacco CEO: Growth hard to find in UK, looks to Asia-Pacific for expansion 

Alison Cooper, the CEO of Imperial Tobacco, said the company is looking to expand more aggressively into the Asia-Pacific region as growth in the UK market slows. Speaking at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer and Retail Conference, Cooper said “The UK is a mature market, consumers are cutting back, and regulations continue to tighten. All of this makes growth hard to come by.”

In contrast, Cooper pointed to emerging markets in Asia, especially China and Vietnam, as key areas for future expansion. “There is rising income and an increasing appetite for premium brands in these markets. We see huge potential to build on our existing presence,” she said. Imperial Tobacco already has a strong foothold in a number of Asia-Pacific countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.

Cooper also addressed the impact of plain packaging laws and tighter regulations in the UK that have made the market more challenging. “While regulation poses headwinds, we continue to invest in innovation to meet changing consumer needs,” she said. Imperial launched several new e-cigarettes and vaping products this year under its blu brand to tap into rising demand for alternative tobacco products, especially among younger customers.

The company reported revenue growth of 500 million pounds in 2019, with operating profit increasing 7% to 3.7 billion pounds. Revenue growth was powered by sales in emerging markets, which now make up 40% of total revenue. Sales in mature markets like the UK and Western Europe declined due to lower demand and the loss of some brands. Cooper said she expects the reliance on emerging markets, especially in Asia, to increase over the next decade. Overall, the CEO expressed confidence in Imperial’s strategy to drive continued growth despite a difficult operating environment.
