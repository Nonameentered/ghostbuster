Marston's Pedigree Sales Decline Due to Rising Popularity of Nitrokegs, but Overall Market Share Increases  

British brewer Marston's reported a 12% decline in sales of its flagship Pedigree beer over the last fiscal year, citing the increasing popularity of nitrokeg and craft beers. However, the company's market share grew overall thanks to strong performances from some of its other brands and expanding into the growing craft beer segment.  

Pedigree, an amber ale, has long been Marston's most popular and well-known beer. The brand has benefited from strong customer loyalty and nostalgia over its long history dating back to 1852. However, the rise of nitrokeg and craft beers, especially among younger drinkers, has provided customers more options and led to declining sales of more traditional ales like Pedigree, according to industry analysts.  

Nitrokeg beers, which use a special tap system to give beers a creamier head, have become popular over the last few years, especially in pubs and bars. Marston's and other large brewers have begun offering some nitrokeg beer options to compete, but sales of existing brands like Pedigree have still declined as customers opt for newer alternatives.  

The company has aimed to offset losses from its legacy brands by releasing new beer styles, acquiring craft breweries, and launching its own craft-inspired brands. Marston's now has over 20 brands of ale, stout, IPA, sour and fruit beers as it tries to compete in Britain's increasingly crowded craft beer market.  

While sales by volume of Pedigree were down 12%, Marston's grew its overall market share, now standing at 5.2% of British beer sales according to industry data. Revenue and profit also increased for the brewer, demonstrating its success in capturing sales in faster-growing segments of the market.  

The declining popularity of brands like Pedigree poses a threat to major brewers relying on legacy beers, but by expanding into new segments, Marston's has weathered this challenge. "Marston's has deftly navigated industry headwinds by making the right strategic investments into craft and other growing beer styles," said drinks industry analyst Emma Reeves. With its balanced portfolio of traditional and craft brands, Marston's seems poised to maintain its position as a leader in British beer.
