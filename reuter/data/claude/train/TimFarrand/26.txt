Unigate Plc Seeks European Food and Distribution Companies for Acquisition

Unigate Plc, one of the largest food processing and distribution companies in the UK, announced today that it is actively seeking acquisition targets in the European food and logistics sectors. The company hopes to acquire one or more companies to expand its operations into mainland Europe and boost its product portfolio.

"We are looking to acquire well-run companies, preferably in Western Europe, that can provide strategic benefits to Unigate through market access, distribution networks or product ranges," said Simon Williams, Chief Executive Officer of Unigate. "Our strong balance sheet enables us to pursue meaningful acquisitions to drive growth and shareholder value."

Unigate currently operates 23 production and distribution facilities across the UK and Ireland, with over 12,000 employees. The company manufactures and distributes dairy, bakery, and prepared food products to both retail and wholesale customers. Some of its most recognizable brands include Gatehouse Dairy, Flapjack Bakery, and Pasta di Amore. Revenue last year was £3.2 billion with profits of £412 million.  

Industry analysts view this move as a natural next step for Unigate as the UK market for packaged foods shows signs of maturity. "Unigate has solid operations and brands in the UK, but future growth will be limited without expansion into new markets and product areas," said Deborah Arch, a food industry analyst at Global Insights Research. "Strategic acquisitions, especially in continental Europe, make a lot of sense given Unigate’s financial strength and operational expertise."  

Unigate did not specify a target acquisition size but said its preference is for mid-sized companies in the €500 million to €2 billion revenue range. The company hopes to complete one or more acquisitions before the end of the fiscal year. Unigate's shares rose 2.3% on the London Stock Exchange following the announcement as investors backed the growth ambitions of the company. The coming months will show whether Unigate can find suitable acquisition targets to fulfil its European expansion goals.
