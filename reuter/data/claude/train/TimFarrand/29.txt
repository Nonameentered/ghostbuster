Independent Brewers Call for Excise Duty Cut Ahead of UK Budget Statement 

 Britain's independent craft brewers have called upon the UK government to cut beer excise duty in the upcoming budget statement, arguing the move would boost a fast-growing industry that provides skilled jobs across the country.

The Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA) has launched a campaign urging Chancellor Rishi Sunak to reduce excise duty by 5% in the budget on March 11. The group represents over 900 small breweries across Britain that produce craft beers and ciders.

 SIBA argues that a duty cut would allow its members to invest in their businesses, stimulate job creation, and encourage more pub visits. The craft beer sector has been one of the success stories of British industry in recent years, with the number of independent breweries increasing fivefold since 2000. However, small brewers face higher costs than major producers, with excise duty making up a significant portion of their overheads.

“A modest cut in beer duty would make a huge difference to small independent craft brewers across the UK,” said Mike Benner, CEO of SIBA. “It will allow them to invest in their businesses, create more jobs, support local pubs and boost the wider economy.”

The campaign is supported by many of Britain’s well-known craft brewers, including BrewDog, Camden Town Brewery, and Beavertown Brewery. They argue that unlike large multinational producers, independent brewers reinvest the majority of their profits in the local and national economy.

However, the duty cut proposal faces significant opposition, particularly from health campaigners concerned about the impact of more inexpensive alcohol. They argue that reducing the price of beer, even moderately, will lead to increased consumption and related harms. The government is also under pressure to raise excise duties on all alcoholic drinks to generate revenue in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

There have been small decreases in UK beer duty over the past two budgets, but SIBA argues that a larger cut is now needed to adequately support independent brewers in the aftermath of COVID-19 damage and uncertainty over Brexit. If approved, the 5% cut would be the largest reduction in beer duty for over 15 years. However, with the budget deficit rising sharply, the Chancellor may decide that further duty reductions cannot be prioritized at the current time. The coming budget statement will reveal whether independent craft brewers’ calls for an excise cut have been heard.
