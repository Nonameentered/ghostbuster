Vendome Profits Drop Due to Poor Tourist Spending in Far East, Hopes for Recovery with Stronger Yen 

The luxury retailer Vendome Group reported a 12% drop in profits for the first quarter of this year due to weak tourist spending, especially from visitors from China and other parts of Asia. Vendome, which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Givenchy, generates nearly half of its sales from tourists shopping in Europe and North America. However, the economic slowdown in China and Hong Kong has significantly dampened discretionary spending on high-end goods.

“2019 has started with contrasting trends, with solid growth in Europe and the United States but slowing demand in Asia due to more challenging economic conditions,” said Vendome CEO Pierre Lefebvre. The Paris-based company said profits for the quarter fell to $1.42 billion, down from $1.62 billion the year before. Sales growth was flat, rising just 1% on a comparable basis which strips out currency effects. 

The luxury sector has become increasingly dependent on affluent tourists from China and other parts of Asia dropping large sums of money on expensive handbags, watches, jewelry, and cosmetics. Any slowdown in the pace of Chinese tourism can have an outsized impact on bottom lines for companies like Vendome. The pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, a major luxury shopping hub, have also deterred some visitors and hurt sales.

However, Vendome expressed optimism that profits and tourism spending would pick up later this year if the Japanese yen strengthens relative to the euro. A stronger yen effectively makes shopping in Europe cheaper for tourists from Japan, who are still big spenders on luxury goods. Lefebvre noted that the yen-euro exchange rate was more favorable for Japanese tourists last year compared to current levels.

In response to the quarterly results, Vendome shares dropped 2.4% in morning trading as investors reacted to the stark reminder of how exposed luxury brands have become to the spending whims of Asian tourists. Still, most analysts remained confident in the long-term growth prospects for luxury retailers like Vendome as affluence continues to rise in emerging markets. Overall, tough times may lie ahead in the short term but the global appetite for €10,000 handbags shows no signs of fading away anytime soon.
