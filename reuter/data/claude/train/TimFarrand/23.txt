Allied Domecq likely to see sharp drop in profits due to Carlsberg-Tetley sale loss and weak markets 

Allied Domecq, the spirits and wine company behind brands like Maker's Mark, Courvoisier, and Beefeater gin, is expected to report a significant drop in profits for the first half of its financial year. Analysts predict profits could fall by up to 20% from the same period last year due to several factors.

The company's sale of its UK beer business Carlsberg-Tetley to Carlsberg for £300 million last year meant the loss of a steady revenue stream. The all-cash deal completed in July and Allied Domecq no longer has that contribution to its top and bottom lines. Carlsberg-Tetley generated over £200 million in revenue and £50 million in profits in its last fiscal year as part of Allied Domecq.

At the same time, Allied Domecq faces challenging market conditions in many of its key markets due to deteriorating economic conditions and changing consumer tastes. The company generates nearly 40% of its profits from the United States, where a cocktail and spirits boom has started to fade and consumers have moderated spending at bars and restaurants. Sales of bourbon whiskey, Allied Domecq's largest spirit category, have declined for two straight quarters. 

In Europe, Allied Domecq confronts stagnant growth in major cocktail markets like Spain and Greece. Anti-alcohol campaigners have also pressured governments to curb binge drinking and tighten regulations on advertising and promotions, which could restrict marketing opportunities for brands. SARS and bird flu scares have disrupted travel and tourism in Asia, impacting duty-free spirit sales.

While cost-cutting initiatives like supply chain improvements and more targeted marketing spend may help offset some of the revenue declines, it likely won't be enough to counter the loss from divesting Carlsberg-Tetley. Investors were initially optimistic about the deal, but now recognise the loss of such a stable cash generator and source of profits in a business with highly cyclical components.

Allied Domecq reports its interim results next month and CEO Philip Bowman faces pressure to show how the company can reinvigorate sales and continue diversifying into wine, premium spirits, and non-alcoholic beverages to rely less on economic cycles. For now though, profits look set to take a hit from the loss of an old reliable part of the business and external events beyond Bowman's control. The market will be watching closely to see just how sharp the drop is, and what the outlook is for the rest of the year. Investors may need to brace for weaker than expected results and slower growth ahead.
