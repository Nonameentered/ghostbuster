Tate and Lyle Plc set to experience sharp drop in full year profits as Staley sees near 50 percent decline in earnings

Tate and Lyle Plc, the British-based sugar producer and ingredient manufacturer, announced it expects its full year profits to fall nearly 50 percent in its latest results statement. Tate and Lyle produces food ingredients, industrial starches and sweeteners used by food and beverage makers around the world. 

The company said it expects adjusted pre-tax profit for the year ending March 31 to be around £330 million, a decline of 46 percent from the previous year. The results are the latest sign of difficulties in the global food ingredients market due to weakening consumer demand, oversupply, and pricing pressures.

Nick Hampton, Tate and Lyle's chief executive, said the results were "disappointing" but that the company is taking actions to improve performance. "We have faced a number of challenges this year, in particular in our Food & Beverage Solutions and Primary Products divisions," Hampton said. "We have taken action to address these challenges and are making good progress transforming our business to deliver sustainable growth."

The company's Food & Beverage Solutions division saw the steepest decline, with profits down 62 percent. The division produces specialty food ingredients and noticed a slowdown in demand from large beverage customers. The company's Primary Products division, which produces sweeteners and industrial starches, saw profits decline 24 percent due to excess supply in the US ethanol market which has reduced demand for corn.

Overall sales volumes declined 2 percent during the financial year. The company expects sales volumes to remain "broadly flat" in the coming 2020 financial year.

The sharp decline in profits underscores the challenges facing ingredient makers as major consumer goods companies come under pressure to reduce costs. Unilever, Nestle, Coca-Cola and other large customers have been streamlining their supply chains and consolidating among fewer suppliers. This has made Tate and Lyle's specialty ingredients business more vulnerable to the loss of big customers.  

Shares in Tate and Lyle dropped 10 percent in early trading on the results announcement before recovering some of the losses. The company's share price has declined nearly 20 percent over the past year. Investors are concerned about the turnaround plan to revive growth and improve profit margins.

Analyst Sandy Gordon at UBS said the results were "worse than expected" but she still believes in the company's longer-term transformation strategy. "There are clearly major challenges to overcome in the current financial year, but we think the roadmap for growth is the right one," Gordon said in a research note. She maintained her "buy" rating on the stock but reduced her price target by 7 percent.

With its recovery plan still unfolding, analysts forecast profits at Tate and Lyle to remain under pressure in the 2020 financial year before starting to rebound the following year. The company aims to reduce costs by £150 million over three years through manufacturing efficiency programs and headcount reductions. It is also expanding into higher-growth sectors such as fibers, reducingsugars and natural sweeteners to accelerate growth.   

Tate and Lyle was once part of the British sugar industry's two largest companies along with British Sugar. It was privatized in 1988 and now operates as an independent public company. Headquartered in London, it employs around 4,000 people across operations in the UK, U.S., Brazil, and China.
