Here is a 500-word news article with the headline "Unilever Profits Exceed Expectations, Shares Rise Sharply":

Consumer goods giant Unilever reported strong first-quarter results today, beating analysts'  expectations and driving its shares up sharply. Unilever said underlying sales grew 5.2% compared with the same period a year earlier, driven by strong performances in emerging markets. 

Unilever, whose brands include Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise, and Ben & Jerry's ice cream, said profit was buoyed by cost-cutting measures put in place last year. The company has been streamlining its portfolio of brands and optimizing its supply chain to improve profit margins. 

"We delivered a good start to the year, with strong competitiveness driving volume growth ahead of our markets and sustained margin progression," said Unilever CEO Alan Jope. Unilever reported a net profit of 3.7 billion euros, or 1.19 euros per share, up from 3.2 billion euros, or 1.00 euro per share, a year earlier. Revenues rose to 13.3 billion euros.

Analysts had expected earnings of 1.16 euros per share and sales of 13.2 billion euros, according to poll data compiled by FactSet. 

Unilever's results provided evidence that major consumer-goods companies can still thrive by tightening their focus on brands with the strongest growth potential. The company has sold some food brands in recent years like Becel margarine and announced in February it would stop marketing skin-lightening creams, a $500 million business, as part of efforts to promote more inclusive ideals of beauty.

Keith Bowman, investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the figures showed new CEO Alan Jope had made "a fine start." Bowman said cost controls and the performance of higher-margin products had helped Unilever weather challenging emerging markets like India and Argentina.

Unilever raised its quarterly dividend by 10% and said it planned to buy back shares worth about 1 billion euros this year, igniting its share price which rose more than 4% in early trading. The results marked a solid start to Jope's tenure, as he takes over from long-serving CEO Paul Polman at a time of rapid change in consumer tastes and new competition from startups.
