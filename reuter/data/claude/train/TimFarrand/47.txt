Greenalls Plc set to report nearly 20% rise in full year profits thanks to Boddington acquisition

Greenalls Plc, the Manchester-based brewer and pub operator, is expected to report a nearly 20% rise in full-year profits next week thanks to its recent acquisition of Boddingtons Bitter. 

Analysts predict Greenalls will announce pre-tax profits of £320 million for the year ending March 2020, up from £268 million the previous year. The increase is mainly attributed to Greenalls’ takeover of the iconic Boddingtons brand in late 2018, which added the famous creamy bitter ale to its portfolio of beers that includes Greene King IPA and Old Speckled Hen.

Boddingtons has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, especially among younger drinkers in the North West of England. Greenalls is investing heavily to boost production of Boddingtons and distribution across the UK. The company is also revamping the beer’s marketing and sponsorship to raise brand awareness nationwide.

The Boddingtons deal is part of Greenalls’ strategy to focus on premium beers and ales, while expanding beyond its traditional base in the North West. The company has been acquiring craft breweries and niche beer brands in an effort to tap into fast-growing segments and new audiences.

Despite a general downward trend in alcohol consumption across the population, the market for craft beers and real ales has steadily expanded over the past decade. Younger generations in particular have developed a taste for more complex, full-flavoured brews. Greenalls is evolving to capitalise on these shifts in customer preferences.

While its beer business is thriving, Greenalls’ chain of over 2,800 pubs and bars has faced challenges from cheaper supermarket prices, the smoking ban, and changing social habits. Greenalls has responded by improving the quality of its pubs, focusing on the dining and drinking ‘experience’, and using promotions to drive regular trade.

Analysts say Greenalls is well-placed to benefit from a continued recovery in on-trade sales and tight cost control. Its shares have risen 15% over the past year, but still offer good value if premiumisation trends continue and consumer confidence holds up post-Brexit. The company is due to announce its full-year results on March 25.
