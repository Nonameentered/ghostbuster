UK government may block Bass's bid to create largest brewer by merging with Carlsberg-Tetley, say analysts 

The UK government is likely to block brewing giant Bass's attempt to take over rival Carlsberg-Tetley, according to industry analysts. The proposed £10 billion deal would combine the UK's two largest brewers and create a company making one in three of all beers drunk in British pubs.

However, the merger is expected to face significant scrutiny from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which monitors business takeovers and mergers. The CMA is likely to argue that the deal reduces competition in an already concentrated market, leads to higher beer prices for consumers, and disadvantages smaller craft brewers.

Bass, the maker of Boddingtons and Pedigree, announced in January its intention to acquire Carlsberg-Tetley from its Danish owners. The combined company would produce major ale brands including Carling, Tetley's and Worthington's, as well as lager brands Carlsberg and Holsten Pils. 

According to market research firm Kantar, the merged business would control 38% of the UK beer market, far ahead of second-placed InBev with 11.5% market share. "A merger reducing competition so significantly in such an important sector will worry the CMA," said Kantar drinks analyst James Arnold. "We expect them to conduct an in-depth investigation, which may well end in them blocking the deal to avoid market dominance."

However, Bass argues the merger will generate cost savings of £200 million per year, mostly from reducing overheads, which it claims will lead to lower prices for pubs and consumers. In a statement, Bass chief executive Jane Haskins said: "This is good news for beer drinkers across Britain who will benefit from new low prices and continued innovation in our industry."

The British Beer & Pub Association, which represents most brewers and pub operators in the UK, has yet to give its view on the proposed deal. Smaller brewing companies have privately expressed concerns but are reluctant to do so publicly for fear of reprisals from Bass.

Consumer groups have voiced opposition to the merger. "This deal would be terrible for choice and consumer prices in pubs across the country," said Neil McMillan from the Campaign for Real Ale. "It cannot be right that two massive companies controlling so much of the market are allowed to join together to exert even more control and push their mainstream corporate brands."

A spokesperson for the CMA said it will launch a Phase 1 investigation into the merger "as soon as reasonably practicable" after receiving notice from Bass about the deal. The initial findings will determine whether the authority pursues an in-depth Phase 2 probe, which could take months and may ultimately block the multi-billion pound tie-up between Britain's two brewing giants. Bass shareholders will have to wait to discover whether they can raise a glass to their new mega-brewer.
