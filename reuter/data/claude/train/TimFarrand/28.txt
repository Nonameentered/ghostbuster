Northern Foods Offset Impact of Low World Dairy Prices with Improved Margins on Prepared Foods  

Northern Foods, the British maker of prepared  foods and dairy products, reported full year earnings today that were slightly ahead of analyst estimates despite facing significant headwinds from lower global dairy prices. The company was able to offset declining profits in its dairy segment through improved margins and volume growth in its prepared foods division.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, Northern Foods reported revenue of £3.7 billion, up 3% from the prior year. Net income declined 8% to £247 million due to lower dairy prices, which reduced profits in the company's cheese and butter divisions. However, earnings per share of 48 pence still beat the average analyst forecast of 47 pence according to FactSet.  

The company's prepared foods segment, which includes items such as ready meals, bakery goods, and soups, posted a 12% increase in operating profit to £183 million as margins expanded and volumes grew across all categories. Sales in prepared foods rose 8% to £2.2 billion, making up 61% of total revenue. The growth in prepared foods helped offset a £64 million, or 34%, decline in operating profit in the dairy segment due to a drop in international dairy prices.

"We are pleased to report improved results this year despite significant challenges in our dairy business arising from global commodity price deflation," said Brian Lynch, Chief Executive of Northern Foods. "The outstanding performance of our prepared foods segment, driven by product innovation, margin enhancement, and volume growth, more than compensated for dairy price weakness."   

The company's dairy business remains under pressure, however, as average dairy prices have declined a further 12% in the first few months of the new fiscal year according to Northern Foods. The company expects world dairy prices to remain weak "at least through the calendar year" before showing some signs of moderate recovery. Northern Foods pledged to continue adjusting its cost base in dairy to offset pricing declines.

The company's guidance for moderate sales and earnings growth in the next fiscal year implies that strong momentum in prepared foods is expected to continue. Northern Foods plans to introduce over 200 new products this year, with a focus on "better-for-you" options and key consumer categories such as protein snacks, artisanal breads, and premium desserts. The company also aims to expand distribution of its prepared meals line in continental Europe, building on its number one position in the U.K.

Northern Foods’ share price was down 1.2% in early trading given the ongoing challenges in dairy. However, analysts noted the company's ability to overcome substantial headwinds this year through innovation and strong management of costs and margins. With a positive outlook for prepared foods and expectations of stability returning to dairy, the company appears well positioned for continued steady growth over the medium term.
