Brewer Bass Plc Expected to Report Strong Earnings Growth Driven by Holiday Inn and Harvester Restaurants  

Brewer Bass Plc, the British hospitality and restaurant group, is expected to report strong earnings growth for the first half of its fiscal year ending June 30. The company owns and operates hundreds of Holiday Inn hotels across the UK, as well as the Harvester and All Bar One restaurant chains. 

Analysts forecast that the company will announce revenue growth of 12-15% and operating profit growth of 20-25% compared to the same period last year. The improved performance is attributed to stronger demand for travel and dining following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Occupancy rates at Holiday Inn hotels have returned to 80% of pre-pandemic levels, allowing the company to increase room rates which will boost the top and bottom line.

The Harvester and All Bar One restaurants have also seen a strong rebound in customer traffic as people return to pubs, bars and restaurants. Like-for-like sales growth, which measures sales at locations open for at least a year, is projected to be up 35-40% from a year earlier demonstrating the pent-up demand for socializing and dining out. 

“Brewer Bass is well positioned to benefit from the release of demand from months of lockdowns and restrictions,” said John Smith, an analyst at Redburn Partners. “Its chains of affordable hotels and family diners are exactly the types of businesses that should see a burst of activity. The trends so far this year suggest the first half results will show a marked acceleration of growth and point to a solid recovery for the rest of the fiscal year if there are no further lockdowns.”

The shares of Brewer Bass have risen 25% over the past six months, lagging some of its competitors that have more upmarket brands. However, analysts think there is further scope for gains if the reopening of the economy continues smoothly and earnings recover to pre-pandemic levels sooner than expected. Brewer Bass management will likely provide an updated outlook for the full fiscal year 2021-22 during its first half earnings report and conference call with analysts on July 15.  

Investors will also be listening for any commentary on how the company’s customers are responding to price increases put through over the past year to offset higher costs of goods and operations. The potential impact of rising food prices and wage inflation on the firm’s margins and profits will be a key issue to monitor going forward. Overall though, the first half results of Brewer Bass are set to show a marked improvement in its financial performance as life slowly returns to normal for the hospitality and restaurant sector.
