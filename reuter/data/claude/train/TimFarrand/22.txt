Unilever sees 5% rise in Q3 profits, shares jump

Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever reported a 5% rise in quarterly underlying sales on Thursday, beating analysts' forecasts, as price hikes more than offset rising costs.

The maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream said third-quarter underlying sales rose 5.8% in India and emerging markets, though only 2.9% in Europe. Unilever's shares rose 3% as the results allayed concerns over its ability to navigate global supply chain problems and pass on higher costs to consumers. 

Unilever's Chief Executive Alan Jope said the results demonstrated the success of the company's premiumization strategy - focusing on higher-margin products. "We have been able to successfully navigate global supply chain disruptions and increasing inflationary pressures," he added.

Unilever's results came a day after rival Nestle also reported better-than-expected sales, as food companies raise prices to cope with surging costs for raw materials, transportation and energy. Both companies said they saw no sign that price rises were curbing consumer demand so far.

Unilever said inflationary pressures would continue to be significant next year but predicted revenue growth would be in the middle of its multi-year annual range of 3-5% in 2022. 

Underlying third-quarter sales rose 2.5%, beating analysts' expectations of 1.9% according to a company-supplied consensus. Third-quarter underlying operating profit rose 5% but came in below forecasts. Jope said profit margins had been pressured by cost increases that could not be immediately offset by price rises. He expected significantly higher input costs next year.

The results point to a steady if unspectacular performance for Unilever ahead of what some analysts think might be a challenging winter for consumer goods companies. The company is also still searching for new CEO, though Jope, the current COO, said the hunt remained on track.

In sum, Unilever reported steady growth in Q3 profits and sales despite inflationary headwinds and supply chain issues. Its premium products and pricing power have enabled the conglomerate to navigate a tough environment and meet analyst expectations. The outlook for Q4 remains uncertain but Unilever expects to sustain modest growth into next year. Overall, investors were reassured by the results as seen in the share price jump following the earnings release.
