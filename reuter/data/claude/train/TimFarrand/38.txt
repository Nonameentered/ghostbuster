Scottish and Newcastle Plc sees 26 percent increase in half-year profits

Scottish and Newcastle Plc, the UK's largest brewer, announced a 26 percent increase in pre-tax profits for the first half of 2007 this morning. The brewer reported pre-tax profits of £153 million for the six months ending June 30, up from £121 million over the same period last year. The strong results were driven by volume growth across the company's key markets in Western Europe and Russia, as well as cost savings from the company's ongoing restructuring program.

"We are delighted to report another set of excellent results, with good profit growth and strong cash flow," said Chief Executive Tony Froggatt. "Our key brands have performed well, particularly in growth markets such as Russia. Combined with the benefits from our efficiency drive, we have achieved an outstanding financial performance in the first half."

Revenue grew 3 percent to £1.69 billion from £1.64 billion last year. Excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, revenue would have grown by an even stronger 6 percent. Volume grew 4 percent overall, with the key growth drivers being the company's premium brands such as Stella Artois and Budweiser. Volume growth was particularly strong in developing markets such as Russia, up 23 percent, Romania, up 32 percent, and Ukraine, up 56 percent. 

Growth in Western Europe was more modest at 2 percent, reflecting limited pricing power and strong competition in mature markets. However, premium brands still outperformed, gaining market share in most of the company's major markets, including the UK, Italy and France. The company's cost reduction program delivered £23 million in cost savings during the first half, contributing to the improved profit margins. The program is on track to deliver total annualized savings of £50 million by 2008.

"While market conditions remain challenging in Western Europe, we have built good momentum in our developing markets in Eastern Europe and continue to benefit from tight cost control," said Froggatt. "The Board remains confident in delivering full year earnings in line with expectations."
