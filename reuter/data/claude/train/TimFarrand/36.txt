Grand Metropolitan Plc to Report Strong Growth Driven by Pillsbury, But Faces Huge Loss on Disposals

Grand Metropolitan Plc, the British alcoholic beverages and food company, is set to report strong first-half results largely driven by the stellar performance of its recent acquisition, Pillsbury. However, the company also is poised to disclose significant losses related to the disposal of underperforming business units.

Analysts expect Grand Met's pretax profit for the first half of 1993 to surge by nearly 70% from a year earlier to about £730 million. The growth primarily reflects the contribution of Pillsbury, the U.S. food company Grand Met acquired last year for $5.7 billion. Pillsbury owns popular brands like Green Giant, Progresso and Häagen-Dazs ice cream that have boosted Grand Met's food business.

Excluding Pillsbury, analysts estimate Grand Met's operating profit still climbed 15% in the first half, reflecting volume gains across its spirits business, which produces brands like Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker whisky. However, the company's disposal of poorly performing businesses—primarily certain continental European restaurant and hotel operations—likely resulted in over £500 million in losses, offsetting much of the profits from its ongoing businesses.

Grand Met Chief Executive Allen Sheppard has moved aggressively to refocus the company around its core spirits, wine and premium food operations. The company has sold more than 60 businesses in the past three years at a loss of nearly £2 billion. Sheppard has said Grand Met aims to derive 70% of its profits from spirits and premium foods. The recent deal to sell the company's brewing operations for £1.2 billion to Guinness Plc will move Grand Met substantially closer to that goal. 

While the restructuring is hurting short-term profits, analysts say it should lead to stronger and more consistent earnings over time. The company's stock has risen more than 50% over the past year, reflecting investor confidence in Sheppard's strategy. Grand Met is relying on marketing and new products, especially in North America, to drive continued growth in spirits and premium foods. The company plans to launch a new ad campaign for Smirnoff later this year to further boost the brand's sales.

Grand Met's half-year results and the progress of its restructuring will likely reassure investors who have backed Sheppard's vision to build a focused portfolio of leading brands. But the sizable disposal losses highlight the challenges Grand Met faces in reshaping itself. The company's future success depends on delivering on the promise of its restructured business and key brands like Pillsbury and Smirnoff.
