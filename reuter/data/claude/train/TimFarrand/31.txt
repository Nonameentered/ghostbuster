Tate and Lyle reports fall in profits, but shares rise on positive outlook for corn miller subsidiary 

Tate & Lyle, the British food and ingredients maker, reported a 6% drop in pre-tax profits for the first half of its financial year, but shares rose as the company said it expects a strong performance from its corn wet milling business in the US.

Pre-tax profits fell to £188 million in the six months to September 30th, down from £201 million a year earlier, as sales declined 2% to £1.71 billion. However, shares rose 3% in early trading as the results beat analysts’ expectations and the company said its corn wet milling subsidiary will benefit from favorable market conditions.

The corn milling business, which provides corn-based sweeteners and starches in North America, is now Tate & Lyle’s largest division following a £1.2 billion acquisition last year. Sales at the unit were up 13% and operating profits rose 12% in the first half. Tate & Lyle said US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade had provided “more certainty” and the business is well positioned to benefit from solid demand.

Nick Hampton, Tate & Lyle chief executive, said: “Our key businesses performed well in the first half against a difficult economic backdrop. We delivered steady results while continuing to invest in our Speciality Food Ingredients and Primary Products divisions to drive future growth.”

“In Speciality Food Ingredients, we saw good volume growth in Beverages and Dairy. We have a strong innovation pipeline of new product launches planned for the coming year. In Primary Products, our North American corn milling business is performing well, given supportive market conditions, and in the rest of the Primary Products division we are driving continuous improvement.”

The results highlight the company’s decision last year to shift its focus to speciality food ingredients and the North American market. In 2018, Tate & Lyle sold a controlling stake in its oats ingredients and industrial starch divisions to focus on higher-margin products.

Hampton said Tate & Lyle remains confident in the group's prospects for the coming year, despite the uncertain economic environment. The company expects modest progress in the 2020 financial year.
