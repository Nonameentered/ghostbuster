Scottish & Newcastle Plc expected to benefit from Courage brands, but held back by Center Parcs, analysts say 

Scottish & Newcastle Plc, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based brewer and pub company, is poised to benefit from its recent acquisition of Courage beer brands, but continues to be weighed down by struggles at its Center Parcs European holiday villages, according to analysts.

The company finalized its purchase of Courage brands and several breweries from Anheuser-Busch InBev in October for £1.8 billion. The deal brings well-known British ale brands like Courage Best, Courage Directors, and John Smith’s Extra Smooth into Scottish & Newcastle’s portfolio, which already includes Foster’s, Kronenbourg 1664, and Strongbow cider.

“The Courage deal was a successful move by Scottish & Newcastle to build on its position as the leading brewer in the UK,” said George MacDonald, an analyst at HSBC. “Those brands have a strong heritage and customer base that should prove very valuable.”

However, Scottish & Newcastle’s results continue to be hampered by its Center Parcs holiday business. The company owns and operates five village resorts in the UK and continental Europe, centered around large sub-tropical swimming pools and family-friendly activities. But the resorts have faced declining occupancy and competition from cheaper package holiday options in recent years.  

In the company’s latest interim results, revenue from its pubs and brewing operations rose 6% but revenue from Center Parcs declined by 2%. Pre-tax profit was up 4%, but would have been higher without the drop in Center Parcs’ contribution.  

“Center Parcs remains an albatross around Scottish & Newcastle’s neck,” said Jane Faulkner, an analyst at Credit Suisse. “The resorts require a lot of capital to operate and upgrade but are struggling to attract visitors. It may be time for management to consider exiting the holiday business, even at a loss, to allow the company to focus on its core brewing strengths.”

However, Scottish & Newcastle’s CEO Andrew Witty has said the company remains committed to Center Parcs for the long term and sees opportunities to turn around performance by improving the customer experience, targeting more premium visitors, and achieving operational efficiencies. The resorts still generate over £500 million in revenue annually for the company.

With the addition of the Courage brands, Scottish & Newcastle is expected to continue growing its brewing and pubs business over the coming years. But much will depend on whether it can address the challenges facing its Center Parcs resorts and turn that division into a greater contributor to group profits. Analysts will be closely watching the company’s next results to see if new strategies for Center Parcs are gaining any traction.
