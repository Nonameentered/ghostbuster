Grand Metropolitan Reports Six Percent Rise in Annual Profits, Driven by Growth in Pillsbury and IDV  

Grand Metropolitan, the UK-based food and drinks conglomerate, reported strong annual results today driven by growth in its Pillsbury and International Distillers and Vintners (IDV) divisions. For the full year ended June 30, pre-tax profits rose 6 percent to £1.47 billion, ahead of analysts’ expectations.

GrandMet’s food division, which includes brands such as Pillsbury, Green Giant, and Old El Paso, increased operating profits by 8 percent. The company attributed the gains to new product launches, increased distribution, and a strong performance in emerging markets like China and Brazil. Pillsbury refrigerated dough products were a standout, with sales up 12 percent in the U.S. and key international markets.

The IDV drinks division grew operating profits by 7 percent, led by growth in premium spirits and innovations in the fast-growing vodka category. Absolut vodka sales rose 9 percent, driven by the successful launch of new flavored variants like mandarin and lime. Sales of Ballantine’s scotch whisky also increased at a double-digit rate, especially in Asia. The gains in spirits offset a weaker performance in IDV’s wine business, where sales declined due to competitive pressures in the U.S. market.

“We are pleased to report another year of good growth at Grand Metropolitan, led by the exceptional performance of our food and premium drinks brands across all regions,” said CEO Mark Williamson. “Our strategic focus on premium, differentiated products and expansion into new markets positions us well for continued success despite the challenging macroeconomic environment.” 

The company expects sales and profit growth to remain solid in the new fiscal year, forecasting mid-single digit revenue gains and high-single digit profit increases, barring major currency impacts or global economic shocks. Grand Metropolitan’s share price rose 2 percent in early London trading on the stronger-than-expected results and outlook. The company proposed raising its annual dividend by 8 percent to 34.5 pence per share.
