Supreme Court to Decide Credit Union Expansion Case, Pitting Non-Profits Against Banks 

The Supreme Court announced today that it will hear a case that could have major implications for the banking industry. The court will rule on whether credit unions, non-profit financial cooperatives, should be allowed to accept new members from outside their core constituencies. Credit unions argue they should be permitted to expand their memberships to serve more consumers, while banks contend that credit unions have an unfair tax advantage and should not be allowed to compete for a wider customer base.

Credit unions have traditionally served groups with a "common bond" like employees of a company, members of an association or church, or residents of a neighborhood. But in 1998, the Credit Union Membership Access Act allowed credit unions to accept new members from outside these groups. The banking industry argues this expansion has gone too far. The American Bankers Association says credit unions have evolved into full-service commercial banks but without paying federal income taxes like banks.  

In 2011, the banking industry challenged three large credit unions that had dramatically expanded their memberships. A district court upheld the challenge but an appeals court overturned that decision in 2013. Now the Supreme Court has agreed to issue a final ruling on the case. A ruling in favor of the credit unions would cement their ability to continue expanding. A ruling for the banks could force some credit unions to shrink their memberships back to original groups.

There are over 5,000 credit unions in the U.S. with 115 million members. Credit union advocates argue they provide valuable competition to banks and services to low-income individuals who might otherwise be unbanked. However, if allowed to expand without limit, credit unions could pose a major competitive threat to community banks in particular. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case this fall and likely issue a decision in 2020. The outcome will shape the future of competition in the financial services sector and access to non-profit financial institutions in communities across the nation.
