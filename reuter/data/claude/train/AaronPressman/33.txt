Clinton Administration Considers Proposal to Remove Barriers Between Financial and Non-Financial Companies in U.S. Banking Reform 

The Clinton administration is considering a proposal to eliminate Depression-era laws that strictly separate financial and commercial companies in the U.S. banking system. The proposal aims to make U.S. banks more competitive globally by allowing them to engage in a wider range of business activities, especially insurance, securities, and real estate underwriting.

Supporters argue this could increase efficiencies in the financial system and provide more choices for consumers. However, critics warn it could also increase risks in the banking sector and lead to conflicts of interest. The proposal is emerging as one of the most controversial aspects of efforts to overhaul financial regulation in the wake of the 1990s savings and loan crisis.

The key measures under review are the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Glass-Steagall Act prohibits commercial banks from undertaking investment banking activities such as securities and insurance underwriting. The Bank Holding Company Act restricts bank holding companies from owning non-bank financial companies. Removing barriers between commercial and investment banks could allow conglomerates that offer a full range of financial and non-financial services.

Administration officials argue this could benefit consumers through "one-stop shopping" and reduce costs. However, others argue it could create too much concentration in the financial industry and pose risks to the banking system. "The concern is that allowing banks to engage in highly risky activities like securities underwriting could threaten the stability of the deposit insurance fund and taxpayers," said John Reed, the former CEO of Citicorp.

Congress would have to approve any proposal to overhaul Glass-Steagall and Bank Holding Company Act. The House and Senate Banking Committees have held hearings on modernizing financial regulation but there is no consensus on how far restrictions should be eased. The financial services industry is lobbying hard for deregulation while consumer groups aim to preserve the laws that have guaranteed stability in banking for over 60 years.

The debate reflects the tensions between promoting American competitiveness and protecting taxpayers in an increasingly global financial system. While change may be inevitable, the pace and scope remain uncertain. One thing is clear: any reform could have a bigger impact on the economy than when these pillars of banking law were first enacted. The coming months will determine if the walls between Main Street and Wall Street come tumbling down.
