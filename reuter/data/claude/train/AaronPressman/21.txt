Task Force Proposes Substantial Expansion of Internet Destinations with Seven New Top-Level Domains

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) today proposed adding seven new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) to expand available internet addresses. The new domain types—.art, .book, .film, .music, .radio, .show, and .theatre—would provide more options for brands, organizations, and individuals to register memorable and meaningful domain names.

ICANN’s Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) unanimously approved the new gTLDs following a review by the GNSO’s New gTLD Subsequent Procedures Policy Development Process Working Group. The working group spent 18 months evaluating nearly 200 requested new domain types to determine appropriate additions to the existing collection of gTLDs like .com and .org. Their recommendations aim to introduce domain names more tailored to specific industries and interests.

“These new gTLDs provide more choice and flexibility for those looking to establish an online presence,” said ICANN Board Chair Maarten Botterman. “They offer alternatives for branding and communication in certain sectors like the arts, entertainment, literature, and music.”

The proposed gTLDs will now proceed to ICANN’s Board of Directors for final approval. If approved, the new domains would become available for registration and use as early as 2021. Brands and domain name registrars are preparing for the launch of the new gTLDs, developing plans to market the domains to clients and make them available for purchase and registration as soon as they are officially released.
