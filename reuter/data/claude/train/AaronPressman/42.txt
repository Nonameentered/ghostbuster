U.S. Legislators Plan to Introduce Bills Relaxing Export Restrictions on Encryption Technology

Leading members of Congress announced today that bipartisan groups of legislators in both the House and Senate are planning to introduce new bills to relax export restrictions on encryption technology. Under current laws and regulations, U.S. technology companies face restrictions when exporting encryption software and hardware abroad due to national security concerns. The proposed legislation aims to ease those restrictions to allow greater export of technology and make U.S. companies more competitive in foreign markets. 

Senator John Doe (D-CA) and Representative Jane Doe (R-TX) are spearheading the efforts in the Senate and House respectively. At a press conference, Sen. Doe said, “Current export restrictions on encryption technologies are outdated and limit the growth of U.S. tech companies. By relaxing these limits in a responsible, targeted way, we can boost American businesses and competitiveness abroad while still protecting our national security.” Rep. Doe echoed these sentiments, saying, “Promoting U.S. business interests and innovation on the global stage needs to be a higher priority. Thoughtful reform of encryption export rules has the potential to drive economic growth and job creation across the country.”

The new bills would loosen export restrictions on commercial encryption software and hardware but continue limits on exports of encryption technologies that directly enable human rights abuses or threats to U.S. national security. The lawmakers acknowledged the need to balance business and security interests. The plans have received tentative praise from tech industry groups that have long advocated changes to the rules. Groups representing U.S. companies such as ABC Tech and XYZ Networks issued statements applauding the legislators for their efforts. However, some national security experts expressed concerns that any relaxation of export controls could be exploited by foreign actors. 

Human rights organizations also weighed in, arguing that reform needs to consider the impact on activists and journalists abroad who depend on encryption tools. A joint statement from several such groups said, “We strongly support finding the right balance between enabling U.S. business opportunities and protecting human rights defenders who rely on encryption. Legislators must fully take into account both technology's economic promise as well as its potentially life-saving use.”

The proposed bills are expected to be introduced in Congress next month. While passage is far from certain, the bipartisan and bicameral support for reforming encryption export policy suggests a real opportunity for legislative change on this issue. If passed, the new laws could significantly impact both the U.S. tech sector as well as privacy and security issues around the world.
