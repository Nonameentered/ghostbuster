Pyramid schemes still the most popular scam on the Internet, says non-profit group 

Pyramid schemes remain the most prevalent scam targeting people on the Internet, according to a new report from the non-profit Fraud Awareness Council. The group analyzed thousands of scam reports from consumers over the past year and found that pyramid schemes, also known as multi-level marketing scams, made up 42% of reported scams.

"Unfortunately, pyramid schemes remain tremendously popular because they seem legitimate and prey on people's desire to make easy money or find a job," said Jane Smith, Director of the Fraud Awareness Council. "These scams are particularly pernicious because people often recruit their close friends and family into the scheme."

Pyramid schemes promise large payouts to participants for recruiting new members, who then also have to recruit new members. The schemes ultimately collapse as it becomes impossible to recruit enough new members. The vast majority of participants end up losing their money.

The Federal Trade Commission reported that consumers lost over $490 million to pyramid schemes last year. The scams most commonly involved health and beauty products, supplements, cryptocurrency, business coaching services, and travel programs. 

"Legitimate multi-level marketing companies rely on sales to customers outside the network to generate profits," Smith explained. "Pyramid schemes ultimately just transfer money from new recruits to earlier participants." She recommended that people be extremely wary of any opportunity that promises big payouts for recruitment or requires a large upfront investment.

To avoid pyramid schemes and other scams, Smith advised people to be skeptical of extravagant promises, do thorough research on any company or financial opportunity, verify income sources, and never share sensitive information or money in response to an unsolicited message. The Fraud Awareness Council helps educate consumers and issues alerts on the latest scam threats.

"Fraudsters have become extremely sophisticated, but if people use common sense and listen to their instincts, many scams can be avoided," Smith said. "If something sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is." The Council's full report is available on their website.
