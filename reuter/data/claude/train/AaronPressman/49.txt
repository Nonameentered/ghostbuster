Legislators Introduce Bills to Overturn Export Limits on Encryption Technology

A bipartisan group of legislators in both the House and Senate introduced bills this week aimed at lifting current export restrictions on encryption technology and software. The bills seek to update laws that limit the export of encryption methods and tools that provide strong cybersecurity protection. 

The House bill, titled the "Protecting Cyber Networks Act," was introduced by Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Ted Lieu (D-CA). The Senate companion bill, "The National Security Implications of Cyber Economic Policy Act," was introduced by Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ron Wyden (D-OR). Current export laws were passed in the 1990s and early 2000s and restrict exports of encryption technology above a certain strength. The legislators argue these laws are outdated and harm the ability of U.S. firms to compete in growing global cybersecurity and technology markets.

“Our current policy hampers American innovation while doing little to keep us safe,” said Rep. Lieu in a statement. “This bipartisan bill fixes that by lifting nonsensical restrictions on encryption exports. It will boost our tech sector, strengthen cybersecurity and uphold our constitutional freedoms.” 

Critics argue that loosening export controls could enable foreign governments and groups that threaten national security to access advanced encryption tools. However, supporters counter that strong encryption is already globally available from non-U.S. sources, so the existing rules only serve to hurt American technology firms.  

The bills follow years of debate around encryption policy and the challenges of balancing privacy, security and economic concerns. Past reform efforts have stalled in the face of national security arguments on both sides, but sponsors are hopeful that new threats and available technologies may prompt reconsideration. The bills were referred to committees for consideration and markup before potential consideration by each full chamber. President [Current President Name] has not yet indicated whether he supports the legislation. With debate around cyber policy intensifying, the bills could help shape an issue that is critical for digital security and trade in the 21st century.
