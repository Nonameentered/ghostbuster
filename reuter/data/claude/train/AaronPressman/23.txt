Federal Reserve Votes to Allow U.S. Banks to Increase Securities Underwriting Activities, Adding Pressure on Congress for Reform 

The Federal Reserve voted today to ease regulations limiting the ability of large banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to underwrite securities like stocks and bonds. In a 3-2 vote, the Fed approved a rule change that will allow banks to increase the amount of securities underwriting business they can conduct. 

The move adds pressure on Congress to pass more sweeping reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 law passed in the wake of the financial crisis that placed restrictions on riskier bank activities. The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have pushed to revise Dodd-Frank, arguing that regulations are restricting economic growth.

Supporters say allowing banks more freedom in securities underwriting will boost capital markets and support the economy. But critics argue it risks repeating the mistakes that led to the financial crisis, in which banks packaged risky mortgages into securities that fueled the housing bubble.

"The Federal Reserve's action today is reckless deregulation that puts the stability of our financial system at risk,” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a group that advocates for stricter Wall Street oversight. “It is only a matter of time before there is another crisis.”

The Fed's rule change raises the limit on the amount of assets a bank can devote to "dealer activities" like underwriting securities for clients from 3% of a bank's tier 1 capital to 5%. The Fed estimates the increase could allow up to $40 billion in additional dealer activity. The bulk of that would likely accrue to the largest Wall Street banks.

Supporters of the rule change argue that it simply provides more flexibility for well-capitalized banks and that securities underwriting activities are less risky than the trading and derivatives that led to huge losses during the crisis. The Fed also put some restrictions on the riskiest types of securities underwriting in the rule.

The close vote highlights divisions at the Fed, with regulators appointed by Democratic administrations dissenting. The vote adds to pressures on Congress as proposals to revise Dodd-Frank fight their way through an evenly divided Senate. Changes to weaken bank rules face strong opposition, meaning that the Fed's move to loosen securities underwriting limits may be one of the few revisions to Wall Street oversight that advances in the short term.
