FCC Tentatively Decides Against Imposing Fees on Internet Service Providers for Local Telephone Line Use  

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) today issued a tentative decision to not require broadband internet service providers to pay additional fees to local telephone companies for access to infrastructure that runs phone service. 

Local exchange carriers, like AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink, charge internet service providers like Comcast and Charter Communications monthly per-line fees to use infrastructure that provides landline phone service to connect to their customers. These infrastructure access charges generate $12 billion a year for the local telephone companies.

In a statement, the FCC said they have "tentatively concluded" that these fees should not be extended to apply to broadband internet access services. The agency argues that unlike telephone service, broadband internet is an information service, not a telecommunications service. Therefore, the FCC claims broadband internet service providers cannot be considered telecommunications carriers under federal law.

"Broadband Internet access service is not functionally the same as telephone exchange access service,” the FCC statement reads. “Among other things, broadband Internet access service does not provide the capability to transmit information between network termination points, nor is network transmission a necessary and integral part of broadband Internet access service."

If finalized, the decision would be a win for cable and telecommunications companies that offer broadband like Comcast, Charter, and Verizon. But local telephone companies argue it will cut into revenue they rely on to maintain and upgrade existing infrastructure. 

Critics argue broadband providers should still contribute to infrastructure costs, even if the services differ. “This FCC tentatively embraces form over substance to let some of the biggest companies off the hook,” said Gigi Sohn, counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. 

The agency will allow further public comment on the tentative decision before voting on a final ruling. The FCC's two Republican commissioners signaled support for the direction of the tentative decision. The agency's lone Democrat expressed some skepticism about the approach.

In its 2017 net neutrality repeal order, the FCC had promised to evaluate the infrastructure fee issue in a future proceeding. Today’s tentative decision delivers on that promise and aims to provide clarity in how companies should pay for shared use of broadband infrastructure. Supporters argue it could drive more investment in next-generation networks to benefit consumers. Opponents counter it favors large incumbents at the expense of fair competition. The final outcome of this long-running dispute is still to be determined.
