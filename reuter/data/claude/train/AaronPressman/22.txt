International Task Force Proposes Expansion of Internet Addresses with New Top Level Domains

An international task force of government and industry stakeholders has proposed expanding the number of top-level internet domains (TLDs) as a way to spur online innovation and competition. The Independent Review Process Group recommended opening up generic TLDs beyond the current 22 in order to provide more options for website addresses and enable new online identities and communities. 

Generic TLDs are the letters to the right of the dot in web addresses, such as .com, .org and .edu. The task force suggested gradually increasing the number of these TLDs to "at least 500" over the next few years. New TLDs could include brand names, locations and communities. For example, .nyc, .music or .canon could become available for New York City, the music industry or Canon Inc. Proponents argue this would provide more memorable and intuitive domain names and allow for niche online identities.

However, critics argue dramatically increasing the number of TLDs could lead to consumer confusion and abuse. Trademark owners worry about new opportunities for cyber squatting and increased costs to defensively register their brand names across many new domain spaces. There are also concerns that new TLDs could fragment the internet and make it harder to find content. The task force acknowledged these concerns and recommended implementing new TLDs slowly while reserving certain names to avoid confusion with existing TLDs and allowing trademark owners first access to their brands.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the nonprofit that oversees domain names and IP addresses, will review the task force recommendations and vote on implementation. If approved, ICANN will start accepting applications for new generic TLDs as early as next year. Brands, communities and entrepreneurs will be able to apply for the new domain names and operate them, potentially providing more choice and competition to the domain name system. However, effects on consumers and trademark holders remain uncertain if new TLDs are not introduced carefully and judiciously according to experts. The coming months will determine whether the internet is ready to open the floodgates for hundreds of new domain name extensions.
