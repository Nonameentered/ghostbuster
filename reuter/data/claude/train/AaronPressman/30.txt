Federal Credit Unions Hope Supreme Court Will Hear Case Against Banks 

The National Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU) is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its case against major banks regarding faulty overdraft fees. The NAFCU filed a petition last week asking the Supreme Court to review a decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit alleging banks intentionally reordered customer transactions to maximize overdraft fees.

The lawsuit argued that banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo manipulated customer transactions for years by reordering them from largest to smallest amounts rather than in chronological order. This practice allowed the banks to drain accounts more quickly and charge more overdraft fees. The NAFCU argued this was deceptive and unfair to consumers.

A district court initially dismissed the case in 2018. The appeals court upheld that dismissal in September, saying the National Credit Union Administration had failed to prove the banks’ practices caused actual harm to the credit unions. The NAFCU is now turning to the Supreme Court in a last effort to revive the case.

“These unfair and deceptive overdraft fee practices by Wall Street mega-banks directly harm working families and students,” said Dan Berger, president and CEO of NAFCU. “We hope the Supreme Court will take up this important issue that impacts consumers nationwide.”

The banks have denied any wrongdoing and argued their overdraft fee policies were clearly disclosed to customers. A spokesperson for Chase said the bank’s practices are “designed to be fair, clear and transparent.” Industry groups argue the issue should be addressed through legislation, not litigation.

If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case, it could have major implications for how banks charge overdraft fees and handle customer accounts. A ruling against the banks may force changes to their overdraft fee practices and could open them up to additional lawsuits. The court receives about 7,000-8,000 petitions each year and only hears oral arguments in about 100-150 cases. The NAFCU hopes their case makes the cut.
