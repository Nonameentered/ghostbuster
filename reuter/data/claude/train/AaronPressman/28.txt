Chairman Jim Leach introduces bill to reshape banking and financial regulation in the US 

Congressman Jim Leach (R-IA), Chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, introduced sweeping legislation today to overhaul banking and financial regulations in the United States. The "Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999" seeks to modernize decades-old laws and remove barriers between different types of financial services companies in order to promote more competition and ultimately benefit consumers. 

“Our current system is a hodge-podge of outdated regulations and statutes that fail to recognize the realities of today’s dynamic financial services marketplace,” said Leach in a statement. “This bill will tear down artificial walls between banks, securities firms, and insurance companies. By allowing diversified financial services firms to better compete and offer consumers more choices, this modernization will spur greater efficiency, innovation, and economy in the financial services industry.”

The centerpiece of the legislation would repeal portions of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, a law passed in the wake of the Great Depression that separated commercial and investment banking. The repeal of Glass-Steagall would allow banks, brokerages, and insurance firms to affiliate and combine into large financial holding companies that could offer their customers a more complete range of services.  

Critics argue that dismantling Glass-Steagall could increase risk in the banking system and lead to conflicts of interest where firms push their customers into investment and insurance products for their own gain. However, supporters counter that adequate safeguards and regulations are in place to prevent these concerns while also noting that US financial firms are already at a competitive disadvantage against foreign firms operating with more flexible rules.

The legislation also addresses a number of other priorities including modernizing the Community Reinvestment Act, streamlining banking rules, and allowing financial firms to operate more branches nationwide. The bill now advances for consideration before the full House of Representatives. If passed by the House, it faces an uphill battle in the Senate where a number of lawmakers have expressed reservations about fully repealing Glass-Steagall. Compromise and amendments may be required to advance any version of the bill through Congress for the President's signature into law.
