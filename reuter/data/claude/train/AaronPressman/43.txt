Internet access providers express concern over potential havoc Congress could wreak on cyberspace  

Major Internet service providers and technology companies have come out strongly against proposed legislation in Congress that could grant the government broad new powers over cyberspace.   

The legislation, called the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), is intended to improve cybersecurity by making it easier for companies to share information about data breaches and hacking attempts with government agencies like the Department of Homeland Security. However, critics argue the bill is dangerously vague and could allow agencies to monitor Internet traffic and access personal information with little oversight.

In a letter to lawmakers this week, a coalition including AT&T, Comcast, Google, and Microsoft said that while the goal of improving cybersecurity is laudable, CISA could enable "monitoring of citizens' online activities and communications" and "undermine privacy, data security and innovation." 

The letter warned that certain provisions in the bill are "extremely broad"  and could be interpreted to allow intelligence and law enforcement agencies to "conduct warrantless searches of private Internet communications and take actions that could undermine cybersecurity." The companies called on legislators to amend the bill to install more privacy and civil liberties safeguards.

Supporters of CISA argue that the bill contains provisions specifically prohibiting the government from accessing private user data or monitoring Internet activity. They say opponents are exaggerating the bill's reach and that information sharing about cyber threats is urgently needed to allow the government and private sector to better protect against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks from hackers, cybercriminals and foreign nations.

The debate in Congress is the latest in an ongoing battle over how to balance the need to improve cybersecurity with the need to protect citizens' privacy in the digital age. There are calls for both strengthening government efforts on cybersecurity as well as reigning in government surveillance programs exposed by whistleblowers like Edward Snowden. The outcome of this debate could reshape the relationship between government surveillance and technological innovation in the U.S. for years to come.
