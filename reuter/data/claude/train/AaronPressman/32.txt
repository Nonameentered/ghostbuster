Internet Users Pose Little Threat to Phone System, Study Finds 

A new study from researchers at Stanford University found that increased internet usage poses little threat to the traditional telephone network infrastructure in the United States. The study analyzed network traffic and usage patterns over the past decade to determine the impact of the rise of streaming media, social networking, and other bandwidth-intensive internet applications on the phone network. The researchers found no evidence that growth in internet traffic has significantly hampered the ability of major phone carriers to provide reliable phone service to customers.

The study is good news for the major telecommunications companies in the U.S., like AT&T and Verizon, who were concerned that their aging telephone networks would struggle under the increasing demand for bandwidth from internet services. The phone system was built decades ago to handle a certain level of voice calls and data transmissions, but the explosion of the commercial internet in the 1990s and 2000s introduced new demands that the network was not originally designed for. Industry experts worried that the phone infrastructure would need major upgrades to continue to function properly under these new pressures.

However, the Stanford researchers found that telecom companies have been able to adapt their networks with relative ease to the rise of the internet. They discovered a roughly 15-20% increase in overall network traffic since 2010 due to more people streaming video, using social networks, and engaging in other bandwidth-heavy internet activities. But they found no evidence that this increase in traffic has taxed the abilities of telecom networks to also carry telephone calls as reliably as in the past.   

"The doomsday predictions of the telephone network's demise have not come to pass," said Professor Marvin Sirbu, the lead author of the study, in an interview. "Our research found that phone companies have been remarkably adept at managing and scaling their networks to keep up with internet demand while still prioritizing telephone calls andPlain Old Telephone Service. The techniques they have used should help ensure the health of the phone network for years to come."  

The researchers said phone companies have several technical means for managing their networks that have allowed them to juggle internet traffic and telephone calls. For example, they can adjust the bandwidth allocated for each kind of data transmission and give higher priority to telephone calls. They have also invested in more advanced tools to monitor network traffic in real time and make routing adjustments on the fly to avoid congestion. With continued innovation, researchers believe phone networks are well positioned for whatever new demands come their way in the future.
