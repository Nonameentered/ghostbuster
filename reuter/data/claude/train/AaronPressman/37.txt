Global Research Group to Issue Encryption Policy Guidelines, But Controversial Issues Omitted

The International Society for Cyber Policy, an influential research organization that provides policy guidance to governments and corporations worldwide, announced today that it will release new guidelines next week on developing encryption regulations. However, the guidelines will not take a stance on some of the thorniest issues around encryption policy, including whether governments should have special access to encrypted communications for law enforcement purposes.

The chairman of the organization's Encryption Policy Working Group, Dr. Anna Chen, told reporters that the group reached consensus on several principles but ultimately decided to avoid specific recommendations on controversial topics where there were irreconcilable differences of opinion. "Encryption policy needs to balance privacy, security, and public safety considerations, and there are good arguments on multiple sides of these complex issues," Chen said. "Rather than suggest one-size-fits-all solutions, we aimed for guidelines that recognize the nuances and trade-offs involved."

Supporters of strong encryption praised the organization for affirming the importance of encryption for cybersecurity and data privacy but criticized the omission of recommendations against government backdoors and encryption workarounds.  "Encryption that is purposefully weakened or limited is not encryption at all,” said the CEO of a major cybersecurity firm. “The guidelines fail to grapple with the realities of how encryption technology works and miss an opportunity to take a principled stand in favor of uncompromised encryption." A digital civil liberties group warned the guidelines could encourage some governments to pursue encryption policies that undermine civil rights and freedoms.

Government officials expressed disappointment that the guidance does not provide a framework for lawful and regulated access to encrypted data when necessary for investigations or counterterrorism efforts. The deputy attorney general in one country suggested that "an organization focused on cyber policy should not shy away from advocating for reasonable restrictions to prevent the lawful use of encryption from thwarting the enforcement of the law.” The organization said its guidelines aim to reflect the interests and input of stakeholders from different countries, sectors, and disciplines around the world.
