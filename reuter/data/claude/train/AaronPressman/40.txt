Congress and Industry Representatives Agree on Scrapping Glass-Steagall Act for Financial Reform, but Details are Controversial

Washington, D.C. – In a rare show of bipartisan unity, leaders from Congress and the financial services industry announced today that they have agreed on the broad outlines of a financial reform proposal that would repeal portions of the Glass-Steagall Act. The 1933 law erected barriers between investment and commercial banking in the wake of the Great Depression. Repealing sections of Glass-Steagall has been a long-sought goal for major U.S. banks seeking greater flexibility in their operations.  

However, while there is agreement on scrapping Glass-Steagall, the details of the reform proposal remain controversial and unclear. There are disputes over how much new regulation is necessary to prevent future financial crises, limit risk in the system, and protect consumers. The announcement of an agreement was light on specifics, with much of the details yet to be hammered out through further negotiations. 

“We have built a bipartisan consensus around the idea that the financial system needs comprehensive reform to limit excessive risk taking and prevent future taxpayer-funded bailouts,” said Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Chris Smith (D-Conn.). “Modernizing outdated laws like Glass-Steagall is a key part of that effort.”

The financial services industry praised the agreement as an important step toward reform. “We support the effort to establish a 21st century regulatory framework that allows U.S. banks to serve customers across traditional business lines,” said American Bankers Association CEO Lisa Stevenson in a statement. 

However, some financial reform advocates argue the proposal does not go far enough and are concerned it will roll back regulations too far. “Repealing Glass-Steagall will not promote economic stability and growth,” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a group that advocates for stricter financial regulation. “Deregulation has proven disastrous and we need to be adding new rules to Wall Street, not removing existing ones,” Kelleher said.

Questions also remain around proposals to limit risky trading activities by banks and implementing stricter consumer protections. Powerful banking lobbies are pushing back against portions of the reform plan that could curb profits. The thorny details will need to be addressed for the reform proposal to move forward in Congress, where it faces an uncertain future. Both Senate Banking Committee Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) expressed a desire to reach a bipartisan consensus, but acknowledged there are many unsettled issues in the reform plan.  

In summary, while lawmakers and financial firms have agreed on ending the separation of commercial and investment banking created by the Glass-Steagall Act, the details of the broader financial reform proposal remain unsettled and controversial. The coming months of negotiations around the proposal will determine whether Congress is able to pass the most sweeping update to financial rules since the Great Recession.
