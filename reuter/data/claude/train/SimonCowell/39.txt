General Accident PLC reports fall in profits despite record final quarter in 1996 

General Accident PLC, one of the UK's leading insurance companies, reported a decline in annual profits today despite achieving record results in the final quarter of 1996.

Profits before tax fell by 17% to £301 million for the full year compared to £362 million in 1995. The drop came despite profits of £101 million in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly profits in the company's history. 

The fall in annual profits was attributed to several one-off charges including costs relating to the acquisition of Guardian Royal Exchange. Higher investment returns and an improvement in underwriting also helped boost profits in the final quarter. For the full year, net investment income rose by 12% to £1.4 billion.

Brian Agnew, CEO of General Accident, said "While the one-off costs impacted our annual results, our underlying performance remained strong. Our Direct Line insurance business continued to grow at a rapid pace, and we achieved record profits in our final quarter."

General Accident is the third largest motor insurer in the UK and also provides household, travel and commercial insurance. The company employs around 18,000 people and has over 7 million customers. In recent years, General Accident has expanded into Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but the UK market still accounts for 80% of premium income.

The results come amid a period of significant consolidation in the insurance sector. General Accident acquired Guardian Royal Exchange in 1996, making it the largest merger in the history of the UK insurance industry. However, analysts say there is potential for further mergers as companies seek to gain scale and new distribution channels.

General Accident's shares fell 2% in early trading following the results announcement. But analysts said the longer-term outlook for the company remains positive, given its strong brand and customer base in the UK insurance market.
