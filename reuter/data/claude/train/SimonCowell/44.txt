Legal & General reports double digit rise in profits and strong dividend growth prospects 

Legal & General, the British life insurance and asset management company, reported a 10% rise in profits for the full year 2019. The firm’s operating profits rose to £2.1 billion, up from £1.9 billion in 2018. Legal & General attributed the increased profits to strong performance across all its divisions, especially its institutional retirement business. 

The firm also announced a 7% increase in its total dividend for the year. The full year dividend rose to 16.42 pence per share, up from 15.35 pence per share last year. Legal & General has a long track record of consistent dividend growth, with its dividend increasing every year for the last 34 years. The firm stated that it is committed to continuing to grow shareholder dividends in a sustainable way going forward.

Legal & General’s largest division, Legal & General Retirement, saw operating profits rise 8% to £1 billion. The firm benefited from increased volumes of annuity sales to individuals and growth in its bulk annuity business, where it takes on the pension liabilities of corporations. Legal & General is the UK’s largest annuity provider and has ambitions to significantly expand its presence in the bulk annuity market.

The firm’s investment management arm, LGIM, also contributed to the improved results. LGIM is one of the largest asset managers in the UK, with over £1 trillion in assets under management. LGIM’s profits rose 15% to £299 million, driven by increasing fee income from strong investment returns and new mandates. LGIM continues to attract strong inflows into its range of mutual funds and ETFs from investors around the world.

Legal & General’s CEO Nigel Wilson praised the results and expressed optimism about the firm’s prospects in 2020 and beyond. "We have delivered excellent results in 2019...We head into 2020 with positive momentum across all our businesses. Interest rates and markets may present headwinds, but L&G is strongly positioned for growth owing to our leading capabilities and platforms in attractive markets.”

The results highlight the strength and resilience of Legal & General’s business model, with multiple divisions contributing to its financial success and ability to generate attractive and growing dividends for shareholders. Despite potential challenges from lower interest rates and market volatility, Legal & General appears well-positioned to continue its track record of solid performance and dividend growth. Overall, this was an impressive set of results from one of the UK’s leading financial institutions.
