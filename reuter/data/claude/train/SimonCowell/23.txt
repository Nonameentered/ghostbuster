SBC Warburg sets deadline for potential bidders to sign confidentiality agreements in sale of Scottish Amicable

SBC Warburg, the investment bank handling the sale of Scottish Amicable, has set a deadline of Friday for interested parties to sign confidentiality agreements to gain access to the data room. Sources close to the deal said initial expressions of interest in Scottish Amicable, one of Britain's oldest mutual life insurers, have been submitted from a range of insurance companies, private equity firms and overseas buyers. 

Scottish Amicable was put up for sale last month by its mutual member owners. The sale process is expected to value the company at between £500 million to £1 billion. Scottish Amicable has more than 2 million policyholders and over £35 billion of funds under management.

Bidders signing the confidentiality agreements will gain access to detailed financial information about Scottish Amicable to help inform their formal offers. Second-round bids are expected in early October. SBC Warburg hopes to sign an exclusive deal with one party later that month.

The insurance sector has seen a flurry of consolidation in recent years amid sluggish economic growth and lower interest rates. Several mutual have been involved in mergers or have demutualized and listed on the stock exchange. Analysts view Scottish Amicable as an attractive target given its large customer base, reputation and brand.

The eventual sale of Scottish Amicable is expected to generate sizable fees for SBC Warburg and legal advisers working on the deal. Sources said the interest from private equity firms is focused on using Scottish Amicable as a platform for further acquisitions in financial services, especially in insurance and asset management. Overseas companies from countries such as Japan and Canada are keen to gain a foothold in the UK market.

Some analysts believe Scottish Amicable could pursue a stock market listing if the bids from trade buyers underwhelm. However, that is seen as a last resort given the preference of management to sell to an established industry player that would safeguard the future of the business. Policyholder interests will reportedly be prioritized to ensure buyers have a strong commitment to fair customer outcomes.

The deadline set by SBC Warburg puts pressure on interested parties to clarify their position on Scottish Amicable ahead of negotiations around legal terms in the share purchase agreement. More details around the bids and frontrunners to acquire Scottish Amicable should emerge over the coming weeks as the auction heats up towards an exciting finale.
