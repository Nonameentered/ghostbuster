Willis Corroon Reports Rise in 1996 Profits, but Warns of Overcapacity and Falling Rates in the Insurance Industry

London-based insurance broker Willis Corroon reported a 12% rise in 1996 pre-tax profits in its annual results today. However, the company warned that the insurance industry continues to face significant challenges from overcapacity and falling premium rates.

Willis Corroon's pre-tax profits rose to £87.4 million last year from £78.2 million in 1995. Revenues increased 14% to £363 million. The results were driven by organic growth in all regions and business lines, as well as contributions from acquisitions made last year. 

However, in a statement accompanying the results, Willis Corroon's Chairman Brian Marwood cautioned that “soft market conditions persist in the insurance industry, with excess capital and competition leading to falling rates in almost all areas. Although Willis Corroon continues to outperform the market through focused diversification, we are not immune to the wider pricing environment.”

The soft insurance market refers to a period in which there is too much capital chasing too little premium volume, causing rates and profit margins to fall. The insurance industry has experienced soft market conditions since the early 1990s, though there were temporary firming periods in 1993 and 1995. Many analysts do not foresee a broad-based shift to a firm market with rising premium rates for at least another 1-2 years.

Willis Corroon has pursued an aggressive diversification strategy to counter soft market pressures, expanding into new geographies, products, and services. Its three business platforms span 308 offices in 58 countries. The company sees particularly strong growth opportunities in employee benefits, marine insurance, financial and professional liability, and North America. However, even in diversified and high-growth areas, the company notes that excess capital continues to depress premium rates.  

Continued low interest rates have also made it difficult for insurance companies to generate investment income, putting further strain on profits. In response, insurers have sought to cut costs through consolidation and restructuring. There were 566 insurance mergers and acquisitions in 1996, up 15% from the previous year, according to industry research firm Insurance Information Institute.

While a prolonged soft market threatens insurance industry profitability and growth, consumers and businesses that buy insurance benefit from very competitive rates and broader coverage. For Willis Corroon, overcapacity means that demand for its brokerage and risk advisory services remains strong, even as the company must work harder to negotiate adequate premium levels on behalf of clients. The company's performance in 1996 demonstrates its resilience, but as Mr. Marwood noted, Willis Corroon is still exposed to the challenging conditions that pervade the insurance industry at large.
