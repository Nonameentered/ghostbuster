Three companies remain in the running for Scottish Amicable takeover bid 

Three major financial services companies have emerged as frontrunners in the bidding war for Scottish Amicable, the UK-based life insurance and pensions provider. Aviva, Prudential, and Standard Life Aberdeen have all submitted preliminary bids for the £3.2 billion takeover of Scottish Amicable, according to anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

Scottish Amicable announced last month that it was putting itself up for sale after facing increased pressure from activist investors to boost shareholder returns. The company has a market capitalization of £3.2 billion but has struggled in recent years due to low interest rates and increased competition. Its share price has declined nearly 25% over the past 12 months. 

Aviva, the largest general insurer in the UK, is seen as the leading bidder at this stage. It has been pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy under its new CEO Amanda Blanc, who took over in January with a mandate to reinvigorate growth. Acquiring Scottish Amicable would boost Aviva’s assets under management by nearly 10% and increase its market share in pensions and retirement savings plans. However, some analysts have raised concerns over potential anti-trust issues given Aviva’s existing dominant position.

Prudential, the London-based life insurer, is also keen to acquire Scottish Amicable to accelerate its pivot towards asset management and retirement savings. Prudential has faced headwinds in some of its key Asian markets recently and is looking to diversify its revenue streams. The deal would be the largest acquisition for Prudential CEO Mike Wells since he took over in 2015. However, Prudential may face pressure from some investors over the deal price given the company’s weak share price performance over the past year.

Standard Life Aberdeen is the only non-insurer bidding for Scottish Amicable. The investment management group has been reshaping its portfolio since the merger between Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management in 2017. Acquiring Scottish Amicable would provide Standard Life Aberdeen with a substantial books of pensions and life insurance assets to invest, though some analysts question whether it would face more challenges integrating the operations. 

Bids from Aviva, Prudential and Standard Life Aberdeen are non-binding at this stage. Scottish Amicable’s board will evaluate the bids and determine a shortlist of companies to proceed to the next round. A final decision and takeover deal is expected within 3 to 4 months, though there is no guarantee of a deal if prices do not meet Scottish Amicable’s valuation expectation. The takeover battle for Scottish Amicable highlights the pressures facing UK life insurers as they grapple with rising customer and investor demands amid a prolonged period of low interest rates. Consolidation in the industry is expected to continue accelerating in the coming years.
