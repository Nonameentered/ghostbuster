Three companies submit final offers for Scottish Amicable in hotly-pursued takeover battle

Three major corporations have submitted final takeover offers for Scottish Amicable, one of Scotland's oldest life insurance companies, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The offers set the stage for an auction over the coming months that will determine the future of the 188-year-old insurer.

Phoenix Group Holdings, Swiss Re, and Germany's Allianz are vying to acquire Scottish Amicable and its 3 million customers. The company is currently owned by a consortium of investors that took it private 15 years ago. However, they are now looking to exit their investment. The high interest in Scottish Amicable illustrates the appeal of its steady cash flow and 3 million customers in an era of ultralow interest rates.

Phoenix Group, a fast-growing life insurer, has teamed up with private equity firm CVC Capital Partners on an offer that could value Scottish Amicable at between £2 billion to £3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Swiss Re and Allianz have submitted their own bids at similar valuation levels, the people said.

The bidders appreciate Scottish Amicable’s focus on retirement savings, life insurance and wealth management. Those highly recurring businesses have proven resilient and generated substantial excess capital even in times of market stress, the people said. Swiss Re and Allianz also like that Scottish Amicable's core operations are centered in one region, reducing currency risk, they added.

A deal would provide an opportunity for the buyer to generate cost savings by consolidating IT systems and cutting overlap. The winning bidder could also use Scottish Amicable's distribution network to sell its other product lines, the people said. However, a takeover also presents risks, including potential customer defections if clients are unhappy with the new owner.

The bidders now await a decision on the final round of offers from Scottish Amicable's board and shareholders. An agreement and announcement could come in the next few months if talks proceed smoothly. The losing bidders are unlikely to make a counteroffer given the competitive process run by Goldman Sachs, the people said.

Shares of Phoenix Group rose as much as 3% on the news, signaling investor optimism about its growth prospects following such a large acquisition. Allianz and Swiss Re shares were mostly unchanged. Representatives for Phoenix Group, Allianz, Swiss Re and CVC declined to comment. Scottish Amicable didn't immediately return a request for comment.
