British Insurers to Require Disclosure of Genetic Test Results for New Life Insurance Policies  

London, UKâ€”The insurance industry trade group the Association of British Insurers (ABI) announced today that life insurers in the UK will begin requiring the disclosure of genetic test results when individuals apply for new life insurance policies. The new rules will go into effect starting January 1, 2021.  

The decision to require genetic test result disclosure is aimed at preventing individuals from withholding information that could be relevant in determining life insurance premiums and payments. However, the move has been criticized by consumer advocacy groups as discriminatory and a violation of individuals' privacy regarding their personal health information.   

The ABI represents over 300 UK insurance companies that provide life insurance, as well as insurance for homes, vehicles, travel, and more. In a press release, the ABI stated that "requiring disclosure of relevant genetic test results allows insurers to continue providing coverage fairly and sustainably." The statement notes that life insurers may use the genetic test information to determine whether to increase premiums for certain individuals or, in some cases, deny coverage if results indicate a high likelihood of serious disease or early mortality.  

Critics argue that genetic test results are an imperfect indicator of future health and longevity. "Penalizing people for their genetics is unfair and discriminatory," said Jennifer Smith of the consumer group Privacy UK. "This policy will discourage many from undergoing potentially life-saving genetic testing and disproportionately harm minority and low-income groups who already face higher health risks."  

Patient advocacy groups also voiced concerns that the disclosure requirement violates individuals' rights regarding sensitive health information. "Your genetic data is private and personal. Forcing people to share it to qualify for life insurance is unethical," argued a spokesperson for the Genetic Alliance UK. However, the ABI policy notes that individuals are not obligated to disclose results of genetic tests performed as part of medical care and individuals who have not undergone genetic testing would not be affected.  

The debate around use of genetic data in the insurance industry extends beyond the UK. In the United States, the 2008 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits health insurers from requiring genetic test disclosures or using genetic data to determine insurance eligibility or premiums. However, GINA does not apply to life, disability or long-term care insurance. Several states have passed laws limiting the use of genetic data for life and disability insurance underwriting. But, like in the UK, consumer groups argue federal laws should be strengthened to provide individuals comprehensive protection of their genetic information.
