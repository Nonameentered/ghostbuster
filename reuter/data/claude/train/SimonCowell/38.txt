British Insurer General Accident Plc's 1996 Profits Fall by £15m Due to Stiff Competition and Severe US Weather  

General Accident Plc, one of Britain's leading general insurance groups, reported a 10% drop in pre-tax profits for 1996 due to intensifying competition and a series of costly natural disasters in the US.

Pre-tax profits fell to £145m from £160m the previous year. The decline was largely attributed to a £37m loss from US operations, compared with a profit of £17m in 1995. The losses were mainly due to hundreds of millions of dollars worth of claims related to winter storms,  floods and hurricanes like Bertha, Fran and Hortense that battered the east coast of the US last year.

The General Accident chief executive, Andrew Simms, conceded that the US performance was "very disappointing" but claimed the group was taking "vigorous action" to turn around the loss-making business. The company has restructured its US management, increased premium rates, tightened underwriting criteria and is scaling back unprofitable operations. It is pulling out of commercial property insurance and cutting 150 staff. 

The troubles in the US overshadowed improved performances in the group's main markets of Britain, Australia and Canada. UK pre-tax profits edged up 3% to £132m, while Australia and Canada also delivered increased profits. The results prompted Simms to reiterate his confidence in General Accident's strategy of focusing on personal lines and small- to medium-sized commercial business in markets where it has a leading position.

However, analysts voiced concerns about the group's relatively high exposure to competitive general insurance markets that are experiencing a squeeze on profits. Paul Thomas, an insurance analyst at stockbroker Phillips & Drew, said the 10% fall in profits was "worse than expected" and raised the possibility of job losses if market conditions do not improve. "With no let-up in sight to competition and price pressures, cost containment is the order of the day in the insurance industry," Thomas noted.

General Accident's results are the latest evidence of woes afflicting the general insurance sector. Last week, Commercial Union reported a 38% slump in 1996 pre-tax profits to £161m, blaming falling premium rates, higher taxes in the US and weather-related claims.  And in January, Royal Insurance Holdings posted a record £1.53bn loss for last year due to soaring claims costs in the US and massive write-downs.

The decline in General Accident's profits comes despite an 11% rise in net premium income to £5.28bn and a drop in the combined operating ratio - a key measure of underwriting performance - to 96.8% from 98.9%. The total dividend for the year was held unchanged at 12.3p. On the London Stock Exchange, General Accident's shares closed down 3.5 pence at 391.5 pence on the results, continuing the recent slide and valuing the group at £3.16bn.
