Britannic Assurance Accelerates Pension Mis-Selling Settlements as Profits Soar

Britannic Assurance, the UK's largest pension company, announced today that it is accelerating the settlement of long-standing pension mis-selling complaints in order to draw a line under the scandal. The move comes as the firm reported a 15% increase in annual profits to £4.2 billion, fueled by robust stock market gains. 

For over a decade, Britannic Assurance has been making compensation payments to customers who were wrongly advised to switch company pensions to personal pensions in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The practice, known as "churning," generated large commissions for advisers but often left customers with smaller pensions. There are still over 100,000 unsettled complaints outstanding.

Britannic Assurance's new CEO, Simon Thompson, pledged to resolve all the remaining churning complaints within the next 12 months. "It is time to make right the mistakes of the past," he said. "We have learned from this experience and overhauled our practices to put the customer first." The company has set aside £3 billion to cover the cost of the outstanding compensation payments and associated administration fees. 

Investor groups welcomed the news that a line would finally be drawn under the mis-selling scandal. "This has been an ugly chapter that has tarnished the reputation of the pensions industry," said Dianne Moyles of the Federation of Private Investors. "Compensating the remaining affected customers will help build trust again."

However, some consumer advocates argued that Britannic Assurance was accelerating the settlements mainly to remove the overhang on its share price. "They just want to brush this under the carpet and move on," said Brian Carr of the Consumers' Pension Rights lobby group. "Many of the remaining claimants are elderly and vulnerable people who were ripped off 30 years ago. They deserve better than a rushed settlement."

Britannic Assurance's annual results were boosted by stock market gains that increased the value of its equity and bond investments. The company also raised premiums by an average of 6% while cutting operating costs by 3% through digitization of its processes. Mr. Thompson said the new cost discipline coupled with technological improvements left the firm well positioned to benefit from future growth in the pensions market.
