Britons applying for new life insurance policies required to reveal genetic test results under new ABI policy

The Association of British Insurers announced today that applicants for new life insurance policies will be required to disclose the results of any genetic tests they have taken. The new policy will apply to all life insurance applications submitted after January 1, 2021.

The ABI, which represents 99% of the life insurance industry in the UK, said the policy change is intended to ensure fair and accurate underwriting of life insurance policies. Genetic test results provide important insights into an individual's health risks and lifespan, according to the ABI, especially tests for genes linked to diseases such as certain cancers or heart conditions. By requiring applicants to disclose genetic test results, insurers can more precisely assess overall risk and set fair premium rates.  

Consumer groups in the UK expressed concern that the new policy may discourage some individuals from taking genetic tests out of fear their results could lead to higher life insurance premiums or even policy denials. However, the ABI stated that genetic test results are only one factor among many considered in underwriting decisions and will not directly determine eligibility or premiums. Applicants will also have the right to verify the accuracy of any genetic test results they disclose before such results are used in the underwriting process.

The new policy applies only to new applications for life insurance. Individuals with existing life insurance policies will not need to disclose genetic test results, even when renewing or modifying their current policies. The ABI acknowledged concerns about privacy and discrimination and said member companies will be required to handle genetic test information confidentially as part of strict industry data protection standards. Consumer advocacy groups nonetheless warned the policy change sets a troubling precedent, even with data privacy safeguards and other protections in place.

Overall, the new policy reflects the ongoing digital transformation of the life insurance industry as underwriters gain access to ever-greater amounts of data about people's health, lifestyles, and lifespan. While artificial intelligence and algorithms are enabling more accurate risk assessments and customized premiums, they are also raising ethical questions about data use which the industry as a whole is grappling with. The ABI's policy on genetic test disclosure is the latest example of this struggle to balance the power of data with personal privacy concerns.
