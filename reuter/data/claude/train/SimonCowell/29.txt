Guardian Royal Exchange considers major acquisition in the life sector after sharp fall in 1996 profits

Guardian Royal Exchange, the UK insurance giant, is considering a major acquisition in the life insurance sector in the wake of falling profits during 1996. The company announced a pre-tax loss of £95.1m for the year, compared with a £141m profit in 1995.

The slump in profits has led Guardian’s chief executive, Tim Bleathman, to accelerate plans to diversify its business away from general insurance. Guardian currently generates 85% of profits from general insurance but aims to increase life and pensions to 30-40% of its business over the next few years. "The results highlight the volatility in our business and the need to balance this with more stable life assurance income streams,” said Bleathman. “We will look to make a substantial acquisition in the life sector during 1997, provided we can find the right opportunity at the right price."

Guardian’s results reflect a difficult year for the general insurance industry due to intense competition and severe weather conditions. The cost of natural disasters during 1996, which included floods, snowstorms and hailstones, reached £475m, compared with £100m the previous year. This squeeze on profits led Guardian to increase premium rates by 12% from January 1, 1997, which is expected to improve financial performance going forward. 

Guardian’s poor results contrast with stronger performances from its main competitors, including Royal Sun Alliance, Commercial Union and Norwich Union. However, analysts believe the compulsory increases in car insurance rates this year will benefit the entire sector. “The general insurance market is firming up and the substantial price rises recently announced should have a significant impact on profits throughout 1997 and beyond,” said James Richards, analyst at Barclays Stockbrokers.

Guardian’s shares have underperformed the market by 10% over the past year due to uncertainty over reserve levels and concerns over its small life business. However, Bleathman remains confident in the group’s long term strategy of diversifying from general insurance and believes the markets will reward the group's performance in 1998 and beyond. “We have endured a difficult year but we are taking decisive action to strengthen our business, both by improving underwriting in our general insurance operations and investing inlife assurance, where the growth prospects are stronger.” said Bleathman.

With a strong capital base and resources for acquisitions, Guardian appears well placed to take advantage of any opportunities to expand into the life insurance sector over the coming year. If successful, this may help address the imbalance in its business and provide a platform for improved results and shareholder returns in the future.
