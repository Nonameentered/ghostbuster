NatWest Group Launches NatWest Wealth Management to Tap into Private Banking and Investment Markets 

NatWest Group, one of the largest banking and financial services companies in the UK, today announced the launch of NatWest Wealth Management, a new division focused on private banking and investment management services. NatWest Wealth Management will consolidate the group's existing wealth management, private banking, and investment management units under one brand.

The new division will have over 3,000 employees and £250 billion in assets under management, making it one of the largest wealth managers in the UK. "By bringing our expertise across private banking, investment management, and wealth planning together under one brand, we aim to provide best-in-class service to help our customers grow and manage their wealth," said NatWest Group CEO Alison Rose.

NatWest Wealth Management will have two main business areas:

•Private Banking will provide banking, credit, investment management, and wealth planning services for high-net-worth individuals and families. It will operate under the well-established brands of Coutts, Adam & Company, and Drummonds. 

• Investment Management will offer investment products and services to private investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients. It will include NatWest Invest, Jupiter Asset Management, and other investment brands under NatWest Group.

"We have a long and prestigious history of serving wealthy individuals, families, and institutions," said David Durlacher, CEO of NatWest Wealth Management. "As markets become more complex, our high-quality wealth management expertise and solutions have never been in greater demand."

The launch of NatWest Wealth Management comes amid growing competition in the UK private banking and wealth management sectors. By consolidating its brands and services under a single division, NatWest Group aims to gain greater scale and efficiency to better serve its clients and strengthen its position in the market. NatWest Wealth Management will begin operations in early 2020.
