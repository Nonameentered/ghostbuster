Financial Regulator Criticizes Slow Progress in Pensions Mis-Selling Compensation in Britain

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Britain's financial regulator, has strongly criticized major banks and insurance companies for delays in compensating customers who were mis-sold pension products. In a report published today, the FCA said less than half the expected compensation has been paid out so far, even though the process has been underway for over two years.

The compensation scheme was set up in 2016 to provide redress to customers who were wrongly advised to cash in their final salary pensions and move their money into other investments with high fees. It is estimated that over 100,000 people may have been victims of such mis-selling between 1988 and 2017. The FCA told firms they must complete the review and payout process by June 2019, but at the current rate of progress that deadline will not be met.

Only six firms are actively reviewing cases and compensating customers, despite the fact that over 30 companies were identified as involved in pension mis-selling. According to the FCA, only 41% of expected payouts have been made so far, worth a total of £2.2 billion. The full bill for the compensation scheme is projected to reach £9 billion. The major banks Lloyds and HSBC have completed less than a fifth of their cases. Some smaller financial advisors have made almost no progress at all.

The Chief Executive of the FCA Andrew Bailey said the delays were "completely unacceptable" and the firms concerned have "no excuses" for their lack of progress. He said the FCA may take additional regulatory action if the pace does not improve rapidly. Victims groups argued the delays are causing further detriment and hardship to those already suffering from poor financial advice. The opposition Labour party called on the government to intervene directly to ensure customers receive the compensation they are owed without any further delay.

The slow progress is a further blow to the reputation of Britain's financial services sector, which has been plagued by a series of mis-selling and misconduct scandals in recent years. The delays also call into question the effectiveness of the FCA in holding firms to account and achieving fair outcomes for consumers. The pensions mis-selling debacle is one of the largest in British financial history, and compensation payments may now drag on for several more years due to continued sluggishness.
