Norwich Union Policyholders to Receive Free Shares Worth £5bn in Flotation Plan

Norwich Union, the UK's biggest insurer, announced plans today to distribute free shares worth up to £5 billion to its policyholders as part of its proposed stock market flotation this year.

The plan would see policyholders receive free shares worth 10% of the company's estimated market value of £50 billion. Norwich Union has not announced an exact date for the listing but is expected to float shares during the fourth quarter of this year. If successful, the offering would be one of the largest flotations in London's history. 

Norwich Union has over 13 million policyholders in the UK and hopes the move will strengthen its relationship with customers ahead of the planned flotation. The free shares plan will apply to policyholders who have been with the firm since before the end of 2017.

Charles Postlethwaite, Chief Executive of Norwich Union's parent firm Aviva plc, said: "We believe giving policyholders a stake in the business is the right thing to do as we prepare to list Norwich Union. They have been loyal customers over many years and deserve to share in our success as we move forward as an independent company."

Aviva acquired Norwich Union in 2000 but announced plans last year to separate and float the business, allowing it to focus on international markets. Aviva will retain a minority stake in Norwich Union after the flotation. Some analysts have questioned whether giving away such a large block of shares is in the best interests of Aviva's shareholders, even if it does help market the offering. However, Norwich Union believes it will motivate policyholders to stay with the firm over the long run.

Norwich Union is the largest motor and home insurer in the UK, providing coverage to one in three households. Despite a highly competitive market, it has built market share through aggressive pricing and advertising. The firm reported profits of £1.2 billion last year on revenue of £10.7 billion. 

If approved, eligible policyholders will receive shares in Norwich Union within four to six weeks of the listing. They will be free to keep or sell the shares as they wish once floated on the stock exchange. For policyholders, it could be a chance to benefit from the success and growth of a company most already know well. For Norwich Union, it is an opportunity to launch onto the public markets with the backing of millions of its most loyal customers.
