Guardian Royal Exchange Plc reports sharp fall in trading profits for 1996 due to competition and bad weather in US and UK  

Guardian Royal Exchange Plc, the UK-based insurance and financial services company, reported a substantial fall in trading profits and earnings in its full year results today. Pre-tax profits fell 32% to £264 million from £388 million the previous year, on "very competitive market conditions and adverse weather events in the US and UK during the year," according to a statement from the company.

The decline in profits was driven by a decrease in underwriting profits in GRX's general insurance business, down 44% from £265 million to £149 million. The company attributed much of this drop to competitive pressure on premium rates in the UK personal and commercial insurance markets, as well as claims related to Hurricane Bertha in the US and winter storms in both countries. GRX's life and pensions business also saw profits fall 9% to £138 million.  

GRX's chief executive David Woodward said "1996 was a difficult year, with profits materially impacted by the effects of intense competition and severe weather events, as well as continued restructuring costs." However, he noted that the company had made "good progress" on reducing expenses and improving efficiency. GRX cut over 2,000 jobs in 1996 as part of a restructuring program aimed at saving £250 million annually. The company also raised £500 million in a rights issue, using the proceeds to pay off debt and strengthen its capital base.  

Despite the profit decline, GRX increased its total dividend for the year by 3% to 56.4 pence per share. The company said it is cautiously optimistic about prospects for 1997. Mr. Woodward stated, "We expect market conditions will remain challenging, but we believe we are competitively well positioned for future opportunities, supported by a stronger capital structure."

GRX's share price fell 2.8% to 1027 pence following the results announcement, reflecting investor disappointment with the sharp fall in profits. The company's share price declined nearly 20% over the course of 1996, underperforming the broader UK market. Analysts said the full impact of GRX's restructuring efforts and capital strengthening may not be felt until 1998 or later. The company faces significant work ahead to turnaround performance in the face of a difficult marketplace.
