Royal & Sun Alliance Reports Lower Results, Seeks Shareholder Approval for Share Buyback

UK insurer Royal & Sun Alliance reported lower half-year results today as it continues to streamline its business. Pre-tax profits fell 4% to £367 million in the first six months of the year compared to the same period last year. The company cited challenging market conditions and higher than expected costs from natural catastrophes as negatively impacting its results.  

Royal & Sun Alliance is in the process of exiting over 30 countries to focus on its core UK and Canadian markets. The company hopes that simplifying its business will allow it to improve profitability over the long term. However, the transition has introduced some costs and intricacies. Royal & Sun Alliance expects to complete the program to exit most international businesses this year but warns there may be additional costs still to come.

“We have made solid progress in executing our strategy to focus on our strongest businesses in the UK and Canada. However, conditions remain challenging, and we have more work to do to improve performance,” said CEO Stephen Hester. “We aim to accelerate measures to cut costs, improve productivity and enhance customer experience. Combined with a more focused business, this gives us confidence in improved returns and cash generation.”

To provide additional financial flexibility, Royal & Sun Alliance is also seeking shareholder approval for a share buyback program of up to £250 million. The company believes buying back its own shares will have a positive impact on earnings per share and says it has surplus capital to fund the program following the sales of its businesses in Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Shareholder approval will be sought at the company’s General Meeting in November.

Royal & Sun Alliance’s stock price was down over 4% in early trading on the news. Investors had hoped for stronger results and more ambitious cost-cutting targets from the company’s new CEO, who took over in March. However, others see Royal & Sun Alliance making steady progress in repositioning itself as a more focused and profitable business over the medium term. With turnaround efforts still underway, shareholders may need to show continued patience before seeing more significant gains.
