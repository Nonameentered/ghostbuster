Prudential Corp's profits rise, but no comment on orphan asset negotiations with DTI

Prudential Corp announced today that its profits climbed 12% in the first half of 2019 compared to the same period last year. In interim financial results released this morning, the insurance and asset management giant posted net profits of $4.6 billion for the six months ending June 30.

The robust results were driven by growth in Prudential's U.S. and Asian businesses, which benefitted from higher equity markets and increased demand for insurance products across its key markets. However, little mention was made of the ongoing negotiations with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in the UK over the management of Prudential's £12 billion "orphan asset" portfolio. 

Prudential's CEO Mike Wells touted the group's solid fundamentals and diversified business model in delivering strong performance despite continuing economic uncertainties. "We have made good progress in the transformation of our business to focus on markets and segments where Prudential has sustainable competitive advantages," he said in a statement. "Our capital position remains robust, enabling us to invest in profitable growth opportunities for long-term shareholder value creation."

The U.S. and Asian divisions each contributed around 40% of total operating profits, benefitting from higher policy volumes and asset under management levels. In contrast, profits from UK and European operations were down 5% as the group faces pricing pressures in mature markets. 

However, there was an absence of any update on the ongoing dispute between Prudential and DTI over whether the life insurer has improperly profited from orphan assets. The term refers to funds from expired insurance policies that were not claimed. DTI has argued that more of these unclaimed assets should have been allocated to benefit pension holders. The disagreement has spanned over a decade with a resolution still unclear.

Market analysts suggested the improved financial results may give Prudential more of a buffer in navigating a settlement with DTI. "The half year numbers will reassure investors that Prudential's business model is still delivering healthy profits despite the uncertainty surrounding orphan assets,” said Hugh Stevens, insurance analyst at Avalon Capital Markets. However, others argue the profits demonstrate why more orphan funds should be released to benefit policyholders. The issue remains an overhang on the company's share price.

In mid-day trading Prudential shares were up 2.4% as investors reacted positively to the half-year results and the group's strategic pivot towards higher-growth markets in Asia and the U.S. However, little insight was provided on an issue that will be material to how the FTSE's second largest insurer ultimately emerges from a lengthy regulatory challenge. All eyes will be on Prudential's next move in a saga spanning over a decade.
