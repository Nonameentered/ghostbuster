Royal & Sun Alliance Reports Annual Results, Plans to Buy Back Shares But Hit by US Environmental Claims  

The British insurance group Royal & Sun Alliance (RSA) today reported a modest drop in full-year profits but plans to buy back shares after reducing debt. However, the results were hit by a $130 million charge related to environmental claims in the US.

For the 12 months to December 31, 2017, RSA's operating profit fell 3% to £543 million ($760 million) from £560 million a year earlier, according to a statement. The slight decline was mainly due to adverse foreign exchange movements and restructuring costs. However, on an underlying basis, profits rose 5% with earnings per share increasing 8% to 28.7 pence.

RSA said it will launch a £500 million share buyback program over the next 12 months after cutting its debt by £900 million. “We have made excellent progress in strengthening our balance sheet and we generated robust cash flows in 2017 despite the major Atlantic hurricanes,” said Chief Executive Stephen Hester. "This allows us to return surplus capital to shareholders while still meeting all our financial targets." 

However, the results were hit by a $130 million charge to settle lawsuits and claims related to industrial pollution in the United States, partly related to discontinued operations. The claims relate to toxic waste dumps and pollution from manufactured gas plants that were active decades ago. While RSA said it faces no further substantial liabilities from these legacy portfolios, the charge underlines the risks that insurers can face from long-tail environmental and health claims.  

Sales at RSA’s five operating divisions rose 2% last year to £6.54 billion, including growth of 7% in Scandinavia, 5% in Canada and 4% in Britain. But sales fell in other markets including Ireland, down 3%, and the Middle East, down 1%.

While the overall results were solid, given the hurricane losses and US charge, RSA faces multiple challenges. After Brexit, the UK economy is faltering and inflation is squeezing households, which could reduce insurance sales. Meanwhile, the firm must adapt as customers increasingly buy more policies online and directly. However, some analysts remain optimistic, pointing to RSA’s stronger balance sheet, reduced costs and growth potential in Canada, Scandinavia and emerging markets.

“RSA's 2017 results demonstrate progress in simplifying and strengthening the group, although hurricanes and legacy charges weighed on earnings,” said Artemis analyst Charles Graham. “If it continues to execute its strategy well, the firm is in a good position to generate attractive returns for shareholders over the coming years."
