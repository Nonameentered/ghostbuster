Scottish Amicable asks for firm offers for company by end of February

Scottish Amicable, the Edinburgh-based mutual life insurance and financial services group, has asked potential buyers to submit firm offers for the company before the end of next month. A number of companies have expressed an interest in acquiring Scottish Amicable since it revealed plans last year to demutualize and explore strategic options, including a possible sale.  

Sources close to the process said Scottish Amicable’s board wants to review concrete proposals within the next four weeks and choose a preferred bidder soon after. The company is being advised by JP Morgan Cazenove and could fetch between £1.5bn to £2bn, according to analysts. Bidders are likely to include fellow insurers like Standard Life Aberdeen, Phoenix Group and Royal London, as well as private equity firms attracted by the opportunity to buy a company with over £30bn of assets under management.

“There has been no shortage of interest in Scottish Amicable given its strong brand, customer base and balance sheet,” said one person involved in the sale process. “However, the board feels the time is now right to move from preliminary discussions to firm bids so they have greater clarity on the options in front of them.”

Scottish Amicable became the UK’s first mutual life insurance company when it was founded in 1826. It provides life and pensions products to over 2 million customers across the UK. However, in recent years it has faced increased competition from lower-cost digital rivals and a period of low interest rates which has reduced returns from bonds and other fixed income investments. 

Demutualizing and selling the company is seen by many as the best way for Scottish Amicable to gain access to the investment and expertise required to modernize its business and take advantage of growth opportunities. The company began consulting with stakeholders about demutualization last autumn and a ballot of eligible members took place in December, with 91% backing plans to abandon its mutual status.

A sale would bring an end to Scottish Amicable's long history of mutual ownership but is expected to generate large sums for distribution
