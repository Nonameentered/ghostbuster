Three Companies Submit Final Offers for Scottish Amicable Takeover 

Scottish Amicable, one of Scotland's oldest insurance and financial services companies, has received final takeover bids from three firms according to sources close to the sale process. The 318-year-old company was put up for sale earlier this year by its parent company, Prudential plc, as part of a strategic review to focus on its core UK and international insurance business.

The bids were submitted last week by Standard Life Aberdeen, Phoenix Group Holdings, and Swiss Re, Europe's second-largest reinsurer. Standard Life Aberdeen is a leading UK asset manager and insurer, Phoenix specializes in closed-life insurance consolidation, and Swiss Re operates global reinsurance and insurance. The tight competition reflects the attractiveness and scarcity of heritage insurance brands like Scottish Amicable.   

Standard Life Aberdeen is considered the frontrunner in the process, with an estimated bid of £1.5 billion. The Edinburgh-based firm is keen to add Scottish Amicable's strong brand and customer base to complement its existing insurance operations. Standard Life merged with Aberdeen Asset Management last year, and a deal with Scottish Amicable would mark its second major insurance acquisition. However, Swiss Re and Phoenix are also strong contenders, with estimated bids of £1.4 billion and £1.2 billion respectively.

The final round of bids will now be evaluated by Prudential and its advisors before a preferred buyer is selected, likely within the next 4 to 6 weeks according to sources. The sales process was conducted by JPMorgan Securities and Fenchurch Advisory Partners. A deal would bring an end to Scottish Amicable's long history as an independent mutual and see it become part of a larger insurance and financial services group. Prudential has said it will reinvest most of the proceeds from the sale in its Asia and US operations.

The prospective acquirees declined to comment given the ongoing nature of the sale process. Prudential said in a statement: "We continue to evaluate options for the potential sale of Scottish Amicable as part of Prudential's strategy to focus on its core UK and international businesses. We will update the market on any material developments in due course." The historic insurer Scottish Amicable last changed hands in 1997 when it demutualized and floated on the London Stock Exchange, later being acquired by Prudential in 2003 for £1.7 billion.
