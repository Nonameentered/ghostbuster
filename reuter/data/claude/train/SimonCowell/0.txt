London Stock Exchange launches new electronic trading system, Sequence 6, completing 3-year modernisation program  

The London Stock Exchange today announced the launch of its new electronic trading system called Sequence 6, marking the completion of a three-year modernization program to upgrade the exchange’s core technology infrastructure. Sequence 6 replaces the exchange’s previous trading platform, TradElect, and is designed to significantly increase the speed, capacity, and resilience of the exchange.  

David Schwimmer, CEO of the London Stock Exchange Group, said: “The launch of Sequence 6 is a major milestone for London Stock Exchange and demonstrates our commitment to investing in innovative technology solutions for customers. Sequence 6 provides a faster, higher capacity, and more reliable platform for our clients to trade, supported by significant investments in people, processes and governance to ensure its safe and secure operation.”

Sequence 6 can process more than 30 million trades per day, a four-fold increase from TradElect. It reduces latency - the time taken for trades to be processed and completed - to as little as 900 microseconds. The new system is also built with full redundancy and diversity, with separate instances located in two geographically separate data centers to ensure continuous operation.

The launch of Sequence 6 is the culmination of Project Orion, the London Stock Exchange’s multi-year technology transformation program. The program involved upgrading or replacing many of the exchange’s core trading, clearing, and post-trade systems. The total cost of Project Orion was £450 million, demonstrating the magnitude of the technology overhaul being undertaken.

In addition to Sequence 6, the Project Orion program delivered new systems for clearing, settlement, market data, and regulatory reporting. These systems are designed to interoperate seamlessly with Sequence 6 to provide a comprehensive, state-of-the-art platform for the exchange and its customers.

The technological transformation of the London Stock Exchange aims to help maintain its status as a leading global stock exchange and fend off competition from rival exchanges in Europe and the United States. Providing faster, higher capacity, and more reliable trading systems is increasingly table stakes for operating a major exchange. With the launch of Sequence 6, the London Stock Exchange believes it once again has a world-class trading platform that positions it well for supporting the demands of its listed companies and traders in the coming decades.
