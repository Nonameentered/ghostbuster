Britannic Assurance Declares £209 Million Special Bonus for Life Insurance Policies

Britannic Assurance, one of the largest life insurance and pension providers in the UK, announced today that it will be paying out a special bonus of £209 million to qualifying life insurance policyholders. The bonus amounts to an average payout of £470 per policy and will be paid out starting in May to nearly 450,000 customers who hold with-profits policies that have been in force for at least 5 years.

The special bonus comes on the back of strong investment returns in Britannic's with-profits fund over the past few years. Investment returns were up 8.2% last year and have averaged over 7% annually over the past 3 years according to the company. The strong performance of global stock markets, especially in technology and healthcare sectors, have been a major contributor to the returns. The bonus declaration also reflects Britannic's stable financial position and ability to share good performance with policyholders, according to a statement by the CEO.  

With-profits policies, unlike unit-linked policies, provide an annual bonus that aims to smooth returns over time and provide steadier payouts to policyholders. They invest in a mix of assets such as stocks, bonds, and property to generate returns for investors. Policyholders get a share of these returns through annual and sometimes special bonus payouts. The amount of bonus depends on the performance of the underlying with-profits fund and is calculated by the insurance company based on a number of factors.

While the special bonus will be welcome news for many of Britannic's policyholders, some consumer advocates argue that bonus payouts by life insurers are often less than actual fund performance. According to an analyst at a policyholder advocacy group, "Insurance companies can hold back significant portions of good returns in reserves and as management fees. Policyholders deserve greater transparency on how bonus amounts are calculated to ensure they are getting their fair share of returns."

Britannic has countered these arguments by pointing to its bonus philosophy which aims to provide stable medium-term returns to policyholders while balancing the interests of new and old policyholders. The company stated that this latest special bonus, on top of annual bonus payouts, reflects its commitment to distributing a fair portion of good performance to qualifying policyholders.
