Commercial Union hit hard by sterling's strength: Reports sharp fall in 1996 profits

The insurance giant Commercial Union suffered a sharp fall in both pre-tax and post-tax profits in 1996, according to results released today. Profits were badly hit by the strong pound and falling stock market during the year. 

Pre-tax profits fell 17% to £1.69 billion from £2.04 billion in 1995. Post-tax profits slumped 23% to £1.21 billion from £1.57 billion. The figures were well below the expectations of most analysts.

The group blamed sterling's strength against other currencies for most of the slide in profits. Around 40% of Commercial Union's business is overseas, so the firm is particularly exposed to currency fluctuations. The pound rose sharply against the Deutsche Mark and French franc in 1996, undercutting profits generated abroad. 

The firm's new business was also dented by a weak stock market, which reduced demand for unit trusts and other investments. Although the FTSE 100 rallied in the final months of 1996, it was on average 9% below 1995's level - and at one point had slumped nearly 20% from its peak. 

However, the underlying performance of Commercial Union's main general insurance and life assurance operations remained healthy, according to Sir Graham Hearne, the group's Chief Executive. Premium income rose 3.4% to £16.6 billion, helped by strong growth in Germany, the US and UK pensions market. The general insurance combined ratio - a key measure of underwriting profitability - improved from 95.4% to 93.9%, indicating firmer pricing and cost control. 

Sir Graham said that barring a "marked economic downturn", underlying profits should recover some of the lost ground this year. But he warned that sterling's level and volatile world stock markets could continue to undermine reported results in the short term. 

Commercial Union's dividend was held at 25.9p per share, but the firm warned that future payouts would depend on profits recovering. The lack of dividend growth drew criticism from some analysts, who argued that the pay-out was already well below the industry average. However, most said the leaner dividend was prudent given the challenging conditions.

The results cap a difficult year for Commercial Union, in which a planned £16 billion merger with General Accident fell apart over concerns that projected cost savings were overstated. However, Sir Graham said the group had emerged from that episode with "renewed vigour, confidence and stability". Yesterday's figures show that will be desperately needed to steer Commercial Union back to calmer waters.
