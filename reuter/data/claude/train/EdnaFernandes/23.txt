Imperial Tobacco reveals former parent group rejected takeover offer due to low price

Imperial Tobacco, one of the world's largest tobacco companies, revealed today that British American Tobacco (BAT), its former parent company, rejected a takeover offer in February due to the offer price being too low. Imperial was spun off from BAT in 1996 but BAT still owns 40% of Imperial's shares.

According to Imperial Tobacco executives, BAT received an unsolicited takeover offer for the company in late January but rejected it within a matter of days. The offer was for £50 per share, valuing Imperial at £26 billion. However, BAT said the offer substantially undervalued the business. Imperial's shares were trading at around £42 per share before the offer was revealed, suggesting BAT was holding out for an offer price of at least £60-£65 per share. 

The rejection of the offer caps months of speculation that Imperial was a takeover target, with rumors of potential bids from Japan Tobacco International and Philip Morris International. However, BAT maintains control over Imperial via its large minority stake and takeover defenses put in place when Imperial was spun off. Any takeover offer would need approval from BAT, likely making a low-ball bid futile.

Imperial executives said they were informed of the offer by BAT in early February but were never directly involved in discussions. "We remain focused on running our business and continuing to generate growth and shareholder value as an independent company,” said an Imperial spokesperson. BAT declined to comment on the offer but said: “We are very supportive of Imperial and believe it remains well-positioned for future success on a stand-alone basis."

The news of the rejected takeover sent Imperial's shares up over 4% in early trading as investors anticipate renewed takeover interest in the £24 billion company, especially if BAT’s stake in Imperial were to be reduced at some point. However, unless and until BAT signals a willingness to sell its stake, Imperial seems destined to continue for the foreseeable future as an independent company within the wider BAT group.
