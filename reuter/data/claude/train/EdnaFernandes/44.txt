Richard Branson's Virgin Group Wins UK Rail Franchise, Plans to Invest $420 Million in New Trains and Services

Virgin Trains, the rail subsidiary of Richard Branson's Virgin Group, has won the bid to operate the InterCity West Coast rail franchise in the UK for the next 15 years. The company pledged to invest $420 million to upgrade services and expand capacity on the busy rail route connecting London and major cities like Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. 

Virgin Trains has operated the InterCity West Coast franchise since 1997. Its new bid promises faster journey times, more frequent services, and brand new trains. The company will replace its entire fleet of trains with 65 new Azuma trains built in the UK, providing more than 10,000 new seats. Journey times between London and Manchester will be cut by 15 minutes. There will also be more direct services to Liverpool and to Birmingham, improving connectivity across the region.

"This is fantastic news for rail passengers across the InterCity West Coast network. We have exciting plans for the future of InterCity West Coast, including a fleet of new Azuma trains, offering more seats and quicker journey times," said Patrick McCall, managing director at Virgin Trains. 

The result provides a boost for Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which also operates Virgin Atlantic airlines and had recently lost out to rival Stagecoach for the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise. The West Coast line has been one of Virgin Rail's most successful and profitable routes since the era of rail privatization in the UK during the 1990s.

The announcement was also welcomed by Britain's Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who said: "This deal is precisely tailored to meet the needs of passengers, providing more trains, more seats, simplified fares and high standards of service."

However, the decision was criticized by Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald, who argued that rail privatization has led to higher fares, worsening reliability and underinvestment in infrastructure. The Labour Party would prefer to return rail franchises to public ownership under a national rail network.

The new InterCity West Coast franchise will begin operating in December 2019. Virgin Trains expects to implement its promised timetable changes and carriage upgrades within the first 18 months of the contract.
