Imperial Tobacco unveils blueprint for export growth to silence critics

Imperial Tobacco, the UK's largest tobacco company, today unveiled an ambitious plan to grow its exports over the next decade in response to sustained criticism over its dependence on the declining domestic market. 

The maker of brands such as Embassy, Golden Virginia and Rizla said it aims to generate half of its revenue from outside the UK within 10 years, up from 42% currently. It will focus its efforts on emerging markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East where demand for western cigarette brands is surging. 

The export push is designed to address concerns that Imperial is overly reliant on a shrinking UK market, where cigarette sales have plunged over decades due to health concerns, taxes, and declining social acceptability of smoking. The company has faced repeated calls from investors and analysts to diversify into new geographies and non-tobacco products to secure its long-term future.

Shares in Imperial Tobacco rose 4% in early trading as investors welcomed the shift in strategy from the maker of Lambert & Butler and John Player Special cigarettes. However, anti-smoking campaigners accused the company of targeting countries with limited tobacco regulation and higher smoking rates in search of growth.

"Imperial Tobacco's plan to aggressively expand into developing countries is morally bankrupt. They are prioritising profits over health by marketing lethal products to countries where governments lack the resources to effectively combat tobacco industry tactics," said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH).

Imperial insisted it "does not market or sell its products to youth, nor do we suggest anyone start smoking". A spokesman said: "Wherever we operate in the world, we do so responsibly." The company highlighted efforts to tap demand for ‘next generation’ tobacco products such as vaping and heated tobacco devices which it believes are less harmful alternatives to cigarettes.

"This is an opportunity to accelerate our strategy in high growth markets and increasingly in next generation products. We will transform how we work to build a sustainable future for this company," said Imperial Brands chief executive Stefan Bomhard.

However, sceptics argue there is little evidence that alternative nicotine products significantly reduce health impacts and fear they are mainly a ploy to sustain industry profits as smoking declines. Imperial's drive into developing countries has also been criticised as an attempt to exploit lax regulation and hook new generations of smokers onto tobacco products.

While major investors welcomed Imperial's pivot to new growth channels, the ethical implications of its international ambitions threaten to ignite further controversy for a company already under siege from an array of opponents. The coming decade is set to prove pivotal in determining whether the tobacco giant can leave its troubles behind or goes up in smoke.
