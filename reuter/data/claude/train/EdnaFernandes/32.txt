Eurotunnel Faces Uncertainty and Financial Pressure After Tunnel Fire

Eurotunnel, the company that operates the Channel Tunnel rail link between the UK and France, is facing uncertainty and financial pressure in the aftermath of a major fire that halted all service last week. 

The fire broke out inside the tunnel on Wednesday evening, creating clouds of thick smoke that filled the 31-mile passageway. The blaze started on a shuttle train carrying heavy goods vehicles and their cargo. The train came to a stop and all passengers were evacuated, but the fire continued for several hours before being extinguished.

The fire caused significant damage within the tunnel, destroying the train and cargo as well as damaging infrastructure. According to Eurotunnel, the concrete tunnel structure remains intact but over 500 meters of the tunnel will need repairs and strengthening before service can resume.

The halt in service is creating a backlog of passengers and freight that typically move through the tunnel. Thousands of people have had their travel plans disrupted, and the delays are costing businesses millions of pounds of losses per day. The Tourism Alliance estimates the closure of the tunnel may result in over £50 million in lost revenue for the tourism industry during the peak summer season.

Eurotunnel has apologized for the severe disruptions and delays. Jacques Gounon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Eurotunnel SE, said: “We are fully focused on implementing a recovery plan to reopen the service as soon as it is safe to do so, whilst maintaining the highest safety standards...This is a challenging time for everyone affected and we would like to thank all our customers for their patience and understanding.”

The company hopes to restart a partial freight train service within the next 2-3 days, but passenger service is not expected to resume for at least 5-7 days according to Mr. Gounon. However, there are concerns that delays could last significantly longer depending on the scale of repairs and safety checks required. 

Eurotunnel obtains two-thirds of its revenue from freight and passenger shuttles through the tunnel. A prolonged closure could have a major negative financial impact and potentially threaten Eurotunnel’s profitability for the year. Shares in Eurotunnel’s parent company fell more than 17% in the aftermath of the fire, underscoring the uncertainty surrounding the current crisis. Both Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic have already placed severe pressure on Eurotunnel’s operations, and this tunnel fire could not have come at a worse time. The resolution of this crisis will be critical to enabling trade and tourism between the UK and EU to resume fully.
