Imperial Tobacco Faces Uncertain Future as it Splits from Hanson Plc Amid Threat of Tobacco Litigation  

Imperial Tobacco Group, the multinational cigarette manufacturer, will become an independent company after ending its 10-year partnership with building materials supplier Hanson Plc. Imperial Tobacco was spun off from Hanson in 1996 but Hanson retained a minority stake in the tobacco company. Now Hanson is selling its remaining shares in Imperial Tobacco for $1.9 billion, allowing Imperial Tobacco to stand alone.

The demerger comes at a precarious time for Imperial Tobacco as the company faces ongoing litigation related to health issues from cigarette smoking. Last year, Imperial Tobacco lost a $12.7 billion class action lawsuit in Florida for its role in selling cigarettes that caused harm to smokers. The company still faces thousands of additional lawsuits in the U.S. and other countries. Without the financial support of Hanson, Imperial Tobacco will rely entirely on the tobacco industry for its revenue and face legal liabilities on its own.

Imperial Tobacco controls tobacco brands including Davidoff, West and Gauloises and has focused its efforts on emerging markets as demand for cigarettes has declined in Western countries. The company’s shares fell 2% on news of its split from Hanson, reflecting investor concern over the litigation risks and uncertain impacts of future regulations on the tobacco industry. Several public health organizations have called for stricter laws including banning tobacco advertising and sponsorship, increasing tobacco taxes and standardizing cigarette packaging.  

“This demerger leaves Imperial Tobacco exposed to substantial threats that could undermine the company's profits and share value,” said Dr. Jennifer Harris from Action on Smoking and Health, a U.K.-based campaigning group. “Tobacco companies like Imperial rely on marketing and promotion to sell their deadly products, especially to young people. Regulations that prohibit such marketing could have a devastating impact.”

Imperial Tobacco CEO Alison Cooper remains confident in the company’s future as an independent entity.  "Imperial Tobacco is a strong, investment grade business with robust cash flows, a portfolio of leading brands and significant opportunities for further growth," Cooper said. However, share prices for other major tobacco companies, including Altria and British American Tobacco, also declined on news of Imperial's split from Hanson, signaling an overall investor wariness of the challenges facing cigarette makers.

Imperial Tobacco and Hanson officially demerged on February 1. The coming years will reveal whether Imperial Tobacco can withstand litigation and regulation on its own or if demand in emerging markets will offset challenges in developed countries. For now, Imperial Tobacco faces an uncertain future in a rapidly changing industry.
