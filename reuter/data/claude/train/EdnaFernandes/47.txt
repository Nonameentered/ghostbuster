Richard Branson's Virgin Group Wins CrossCountry Rail Franchise with Plans to Invest £250 Million in New Trains and Services 

Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group has secured the franchise to operate the CrossCountry rail network, pledging to invest £250 million in new trains and improved services. The new franchise will operate from June 2019 until 2026, with options to extend to 2029.

Virgin Trains will take over the running of the CrossCountry network which spans much of England, stretching from Penzance in Cornwall to the Midlands, North East, North West and Scotland. They aim to operate a fleet of 26 new Intercity Express Trains from December 2019, with more spacious and comfortable seating, additional luggage space and improved accessibility.

The new trains will replace some of the oldest on the UK rail network, with an average age of 30 years, delivering faster journey times and reduced overcrowding for over 27 million CrossCountry passengers each year. Over £50 million will also be invested to overhaul existing trains, including £21 million on overhaul of existing Voyager trains and £30 million on general upgrades to support the introduction.

The winning bid from Virgin Group followed a six-month procurement process by the Department for Transport. Virgin Trains edged out the other shortlisted bid from Arriva Rail North to secure the 8-year contract. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: “We are delivering new trains, improved connections and a more comfortable travel experience for millions of passengers across the country through the CrossCountry franchise.”

Virgin Group's CEO Josh Bayliss said: “This is an exciting new chapter for Virgin Trains. Our CrossCountry franchise will reinvigorate travel across Britain and deliver an all-new rail experience to more than 27 million people each year.”  

The new CrossCountry franchise continues the Virgin Group's expansion in UK rail operations. In conjunction with Stagecoach, Virgin has operated the West Coast mainline franchise since 1997 which was recently extended to 2026. The group is also vying for the new East Midlands franchise in a joint bid with Stagecoach.

The investment in new rolling stock, upgrades and improved connectivity across the CrossCountry network will be welcomed by passengers who have endured cramped conditions, delays and disruptions for too long. The new franchise aims to transform the aging CrossCountry services, bringing 21st century rail travel to communities across Britain. Virgin's plans appear an exciting step in the right direction.
