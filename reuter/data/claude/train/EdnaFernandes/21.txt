Imperial Tobacco Group Plc plans to cut debt and focus on export growth with possible entry into Japanese market  

Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, one of the world's leading producers and distributers of tobacco products, announced plans today to reduce debt and accelerate export growth over the next 3 years. The company aims to cut net debt by at least £3 billion through organic cash generation and tighter cost controls. At the same time, Imperial Tobacco seeks to boost export revenue, especially in emerging markets in Asia, Middle East and Central Europe.  

“We have delivered solid results in a challenging operating environment, but we aim to do even better by strengthening our balance sheet, increasing investments in key export markets, and improving operating efficiencies,” said Mark Williamson, CEO of Imperial Tobacco. “Despite global demographic and regulatory headwinds facing the tobacco industry, there are still many opportunities for growth particularly in emerging markets outside Western Europe and North America.”

Imperial Tobacco reported a 4% decline in revenue last year due to lower tobacco consumption and tightening regulations in its main markets of UK, Germany, Spain and the US. However, the company achieved modest growth in export markets such as Russia, Ukraine, Poland, as well as Middle Eastern and North African countries. Export sales now account for 36% of total revenue, compared with 32% five years ago. Imperial aims to increase this share to 40% over the next 3 years.   

One new potential market Imperial Tobacco seeks to enter is Japan, the 3rd largest tobacco market in the world after China and the United States. Japan has a high percentage of adult smokers at 18% and cigarette sales have been stable over the long run despite demographic shifts and health concerns. “Japan represents an attractive opportunity given its size, pricing dynamics and differentiated consumer preferences. We believe our premium brands can thrive in Japan with the right distributor partnership and marketing investments,” noted Mr. Williamson. 

Imperial Tobacco's plan to cut debt and focus on export growth is a pragmatic strategy, according to analysts. “Deleveraging their balance sheet will give them more flexibility to invest in growth and wage potential takeovers," said Owen Bennett, an analyst at Jefferies International. "Their export drive into emerging markets also makes sense given the weak conditions in their core UK and European markets." If executed well, Imperial's strategy could drive modest revenue and profit growth over the next few years despite wider industry challenges. The possible entry into the Japanese market may emerge as a key catalyst for the company's turnaround.
