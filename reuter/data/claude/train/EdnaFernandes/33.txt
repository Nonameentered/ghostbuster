Glaxo Wellcome Buys Out Japanese Joint Venture for $596 Million 

Glaxo Wellcome PLC, the British pharmaceutical giant, announced today that it will pay $596 million in cash to buy the remaining 50 percent stake in its Japanese consumer healthcare joint venture from Kakaku Seiyaku. The joint venture, GlaxoSmithKline K.K., was formed in 2001 to develop and market over-the-counter medicines and other consumer healthcare products in Japan.

Glaxo Wellcome currently owns 50 percent of GlaxoSmithKline K.K. and has been aiming to establish a stronger direct presence in Japan, the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world. Buying out its joint venture partner will give Glaxo Wellcome full control over the operation and help establish its consumer healthcare business in a key strategic market in Asia.

“This acquisition reinforces our commitment to grow our business in the Japanese market,” said Sir Christopher Hogg, Chairman of Glaxo Wellcome. “Taking full ownership of GlaxoSmithKline K.K. is an important step to enable further expansion of our consumer healthcare products in Japan to better serve more customers and consumers.”

Glaxo Wellcome has had commercial operations in Japan for more than 40 years. The company is focused on prescription medicines and vaccines in Japan, in addition to consumer healthcare products. Some of its well-known brands in Japan include cold and flu relief medications, as well as pain relief tablets and ointments.

The deal is not expected to have a significant impact on Glaxo Wellcome’s earnings in the 2017 fiscal year but should be accretive to the company’s bottom line over the long run. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second half of 2017. 

Shares of Glaxo Wellcome fell slightly in early London trading following the announcement but remained broadly in line with the overall British market. The company’s stock price has gained more than 25% over the past 12 months, reflecting Glaxo Wellcome’s relatively strong growth compared to its peers.
