LucasVarity Announces Major Corporate Shake-Up, Including 13 Non-Core Disposals and Axing of 3,000 Jobs Worldwide Over Two Years

LucasVarity, the international automotive components and aerospace manufacturing group, today announced a major restructuring plan that will see the disposal of 13 non-core businesses and the elimination of 3,000 jobs worldwide over the next 24 months. The restructuring is designed to refocus the company on its core automotive and aerospace operations and improve profitability. 

The plan includes the sale of LucasVarity’s Electronics, Fluid Power, and Building Products divisions, which represent combined annual revenues of over $2 billion. LucasVarity CEO John Dawson said “these disposals will allow us to concentrate our resources on our automotive braking and aerospace activities, where we have technological leadership and strong long-term growth prospects.”

The job cuts represent over 10% of LucasVarity’s global workforce of 28,000 people. The reductions will impact manufacturing facilities in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, the US, Brazil, and India. The restructuring is expected to cost LucasVarity approximately $450 million but should generate pre-tax cost savings of $250 million per year by the end of the two-year restructuring period.

The cutbacks and disposals are a response to stagnant sales and declining profit margins, especially in LucasVarity’s European automotive components division. The company reported flat sales of $8.2 billion and a 4% drop in operating profit to $650 million for its last fiscal year. LucasVarity’s share price has declined over 25% in the last 12 months, underperforming the broader market indexes.

Investors reacted positively to the restructuring announcement, with LucasVarity’s share price rising over 5% in early London trading. Analysts said the strategic plan and more focused business model should help address the company’s recent underperformance and unlock greater shareholder value over the long run. However, unions have condemned the large job losses and called on LucasVarity and government officials to lessen the impact on workers.

The company said the non-core divestitures and job cuts will be substantially complete within two years. LucasVarity will provide further details on the restructuring plan at its interim results announcement in August. The company has manufacturing operations in 23 countries worldwide, serving customers that include Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin.
