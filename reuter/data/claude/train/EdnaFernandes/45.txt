Virgin Group Wins CrossCountry Rail Franchise and Plans $420m Investment in New Trains and Services  

Virgin Trains, a subsidiary of Virgin Group, has won the bid to operate the CrossCountry rail franchise in the UK for the next 7 years. Virgin Trains will take over operations of the CrossCountry network in December 2019, replacing the current operator Arriva Rail. The franchise operates intercity rail services across large parts of England, Scotland and Wales.

The Department for Transport awarded the new contract to Virgin Trains after the company promised significant investments to improve services and the customer experience. Virgin Trains plans to invest $420 million over the life of the contract to provide faster journey times, more frequent services, and upgraded rolling stock. This includes acquiring new state-of-the-art trains to replace some of the current diesel trains in the CrossCountry fleet.

The new fleet will allow CrossCountry to offer more seats, shorter journey times, and an improved onboard experience for passengers. CrossCountry will also increase the number of services across the network, add more direct routes, and improve connections with major UK airports. Virgin promises the investments will bring new jobs and economic opportunities to cities and towns across the CrossCountry network.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “This deal is fantastic news for passengers, with state-of-the-art trains, improved connections, and £172 million of investment in services. Virgin Trains’ plans will deliver a much-improved experience for the millions of people right across England, Scotland and Wales who use these vital services.”  

Virgin Group CEO Patrick McCall said: “We are delighted to have won the right to run services on the CrossCountry network and are ready to deliver an exciting new era for this important rail network. Our proposals for new intercity trains will provide increased capacity and speed up journey times, while our commitment to no franchise fee for the duration of the contract means more money can be invested into the railway. We look forward to providing CrossCountry passengers with a significantly improved travel experience.”

The new franchise contract will start on December 8, 2019 and run until 2026, with an option for a one-year extension. Virgin Trains will take over all current CrossCountry services, stations, and railway staff upon the start of the new contract. Passengers across England, Scotland and Wales covered by the CrossCountry network should expect to see significant improvements to rail services over the coming years. Continued...
