Sea Launch: East and West unite to create ultimate space technology and undercut competition 

In a move that surprised industry experts, companies from the U.S, Russia, Ukraine, and Norway have joined forces to create Sea Launch, a unique space launch service that provides heavy-lift launch capabilities at a lower cost than traditional land-based launch systems. The multinational consortium, which consists of Boeing, Energia, Yuzhnoye and Yuzmash from Ukraine, and the Norwegian shipbuilder Kvaerner, aims to capture a significant share of the commercial launch market by offering an innovative "sea-based" launch platform that provides numerous cost and logistical benefits compared to terrestrial launch systems.

The key to Sea Launch's competitive advantage is its equatorial Pacific Ocean launch site and the self-propelled launch platform named the Odyssey. Rocket stages and payloads are integrated on shore at Sea Launch's home port in Long Beach, California, and the assembled rocket is then transported to the ocean-based Odyssey, which serves as a floating launch pad. The Odyssey sails to the equatorial Pacific launch site, approximately 2,400 miles southeast of Hawaii.  Once on location, final countdown and launch operations are conducted. The advantage of an equatorial sea-based launch is that it provides an extra boost in speed to launch payloads into space. The equatorial site and eastward launch direction provide the maximum velocity to launch payloads into geosynchronous transfer orbit. 

"Sea Launch offers cost savings of up to 25 percent compared to land-based launches, greater lift capabilities, and shorter travel time to orbit," said Thayer MacNaught, Boeing's Director of Commercial Launch Services.  "This innovative approach supports the commercial space marketplace with flexible, cost-effective launch options that open more opportunities for companies looking to harness the potential of space."

The Sea Launch fleet, which includes the Odyssey launch platform, assembly and control ship, and multiple support and supply ships, is staffed by a multinational workforce uniquely skilled in the marine and space environments. All operations are conducted in a standardized way to provide maximum reliability and mission assurance. With its first successful launch in 1999, Sea Launch has a track record of delivering payloads to orbit efficiently and reliably. It has conducted over 30 missions to date with a success rate well above the industry average. 

While novel and untested, the Sea Launch concept appears poised to make headway in reducing costs and improving efficiency in the space launch sector.  If it continues its successful track record, this east-west partnership has the potential to disrupt existing space launch services and open up space access to new customers and markets around the globe. The launch of the maritime "space race" has begun.
