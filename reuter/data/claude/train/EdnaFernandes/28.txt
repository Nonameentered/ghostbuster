Massive tunnel fire sparks safety review of Eurotunnel freight train design

A raging fire in the Eurotunnel that shut down travel underneath the English Channel for six hours last week has prompted officials to review safety procedures and the design of freight trains using the tunnel. The fire broke out on Wednesday evening in a truck onboard a Eurotunnel Le Shuttle freight train travelling from Folkestone, UK to Calais, France. The intense fire and smoke caused the suspension of all passenger and freight services through the tunnel for several hours. 

The fire started on a freight train carrying 28 trucks just as it entered the tunnel around 7:40 pm local time. The train stopped and all truck drivers and passengers were immediately evacuated. Smoke from the fire activated the tunnel's fire detection system, automatically stopping all rail traffic in both directions. Within four minutes, Eurotunnel's rescue and firefighting teams reached the site of the fire but the blaze had already fully engulfed two trucks and spread to a third.

Fighting the fire proved challenging given the narrow, confined space inside the tunnel and limited access for emergency vehicles. However, after 90 minutes firefighters extinguished the blaze using water cannons and foam to suppress the flames. The fire caused extensive damage to 300 feet of the tunnel's concrete walls and along 150 feet of the main tunnel track before it was put out. No serious injuries were reported from the incident, though several people were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation.  

The fire has raised questions about the adequacy of safety systems for the large freight trains that traverse the 50-kilometer tunnel. Each Le Shuttle freight train can carry up to 28 trucks, posing risks of a large vehicle fire in the confined space of the tunnel. Eurotunnel officials said they will review ventilation, fire detection, and suppression systems to determine if improvements are needed, especially for the long freight trains. Revising the layout and design of the freight wagons may also be considered to allow for faster emergency evacuations and fire truck access if another blaze erupts.

The day after the fire, normal passenger and freight rail service through the Eurotunnel resumed. However, the tunnel walls and tracks damaged in the fire still require repairs that will take months to complete during overnight closure periods. Wednesday's fire in the Channel Tunnel serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges of minimizing risks from accidents and natural disasters in long undersea tunnels. Ongoing investments in the latest safety systems and emergency response plans are critical to ensure the safe operation of infrastructure as complex as the Eurotunnel.
