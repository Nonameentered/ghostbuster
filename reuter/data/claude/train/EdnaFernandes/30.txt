Sea Launch: The East and West Unite to Build Ultimate Space Technology 

In a demonstration of post-Cold War cooperation, companies from Russia, Ukraine, Norway and the United States have come together to create a unique space launch platform. Called Sea Launch, it is a seaborne launch system that provides heavy-lift launch services for commercial and government payloads. 

The Sea Launch system consists of the Odyssey Launch Platform, the Zenit-3SL rocket, and the Assembly and Command Ship called Sea Launch Commander. The Odyssey Launch Platform is a self-propelled vessel that provides a stable, open-sea platform from which rockets can launch payloads into space. The Zenit-3SL rocket is a modified version of the Russian Zenit-3SLB launch vehicle, designed to launch from the platform at sea. The Sea Launch Commander, stationed a safe distance away, serves as a floating launchpad control center and provides accommodations for customer and personnel during launches.

By launching from the equator, Sea Launch is able to take full advantage of the Earthâ€™s rotation to lift payloads into orbit. The equatorial launch site provides a velocity boost of approximately 500 meters per second, resulting in up to a 30% increase in payload lift capacity compared to launches from higher latitude sites. The mobility and flexibility of the platform also allow Sea Launch to avoid bad weather by moving to an alternate launch region.  

Sea Launch was founded in 1995 as a consortium of four companies: Boeing of the United States, Kvaerner (now Aker Solutions) of Norway, RSC Energia of Russia and KB Yuzhnoye/PO Yuzhmash of Ukraine. The consortium has launched a total of 36 rockets and sent numerous communications satellites into orbit for world leading operators, clearly demonstrating the viability of international space partnerships.

While Sea Launch has faced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, the company successfully reorganized and aims to become profitable again. New launch contracts have been signed, and the company conducted its first launch since emerging from bankruptcy in April 2015, sending a satellite into orbit for Asia Broadcast Satellite. Sea Launch represents a unique partnership that transcends geopolitical tensions and has the potential for continued commercial success going forward. Through international collaboration, this ambitious alliance of spacefaring nations has built a one-of-a-kind space launch platform to provide launch services for clients around the world.
