UK Construction Industry Expects Continued Infrastructure Spending Cuts in Next Budget

The UK construction industry is bracing itself for further cuts to infrastructure spending in Chancellor Philip Hammond's budget speech next month. Construction industry leaders expect the budget will continue the government's austerity drive and reduce funding for major infrastructure projects.

Hammond is under pressure to balance the budget and continue reducing the deficit. He is expected to reaffirm the government's commitment to fiscal discipline in the November budget. While tax receipts have been higher than expected in recent months, analysts expect little scope for boosting spending. Capital investment in infrastructure projects is seen as an easy target for cuts. 

The Construction Leadership Council, which represents major contractors, said it fears planned infrastructure spending over the next 10 years will be scaled back further. The council has called for long-term funding certainty and said "stop-start" spending on major projects is damaging productivity in the construction sector.

High-speed rail projects including HS2, the proposed high-speed rail network linking London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, could face delays or budget reductions. Motorway and road improvement schemes are also likely targets for cuts, while long-awaited upgrades to London's subway system may be pushed further into the future.

Housing associations have also warned that cuts to affordable housebuilding grants will worsen the UK's housing crisis. With Brexit looming, analysts say infrastructure spending is vital to support economic growth. However, the budget is expected to prioritize deficit reduction over pumping money into construction.

Hammond may point to existing long-term infrastructure plans, including the National Infrastructure Plan, to claim that project pipelines are secure. But without funding commitments from the Treasury, many plans could stall. The budget is unlikely to contain good news for the UK construction sector as it prepares for the economic uncertainty of leaving the European Union.
