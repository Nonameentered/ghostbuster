Virgin Rail to Spend 250 Million on New Rolling Stock After Winning CrossCountry Franchise 

Virgin Rail has announced plans to invest over Â£250 million in new rolling stock after being awarded the CrossCountry rail franchise by the Department for Transport. The 15-year franchise will begin in December 2019 and includes operating services across Britain, connecting over 100 stations from Aberdeen to Penzance, including major cities like Edinburgh, Leeds, Birmingham, and Bristol.

As part of the franchise agreement, Virgin Rail has committed to replace its entire fleet of trains with faster, higher-capacity vehicles. This includes acquiring over 80 new train sets that will allow for additional seating, more spacious carriages, and facilities for customers with bicycles and luggage. The new trains are expected to cut journey times by up to 10 minutes on long-distance routes thanks to their streamlined design and faster acceleration.

Virgin Rail's Chief Executive Charles Hammond said, "We are delighted to have won the right to operate services on the CrossCountry network and look forward to transforming journeys across Britain with state-of-the-art new trains and superb customer service." Transport Secretary Chris Grayling commented that Virgin demonstrated ambitious plans for increasing capacity, improving journey times, and enhancing the overall customer experience.

The new franchise arrangement will also see Virgin introduce automatic delay repay compensation for late-arriving passengers, free Wi-Fi across its network, and upgrades to station facilities including new waiting rooms and Ticket Vending Machines. However, some rail advocates have argued that the government should have required Virgin to keep fares flat under the terms of the new franchise given the significant public investment in rail infrastructure and new rolling stock. Virgin Rail has said any fare increases over the franchise period would be below the rate of inflation.

The CrossCountry franchise currently carries over 100 million passenger journeys each year across its network of long-distance rail services in Britain. The new agreement will deliver faster, more comfortable travel and an improved travel experience for the tens of millions of people who use CrossCountry trains each year to commute, travel for business or visit friends and family.
