Christian Salvesen Demerges Aggreko Business and Announces 150 Million Pound Special Payout   

Christian Salvesen PLC, the logistics and transportation company, announced today the demerger of its Aggreko subsidiary. Aggreko, which provides temporary power and temperature control services, will become an independently listed company on the London Stock Exchange. As part of the demerger, Salvesen will make a special payout of 150 million pounds to its shareholders.

Aggreko was acquired by Christian Salvesen in 1992 but has grown substantially over the past 26 years into a global leader in its industry. Aggreko now operates in over 100 countries and generated over 1 billion pounds in revenue last year. The demerger is designed to enable both companies to focus on their strategic priorities as separate entities.  

Ian Marchant, CEO of Christian Salvesen, said "Aggreko has achieved tremendous success as part of Salvesen over the past decades. However, it has now reached a scale and maturity where it can thrive as an independent company. The demerger will allow Aggreko to gain more direct access to capital and make strategic investments focused specifically on its business. At the same time, it will allow Salvesen to direct our resources to accelerating growth in our logistics divisions."

Under the demerger, Salvesen shareholders will receive one Aggreko share for every Salvesen share they own. Aggreko will have an independent board of directors and list under the ticker symbol "AGK" on the London Stock Exchange. The companies will maintain a strategic partnership after the demerger.

In addition to gaining an independent Aggreko shareholding, Salvesen shareholders will receive a one-time special dividend of 150 million pounds, or approximately 30 pence per share based on the current share count. Marchant noted that "The special payout demonstrates our appreciation for the support of Salvesen shareholders through the years. It represents a portion of the value that has been created through the growth and development of Aggreko." 

The demerger and payout are subject to shareholder and regulatory approval but are expected to be completed by the end of June. Financial analysts reacted positively to the announcement given Aggreko's strong historical performance and future growth potential. Salvesen shares rose 4% on the news while analysts anticipate Aggreko could trade at a premium to peers following its debut as an independent company.
