Serious Fraud Office Launches Investigation into Former Wickes Plc Bosses over Accounting Irregularities  

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a criminal investigation into two former senior executives of Wickes Plc over alleged accounting irregularities during their tenure at the DIY retailer, according to sources close to the matter. Howard Jones, former Chief Executive, and Kevin Wells, ex-Chief Financial Officer of Wickes, are subject to an SFO probe over suspected misreporting of profits and results between 2014 and 2016.

During those years, under the leadership of Jones and Wells, Wickes experienced a strong upturn in reported profits, beating analyst expectations and fuelling a rally in the share price of more than 300% over the 3-year period. However, following the abrupt departure of both executives in late 2016 under unclear circumstances, an internal whistleblower came forward alleging that the financial results had been artificially inflated through aggressive accounting measures.

After conducting an initial review, the board of Wickes launched an independent investigation which uncovered substantial accounting "issues" and "irregularities" that led to the restatement and downward revision of financial results for 2014 to 2016, wiping out nearly 80% of reported profits over the period. The board said that it had referred the findings of the investigation to the appropriate regulatory and legal authorities. This appears to have prompted action from the SFO who have now launched the criminal probe.

In a statement, the SFO confirmed it was investigating "suspected false accounting and fraud" at Wickes between 2014 and 2016. It did not name any suspects but informed they were former senior executives. The alleged irregularities focus on the inflation of profits through aggressive recognition of commercial income and delayed recognition of commercial expenses. If found guilty, the suspects could face up to 10 years imprisonment.  

Jones and Wells have not yet commented on the allegations or investigation. Wickes stated it was cooperating fully with the SFO and was keen to draw a line under the issue, emphasizing the events were related to past executives and the group had since significantly strengthened its financial governance and controls. The share price fell 4% on the news of the SFO criminal probe.
