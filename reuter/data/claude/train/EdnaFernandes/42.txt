British Government Refers Proposed P&O and Stena Line Merger to Competition Watchdog

The British government has referred the proposed merger of ferry operators P&O Ferries and Stena Line to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) over concerns that the deal could reduce competition and lead to higher fares for passengers. 

P&O Ferries, a subsidiary of DP World, and Stena Line, owned by Stena AB of Sweden, announced plans in January to combine their ferry operations, which transport freight and passengers between the UK, Ireland, Northern Ireland and mainland Europe. The merged company would dominate routes across the Irish Sea and English Channel, operating over 50% of ferry capacity.

Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she had referred the deal to the CMA because of concerns it may be "problematic for competition." The CMA will now investigate how the merger might affect ferry services on the routes operated by P&O Ferries and Stena Line from ports including Dover, Portsmouth, Liverpool and Dublin.

The CMA said it would assess whether the loss of competition could lead to higher fares, reduced service frequencies or lower service quality for passengers and freight customers. It has set a statutory deadline of September 29 to issue its final report. P&O Ferries and Stena Line stated the investigation was "routine" but that they remained confident the merger will be approved. 

Consumer group Which? supported the government's decision, arguing the deal risked "seriously reducing choice" for travelers. The referral "will help ensure this merger does not lead to a monopoly that pushes up ferry prices," said Adam French, Which? consumer rights expert.

The merger plans have also faced political opposition. Welsh Labour MP Chris Elmore warned in February that P&O and Stena Line could gain "a monopoly on UK-Ireland trading routes with the power to significantly raise prices for both passengers and cargo." He urged the government to refer the matter to the CMA.
