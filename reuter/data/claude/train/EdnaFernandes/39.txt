Serious Fraud Office launches investigation into former bosses of Wickes Plc after accounting scandal worth tens of millions of pounds

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a criminal investigation into the former chief executive and chief financial officer of Wickes Plc, the home improvement retailer. The investigation follows the discovery of an accounting fraud worth at least £30 million over three years at the FTSE 250 company.   

Wickes announced yesterday that it had uncovered "serious and deliberate" accounting irregularities that inflated its profits between 2017 and 2019. The issues mainly relate to the timing of income recognition and the capitalization of costs. The company has restated its accounts for the affected years, reducing pre-tax profits by 12% over the period. 

The SFO director said: "These are serious allegations that merit a full criminal investigation. We will work with Wickes Plc to establish the facts of the case and to determine whether charges should be brought against individuals involved."

The former CEO, Amanda Redfern, stepped down "by mutual agreement" with the company in October 2019 after 12 years in the role. The former CFO, Tim Winter, left Wickes in April 2020 after six years as finance director. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the current management team.

Wickes share price fell 18% on the news before recovering some losses. Analysts said the accounting issues raised "major questions" about governance and oversight at the company. Wickes chairman admitted the news was a "bitter disappointment" and apologized to shareholders. An independent law firm has been hired to review Wickes’ internal financial controls.

The SFO investigation underlines the regulator's renewed focus on accounting fraud and false financial reporting by listed companies. If charges are brought, it would mark one of the largest cases of accounting fraud in Britain this decade. The SFO has powers to impose unlimited fines and hand down jail sentences for the most serious white-collar crimes.

Wickes operates 230 home improvement stores across the UK and employs over 10,000 staff. The company said the restated accounts did not impact its liquidity or banking covenants. Shares in Wickes were up 3% in morning trading as investors took some comfort from the company's underlying financial position.
