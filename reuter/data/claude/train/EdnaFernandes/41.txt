Stagecoach's Profits Surge 127%, Sends Shares Soaring to Record Highs   

Shares of Stagecoach Group, the UK's leading bus and train operator, surged to record highs today after the company reported a massive 127% increase in annual profits, boosted by lower costs and higher customer demand.

Stagecoach reported pre-tax profits of £132.6 million for the year ended April 30, up from £58.4 million in the previous fiscal year. Revenues rose 3.6% to £1.8 billion, helped by more bus journeys and higher rail passenger numbers in the UK.  

The company's bus division reported a 6% increase in revenue and a 50% jump in operating profit. Stagecoach credited improving economic conditions in the UK and its own efforts to attract more customers with lower fares and investments in new vehicles and employee training. The company transported over 1 billion passengers on its bus and tram networks across the UK this year.

Stagecoach's South Western and East Midlands rail franchises also delivered strong growth, with higher passenger numbers and revenue. Government subsidies for the rail franchises declined, however, leading to slightly lower profitability in the rail division.  

"We have delivered a very good set of results, thanks to our team's dedication to attracting and keeping customers, and focus on driving efficiency," said Stagecoach Group Chief Executive Martin Griffiths. "The outlook for the year ahead remains positive."

Buoyed by the positive results and outlook, Stagecoach shares spiked as much as 12% to an all-time high of 171 pence in London trading. The stock has gained over 40% in the past 12 months as investors have recognized the company's solid execution and progress.  

Some analysts were surprised by the size of Stagecoach's profit increase. "These results were well ahead of expectations, particularly the scale of recovery at the bus division," said Stephen Furlong, associate at Davy Research. However, others warned that Stagecoach faces potential headwinds including economic uncertainty related to Brexit and the loss of a major rail franchise in 2019.

Stagecoach was founded in 1980 and now employs around 26,000 people across its bus and rail networks in the UK. The Perth, Scotland-based company operates iconic coach routes in Scotland and England, as well as commuter bus services in major UK cities. Stagecoach is also a major operator of inter-city rail franchises, though it lost the East Coast Main Line franchise earlier this year.
