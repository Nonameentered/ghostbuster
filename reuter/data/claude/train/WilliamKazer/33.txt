Asia Cautiously Welcomes Clinton's Appointments for Key Cabinet Posts 

Governments across Asia offered cautious praise for President-elect Hillary Clinton's cabinet appointments, welcoming experienced and familiar faces at the State Department and Pentagon while uncertainty remains over key economic posts.

Clinton's selection of Susan Rice as Secretary of State and Michele Flournoy as Secretary of Defense signals continuity in America's engagement with the region, according to statements from China, Japan, South Korea and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Rice, currently serving as national security advisor, and Flournoy, a former Pentagon official, are well known in Asian capitals and expected to champion strategic alliances and partnerships.

However, questions persist over Clinton's choices for Treasury Secretary and US Trade Representative, positions critical to economic ties with Asia. The narrow election victory left Clinton with little time to make key appointments before the January 20 inauguration, sources said, forcing her to delay some second-tier cabinet selections until later. Unfilled roles include  cabinet-rank positions overseeing trade, economics and commerce - at a time when the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal hangs in the balance.

While broadly welcoming Clinton's security team, China signaled it would closely monitor her economic and trade picks. The government aims to advance China's interests as the world's second-largest economy expands links with its neighbors, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang. He urged the new administration to "meet China halfway" on mutually beneficial cooperation.

Japan and South Korea also looked forward to continued close coordination on North Korea's nuclear program and territorial disputes with China. But officials privately voiced concerns over "worrisome protectionist tendencies" in America and pushed for early clarity on trade policy direction.ASEAN leaders committed to further deepen strategic ties with the US but called for Washington to uphold economic engagement and the rules-based international order.

The mix of optimism and caution reflects an abiding desire for stability and shared prosperity across a region wary of political upheaval and economic headwinds. While Clinton's foreign policy record offers reassurance, questions about the wider direction of her administration and uncertainty over unfilled economic roles have tempered an otherwise warm welcome for her national security team. The coming weeks will be crucial in shaping perceptions of America's role in Asia.
