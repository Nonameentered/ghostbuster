China takes cautious approach to tackling ailing state enterprises ahead of Communist Party congress 

Beijing (Reuters) - China is taking a cautious approach to reforms of its lumbering state-owned enterprises ahead of a key Communist Party congress this fall, avoiding bold moves that could damage already slowing economic growth. 

President Xi Jinping has made reforming China's sprawling state sector a key priority to improve economic efficiency and tackle bureaucratic infighting and waste. But with economic growth at its slowest pace in nearly 30 years, Beijing is moving carefully.

The Communist Party has long used state firms to assert its control over strategic parts of the economy, from telecommunications and transport to energy and heavy industry. Reforms of state firms have been halting, however, stymied by opposition from vested interests.

With its stability-obsessed leaders preparing for the 19th party congress in October, Beijing is unlikely to vigorously overhaul or cut loss-making "zombie" firms, economists say, despite warnings it will be impossible to meet official growth targets without urgent reforms.

"There is a problem with vested interests and they are very strong," said Xu Gao, chief economist at Everbright Securities in Beijing. "So this year, this sensitive year especially, the government will be cautious."

Modest goals, like improved governance and more central oversight of risk, are more likely than wholesale closures of troubled firms, government sources and analysts say.

The Ministry for Finance pledged in January to shut down "zombie" firms, but little progress has been reported. A "task force" formed to close steel mills and coal mines is also struggling.  

Some analysts argue more forceful reforms after the congress could hurt growth further. "Politically, it's not a good time," said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Hong Kong. "Every point of GDP is fairly precious."

There are modest signs of progress. The power, telecoms, railways and banking sectors have been opening further to private investment, while Beijing has also promised to reduce excess capacity in industries like steel and coal.

But without bolder moves, analysts question leaders' ability to meet key economic goals, like doubling GDP growth from 2020 levels by 2021.  

"They won't be able to achieve those high growth targets," said Collier at Orient Capital. "If they continue to rely on government spending and state companies to generate growth, it's not going to lead anywhere good."
