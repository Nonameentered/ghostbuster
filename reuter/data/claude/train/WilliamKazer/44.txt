China Cautions Against Reinforcing Military Alliances, Citing Persistence of Cold War Ideology  

Beijing warned Western nations today against strengthening military alliances that it sees as a relic of Cold War thinking. Speaking at a press briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that "certain countries should abandon the Cold War mentality, zero-sum game mindset, and ideological bias.” 

Wang's comments come as the U.S., India, Japan and Australia agreed in principle to cooperate on a range of defense initiatives at the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue meeting in New Delhi last week. The countries of the "Quad" pledged closer collaboration on maritime security, cyber security, counterterrorism and disaster relief. However, China views the grouping as an attempt by Western nations and their allies to counter its rise.

"We hope relevant countries will stick to peaceful development and cooperation, and avoid purposefully reinforcing military alliances and group confrontation," Wang said. He added that "forming exclusive cliques targeted at third parties" goes against regional peace and cooperation.

Tensions have been rising between China and its neighbors in recent years, particularly over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Last week, China issued a regulation requiring foreign ships entering Chinese territorial waters in the disputed Paracel Islands to report their movements. The new rule has been rejected by Vietnam, which also claims the islands.

China's warnings are unlikely to deter strengthened cooperation between the Quad members, who share concerns about China's growing military and economic assertiveness on the global stage. At the meeting, defense ministers and foreign ministers agreed to boost cooperation on COVID-19 assistance, maritime domain awareness, counterterrorism and cybersecurity. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the group's goal is to achieve a "free and open Indo-Pacific."

The Quad first met in 2004 but went into abeyance for a decade. Annual meetings restarted in 2017 amid China’s island-building in the South China Sea. While military exercises are not officially on the agenda, expanded cooperation on security issues points to a de facto military alignment, even if the Quad stops short of a formal military alliance. Maritime cooperation in particular, including joint naval drills, would likely raise Beijing's concerns over encirclement.

China will continue to push back against strengthened ties between the Quad members and what it perceives as threatening military pacts more broadly. But for now, the Quad appears determined to continue cooperation towards shaping a regional balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.
