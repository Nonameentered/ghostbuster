U.S. open to peaceful nuclear cooperation with China before accord fully implemented, says Secretary of State Christopher

The United States is willing to explore peaceful nuclear cooperation with China even before a pending bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement is fully implemented, Secretary of State Christopher said during his visit to Beijing today. 

Secretary Christopher met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and expressed the U.S.'s openness to nuclear cooperation in areas like nuclear energy, nuclear safety, and nonproliferation. "We have a landmark civil nuclear cooperation agreement in place, and we believe there are opportunities for cooperation even as we work through the process to implement it fully," Secretary Christopher said.

The U.S.-China civil nuclear cooperation agreement was signed in 2015 but still needs approval by both countries' legislatures before it can take effect. Secretary Christopher said the Trump administration is committed to implementing the agreement but also sees opportunities for nuclear cooperation in the interim, calling it "an area that should not wait for the formalities."

Minister Wang welcomed Secretary Christopher's remarks, saying China is willing and ready to expand mutually beneficial cooperation with the U.S. on nuclear energy and nuclear safety. "China attaches great importance to nuclear security and has always adhered to the principles of mutual respect, mutual understanding and mutual accommodation in developing relations with other countries," Minister Wang said.

Nonproliferation experts in Washington cautioned that any nuclear cooperation with China before the 2015 agreement takes effect could undermine the agreement's nonproliferation safeguards. "The Trump administration should be patient and make sure the agreement is fully implemented before rushing into nuclear cooperation, no matter how tempting it may be," said one expert at a Washington think tank. 

Secretary Christopher dismissed these concerns, saying that any cooperation with China on nuclear issues would adhere to the highest nonproliferation standards. He said the Trump administration believes engagement and cooperation, even in incremental steps, is the most effective path forward with China on civil nuclear issues.

The secretary's visit comes ahead of next month's G20 summit in Japan, where President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping plan to meet for trade talks. Secretary Christopher said he and Minister Wang also discussed trade, North Korea's denuclearization, and other issues in preparation for the Trump-Xi meeting.
