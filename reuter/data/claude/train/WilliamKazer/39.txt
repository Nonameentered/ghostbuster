US Sidesteps China's Premier Li Peng Over Tiananmen Square Link  

The United States government has taken the unusual step of refusing to meet with a visiting head of government from China. Premier Li Peng, China's second-most powerful leader, is in New York this week for the United Nations General Assembly. However, the White House and State Department have declined requests from the Chinese embassy for President Clinton or Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to meet with Li.

The snub is clearly linked to Li's role as China's premier during the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, in which the Chinese military violently crushed pro-democracy protests, killing hundreds of civilians. Li was a key leader during that crisis and endorsed the decision to use force against the student protesters.  

In the years since Tiananmen, Li has rarely traveled abroad, in part due to the likelihood of protests against him. His visit to the UN this week is the first time he has set foot on US soil since 1989. The White House has framed its refusal to meet as a "scheduling issue" but few observers are buying that explanation. 

"Li Peng has blood on his hands from Tiananmen and it's no surprise the US doesn't want to give him the respect and legitimacy that comes with a presidential meeting," said Jenny Lu, an analyst with Human Rights Watch. There are reports that Li's attendance at this year's General Assembly was in doubt due to the likelihood of vocal protests against him, an embarrassment that China sought to avoid.

Li gave a speech defending China's human rights record at the UN earlier this week, saying that China pursues "socialist legality with Chinese characteristics." He made no mention of Tiananmen Square. In the Li's absence, President Clinton instead met with the lower-ranking Chinese Foreign Minister and urged progress on human rights.

The snub of a head of government is almost unheard of in diplomatic circles. The White House argued that President Clinton's schedule did not allow time for a meeting, but most observers saw a deliberate choice to avoid being pictured shaking hands with Li. "There's no way the White House team would not have left time for Li Peng if they wanted to meet him," said a former US ambassador to China.  

China expressed its dissatisfaction with the US refusal to meet Premier Li. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson called it " wrongful behavior" that undermines the cooperative relationship between the two powers. However, China's options for direct retaliation seem limited. The US and China are currently negotiating a major trade deal, and China's leaders are unlikely to permanently damage the economic relationship over a symbolic snub.

The move by the Clinton administration will be seen by some as a principled stance, refusing to white wash the memory of Tiananmen and Li's role in the violent suppression of dissent. For others, it highlights the delicate balancing act required in managing the complex and often strained US-China relationship. Li may be leaving New York without the usual photo opportunities with US leaders, but China remains as powerful as ever on the global stage.
