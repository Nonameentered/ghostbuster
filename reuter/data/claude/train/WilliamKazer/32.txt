China Presses to Join WTO at Singapore Meeting  

Singapore - China made a strong push this week to join the World Trade Organization, lobbying trade ministers at a meeting in Singapore. China has sought for years to join the WTO, the body that sets the rules for global trade and provides a framework for resolving trade disputes.

Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister, met with trade representatives from the United States, European Union, and other WTO members on the sidelines of the Singapore meeting. In her meetings, Wu argued that China deserved to join the WTO based on economic reforms made over the last decade. "China's accession to the WTO will be win-win, benefiting both China and the WTO," Wu said in her opening remarks.

Some WTO members, especially the U.S., have blocked China's accession over concerns about unfair trading practices, intellectual property theft, and China's closed markets in some sectors. But support has been growing recently for China to join. "The question is no longer if China will join but when and how," said EU trade commissioner Pascal Lamy. The U.S. also signaled recently that it aims to reach a deal with China to pave the way for its WTO entry.

Still, difficult negotiations lie ahead. There are disagreements over China's status as a "market economy" and U.S. demands that China further open its markets to foreign competition. China maintains tight control over key industries like banking, telecommunications, and automotives. "China still needs to make significant progress to address our concerns," said U.S. trade representative Barshefsky. "But with political will on all sides, China's WTO entry could be secured next year."

China's accession to the WTO requires approval from existing members. The next ministerial meeting of the WTO will be held in Seattle in November, providing an opportunity for further talks on the issue. China hopes membership in the Geneva-based WTO will provide greater access to global markets and boost its growing but fragile economy. WTO membership for China, home to 1.2 billion consumers, would also represent the largest expansion of the global trading system since the end of World War II.
