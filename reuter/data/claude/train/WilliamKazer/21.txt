China and U.S. to Hold Talks on Trade Dispute Over Textile Sanctions

The United States and China have agreed to high-level talks next week aimed at resolving a growing trade dispute between the two economic powers. The dispute centers around U.S. sanctions against Chinese textile manufacturers, which China claims violate international trade rules. 

The White House announced that U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai will travel to Shanghai to meet with her Chinese counterparts, led by Commerce Minister Zhong Shan. The meetings, scheduled for March 15-16, will be the first face-to-face trade talks between the Biden administration and China's leadership.

At issue are duties of up to 50% that the Trump administration imposed on $300 billion of Chinese textiles and apparel in 2020. The U.S. claimed that China was illegally subsidizing textile companies and dumping products in the U.S. at below-market prices. China appealed the sanctions to the World Trade Organization, arguing that the Trump administration failed to follow proper procedures. The WTO is still reviewing China's claims.

The textile tariffs are one of several trade actions left over from the Trump era that have strained relations between Washington and Beijing. The Biden administration had hoped to stabilize the economic relationship with China after years of escalating tensions under Trump. However, China is insisting that the U.S. remove what it considers unjustified sanctions before broader trade negotiations can resume.  

U.S. apparel retailers have also called on the Biden administration to roll back the China textile tariffs, claiming that the duties have raised costs for consumers. However, the sanctions remain popular with U.S. textile manufacturers and unions. The upcoming talks in Shanghai will demonstrate whether the U.S. and China can find common ground to defuse tensions or if they remain on a collision course that could undermine the global economy.
