China Bans Poultry from Two US States Over Deadly Disease Outbreak 

China has banned poultry imports from two major US states after an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected. China’s ban comes as the US Department of Agriculture announced at least one case of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in chickens at a commercial farm in Kentucky. The deadly disease, also known as “bird flu,” is highly contagious and fatal to domesticated poultry.  

In response, China’s customs administration has suspended poultry imports from Kentucky and the surrounding state of Tennessee. China is the world’s second largest poultry consumer and importer, buying nearly $1 billion worth of US poultry meat last year. The ban is expected to last at least 90 days until the animal health risk is cleared. 

The USDA has quarantined the affected farm site and established a 6.2 mile control area and a 12.4 mile surveillance area around the location to limit the spread of the disease. All commercial and backyard poultry flocks within those areas will be tested and monitored for illness over the coming weeks. The USDA warns that the H5N1 strain can spread from birds to humans in rare cases, though no human infections have been detected in this outbreak.

Farmers and industry groups have expressed concern about the economic impact of China’s ban, especially following disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. “Any trade restrictions will have significant economic harm,” said a spokesperson for the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council. Kentucky's agricultural sector generated $5.8 billion from poultry and egg production last year. Officials say the key now is to contain the outbreak within the affected area.

The USDA is working with local and state partners to quarantine infected and at-risk flocks to limit the spread of the disease. Federal authorities will cull all infected birds to reduce the potential for further disease transmission. Enhanced biosecurity measures are also in effect, including disinfecting, controlling wildlife and rodents, and limiting human access to the property. Similar steps were taken during the last major US outbreak of avian flu in 2015 which led to the culling of over 48 million birds across 15 states.
