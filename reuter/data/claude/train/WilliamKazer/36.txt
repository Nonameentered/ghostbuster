China bans poultry from Missouri and Oklahoma due to outbreak of deadly disease 

China announced today that it is banning all poultry products from the states of Missouri and Oklahoma in response to an outbreak of a deadly avian disease in the Midwest. The ban is effective immediately and will continue indefinitely until the virus is contained, according to a statement from China's General Administration of Customs.

The ban comes after officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed more than a dozen cases of Eurasian H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as HPAI H5N1, across commercial and backyard poultry flocks in Missouri and Oklahoma. The disease, commonly known as bird flu, is deadly to birds and poultry but rarely infects humans. However, China views it as a threat to its domestic poultry industry and food supply.

"To effectively prevent the risk of the Eurasian H5 HPAI entering China, the Chinese side has decided to suspend the import of poultry meat products and live birds from Oklahoma and Missouri with immediate effect," the customs administration said. "The ban will be lifted after the Chinese and U.S. sides have taken satisfactory control measures and the epidemic has been eradicated."

The banning of poultry from two entire states by China is an aggressive move that goes beyond the limited import restrictions put in place by other U.S. trading partners in response to the outbreak, such as Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. It signals China's ongoing wariness about imported food safety issues after several recalls of U.S. agricultural products ranging from pork to pet food in recent years. The step also highlights China's immense buying power as the third largest market for U.S. poultry.

Economists said the poultry ban could cost the industry tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue if it persists for more than a few months. Missouri and Oklahoma are major producers of chicken, turkey, ducks and eggs, much of which is exported around the world. "China is such a major importer that this is deeply concerning, said James Williams, an agricultural economist at Texas A&M University. "Farmers depend on trade and this could deliver another blow."

The bird flu cases in Missouri and Oklahoma are the first detected in commercial poultry in the U.S. since 2017. State and federal officials have quarantined affected farms and are culling birds to contain the virus, but about 100,000 turkeys have already been euthanized. The USDA does not believe there are any public health concerns due to the outbreak at this point. Human infections of HPAI H5N1 are rare but have a 60% mortality rate.
