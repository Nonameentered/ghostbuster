China Echoes Alan Greenspan's "Irrational Exuberance" Warning to Stock Market Investors

China's top securities regulator warned investors about the risk of "irrational exuberance" in Chinese stock markets last week. Sounding an alarm similar to former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's famous warning about inflated asset values in 1996, the China Securities Regulatory Commission told investors not to expect rising stock prices without economic fundamentals to back them up.

The warning comes as China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has rallied over 36% so far this year, making it one of the best performing stock indexes in the world. The strong stock market performance has been fueled by bets on looser monetary policy in China to boost economic growth, as well as an influx of new individual investors opening brokerage accounts to invest in stocks. However, some analysts argue Chinese stocks have risen too far too fast given the modest pace of economic growth.

In a statement posted on its website, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said "irrational exuberance" in stock markets could lead to a "bubble" that harms the market. "Investors should remain rational and pay attention to risk," the regulator warned. The phrase "irrational exuberance" echoed Alan Greenspan's famous warning in a 1996 speech about overinflated asset prices. Greenspan's warning proved prescient, as a technology stock market bubble peaked and burst in 2000, sending the broader market into a bear market.

Like Greenspan in the 1990s, China's securities regulator is trying to temper expectations of investors clamoring to pile into a hot stock market. However, the regulator stopped short of announcing any policy changes or direct interventions to curb risky activity. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.2% the day after the regulator's warning, though it remains up by over a third for the year so far.
