Russia and China to Expand Economic Ties at Upcoming Meeting in Moscow

Senior officials from Russia and China are set to meet in Moscow this week to discuss strengthening economic and trade ties between the two nations. Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese premier Xi Jinping are expected to sign multiple agreements aimed at boosting cooperation on energy, infrastructure, and financial projects. 

The meeting comes as Russia is facing economic challenges due to low oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine. China is seeking new markets to invest its large foreign exchange reserves and excess industrial capacity. Expanding the economic partnership with China could provide a much-needed boost for Russia's economy. According to analysts, China has invested over $120 billion in Russia in recent years, with additional investments and financing deals expected to be announced in Moscow.

In the energy sector, Russian oil giant Rosneft aims to increase oil exports to China and PetroChina, China's largest oil producer, is interested in acquiring a stake in a gas field in eastern Siberia. China is also financing and constructing high-speed rail lines and highways in Russia to facilitate trade and transportation of goods between the two countries. 

On the financial side, the Moscow meeting may yield deals allowing Russian companies to issue bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The Central Bank of Russia has also reached a currency swap agreement with the People's Bank of China that will allow the two countries to conduct trade using local currencies instead of US dollars. Reducing dependence on the dollar is a strategic priority for both Russia and China.

Geopolitically, Russia and China share a view of the global order that stands in contrast with Western liberal democratic values. Strengthening the Moscow-Beijing axis is seen as a way for both countries to counterbalance the global influence of the United States. However, the partnership is one of convenience rather than a formal alliance, and the two sides still harbor some mutual distrust and competitiveness.

The upcoming high-level meeting will highlight the growing economic, political and diplomatic ties between Russia and China. While Western nations have become increasingly critical of Russia, China has become a crucial partner for Moscow both strategically and economically. The new agreements and deals expected to be signed this week will bind Russia and China closer together for years to come.
