China urges US to end curbs on technology exports to balance trade 

China has called on the United States to lift restrictions on technology exports to China in order to rebalance trade relations between the world's two largest economies. Speaking at a press conference, China's Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan said "The U.S. should stop overstretching the concept of national security and abuse of export control measures, and make fair and just ground rules."

The U.S. has placed a number of Chinese technology companies on the entity list, restricting them from purchasing U.S. components and software without a license. The U.S. says this is necessary to prevent critical technologies with military applications from reaching China's armed forces. However, China argues that most of the technologies are for civilian use and that the U.S. restrictions are aimed at curbing China's technological capabilities and global competitiveness.  

The technology exports curb is part of a broader dispute over trade and technology transfer between the U.S. and China that has led to a protracted trade war. The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, while China has retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. products. Despite over a year of negotiations, a comprehensive trade deal has remained elusive.

“The essence of China-U.S. economic and trade relations is mutually beneficial cooperation, not zero-sum competition,” said Zhong. He urged the U.S. to refrain from politicizing and weaponizing trade issues to restrict China's development. China remains open to dialog and consultation to find a solution, but it will also take necessary measures to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests, according to Zhong.

The technology export restrictions are unlikely to be lifted unless there are concessions from China on long-standing U.S. concerns such as intellectual property protection, forced technology transfer, and cyber theft. Achieving a balance in the trade and technology relationship between the U.S. and China remains challenging, especially as both sides see competition in advanced technologies as a key geopolitical priority. Barring a breakthrough, frictions over technology issues are expected to persist with uncertain consequences for global trade and growth.
