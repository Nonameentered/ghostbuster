China Opposes Taiwan Foreign Minister's Visit to Jordan, Accusing Island Rival of Disrupting Diplomatic Ties 

China has issued a rebuke of Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu's visit to Jordan, accusing the island rival of maliciously disrupting China's diplomatic relations and seeking independence. Wu met with Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi in Amman on Wednesday to discuss bilateral relations. The visit comes amid warming ties between Taiwan and Arab states, to the dismay of Beijing which considers Taiwan a province of China.

In a statement, China's Foreign Ministry said it was "firmly opposed to any forms of official exchanges between the Taiwan region and countries with which China has diplomatic relations." The Ministry called on Jordan to "abide by the one-China principle and properly handle Taiwan-related issues." China asserts that Taiwan does not have the right to establish diplomatic ties with other nations or join international organizations like the World Health Organization. Most countries follow the "One China" policy and do not formally recognize Taiwan as an independent nation.

Taiwan hailed the meeting as an "important milestone" in boosting ties with Jordan and other partners in the Middle East. The island seeks to strengthen unofficial relations and increase trade with regional countries that do not have formal diplomatic relations with Taipei. Jordan has maintained diplomatic relations with China since 1977 but also engages in economic and cultural ties with Taiwan.

The spat highlights rising tensions between China and Taiwan under Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who Beijing accuses of pushing for Taiwan's formal independence. Tsai's government rejects China's assertion that Taiwan is a province of China, saying only the island's 23 million people can decide their future. The rival claims to sovereignty have added volatility to the geopolitics of East Asia. China has stepped up diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan, flying fighter jets and conducting targeted misinformation campaigns against the Tsai administration.

Taiwan will not be deterred from engaging with partners in the region, Wu said. But as long as most nations follow the One China policy, Taiwan's ambitions for full international participation face significant challenges. Wednesday's meeting signals Jordan's intention  to continue unofficial ties with Taiwan despite China's objections, adding friction to an increasingly fraught situation across the Taiwan Strait.
