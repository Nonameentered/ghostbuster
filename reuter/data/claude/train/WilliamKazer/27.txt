China and U.S. Agree to Push Sino-American Ties Forward in Highest-Level Visit in Two Years 

Beijing, China - In the highest-level visit between China and the U.S. in two years, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with top Chinese officials in Shanghai today. Secretary Blinken met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and highlighted the Biden administration's intention to strengthen lines of communication and cooperation with China.

The meeting signals a willingness by both sides to stabilize a relationship that deteriorated under the Trump administration. There were no major breakthroughs, but both sides described the talks as "constructive" and committed to pushing the relationship forward in a "positive direction." The two diplomats discussed security, trade, human rights, climate change, and the coronavirus pandemic. 

"The alternative to cooperation is competition and even confrontation," Wang told reporters. "A healthy and stable China-U.S. relationship serves the interests of both sides."

Secretary Blinken affirmed America's commitment to "uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait." The issue of Taiwan has been a flashpoint, as China considers the self-governing democratic island as a province awaiting reunification. Blinken also raised concerns over human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. In response, Wang Yi defended China's policy in Xinjiang and said Hong Kong affairs were China's internal business.

On trade and technology, the diplomats pledged cooperation and to address areas of disagreement. But there were no indications of progress on issues like lifting of tariffs, subsidies to state firms, and U.S. blacklisting of Chinese tech companies.  Climate change is seen as a promising area for bilateral cooperation in the lead up to COP26 conference in November, according to a senior Biden administration official.

The meeting suggests China and the U.S. want to compartmentalize areas of disagreement to focus on finding common ground.  While a single round of talks won't resolve long-standing differences, both sides came with a shared purpose to bring more normalcy and stability to the most consequential geopolitical relationship in the world today. The visit lays the groundwork for more substantive engagements to come, including a potential first summit between President Biden and President Xi.
