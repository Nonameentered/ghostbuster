China Declares End to Austerity Programme, Shifts Focus to Stability and Reform

The Chinese government announced today the conclusion of its multi-year austerity drive aimed at reducing corruption and curbing lavish spending by government officials. The austerity programme began in 2012 under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and was seen as a way to address public anger over growing inequality and perceptions of elite excess. 

In a statement, the Communist Party's central commission for discipline inspection said the austerity campaign had achieved its goals. "The objectives and tasks of the austerity work since the 18th National Congress have been comprehensively completed," the statement said. With the campaign now ended, the government said it would shift its focus to maintaining economic and political stability in the face of slowing growth and uncertainty over trade tensions with the United States.

The austerity drive was one of Xi's first major initiatives after taking over as leader of the party in 2012. It included measures such as banning lavish banquets, restricting use of public funds for travel and entertainment, and scrutinizing officials' behaviour to eliminate conspicuous consumption. The campaign targeted China's bloated state sector, attempting to make Communist cadres more frugal and curb corruption.

Observers say the campaign has succeeded in addressing some of the public's concerns about official waste and greed. But it has also been criticized for going too far in some instances and damaging economic activity dependent on government spending. Ending the austerity drive is seen as an attempt to bolster confidence among officials and boost government-backed economic activity.  

The shift to "stability and reform" signals the government will focus on maintaining steady growth and progressing with market-oriented economic reforms, while also strengthening its hold on power amid a slower economy. However, continued measures to stamp out corruption and hold officials accountable to the public will still be in place, the government said. The austerity campaign may have ended, but the wider anti-corruption effort continues. Overall, the announcement marks an inflection point as China's leadership looks ahead to new challenges on the horizon.
