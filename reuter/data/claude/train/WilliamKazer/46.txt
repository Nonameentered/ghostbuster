China Hails Deng Xiaoping as Key Player in Regaining Hong Kong in New Documentary

The Chinese government has released a new documentary highlighting the role of former leader Deng Xiaoping in negotiating the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. The 70-minute film, titled "Deng Xiaoping and the Return of Hong Kong,” premiered on state television this week. It celebrates Deng as the visionary leader who made regaining sovereignty over Hong Kong possible after more than a century of British rule.

The documentary details how Deng pushed for talks with Britain in the early 1980s to discuss the return of Hong Kong to China. Britain had taken control of Hong Kong island in 1841 after the First Opium War and expanded control to include more territories in the ensuing decades. By the 1980s, the original 99-year lease on the so-called New Territories was nearing expiration, raising questions about the future governance of Hong Kong.

Deng proposed that China and Britain enter negotiations over the return of the entire Hong Kong region, not just the New Territories. Despite opposition from some in the Communist Party leadership, Deng prevailed. Talks began with Britain in 1982 and culminated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong in 1984, in which Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to China in 1997.

The new documentary highlights Deng’s foresight in pushing for reunification and his willingness to guarantee Hong Kong’s autonomy and way of life after the handover. It uses archival footage and interviews with policymakers from that era to portray Deng as a visionary leader who made a “great historic decision” that strengthened China's sovereignty.

Deng is commonly viewed as the leader who opened China to economic reforms and the outside world after the death of Mao Zedong. Regaining control of Hong Kong is frequently cited as one of Deng’s most significant foreign policy accomplishments. The new film aims to further cement Deng’s status as the leader who made China's return to global prominence possible, in part through the repossession of Hong Kong.

The release of the film comes as China is exerting more control over Hong Kong in ways that critics argue threaten the “high degree of autonomy” the territory was promised after the handover. The U.S. has declared that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to merit special treatment in trade and other relations. China appears eager to highlight the original terms of the handover in response. The new documentary is part of a broader push to portray strict Chinese control and sovereignty over Hong Kong as inevitable and in line with the vision of the country's paramount modern leader, Deng Xiaoping.
