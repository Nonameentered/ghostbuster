Apple Reports $120 Million Loss in Q1, Warns Investors of Continued Struggles Until September 

Tech giant Apple reported a surprising loss of $120 million in its first fiscal quarter of 2021, a sharp downturn from the $55 billion profit in the same period last year. Apple CEO Tim Cook warned investors that supply chain disruptions and chip shortages would continue to hamper the company's performance over the next two quarters. Apple’s stock plummeted over 7% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

The Q1 loss stunned Wall Street analysts who were expecting Apple to report a healthy profit for the quarter. However, the ongoing global chip shortage that has hobbled industries from automakers to consumer electronics appears to have finally caught up to Apple. In a call with analysts, Cook said that while demand remained very strong for Apple products, the company simply could not manufacture or ship enough devices to meet customer needs. 

“We faced greater than anticipated supply constraints, especially for our iPhones and Mac laptops, due to semiconductor shortages that significantly hampered our production capabilities,” Cook said. “While we expect these supply chain issues to continue impacting us through Q3, they should gradually recover to normal levels starting in early 2022. But we want investors to go into this quarter and next with realistic expectations.”

In particular, Apple was not able to produce enough of its flagship iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max models, which carry higher profit margins. iPhone revenue declined over 30% as a result. Mac laptop sales were also down by 25% due to production issues. However, Cook noted that demand for these higher-end products remained very robust, an optimistic signal once supply issues get resolved.

Cook promised that Apple has been working closely with its suppliers and chip manufacturers to remedy the situation as quickly as possible but noted that the global chip shortage would not have a quick or easy fix. “While we aim to minimize these supply chain woes, the realities of the current environment mean we will not be back to typical levels for another couple of quarters,” Cook said. 

investors are likely to remain cautious until Apple can demonstrate solid performance again. But if Apple can return to full production capacity in time for the busy holiday season and launch of its next iPhone 13, the company may still be able finish 2021 on a high note and put this rare stumble behind it.
