Informix Corp. Files Lawsuit Against Oracle Corp. Over Alleged Trade Secret Theft 

Informix Corporation, a database software company based in Menlo Park, California, filed a lawsuit today against rival Oracle Corporation alleging theft of trade secrets. The lawsuit claims that Oracle illegally obtained proprietary source code and other intellectual property from Informix to help speed development of competing database products.

According to the complaint filed in San Mateo County Superior Court, a former Informix software engineer named James Smith recently left the company to take a position at Oracle. Informix claims that Smith had access to highly sensitive technical information, including source code for a next-generation cloud-based database currently under development. 

Informix alleges that Smith downloaded more than 10,000 files containing trade secrets and other proprietary data before leaving Informix last month. The company claims that Smith has already shared some of this information with engineers at Oracle, enabling Oracle to fast-track development of a competing cloud database product.

“Informix invests heavily in software innovation, and our trade secrets and intellectual property are essential business assets,” said Tom Jones, CEO of Informix, in a written statement. “We take their protection very seriously and will pursue all legal means necessary against anyone attempting to steal them.”

Oracle denied the allegations and pledged to vigorously defend itself in court. In a statement, an Oracle spokesperson called the lawsuit “a desperate attempt by Informix to slow Oracle’s progress in developing next-generation cloud database products. We have strict policies against the improper use of others’ intellectual property, and we see no evidence those policies were violated here.”

If proven, the theft of trade secrets can carry both civil and criminal penalties. Informix is seeking unspecified monetary damages as well as an injunction preventing Oracle and Smith from using or distributing the allegedly stolen intellectual property. The case is still pending in the San Mateo courts. Informix and Oracle have a long history as fierce competitors in the $50 billion database software market.
