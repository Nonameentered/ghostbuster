Apple Reports $120 Million Loss, Expects to Return to Profitability by September   

Apple Inc. reported a loss of $120 million in the second quarter of 2020, the company's first quarterly loss in nearly 20 years. The loss comes as Apple suffered major supply chain disruptions and a decrease in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple closed all of its retail stores outside of China in March and April, which significantly impacted sales of iPhones, iPads, and other products.   

Revenue for the quarter declined to $45 billion, down from $58 billion a year earlier. The loss contrasts with a profit of $13 billion in the same quarter last year. International sales accounted for 61% of Apple's revenue for the quarter.  

"Despite COVID-19's unprecedented global impact, we're proud to report that Apple grew in Q2 driven by an all-time record in Services and a quarterly record for Wearables," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "Apple is in a strong financial position, and we're confident in our long-term strategy and the strength of our offerings and teams."

The decline in iPhone sales from fewer people visiting stores and carriers was the biggest driver of the revenue drop and loss. Apple expects the loss to be temporary as production ramps back up and retail stores start to reopen. The company forecasts a return to modest revenue growth and profitability next quarter. 

"We have temporarily closed some of our offices and retail stores, and have placed additional restrictions at other locations based on the advice of governments and health experts. At the same time, we are continuing to execute on business priorities ranging from new product development to supply chain diversification," said Luca Maestri, Appleâ€™s CFO.

Apple's board of directors approved a cash dividend of $0.82 per share, up 6 percent. The company expects international sales to make up 59-61% of revenue in the third quarter. Apple is set to hold its Worldwide Developers Conference virtually next month, where it may unveil new software features for its various devices. The company aims to launch new 5G iPhones later this year which could spur a new upgrade cycle and boost sales, though some analysts worry economic conditions may lead consumers to delay discretionary technology purchases. Overall, Apple remains optimistic about growth opportunities and its trajectory to return improved quarterly profits by the fourth quarter ending in September.
