Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio Assures Investors of Three-Year Turnaround Plan Despite First-Quarter Losses 

Apple Computer Inc. Chairman and CEO Gilbert Amelio today reassured investors that the company's turnaround efforts are on track, despite reporting a $708 million loss in the first quarter of 1997. Speaking at the company's annual shareholder meeting, Amelio said he expects Apple to return to profitability within three years under his recovery plan.

The quarterly loss, Apple's largest in five years, highlights the significant challenges the company faces in reviving its fortunes. However, Amelio emphasized that the results were anticipated and are not a sign that the turnaround strategy is faltering. "Apple's recovery is progressing according to plan. The numbers will take a couple of years to turn fully positive, but our internal projections show we are making progress," Amelio said.

Amelio was named CEO of Apple in February last year and initiated a major restructuring to cut costs as sales of the company's Macintosh computers declined in the face of price competition from other PC makers. The turnaround plan involves reducing operating costs by $400 million, returning the Mac to stable growth, and maintaining a strong cash balance of over $1 billion.

The first-quarter results saw revenues drop to $1.58 billion from $1.87 billion a year ago, while number of Macintosh units sold declined 16 percent. However, Amelio said new product releases later this year, including the next-generation Power Macintosh and Newton devices, will help reinvigorate growth. He also pointed to a stabilization in Macintosh market share and higher gross margins as signs the turnaround is gaining traction.

Investor reaction was mixed following the meeting. Some analysts expressed renewed faith in Amelio's strategy, but others argue the scale of losses raises doubts about whether a full recovery is possible. Apple's stock price closed down 2 percent for the day at $12.75, continuing a recent downward trend.

Amelio acknowledged the skepticism but said he remains confident in the company's trajectory. "The road ahead is not short, and it won't always be smooth. But we have a good plan, we have the right products, and we are making progress every day. Apple's best days are still in front of it." The company will need to demonstrate improved quarterly results soon, however, to back up Amelio's assertions and win over critics. For now, Apple's long-heralded turnaround remains very much a work in progress.
