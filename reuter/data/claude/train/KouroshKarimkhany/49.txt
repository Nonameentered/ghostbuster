Video Game Industry Bounces Back with Strong December Quarter Results  

The video game industry rebounded strongly in the final three months of 2020, boosted by the release of highly anticipated new gaming consoles and several blockbuster titles. According to new data from industry tracker NPD Group, U.S. consumer spending on video gaming in the December quarter spiked 25% to $19 billion, driven by more people staying at home during the pandemic and turning to games for entertainment and escapism.

Spending on video game content, including full games, expansion packs, and subscriptions, rose 24% to $13.9 billion in the quarter. The biggest contributors to the growth were new installments of hit franchises like Cyberpunk 2077, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Spending on gaming hardware more than doubled to $4.2 billion, thanks to the late November launches of the PlayStation 5 console from Sony and Microsoft's Xbox Series X.

“The fourth quarter marked a great ending to an extraordinary year for the U.S. gaming industry,” said NPD analyst Mat Piscatella. “Spending growth was broad-based across platforms, accessory categories, and content types as new console launches and popular existing and new franchises drove sales.”

While overall retail sales of video game products declined about 3% over the full year, the fourth quarter results suggest the gaming industry has proved resilient during the pandemic. According to NPD Group, total consumer spending on video game content in 2020 reached $56.9 billion, a new annual record and up 13% year over year.

Looking ahead, analysts expect spending on gaming to rise further in 2021 with more people receiving new consoles and gaming PCs as holiday gifts, and as additional PS5 and Xbox Series X supplies become available. The gaming industry should also benefit from major titles slated for release this year, including Horizon Forbidden West, Dragon Age 4, and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2.
