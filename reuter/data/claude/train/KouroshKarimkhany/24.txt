Comdex 1996 to Showcase Handheld Computers and DVD Technology 

Comdex, the giant consumer electronics show, kicks off next week in Las Vegas and attendees can expect to see two technologies take center stage: handheld computers and DVD players. Handheld computers, also known as personal digital assistants or PDAs, are becoming smaller, more powerful, and gaining wireless connectivity. DVD players are poised to replace VCRs as the mainstream movie playback device in homes around the world.

On the handheld computer front, look for new models from industry leaders like Palm Computing, Microsoft, and others. Palm will likely show off a new color version of its popular PalmPilot organizer. Microsoft is rumored to be planning to unveil "Jupiter," its long-awaited Windows CE-based clamshell PDA. Combined with wireless modems, these new handhelds will allow people to check email, browse web pages, and access information from anywhere.

In the DVD arena, numerous consumer electronics companies will demonstrate DVD players that are faster, include more features, and are aggressively priced to compete with VCRs. DVDs offer significant advantages over VHS tapes, including higher audio and video quality, durability, and smaller size. Leading DVD player makers like Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba, and newcomers like Samsung will all have new models on display at Comdex. Most will play DVDs and CDs, and many will also play MP3 digital music files, providing an all-in-one entertainment device for living rooms.  

With the backdrop of the Las Vegas skyline, Comdex is the ideal venue for companies to generate buzz around new technologies like handheld computers, DVD players, and the many other innovations on display. Over 200,000 attendees are expected to flock to the show, representing computer resellers, software developers, technology enthusiasts, and everyday consumers. While the sprawling show floor can be overwhelming, it provides a glimpse into the exciting future of consumer electronics and computing. For those unable to attend, tune into the live web streams and nightly recaps to see what's new, what's hot, and what may be headed to a store near you. The future is at Comdex.
