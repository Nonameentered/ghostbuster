Semiconductor Industry's Key Indicator of Computer Chip Demand Reaches Highest Level of the Year in September  

The global semiconductor industry received an upbeat signal regarding demand for computer chips and other digital components in September. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today reported that worldwide sales of semiconductors reached $115.8 billion in September, the highest monthly total so far this year. This marks a year-over-year increase of 33.4% from September 2020 and reflects continued strong demand for chips that power technologies spanning from automobiles and mobile devices to computing platforms and healthcare equipment.

"Global semiconductor sales have increased sharply and consistently throughout 2021, reflecting the pivotal and growing role chips play in so many industries and technologies that enrich our lives," said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO. "Sales into the Americas region were up especially strongly in September compared to last year, while all major markets experienced significant sales increases. On a year-to-date basis, 2021 global semiconductor sales are projected to eclipse the total annual sales of 2020 before the end of October."  

The strong September sales numbers suggest the worldwide chip shortage that has affected many tech sectors may be starting to improve, though full supply chain corrections often take multiple quarters. Monthly sales are a leading indicator of demand across major electronic equipment markets, so the September uptick bodes well for continued strength in technologies that rely on semiconductors for the remainder of 2021 and into 2022. Regionally, sales were up significantly across all major markets: China (34.8%), Europe (29%), Japan (28.4%), Americas (34%), and Asia Pacific/All Other (35.1%) compared with September 2020.  

Continued strong global demand for certain devices like smartphones, tablets, and notebooks as well as increasing semiconductor content in automobiles and various home devices have fueled much of the growth. Wireless technologies including 5G and Wi-Fi 6 are also driving more demand for connected chipsets and semiconductors. Barring any unforeseen global events, industry analysts predict the worldwide semiconductor market should finish 2021 markedly higher, with double-digit growth over 2020's total of $433 billion. The SIA report is based on sales figures compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization.
