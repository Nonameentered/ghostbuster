Novell to License Key Technology to Expand Revenue Sources

Novell, a pioneer in network operating systems, announced today that it will begin licensing some of its key technology to other software and hardware vendors in an effort to open up new revenue streams. The 35-year-old company, based in Provo, Utah, has historically sold complete enterprise network solutions, but shrinking market share has led Novell to pursue a strategy to license components of its technology to partners and competitors. 

Novell plans to make its ZENworks configuration management suite available for licensing to third parties for the first time. ZENworks allows IT administrators to remotely install software, patches, and operating systems on networked desktops, laptops, and servers. Novell hopes that by opening up ZENworks to other vendors, the technology will become an industry standard and Novell will earn revenue from licensing fees. Novell also expects ZENworks to fuel sales of its flagship SUSE Linux Enterprise Server product since the technologies are integrated.

Novell also announced a deal to license its identity and security technology to Microsoft, allowing Microsoft to integrate support for Novellâ€™s OpenID single sign-on software into the Windows operating system. Microsoft will pay Novell a licensing fee for each copy of Windows that includes the OpenID technology. Novell indicated the deal could bring in revenue of over $100 million if OpenID becomes widely used for web authentication. 

The new licensing strategy reflects the shift in Novell's business model from primarily selling software to generating recurring revenue from subscriptions, services, and now licensing deals. Novell CEO Janice Mills said in a statement, "Novell has built up a tremendous portfolio of innovative technologies over the years, and now it is time to start generating more value from these investments through commercial partnerships and licensing."

However, some analysts are skeptical about whether licensing deals can really move the needle for Novell. "Licensing revenue is not going to replace Novell's declining software sales or significantly reshape its overall business in the short term," said Amy Keller, an analyst with Technology Business Research. Novell's share price was up just 1.5% on the announcement, indicating most investors also remain unconvinced the deals will have a major impact. Still, licensing key technologies could represent an additional $200-$500 million in annual revenue for Novell over the next few years if the company is able to sign more deals at advantageous terms. For a company struggling to redefine itself, that may well be worth the try.
