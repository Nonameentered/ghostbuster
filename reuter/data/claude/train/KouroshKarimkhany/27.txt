Corporate Computer Buyers Drive PC Sales at Comdex Trade Show 

The annual Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas is concluding another successful year, boosted by strong sales to corporate and business buyers. While consumer interest in PCs has declined in recent years, corporations and government agencies have continued upgrading their technology infrastructure. This trend was on display at Comdex this week.

Major PC makers like Dell, HP, and Lenovo reported brisk sales of desktop and laptop computers to business customers. Dell said sales of its commercial PC  products increased 18% over last year's Comdex show. An HP executive noted that for every consumer PC sale, the company made three sales to business and government clients. Lenovo also cited higher demand for its ThinkPad business laptops and other commercial devices.  

The appetite for business PCs highlights the ongoing digital transformation of companies and government organizations. Firms are investing heavily in new technology to boost productivity, cut costs, and gain a competitive advantage. Upgraded PCs enable new digital capabilities like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and more. With many office workers now remote, demand for enterprise-level laptops has also surged.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has hurt many areas of the economy, the technology sector has proven resilient. Tech companies enabling remote work, delivery services, and online commerce have thrived. The shift to remote work and learning specifically has driven higher sales of PCs and other devices that power virtual offices and classrooms.  

Despite its virtual format this year, Comdex attracted more than 100,000 attendees looking to check out the latest software, gadgets, and other technology services. However, the biggest buyers were large corporate delegations looking to make major purchases and form new partnerships. The annual event has become an important venue for business-to-business technology deals and alliances.  

Though consumer interest in PCs has declined from the early 2000s, the computer industry continues to benefit from demand for powerful and reliable machines by enterprises. While gadgets come and go, it seems the PC will remain an important productivity tool for businesses and their workers for years to come. Overall, Comdex and its exhibitors benefited once more from the steady and growing needs of the corporate technology market.
