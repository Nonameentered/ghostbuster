Apple buys NeXT Software and rehires Steve Jobs, but analysts unsure if it will boost market share or profits

Apple dropped a bombshell on Wall Street and the tech world this week by announcing the acquisition of NeXT Software for $400 million and the return of Steve Jobs as an adviser to Apple's interim CEO, Gil Amelio. Apple has been struggling to remain competitive in the personal computing market and is hoping that the move will boost its fortunes and help it regain market share lost to competitors like Microsoft and Dell.

Steve Jobs founded NeXT Software in 1985 after being ousted as Apple's CEO in a power struggle. NeXT developed advanced operating systems and software used by corporate and government clients. Initially seen as a rival to Apple, NeXT could never achieve significant market share or profits on its own. After more than a decade of struggling as an independent company, NeXT agreed to be acquired by Apple in a deal that brings Jobs back into the fold of the company he co-founded.

The deal is a merger of former rivals and a roll of the dice by Apple, which after cutting thousands of jobs and closing some operations is trying to find its footing. Whether the acquisition of NeXT and the return of Jobs will boost Apple's bottom line remains uncertain, according to analysts tracking the tech sector.

"Apple desperately needs a spark that can restart its growth, and it's betting that Steve Jobs and NeXT Software can provide that," said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a consulting firm in Campbell, Calif. But Mr. Bajarin cautioned that "it will still take outstanding new products, good marketing and world-class innovation to help Apple boost its market share."

Other analysts echoed that view. "The deal is definitely an unexpected turn of events and brings Apple full circle with Jobs and NeXT," said Megan Graham-Hackett, an analyst at Dataquest Research. "However, Apple still faces significant challenges to differentiate itself and its products. Acquisitions alone will not solve that problem." She added that "Apple has a long way to go before it can truly challenge Microsoft in terms of market dominance."
