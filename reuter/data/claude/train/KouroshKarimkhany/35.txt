Apple Chairman announces plan to revamp Macintosh with Next Software at Macworld trade show 

In a surprise announcement today at the Macworld trade show in Boston, Apple Chairman Steve Jobs unveiled plans to revamp the Macintosh computer line by incorporating software from Next, the company Jobs founded after being ousted from Apple in 1985. Jobs rejoined Apple as interim CEO last year after Apple acquired Next for $400 million.

In his keynote address, Jobs said that Apple will incorporate Next's operating system, called NextSTEP, into the Mac OS. This will allow Macintosh computers to run programs designed for NextSTEP as well as existing Mac software. "By including NextSTEP, we will make the Macintosh platform open, scalable, and able to run a variety of applications," said Jobs.

The move is seen as a way for Apple to modernize its computer line, which has struggled in recent years to match the success of Windows-based PCs. The Macintosh continues to be popular with schools and creative professionals, but has failed to gain broader adoption. NextSTEP is respected for its advanced software capabilities, but the company's proprietary hardware failed to find a large audience. 

"This signals that Apple is finally willing to embrace open systems and industry standards," said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies. "The addition of NextSTEP means that the Mac can run a variety of applications from different sources, not just those coded specifically for the Mac."

However, some analysts warn there are risks to incorporating NextSTEP. "Apple will face technical challenges in melding the Mac OS and NextSTEP, and there may be software incompatibilities that frustrate users," said Kathleen Allen of Infoworld. "There is also a question of how developers and customers will respond. Will they embrace a mixed Mac/NextSTEP platform or be turned off by the confusion?"

Jobs acknowledged there will be difficulties, but said "the promise of a reinvigorated Mac platform is worth it." He promised that Apple would work to minimize disruption for developers and ensure backward compatibility for user applications. Jobs did not provide a specific timetable for the new Mac/NextSTEP software but said the first wave of changes would be announced by fall with new product releases scheduled for early next year.

The announcement is a stunning development for Next, which only a few years ago was struggling to stay alive. But the acquisition by Apple gives Next's innovative technology and Jobs a second chance to play a leading role in shaping the future of desktop computing. For Apple and the Macintosh, it may be the company's best hope for regaining its reputation as an industry innovator.
