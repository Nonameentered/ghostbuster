Macromedia Inc. shares plummet after unexpected Q3 loss and potential weak sales ahead  

Shares of Macromedia Inc. plunged over 40% today after the company announced an unexpected loss for the third quarter and cautioned that future sales could be weak. The company, which makes popular software tools for web developers like Dreamweaver and Flash, reported a loss of $12.3 million or 20 cents per share for the quarter ended September 30. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to earn 3 cents per share in the quarter.  

Revenue for the quarter rose just 2% to $113.4 million, far below analysts' estimates of $127 million. In a statement, Macromedia CEO Stephen Elop attributed the poor results to a general slowdown in technology spending as well as increased competition. "The overall IT spending environment has been challenging this year, and that affected demand for our products in the quarter," Elop said. He warned that the difficult environment is likely to continue in the fourth quarter, the company's fiscal year-end.

Investors reacted swiftly and negatively to the report. As of midday trading, Macromedia shares had fallen $8.94 to $13.12, a decline of over 40% from yesterday's close. At its high point in March, Macromedia stock traded above $45 per share. The sharp drop erased nearly $1.5 billion in market value for the company.

 Several analysts downgraded their ratings and earnings estimates for Macromedia following the report. "Obviously this was an incredibly disappointing quarter from Macromedia, and the implications for the broader technology sector are not good," said Rajesh Jain, an analyst with JP Morgan. "Given the weak demand and competitive pressures cited by management, we have little confidence current growth levels can be sustained next year."

Macromedia's business has long been dependent on sales of web design tools like Dreamweaver, which helps web developers build and maintain websites. But Dreamweaver now faces low-cost or open-source competition, putting pressure on pricing. Macromedia is also attempting to diversify into new product areas like business software, but those efforts are still nascent. If technology spending stays weak, Macromedia may face significant challenges to reinvigorate sales and return to growth. With today's stock plunge, Macromedia has its work cut out in restoring investor confidence and turning around its business.
