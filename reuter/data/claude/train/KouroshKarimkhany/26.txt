Corporate Computer Buyers Drive Sales at Comdex Trade Show 

The Comdex trade show in Las Vegas this week saw strong sales and attendance, fueled by renewed interest from corporate technology buyers. The show, which is focused on business computing, networking, and communications products, had struggled in recent years due to a weak economy and the rise of competing trade shows. However, this year over 200,000 attendees flooded the conference halls and a number of companies reported double-digit increases in sales and leads generated at the event.

The booming sales at Comdex were driven primarily by large enterprises looking to upgrade outdated technology infrastructure and invest in new systems to enable digital transformation initiatives. "We've seen a significant uptick in sales to Fortune 1000 companies this year, many of which didn't attend Comdex last year or the year before," said Mike Foster, CEO of network security firm Firewall Inc. His company landed six-figure deals with multiple Fortune 500 firms at the show.  

The return of big corporate spenders to Comdex will be welcome news to sponsors and exhibitors, many of whom have long relied on the show to reach new customers and generate end-of-year revenue. Tom Gorham, VP of Sales at data storage leader Hard Drives Unlimited noted, "Comdex represents over 20% of our total annual sales in an average year. The last few years at the show have been lean, so we went in with lower expectations. But sales this week exceeded even our most optimistic forecasts."   

Industry analysts say Comdex provides a unique platform for companies to connect with CIOs and other senior IT executives from major companies all in one place. "Even with growth in digital communications, there's no substitute for face-to-face meetings and relationship building with key customers," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group. The show's organizers were also pleased about the turnaround and announced dates for Comdex 2019 shortly after the show floor closed, signaling their confidence in the event's future. Overall, Comdex 2018 proved that in-person technology conferences and trade shows still remain an important channel for enterprise technology companies to land big deals.
