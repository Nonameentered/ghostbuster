Apple's Expected Loss of $100-150 Million in First Quarter is a Setback for Comeback Plan, Analysts Say

Apple Inc. is expected to report a loss of $100 million to $150 million for the quarter ending March 31, according to analysts, marking a major setback for the company's comeback efforts. The loss would be Apple's  first quarterly deficit in five years and highlights the steep challenges facing the company as it tries to turn around slumping sales.

The anticipated shortfall in the first quarter results is a blow to Apple's new chief executive, John Sculley, who took over from Steve Jobs earlier this year with a mandate to revitalize the company. Mr. Sculley has embarked on a reorganization plan aimed at trimming Apple's costs and improving its marketing to regain market share lost to competitors like Dell and Gateway. But analysts said the expected first-quarter loss shows how difficult a road Apple faces. 

“The loss is a wake-up call that Apple has a long way to go to get back to consistent profitability and growth,” said Daniel Morgan, a technology analyst at investment bank Goldman Sachs. “Sculley has talked a good game about a turnaround, but proving it will be challenging and will take time.”

The expected loss would compare with a profit of $150 million to $170 million in the period a year earlier. Analysts said sagging sales of Apple's Macintosh computers accounted for much of the decline. While sales of Windows PCs continue to grow, sales of Macintosh computers fell 10 to 15 percent in the first quarter, analysts estimated. "Apple's sales troubles really reflect how out of sync their products are with today's marketplace," said Steve Baker, an analyst at NPD Research. 

In response, Mr. Sculley has moved to cut costs, announcing plans to lay off 5 percent of Apple's workforce. He has also shifted marketing dollars away from traditional print and TV ads, investing more in social media and online influencers to spread the word about new Macintosh computers and other products on platforms like YouTube and Instagram. 

Mr. Sculley declined to comment on the expected quarterly results ahead of their official release. But in an interview, he expressed confidence in Apple's turnaround plan. “Turnarounds take time, but we are making progress and continuing to innovate in ways that will delight our customers," he said.

Still, analysts said the expected first-quarter loss highlights the long road ahead for Mr. Sculley's comeback efforts and the uncertainty about whether he can revive Apple's flagging fortunes. The results for the full fiscal year will provide a clearer verdict on the company's progress, analysts said. But for now, they expect rocky results ahead.
