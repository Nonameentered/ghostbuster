Apple Computer Inc. stock sinks as company predicts major loss in latest quarter

Tech giant Apple Computer Inc. announced today that it expects to report a significant loss in revenue and earnings for the latest quarter ending September 30. The company said sales of its flagship products, the iPhone and MacBook, have declined steeply in recent months. In response, Apple stock plunged over 10% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

The revelation of a major financial hit stunned Wall Street analysts, who had anticipated continued growth and strong sales from the maker of popular consumer electronics and devices. However, Apple admitted today that its recent quarterly results will likely show the company's first year-over-year revenue decline since 2016 and its first drop in quarterly profit since 2017. 

“We are certainly disappointed by these results,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a statement. “Demand for our products has not matched our own forecasts, and we clearly misjudged the appetite for some of our latest offerings.” 

The news is a major setback for Apple, which briefly became the first US company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization last year but has struggled with slowing growth and sales in China and other markets. The company blamed decreased demand for the iPhone, especially the latest editions like the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, as well as sluggish sales of the newest MacBook laptop models. 

Revenue from the critical iPhone product is projected to drop over 25% compared to the same period last year. The decline underscores concerns that Apple has failed to introduce breakthrough features on recent models to spur upgrades and maintain premium pricing. The starting price of the iPhone 11, for example, was cut to $699 this fall, $50 lower than the 2018 model.

Sales in China are a particularly sore spot, dropping an estimated 35% as Apple faces stronger competition from domestic rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi, which offer feature-packed phones at lower price points. The escalating trade war between the US and China has also likely contributed to Apple's woes, with Chinese consumers opting for homegrown brands over American ones. 

In light of the dismal quarterly results, Apple plans to cut costs, reduce headcounts in some areas and potentially discontinue underperforming products to shore up margins and earnings going forward. The company will report official earnings for the September quarter on October 30, at which point Wall Street will gain further insight into Apple’s struggles and its strategy to reignite growth.
