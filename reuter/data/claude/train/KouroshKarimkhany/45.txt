Apple Reports $120m Loss and Warns of Continued Struggles

Tech giant Apple reported a $120 million net loss for the fiscal second quarter and warned that it expects ongoing revenue and profit struggles to continue in the coming months. The loss per share of 27 cents significantly missed analysts' expectations of a profit of 2 cents per share. Revenue also declined for the quarter, dropping 5% year over year to $58.3 billion, the sharpest quarterly drop for Apple in over a decade.  

The results reflect the harsh impacts of the global pandemic on Apple's key business areas like iPhone sales, retail stores, and global supply chain. Most of Apple's 52 stores remain closed around the world and those that are open have limited foot traffic. At the same time, iPhone sales declined as consumers pull back on spending and many carriers offer incentives to delay new phone upgrades.  

"This is one of the most difficult economic environments of our lifetime and certainly since Apple was founded in 1976," said Apple CEO Tim Cook on a call with analysts. "We saw an economic deceleration in mid-March take place around the world and that deceleration has continued into April."

Apple refused to provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter, citing ongoing uncertainty. But Cook warned that challenges will persist and potentially worsen in the coming months. Revenue from Apple's services division, which includes Apple Music and Apple TV+, grew by 16% but is unlikely to offset the declines in other areas, especially if the economy continues to deteriorate.  

The quarterly results underscore the fact that even the world's largest tech companies are not immune to the effects of COVID-19. Last week, Alphabet's Google reported a revenue decline for the first time in its history. Amazon and Facebook will report earnings later this week, with Wall Street expecting significant slowdowns in ad sales and e-commerce growth.
