Steve Jobs Rehired at Apple to Revamp Mac Software

In a stunning move, Apple announced today that Steve Jobs, the company's co-founder and former CEO, has been rehired to revitalize its Mac computer division. Jobs returns more than seven years after he resigned as CEO, replacing the struggling software engineering team that Jobs himself handpicked. 

Apple's newest laptop and desktop computers have received lackluster reviews for unimaginative designs and features that fail to match competitors. Sales of the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Pro have declined for three straight quarters. In a memo to employees, Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted the company's mistakes and said "the Mac needs to return to its roots of simplicity, design prowess and innovation."

Cook announced that Jobs will serve as Senior Vice President of Mac Software Engineering, the position he held in 1997 when he returned to a struggling Apple and led its epic turnaround. Jobs will report directly to Cook and have full authority over the team responsible for the Mac operating system and applications like Photos, GarageBand, and Final Cut Pro.

The move marks the first time Jobs will have a formal title at Apple since he resigned as CEO in August 2011 due to health issues. However, Jobs has remained on Apple's board of directors and has advised Cook on an informal basis. According to sources close to the company, Jobs has grown increasingly frustrated with the direction of Apple's Mac software efforts over the past two years and agreed to come out of retirement to help get the division back on track.

In an internal email, Jobs promised to bring "sight, passion and design" back to the Mac experience. "The products we've released in the past couple of years have lacked a certain 'Apple magic'," Jobs wrote. "My role is to make the Mac as simple, intuitive and delightful as it was 20 years ago." Jobs is expected to reorganize the software engineering team, review ongoing projects, and help map out the multi-year roadmap for the next three major releases of the Mac operating system.
