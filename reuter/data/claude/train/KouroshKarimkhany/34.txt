CompUSA Warns Weak Christmas Sales May Affect Entire Computer Industry 

CompUSA Inc., one of the nation's largest computer retailers, warned today that lackluster holiday sales could have broader implications for the computer industry. The company reported that same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, declined 5% in December compared with the same month a year earlier. 

The weak sales come amid a sluggish broader economy and growing concerns about consumer spending. CompUSA executives said the results may signal challenging times ahead for the computer market given that the holiday season accounts for up to 50% of annual sales for some PC and component makers.

"There's no way for the numbers not to impact the overall technology sector," said CEO John Pearson in a call with analysts. "We think this is likely to lead to industry consolidation and significant cost-cutting measures."

Shares of CompUSA dropped over 25% in early trading. PC makers including HP Inc. and Dell Technologies also saw their shares fall sharply, as investors worry that demand for new computers is slowing. Tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq Composite also declined.

The lack of sales growth stands in contrast to strong revenue gains in other retail categories like apparel and home goods. Mr. Pearson blamed disappointing sales on a "softer consumer spending backdrop" as well as price deflation for some key computer products like laptops. But he also said CompUSA likely lost some sales to competitors who cut prices more aggressively.

In response, CompUSA plans to close underperforming stores, reduce inventory levels, and renegotiate pricing with vendors to boost profit margins. The company will also increase promotions and discounts after the holidays to drive more customer traffic, despite the hit to profits.

Analysts said the action was necessary but may not be enough to counter broader economic headwinds. "The whole sector probably needs to lower financial expectations for the next year," said George Schapiro at research firm Gartner Inc. "CompUSA's struggles show that even aggressive cost-cutting may not make up for weak consumer confidence and low demand."
