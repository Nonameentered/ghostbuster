Intuit Unlikely to Pursue Merger Anytime Soon Despite Buyout Speculation  

Shares of Intuit, the maker of TurboTax tax preparation software and QuickBooks small business accounting software, rose 4% on Monday following rumors that the company may be exploring a sale or merger. However, sources close to Intuit suggest that the company is unlikely to pursue an acquisition or merger in the near future. 

Intuit has been the topic of periodic merger speculation over the past several years, with potential suitors bandied about including technology giants like Oracle, private equity firms, and other financial software companies. Intuit's stable cash flow and market dominance in tax and accounting software make it an attractive target. The company's share price has also lagged the broader market recently, making it appear potentially undervalued.

However, Intuit executives have shown little interest in giving up the company's independence, according to people familiar with the matter. Under CEO Sasan Goodarzi, who took over in January 2019, Intuit has pursued an aggressive growth strategy focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and expanding its small business offerings. The company aims to become the center of its customers' financial lives, providing software and services to help individuals and businesses transact, budget, report, and file. This long-term vision would likely be disrupted by an acquisition.

Intuit also faces no urgent need to merge for financial reasons or competitive pressures. The company has over $1.6 billion in annual cash flow and a strong balance sheet with over $2 billion in cash and short-term investments. Its flagship TurboTax and QuickBooks products dominate their markets with little viable competition. Price competition from rival tax prep services like H&R Block has remained modest. And Intuit has successfully fended off challenges from low-cost accounting software alternatives for years.
