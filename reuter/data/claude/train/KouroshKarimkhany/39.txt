Macromedia Inc. Shares Plunge to Two-Year Low Following Unexpected Third-Quarter Loss and Weak Sales Forecast 

Shares of Macromedia Inc., a maker of web development and design software, sank to a two-year low Tuesday after the company reported an unexpected loss for its fiscal third quarter and issued a weaker-than-expected sales forecast.

Macromedia shares fell $3.94, or 21%, to close at $15.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Earlier in the day, the stock hit a intraday low of $15.12, the stock's lowest level since November 2002.

The plunge came after Macromedia posted a loss of $49.4 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $19.5 million, or 22 cents a share. Excluding items like restructuring charges, the company lost $16 million, or 18 cents a share. Revenue rose 11% to $97.8 million.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had expected Macromedia to earn 11 cents a share on $99 million in revenue. Macromedia blamed the shortfall on lower-than-expected sales of its products in the U.S. and Europe due to weakening demand in those regions. The company also incurred $15.7 million in one-time charges related to layoffs and other restructuring moves.

For the fourth quarter, Macromedia projected revenue of $93 million to $100 million, a range that was seen as indicating somewhat flat to modestly higher growth. Analysts had been expecting sales of $109.2 million. 

The results and outlook stunned analysts and investors, who had been expecting Macromedia's business to gain momentum from the release of its Studio MX 2004 product suite in early October. The company also has been spending heavily on marketing in recent quarters to promote new products.

“The magnitude of the miss was surprising,” said Dan Kurnos, an analyst at Southwest Securities, who cut his rating on Macromedia shares to “underperform” from “market perform.” The results suggest the weakness in corporate technology spending “may be more pervasive than we had anticipated,” he said.

Macromedia's shares have now lost more than half their value since peaking in June. The decline reflects broader concerns about the health of technology spending as well as worries about competition from Microsoft Corp., which sells some similar design and development tools.
