Mexico's Foreign Minister Criticizes US Policy on Drug Trafficking Certification 

Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard criticized the US State Department's latest narcotics certification report, calling it "unfair and impossible to meet." In an interview, Ebrard said the report's standards for judging Mexico's anti-drug efforts were unrealistic given the transnational nature of drug trafficking and the vast resources of criminal groups operating in the country.

The State Department's annual report is required by US law to determine whether countries are meeting international commitments to crack down on drugs and money laundering. Countries can face sanctions if they receive an unfavorable review. But Ebrard argued the report takes an overly "unilateral" approach that does not account for the joint responsibility involved. "There is no recognition that this is a shared problem between countries," he said. "A certification or sanction will not reduce the number of overdoses in the US or the flow of drugs."

US officials maintain that Mexico needs to do more to reduce the flow of drugs into the US, strengthen the rule of law, and curb corruption enabling criminal groups. But Ebrard pointed out that Mexico has made progress on these fronts, investing billions of dollars to improve border security, expand the federal police, and implement judicial reforms. "We are capturing more drugs and criminals than any other time in our history," he said. "No other country has done as much as Mexico in the fight against organized crime."

Still, Mexico continues to struggle against heavily armed cartels that control drug trafficking routes into the US. Last year saw record homicide numbers, and drug-related violence has claimed over 200,000 lives in Mexico since 2006. Ebrard said the violence shows the futility of a strategy focused primarily on capturing kingpins. "The certification rules do not recognize that you cannot defeat transnational criminal groups through arrests alone," he argued. "As long as there are profits to be made from the illegal drug trade, these organizations will continue to exist."

Ebrard called for greater US cooperation to reduce drug demand, limit the flow of weapons to Mexico, and support development programs that provide alternatives to those involved in the drug trade. Mexico is open to more information-sharing and joint operations with US authorities, he said, but not to "imposing a set of requirements that neither the US nor any other country could meet." The Foreign Minister urged the Biden administration to take a "cooperative rather than coercive" approach on drug policy and security issues.
