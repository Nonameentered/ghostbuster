FARC Hails Peruvian Rebel Group's Attack on Japanese Ambassador's Residence as "Spectacular and Well-Planned" 

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) issued a statement today praising the attack by the Peruvian rebel group MRTA on the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, Peru as "spectacular and well-planned." The incident began on December 17th when 14 members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) stormed a party at the ambassador's residence, taking hundreds of diplomats, officials, and other dignitaries hostage. 

"The courageous fighters of MRTA have struck a mighty blow against the forces of imperialism and Peru's corrupt ruling elites who have sold out the nation's rights and interests to foreign powers," the FARC statement said. The rebel group, which has been fighting a decades-long insurgency against the Colombian government, voiced strong support for the MRTA's aims and called on other "revolutionary movements" in Latin America to follow its example.

The crisis in Peru entered its fifth day with no resolution in sight. The rebels are demanding the release of imprisoned MRTA members in exchange for the release of their hostages, which the Peruvian government has so far refused. The standoff has gripped the attention of the international community and led to calls for a peaceful negotiated settlement from leaders around the world.

In a video released by the MRTA, the rebels can be seen dressed in green uniforms and red berets, with their faces covered by ski masks and balaclavas. The hostages, including foreign ambassadors and military officers, are shown sitting or lying face down, tied up with rope. The MRTA has threatened to kill one hostage every day its demands go unmet, though it has not yet acted upon those threats.

Peruvian special forces have surrounded the ambassador's residence, while military aircraft and helicopters circle overhead. However, any raid to free the hostages by force risks heavy loss of life, giving the MRTA significant leverage in the tense negotiations. The judicious use of force, rather than brute violence, will be key to resolving this alarming situation peacefully. All parties must work to find a compromise that spares innocent lives, brings the perpetrators to justice, and avoids fuelling further violence. The international community stands ready to assist in any way to help bring this tense crisis to an end.
