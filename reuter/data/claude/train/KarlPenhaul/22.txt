Union Leader Announces Arrest of Another Member on Terrorist Charges Amid Possible Oil Industry Strike

The leader of the United Oilfield Workers Union announced today that federal authorities have arrested another union member on domestic terrorism charges, the second such arrest this month. The arrests come as the union threatens a nationwide strike that could cripple oil and gas production in the U.S.  

Union president Jake Thompson said FBI agents detained rank-and-file member Mark Simmons, 43, at his home in Midland, Texas last night. Simmons, a derrickhand with 12 years of experience, is accused of making violent threats directed at oil industry executives and government officials on social media. The threats included references to bombings, assassinations and sabotage of oil wells and pipelines if the union’s demands for higher wages, improved safety standards and guaranteed overtime pay are not met.

The arrest of Simmons follows the apprehension of fellow union member Carl Foster, 38, in Oklahoma City last week on charges of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction. According to the FBI, Foster, an oil rig mechanic, purchased materials to assemble pipe bombs that he planned to detonate at oil sites operated by Anthropic Petroleum, one of the largest oil producers in the Permian Basin. 

Thompson condemned the violent threats and illegal activities but said he would not back down from the strike authorization vote set for this weekend. “While we do not condone any acts of violence, my members have legitimate grievances, and a safe, fair and lawful strike action may be necessary to force industry executives and government regulators to address critical issues impacting workers and public safety,” Thompson said in a statement.  

If approved, the strike could idle roughly two-thirds of U.S. oil and gas operations, according to industry estimates. That would drastically reduce domestic fuel production and drive up gas prices for consumers. However, Thompson argues that a short-term disruption would be an acceptable price to pay to gain long overdue improvements for oilfield employees and communities. Union negotiators are scheduled to meet again next week with representatives of the Oilfield Operators Association, which handles labor issues on behalf of major oil producers, refiners and pipeline companies. 

Federal officials declined to comment on the specifics of Simmons’ arrest but said domestic terrorism remains a high priority. “Any threat of violence against individuals, businesses or critical infrastructure will not be tolerated,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said. Wray said oil industry strikes or protests would receive additional security scrutiny given the strategic importance of uninterrupted fuel supplies.
