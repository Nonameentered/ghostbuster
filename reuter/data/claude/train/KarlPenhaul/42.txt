Colombian President Declares Economic Emergency to Tackle Fiscal Deficit  

Bogot√°, Colombia - Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos declared an economic emergency today in an effort to gain control of the country's growing fiscal deficit. In a televised address, President Santos announced a series of economic measures, including a value-added tax increase, public spending cuts, and a temporary freeze on salary increases for government employees. 

The economic package is aimed at reducing Colombia's budget deficit, which has ballooned to over 4% of GDP, the highest in a decade. President Santos blamed the increasing deficit on the economic fallout from the global coronavirus pandemic, which has caused tax revenues to plunge and spending demands to soar. "We have to take urgent and exceptional measures to avoid putting the sustainability of public finances at risk," said President Santos.

The centerpiece of the new measures is a two percentage point increase in the value-added tax for the next two years, taking it from 19% to 21%. The government expects this will generate an additional $2.5 billion in tax revenue next year. The President also announced $3.6 billion in cuts to public spending, including eliminating non-essential travel, limiting hiring of new staff, and reducing funding for government contractors and consultants.

Continued salary freezes for government employees, extending a measure first put in place last year, are expected to save an additional $500 million. President Santos said the new economic plan would reduce the deficit to 3.6% of GDP next year and put it on a path to meet the government's target of 2.4% by 2022.

The measures received a mixed response, with business groups supporting the President's actions but labor unions criticizing the impact on workers and the middle class. The economic emergency declaration will give President Santos temporary power to push through reforms without congressional approval for 60 days. The government will aim to make the measures permanent through new legislation before the emergency period ends.
