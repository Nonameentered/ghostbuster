Colombia aims to shed pariah status as US envoy lauds anti-drug efforts

Bogota, Colombiaâ€”Colombian President Ivan Duque welcomed U.S. Special Envoy for the Colombia Peace Process Bernie Aronson to Bogota this week, hoping to shore up relations with Washington as the South American country tries to move past its notorious history as a narcotics hub. 

Aronson met with Duque and other top officials to discuss Colombia's efforts to implement a 2016 peace deal with the FARC rebels and tackle a spike in coca cultivation that has tested bilateral ties. After the meeting, Aronson praised Colombia's "impressive success" in curbing cocaine production and seizing assets from drug traffickers.

The visit signals an easing of tensions that flared up last year after the White House issued a scathing report accusing Colombia of failing to do enough to curb coca cultivation and cocaine production. At the time, Duque had just taken office, inheriting from his predecessor a fragile peace deal he had campaigned against and pledging a tougher stance on security issues.

Duque has since launched an ambitious plan to curb coca growth by 50% over five years through aerial spraying, manual eradication, and rural development programs. Aronson's praise suggests those efforts are paying off, even as independent estimates show cocaine production at record levels.

"Colombia has been a stalwart ally of the U.S. for decades and it's exciting to see the progress you have made on counternarcotics and securing peace," Aronson told reporters. "We stand ready to support you as you work to curb cocaine production, revamp rural development, and face challenges like Venezuelan migration."

The visit was a bright spot for Duque, whose government faces mounting security challenges and has seen public support wane amid a slow recovery from recession. Aronson reaffirmed the U.S. sees Colombia as its top ally in Latin America even as the Trump administration continues to exert pressure on Venezuela's authoritarian regime next door.

Colombia aims to curb cocaine exports by 70% over the next five years to shed its image as a source of illegal drugs and join the OECD, an organization of mostly developed countries. Though the country remains the world's top cocaine producer, Duque's government has extradited more traffickers, seized record drug shipments, and begun aerial spraying this year for the first time since 2015.

"We will continue working tirelessly to defeat the drug cartels that threaten our democracy and the moral future of our youth," Duque told reporters alongside Aronson. "With the support of our strategic ally, the United States, we will win this fight against illegal drugs."
