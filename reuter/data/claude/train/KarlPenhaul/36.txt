Tragedy in the Andes: Bus crash claims 37 lives, as rescuers face difficult recovery efforts

A bus crash in a remote, mountainous region of Peru resulted in the deaths of 37 passengers, officials say. The accident occurred sometime Wednesday evening along a treacherous stretch of highway known as “the Devil’s Curve,” about 200 miles north of Lima, the nation’s capital. 

The bus was traveling from the town of Caraz to Chimbote, a coastal city, when it careened off the road and tumbled 200 feet into a steep ravine. The vehicle landed upside down, trapping most of the occupants inside. Local residents alerted authorities about the accident after spotting the wreckage from a distance. However, the location of the crash posed major challenges for first responders attempting to reach the site.

Heavy rain caused flash floods and mudslides along the highway, while dense fog obscured visibility. Emergency crews first had to repair damaged sections of the road before they could allow vehicles to pass through. The difficult terrain and poor weather conditions delayed rescuers by several hours, according to officials from Peru’s Ministry of Transportation and Communications.

Using ropes and harnesses, specially trained mountain units rappelled down the slope to access the mangled bus. They found only a handful of survivors among the wreckage, most suffering from severe injuries. Officials stated that the majority of passengers were pronounced dead at the scene due to blunt force trauma. The survivors were airlifted to the nearest hospital in Chimbote for treatment. 

The cause of the crash remains under investigation, though authorities speculate that it may have been due to reckless driving along a portion of highway where numerous accidents have occurred in the past. The bus company that operated the vehicle did not have any major safety violations on its records, officials said. However, family members of victims have criticized the firm for perceived poor conditions of its fleet.  

Continued recovery efforts were suspended overnight due to lack of light but have resumed Thursday morning. The names and nationalities of the victims have not yet been released, pending notification of next of kin. Wednesday’s tragedy marks another deadly episode along Peru’s winding mountain roads, which many consider among the world’s most dangerous highways. Officials have pledged to improve road safety regulations and increase police patrols in the area where the latest accident took place.
