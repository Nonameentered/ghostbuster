Former Colombian Rebel Leader Urges Peruvian Guerrillas to Keep Cool in Hostage Crisis

Manuel “Sureshot” Marulanda, the aging former leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), issued a statement this week urging the Peruvian guerrilla group Shining Path to remain calm and patient in the ongoing hostage crisis involving three aid workers. The hostages, two Americans and one Briton, were kidnapped six weeks ago in a remote area of the Peruvian Andes during a medical relief mission. 

Marulanda, who led FARC for over 40 years before stepping down in 2008 due to health issues, said that in his experience, hostage situations require strategic thinking, not rash action. “My comrades in Shining Path, you must think long term. Do not act in haste or make demands you cannot fulfill,” Marulanda said in a video posted online. “Keep the hostages safe and leverage the situation to raise awareness of your political goals. But also leave room for negotiation - you need a path to resolution.”

Shining Path has demanded the release of 50 imprisoned members in exchange for the hostages, a concession the Peruvian government has so far refused. The hostage crisis is the highest profile action by Shining Path in over a decade. The left-wing rebel group was nearly wiped out in the 1990s but has seen a resurgence over the past few years under new leadership. Still, many analysts consider the current hostage demands unrealistic and a sign the group is struggling internally.

Marulanda and FARC were notorious for several high-profile kidnappings, including the 2002 abduction of Colombian senator Ingrid Betancourt, who was held for six years before a dramatic rescue by Colombian forces. Marulanda’s video message suggests he sees Shining Path following a similar playbook to gain notoriety and political leverage. However, many believe the situation could end violently if Shining Path’s demands are not met.

The Peruvian government has said it will not negotiate with Shining Path under threats of violence. But family members of the hostages are urging an open line of communication in hopes of a peaceful resolution. All sides seem to agree that time is of the essence to resolve the crisis before loss of life, even if Marulanda advocates for strategic patience. The fate of the three hostages remains uncertain as Shining Path's intentions become increasingly unclear.
