Cocaine kings of Colombia get reduced prison terms for guilty plea, drawing rebuke from US ambassador 

Three Colombian drug lords known as the "Cocaine Kings of Colombia" received reduced prison sentences yesterday in exchange for pleading guilty to drug trafficking and money laundering charges in Miami federal court. The plea deal has drawn criticism from the U.S. ambassador to Colombia, who said it undermines years of work by law enforcement to bring the men to justice.

Brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, former leaders of the Cali Cartel, and Helmer "Pacho" Herrera, a high-ranking member of the cartel, have been in U.S. custody since being extradited from Colombia in 2017. They faced potential life sentences if convicted of charges related to smuggling hundreds of tons of cocaine into the U.S. in the 1980s and 1990s.

Under the plea agreement approved by U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno, Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, 83, was sentenced to 30 years in prison, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, 58, received a 27-year sentence, and Herrera, 63, was given a 25-year sentence. The brothers forfeited $2.1 billion in assets to the U.S. government as part of the deal.

In a statement, Ambassador Philip Goldberg said the sentences were too lenient given the "death and destruction" caused by the Cali Cartel's criminal enterprise. He noted that Colombian authorities worked for decades to dismantle the cartel and capture its leaders, often at the cost of their own lives. 

"While any guilty plea resulting in jail time is a win, the sentences handed down today are not commensurate with the gravity of the crimes committed by the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers and Helmer Herrera," Goldberg said.

The men were among Colombia's earliest drug lords and built a billion-dollar cocaine empire through murders, kidnappings, and acts of terror in Colombia. At the height of its power in the 1990s, the Cali Cartel was supplying 80% of the cocaine in the United States and making $10 billion annually, according to law enforcement estimates.

Defense attorneys argued their age, health issues, and time already served in Colombian and American jails merited lighter sentences. In court, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela walked with a cane and at times appeared disoriented. "Despite their crimes, they are still human," his attorney, David A. Markus, told reporters.

The case highlights the ongoing debate over sentencing lengths for elderly defendants, even those accused of heinous crimes. Some legal experts argue long sentences for the aged serve little purpose. Others say criminals should face appropriate punishment regardless of age or health.

The plea deal is a setback for Colombian authorities who captured the men in the 1990s and spent years securing their extradition. Colombian Senator Paloma Valencia said the short sentences undermine her country's hard-fought battle against drug cartels and should not be celebrated. 

In a Twitter post, Valencia said: "The low sentences for the Orejuela brothers demonstrate that crime pays and opens the door to the 'normalization' of drug trafficking."
