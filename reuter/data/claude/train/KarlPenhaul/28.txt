Powerful bomb kills four and injures scores in Colombia's northwest Cordoba province 

A powerful bomb exploded outside a police station in the town of Tolemina in northwest Colombia's Cordoba province on Tuesday morning, killing four people and injuring at least 70 others. The blast was from an improvised explosive device placed on a motorcycle, according to Colombian authorities.

The explosion went off at around 11 am local time in the town center, just 50 meters from the police station. The blast shattered windows in nearby buildings and was felt several kilometers away, residents reported. Among the casualties were two police officers who were on duty at the time of the explosion. The wounded were taken to local hospitals, with at least 10 people suffering critical injuries.

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. However, authorities suspect left-wing guerrilla groups still active in the region, such as the National Liberation Army or ELN. Cordoba province sees occasional violence from rebel and paramilitary groups involved in Colombia's long-running armed conflict.

The bombing is one of the deadliest in Colombia this year and comes just days after a car bomb attack on a military base in neighboring Nari√±o province killed three soldiers. President Ivan Duque vowed to bring those responsible for Tuesday's "act of terrorism" to justice. "We will not rest until we capture and prosecute all those who plan and execute these despicable acts," Duque said in a televised address.

Colombia implemented a peace deal with the much larger rebel group FARC in 2016, but fighting with the ELN and narcotrafficking gangs continues in parts of the country. Cordoba province is a hub for agriculture and petroleum, making it a strategic location for groups seeking resources and territory. No tourists were reported among the casualties in Tolemina, but the bombing will likely deal a blow to Colombia's hopes of attracting more visitors to explore its picturesque countryside and colonial towns.
