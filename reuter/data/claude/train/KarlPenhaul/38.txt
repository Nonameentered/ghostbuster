U.S. pilot killed in plane crash during first anti-drug mission in Colombia  

A U.S. military pilot was killed Monday when his plane crashed during the first anti-drug trafficking mission as part of an agreement with Colombia to fight narcotics smuggling. The crash occurred in the southern region of Colombia. Officials have not yet released the name of the pilot. The diplomatic agreement was signed shortly after the inauguration of new Colombian President Ivan Duque to restart aerial surveillance flights in the South American country.

The U.S military was providing air support for Colombian troops who were conducting ground operations against drug traffickers when the aircraft crashed in a rural area. The cause of the crash was still under investigation, but officials said the plane did not appear to have been shot down. The Colombian troops seized a cocaine stash during the joint mission, according to officials.

The joint military operations were recently agreed to allow U.S. surveillance planes to operate from Colombian military bases to assist the police and armed forces in counternarcotics and counterterrorism operations across the country. The agreement allows the U.S. military to use up to five military bases and 800 personnel in the joint missions. Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine and faces significant challenges eradicating drug crops and battling the violent drug cartels that control much of the trade. 

Colombia's ambassador to the U.S., Francisco Santos said the anti-narcotics cooperation between the two countries "has saved many lives in Colombia and in the United States." The joint operations have been ongoing since the early 2000s but were suspended in 2015 over a legal dispute. The crash was a tragedy but would not derail the renewed cooperation, according to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a statement. The State Department was working closely with Colombian authorities to investigate the cause of the crash. 

The unnamed pilot's death marked the first American fatality since the joint missions restarted. Anti-drug missions were considered dangerous but key to battling the illegal drug trade that fuels violence and corruption in Colombia and contributes to rising overdose deaths in the U.S. The pilot was remembered as a hero who died serving his country in the fight against the dangerous cartels fueling America's opioid crisis. Officials vowed his death would inspire countries to strengthen their resolve in this shared struggle.
