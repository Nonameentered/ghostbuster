British Yacht Owners Held on Cocaine Smuggling Charges Caught with Second Multimillion-Dollar Drug Stash in Colombia

Two British yacht owners currently detained in Colombia on cocaine smuggling charges have had a second, larger stash of the drug discovered aboard their luxury sailboat, according to Colombian authorities. Police found over 3 tons of cocaine, with a street value of over $80 million, hidden within different parts of the 60-foot yacht docked on the Caribbean coast. 

The yacht owners, identified as Malcolm Culpepper, 57, and Paul Simmons, 43, were arrested last month after police found over 100 kilograms of cocaine aboard their sailboat, which was traveling along the coast of South America. They were on their way to Panama when their vessel was boarded by the Colombian navy for a routine check. Police said the initial discovery was the result of a tip from British law enforcement, who had been monitoring the men's travel plans.

Following their arrest, the sailboat was impounded by police for further investigation. A thorough search of the vessel in dry dock led to the discovery of the much larger drug cache, stashed within specially built hidden compartments in the floors, walls, and ceilings throughout the boat. “This was a very professionally built smuggling ship, with secret spaces we have never seen before,” said Captain Ernesto Rios, head of the Colombian navy unit that conducted the search. 

Culpepper and Simmons now face charges of international drug trafficking and face up to 30 years in prison if convicted. Colombian officials are working with the UK's National Crime Agency to trace the source and intended buyers of the cocaine. “This is a major seizure that has halted a huge amount of drugs making their way to Britain and Europe,” said an agency spokesman.

The sailboat, named the White Cloud, is a luxury vessel that Culpepper and Simmons frequently rented out to tourists on chartered cruises in the Bahamas and Caribbean. It is now considered drug trafficking equipment, subject to seizure by the Colombian government.

Culpepper and Simmons denied all knowledge of the drugs in initial questioning, claiming they were "set up" by someone else seeking to import narcotics into Britain. Colombian police are skeptical of their claims, given the large amounts of cocaine and the sophisticated nature of the hidden smuggling compartments found aboard the White Cloud.
