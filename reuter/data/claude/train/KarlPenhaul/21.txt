FARC Refuses to Release Captive Troops Unless Demilitarization Demands Met  

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) said yesterday they will not release several captured government troops as a goodwill gesture unless the Colombian government meets their demands for demilitarization of two southern regions of the country. The Colombian government has refused to withdraw troops from the regions, claiming it would leave citizens unprotected from criminal elements.

For decades, the Colombian government has been engaged in conflict with FARC, a left-wing guerrilla group that aims to overthrow the government. In 2016, the two sides signed a historic peace deal to end 52 years of civil war that killed over 220,000 people. As part of the deal, FARC agreed to lay down their arms in exchange for guarantees of political participation and economic opportunity. The deal has led to the demobilization of over 13,000 FARC guerrillas.

However, violence has continued in some parts of Colombia as criminal groups battle to fill the power vacuum left by FARC. The government insists that withdrawing security forces from Cauca and Valle del Cauca, two southern departments in Colombia, would expose citizens to threats from these criminal groups. FARC claims that continued militarization of these areas violates the peace agreement and that they cannot advance further demobilization efforts until the security forces leave.

The dispute centers around the interpretation of a controversial part of the peace deal regarding transitional security mechanisms in former conflict zones. FARC leaders argue that the deal explicitly calls for joint oversight of security in some areas by government forces and former FARC members during the demobilization process. The government claims joint control would be illegal and that security forces cannot be withdrawn until FARC completes the demobilization of all members in the region.
