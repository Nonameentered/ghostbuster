Colombian Oil Union Delays Indefinite Strike Amidst Government Talks Following Member Arrests

The Colombian oil workers union USO announced today it will delay a planned indefinite strike to allow government negotiations following the arrest of three union members. The union members were detained during protests over lack of workplace protections and unpaid wages. 

The USO, which represents over 5,000 oil workers, had planned to begin an indefinite national strike on March 15 to protest what they see as violations of labor rights and unsafe working conditions in the Colombian oil fields. However, union leaders announced they will postpone the strike for one week to allow talks with the Labor Ministry.

“We are willing to engage in dialogue with the hopes of finding solutions to the serious issues facing oil workers,” said USO President Edwin Palma. “However, we reserve the right to strike if we do not see concrete steps towards guaranteeing fair pay, healthcare services and the protection of workers’ lives.”

The announcement comes just two days after police detained three USO members following protests outside oil fields operated by Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol. The union claims health and safety standards have deteriorated and workers are owed nearly $150 million in unpaid wages.  Ecopetrol has denied the allegations, claiming they provide competitive pay and benefits in line with regulations.

Labor Minister Alfonso Prada welcomed the announcement and said the government is open to discussing the union’s demands. However, he stated that illegal protests and roadblocks would not be tolerated. “We encourage the union to resolve issues through respectful dialogue instead of disruptive actions,” Mr. Prada said.

The one-week delay gives both parties an opportunity to address escalating tensions. But if demands remain unmet, the threat of eventual oil sector paralysis still looms. The USO’s national strike could halt installations across Colombia, impacting Ecopetrol’s 200,000 barrel-per-day production and the wider economy.
