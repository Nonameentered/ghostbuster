Colombia Braces for Escalation in Long-Running Guerrilla War in 1997

Bogota, Colombia— The Colombian government has announced an escalation of its military efforts against armed Marxist guerrilla groups this year amid growing frustration with the groups' bombing campaigns and terrorist activities. Colombia's military leaders say they will launch more aggressive operations against the largest and most heavily armed guerrilla organization, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as well as the smaller National Liberation Army.

The FARC is believed to have as many as 17,000 combatants and has stepped up military operations throughout the country in recent years. They are believed to be largely funded through drug trafficking, extortion, and kidnapping. In 1996, the FARC carried out more than 200 bombing attacks and 1,500 terrorist acts that killed many civilians, according to government reports. The group has been operating in Colombia since the 1960s.

"The guerrillas have taken advantage of peace talks with the government to strengthen their military capabilities while continuing to harm innocent lives and disrupt our progress toward stability and prosperity," said General Luís Ernesto Gilibert, commander of the Colombian armed forces. "The time for restraint is over. We must confront the threat posed by these terrorist groups and protect the Colombian people."

Critics argue that an increased military approach will only lead to more violence and human rights abuses. They point out that the Colombian armed forces have also been accused of colluding with illegal right-wing paramilitary groups that target leftist activists. "A 'no-holds-barred' confrontation with the guerrillas will only intensify the conflict and put more civilians in the crosshairs," said Luis Gonzalez, director of the peace advocacy group Diálogos por la Paz.

Peace talks between the government and FARC broke down in January after the guerrillas hijacked a flight and kidnapped a senator on board. President Ernesto Samper has said the government is open to resuming dialogue if the FARC is willing to enter in good faith, but military officials appear eager to take the fight to the guerrillas after years of stalled progress. The escalation of the long-running conflict in Colombia threatens to further destabilize the country and put many innocent lives at risk. Only time will tell if an aggressive new military policy will force the guerrillas to negotiate or lead to a dangerous new phase in this decades-old war.
