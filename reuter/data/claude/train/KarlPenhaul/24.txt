Colombian Lawmakers Race Against Time in Bid to Strip Drug Barons of Their Fortunes Before U.S. Imposes Sanctions

Lawmakers in Colombia are pushing for the swift passage of a bill that would allow the government to seize the assets of suspected drug traffickers. The bill, known as the " assets for peace bill," is seen as crucial for Colombia avoiding potentially damaging economic sanctions from the United States.

The proposed law would give Colombian authorities the power to seize assets and properties of suspects even before they are formally charged with a crime. Supporters say it is necessary to tackle drug traffickers' immense wealth and hit them where it hurts the most - their wallets. If passed, it would be one of the most aggressive anti-narcotics laws in Colombia's history.

However, the bill is controversial and faces opposition. Critics argue that it undermines the presumption of innocence and could be used against political opponents. The law has lingered in Congress for over a year but was revived recently due to pressure from the United States. Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Colombian President Ivan Duque that unless "swift, concrete progress" is made on anti-narcotics efforts, Colombia risks being labeled a “country of concern” by the U.S. 

That designation would trigger economic sanctions that could damage Colombia's already struggling economy. Agriculture Minister Rodolfo Zea said "the sanctions would be disastrous, so we have to move quickly." The Duque administration has made the bill a priority and is lobbying lawmakers to fast-track its passage.

Still, the bill faces an uphill battle in Congress. Duque's party holds a minority in both chambers, and some opposition leaders resent the "interference" from the U.S. The debate around the bill has become a tug-of-war between protecting civil liberties and avoiding economic turmoil. Lawmakers have just weeks left in the current legislative session to find a compromise before the U.S. makes its determination on potential sanctions. All sides agree that action must be taken to weaken drug cartels. However, the question of how far to go to achieve that goal remains controversial. The coming days will determine whether Colombian lawmakers can converge on a solution in time.
