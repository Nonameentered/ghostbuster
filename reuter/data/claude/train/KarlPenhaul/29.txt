Car bomb kills woman and injures dozens in Medellin, Colombian government suspects drug cartels

A powerful car bomb exploded in downtown Medellin, Colombia on Tuesday morning, killing one woman and injuring at least 24 others. The blast happened around 8:30 am local time near a busy office tower, shattering windows and damaging vehicles in a two block radius. The explosive device was planted in a van, according to authorities.

The Colombian government believes drug cartels were responsible for the attack, given Medellin's history as the headquarters for Pablo Escobar's cocaine empire. Current criminal organizations continue to operate in the city, fighting over control of drug trafficking routes and other illicit activities. However, no group has yet claimed responsibility for the bombing.

"This was a cowardly act of violence that has left innocent people injured and taken a life," said Colombian President Ivan Duque in a televised address. He promised to bring the perpetrators to justice and offered a reward for information leading to arrests. Police have blockaded roads around the site of the explosion and are conducting an investigation along with the prosecutor general's office.

The woman killed in the blast was a street vendor who was near the van when it exploded, according to Medellin's mayor. The other victims sustained injuries from shrapnel, collapsed buildings and shattered glass. Several remained in critical but stable condition at local hospitals on Tuesday afternoon. 

Medellin was once one of the most violent cities in the world but has seen significant security improvements in recent decades. Tuesday's bombing, however, has residents on edge and underscores the continued influence of illegal armed groups in Colombia's second largest city. Despite a 2016 peace deal with Marxist FARC rebels, violence persists in some parts of the country and the government has struggled to fill a power vacuum left by the demobilization of FARC.

"We cannot let these groups operate with impunity and create terror for our citizens and visitors," said Mayor Federico Gutierrez. He pledged additional resources for law enforcement to prevent future attacks and dismantle criminal organizations in Medellin. The bombing is a setback for a city working hard to shed its violent image.
