Bombing kills four and injures 33 in northwest Colombia 

A bombing at a crowded marketplace in the city of Barranquilla in northwest Colombia killed four people and injured at least 33 others on Saturday morning. The attack targeted a group of police officers who were patrolling the market, according to officials.

The explosion occurred around 11 am local time outside a bakery in the historic center of Barranquilla, a port city of over a million people. Witnesses reported seeing a man on a motorbike throw a bag toward the police officers that then exploded. The blast caused damage to buildings up to a block away, shattering windows and scattering debris. 

Police officials called the bombing an act of terrorism and launched an investigation into who orchestrated the attack. No group has yet claimed responsibility, but security forces believe it may be linked to drug trafficking gangs or leftist guerillas who remain active in some parts of Colombia despite a 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia militant group.

The four victims who died include two women, ages 54 and 57, a 45-year-old man, and a 68-year-old man, according to health officials. The injuries of the 33 injured people range from cuts by flying glass to broken bones to brain trauma. At least 8 people remain in critical condition at local hospitals. 

President Juan Carlos Vélez condemned the violence and vowed to work with investigators to bring the perpetrators to justice. In a televised address, Vélez said “Terrorism and hatred have no place in Colombia. We must stand united against those who would spread fear and bloodshed.”

The bombing is the deadliest attack in Barranquilla since 2003. Security forces have stepped up patrols and checkpoints around the city in response. Officials also urged citizens to come forward with any information that could assist the ongoing investigation.
