Colombia plays down potential rift with Brazil over coffee export retention plan

Colombia's government and coffee industry representatives sought to defuse perceptions of a growing rift with Brazil over Colombia's plans to retain more of its high-quality arabica coffee for domestic consumption rather than export. 

Colombia's National Coffee Growers Federation (FNC) last week announced a new policy aimed at keeping between 2 to 3 million bags of Colombia's arabica coffee in the domestic market rather than export them, in order to spur greater local consumption of Colombian specialty coffees. However, Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, has taken issue with the move, saying it could distort global coffee prices if other producers followed suit.

In response, Colombia's coffee minister said the policy was "not a matter of controversy" and would not significantly impact global coffee supplies or prices. The head of the FNC also downplayed talk of tensions with Brazil, saying "we maintain the best relations" and that he would explain the rationale for the policy to Brazil's coffee industry representatives. 

The FNC has argued the policy is necessary to raise domestic consumption of Colombian coffees, which lags far behind most coffee-producing countries. By keeping more prime Colombian arabica beans in the local market, the FNC hopes to boost the prevalence of a coffee drinking culture in Colombia and support the country's growing community of specialty coffee roasters and cafes.

However, Brazil has said the move could backfire, impacting legal coffee supplies and prices. "We understand the intention but retaining excess supply can undermine a sustainable coffee policy," said an official at Brazil's National Coffee Council. He urged Colombia to find other ways to stimulate local coffee demand that do not involve large-scale retention of exports.

Colombia expects to produce 14.3 million 60-kg bags of arabica coffee in 2020, up 3 percent from 2019. The new retention policy would keep roughly 16 percent of this coffee from export markets, the first major supply shift since the International Coffee Agreement governing global coffee exports collapsed in 1989.

Despite disagreement over the policy, Colombia and Brazil's overall relationship remains close. The two nations, which produce about half the world's coffee, have collaborated on coffee sustainability initiatives and also partnered to strengthen coffee marketing globally.

Continued cooperation will be needed, experts say, to address the economic challenges facing coffee farmers in both countries, expand global coffee consumption in emerging markets, and promote the use of certified sustainably grown coffee.
