French Industry Minister Insists on Majority French Control in Anglo-French Nuclear Merger  

The proposed merger between two major European nuclear power companies, France's Framatome and Britain's Rolls-Royce, hit a roadblock today as France's Industry Minister voiced strong objections to any deal that would result in Framatome losing majority control. In a statement, the minister said, "France's energy security and independence cannot be compromised. We will not support any merger or acquisition that results in a dilution of French control over strategic national infrastructure like our civilian nuclear program."  

Framatome and Rolls-Royce first announced plans for a "merger of equals" last month that would create a single company to design, build, operate, and decommission nuclear power plants across Europe. The deal was touted as a way to pool resources and cut costs while providing both countries greater energy security through access to new technologies and expertise. However, terms of the initial agreement granted Britain a slight majority stake of 51% of the combined company.

The French minister's comments appear to rule out that structure and demand instead that Framatome retain at least 50.1% of the merged entity. His statement praised the potential benefits of cooperation with Rolls-Royce but said "the nuclear industry has implications for national security, and control of that industry must remain in French hands." Failure to secure majority control could prompt Paris to block the merger altogether.

Rolls-Royce expressed disappointment in the minister's position. A company spokesman said, "This proposal is about building a stronger, pan-European champion in the nuclear energy sector. We remain open to discussing the optimal ownership structure to realize the benefits of this partnership while respecting both countries' interests." However, observers say the British company may be unwilling to cede majority control in what would be the largest nuclear company in Europe with combined annual revenues of over â‚¬15 billion.  

Negotiations are continuing in Paris but without a compromise over ownership and control, the landmark business deal could fall apart before reaching the discussion of thornier issues like job cuts, executive leadership, and the company's headquarters. The future of longstanding cooperation on nuclear energy between Britain and France now hangs in the balance as economic nationalism rears its head. Both sides have incentives to make the merger work but only if they can find an ownership formula that leaves neither country exposed and both partners on equal footing. The coming days will be crucial in salvaging the far-reaching agreement.
