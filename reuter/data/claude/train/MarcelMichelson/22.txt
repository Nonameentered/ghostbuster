Rhone-Poulenc Third Quarter Results Garner Mixed Analyst Reviews

French industrial giant Rhone-Poulenc released its third quarter earnings report today, posting revenues of $12.3 billion and net income of $900 million for the three months ending September 30. The results represent an increase of nearly 15 percent in revenues and 20 percent in net income over the same quarter last year.

However, analysts offered mixed reviews of the results, praising the company's growth in key divisions like pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals but expressing concern over continued weakness in Rhone-Poulenc's commodity chemicals segment. "The company continues to perform well in high-margin, high-growth areas but is still struggling with some of its bulk chemicals and polymers businesses," said Claude Martin, an analyst with Credit Agricole Indosuez in Paris.

Rhone-Poulenc's pharmaceutical division led the quarterly results, with revenues climbing 22 percent to $4.6 billion and operating income up 17 percent. The company attributed the strong pharmaceutical performance to rising sales of its menu of blood pressure and cholesterol drugs, as well as several oncology treatments. Rhone-Poulenc has focused resources and investments on its pharmaceuticals division in recent years to offset volatility in other segments.

However, revenues in Rhone-Poulenc's commodity chemicals division fell 8 percent from a year earlier, dragged down by weak demand and pricing for basic chemicals like ethylene and polyethylene. The drop highlights the split personality of the company, with world-leading life sciences and agricultural science units on one hand and heavy exposure to bulk industrial chemicals on the other.

"We continue to see strong growth opportunities in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and other science-driven businesses," said Rhone-Poulenc CEO Henri Lachmann. "While conditions remain difficult in some chemicals markets, we are optimistic that stabilizing demand and reduced industry capacity will support strengthening in this segment starting next year."

Rhone-Poulenc shares rose 2 percent on the Paris Bourse following the announcement. While the third quarter results were largely in line with expectations, analysts said the company's comments about improving conditions in its chemicals division heading into 2020 were a positive signal. Overall, the report illustrated both the strengths and weaknesses that have marked Rhone-Poulenc's financial performance over the past several years.
