Cegetel launches bid to become main rival to France Telecom with fixed telephone network in Nice

Cegetel, France's second largest telecommunications company, announced plans today to build a fixed telephone network in Nice to directly compete with France Telecom, the dominant phone operator in France. Cegetel aims to sign up 100,000 subscribers in Nice over the next three years, establishing the city as a beachhead from which it can expand its fixed-line phone service nationally. 

The move is a bold gambit by Cegetel to become a major rival to France Telecom, which currently controls over 90% of the fixed-line phone market in France. While Cegetel has been successful as a mobile phone operator, it has struggled to make inroads into the fixed-line residential phone market due to France Telecom's entrenched position. The huge investments required to build competing physical phone networks across the country have also posed a significant barrier to entry for competitors.

Cegetel believes it has found a way to overcome these obstacles in Nice, a city of 350,000 residents on the French Riviera. The company will leverage existing fiber optic cable infrastructure it has built in Nice to support its mobile broadband and television services. By upgrading this network, Cegetel can deploy high-speed fiber phone lines to homes and businesses across the city at a reasonable cost. 

Cegetel's CEO Marc Simoncini said, "Our existing footprint in Nice provides us an opportunity to invest in a fixed fiber phone network that can deliver fast, reliable service to residents and businesses.  We aim to provide real choice and competition for fixed line phone services, which most French consumers and businesses have never truly had."

France Telecom downplayed the competitive threat from Cegetel's move. A spokesperson said that while the initiative may lead to some short-term subscriber losses, the impact would be limited given France Telecom's scale and the barriers to building large fixed-line networks. However, analysts believe Cegetel's bid to become a major challenger in the fixed-line phone market should be taken seriously if it can successfully execute its Nice initiative.

"Cegetel has opened an interesting new front in the war to take on France Telecom.  If it can demonstrate the business case for alternative fixed-line networks in Nice, it may spur additional fiber investment nationally, which would intensify pressure on France Telecom over time," said Jean-Louis Constanza, a telecommunications analyst at BNP Paribas in Paris.

The battle for phone subscribers in Nice will heat up over the coming year as Cegetel completes its network buildout and begins a marketing blitz to sign up new customers.  Its success or failure could shape the dynamics of competition across the French telecommunications sector for years to come.
