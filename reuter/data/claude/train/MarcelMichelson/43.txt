French Government to sell stake in computer-maker Cie des Machines Bull 

The French Government announced today it will sell its 42% stake in Groupe Bull, the state-controlled computer company and IT services provider. The sale of the company, founded in France in 1931, is the latest in a string of privatization moves by President Emmanuel Macron and his administration. Bull employs over 10,000 people worldwide and is headquartered in Paris with a revenue of €1.32 billion in 2016.

The French state has been a majority stakeholder in Bull since rescuing the company from bankruptcy in 2014 and injecting €250 million to prop up the struggling tech firm. Now Macron is looking to raise funds through a sale of shares to help boost the economy and cut government spending. An IPO on the French stock exchange is a possibility if private buyers are not immediately found, according to a government press statement.

Once a leading manufacturer of multi-user minicomputers, Bull has faced significant pressures from the rise of the personal computer and shift to cloud computing and software services. The company still manufacturers servers, computer hardware, and software, but has also pivoted to become an IT services provider. Bull operates data centers, provides IT consulting, and works with companies in sectors like defense, telecommunications, healthcare, and finance.

The sale represents an opportunity for a private buyer to acquire Bull's operations across Europe and its customer base which includes many large French and European institutions. However, significant cost-cutting may also be required to make Bull profitable without government support. Privatization will also mean a loss of national control over a company whose technology and services are used for sensitive purposes by governments and military branches. There are concerns any buyer may discontinue certain operations or entire business units leading to job losses, though the French Government has indicated protections will be put in place for Bull's employees.

According to analysts, proceeds from the sale will be small relative to the amount injected since 2014. Therefore, privatization of Bull is viewed more as an opportunity for the government to cut its losses while advancing President Macron's pro-business strategy. The move may also open up France's technology sector to more competition and push national champions like Bull to innovation. However, it remains to be seen if a new owner will be able to successfully restructure and grow a company that has struggled for decades to keep up with the pace of change in the IT sector.
