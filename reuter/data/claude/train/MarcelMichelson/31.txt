Here is a 750-word news article with the headline "Groupe Salomon SA shares fall for second day in a row due to rumors and bankruptcy of Japanese distributor":

"Shares of Groupe Salomon SA, the France-based sports equipment company best known for its skiing and footwear brands, fell for a second consecutive day today amid speculation that the company may be facing financial difficulties. The stock declined 6.5% today, following a 4.1% drop yesterday, bringing the total decline over the two days of trading to over 10%. 

The sell-off was sparked by rumors that Groupe Salomon's long-time Japanese distributor, Tachibana Corp, had filed for bankruptcy protection. Tachibana has been Groupe Salomon's primary distributor in Japan for over 20 years and Japan represents nearly 15% of Groupe Salomon's total revenue. The bankruptcy of such a major partner raises concerns about the financial impact on Groupe Salomon, though the company has yet to release a statement on the situation.

Some analysts also pointed to Groupe Salomon's recent struggles in its skiing equipment division as a sign that the company may be facing broader challenges. Revenue from skiing equipment, which comprises the largest portion of the company's business, has declined for three consecutive years due to warm winters in Europe and Japan as well as increased competition from lower-cost manufacturers. Last month, Groupe Salomon announced plans to close three factories in France and lay off over 1,000 employees in an effort to cut costs, fueling speculation that the company is under greater financial strain than has been publicly disclosed.

However, other analysts argued that the declines over the past two days were an overreaction and that Groupe Salomon remains on sound financial footing. The company still generates over $8 billion in annual revenue, maintains a healthy balance sheet with little debt, and has a well-established portfolio of brands including Salomon shoes and apparel as well as Arc'teryx outdoor gear. While the loss of the Japanese distributor would require Groupe Salomon to find an alternate partner in the region, Japan comprises a relatively small portion of the company's global business. The restructuring plans announced last month are a prudent cost-cutting measure, analysts said, and not a sign of impending financial troubles.

Going forward, much will depend on Groupe Salomon's upcoming second-quarter earnings results and announcement of a new Japanese distribution agreement, analysts said. Investors will be closely monitoring the company's financial reports and statements to determine whether the sell-off this week was an overreaction to rumors and short-term challenges or a harbinger of deeper issues within the company. In the meantime, volatility is likely to continue in Groupe Salomon shares until there is greater clarity on the company's financial health and outlook."
