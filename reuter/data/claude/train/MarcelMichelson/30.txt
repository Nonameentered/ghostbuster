Daewoo Electronics Defends Plans to Buy French Multinational Thomson Multimedia With Charm Campaign 

Daewoo Electronics, South Korea's second-largest consumer electronics company, is launching a major charm campaign to defend its controversial $5.3 billion bid for the French multinational Thomson Multimedia. The proposed deal has faced criticism from European regulators concerned about growing South Korean influence in the region.

Daewoo announced an advertising and public relations blitz across major European countries to reassure customers and policymakers about its intentions. The company will highlight its commitment to Thomson's 56,000 employees worldwide and pledge to maintain Thomson's brand identity and management independence. 

"We want to spread a message of partnership and cross-cultural cooperation," said Kim Sung-Hee, Daewoo's head of corporate communications. "This acquisition is about growth, not cost-cutting. Thomson's legacy of innovation will be in good hands."

The announcement comes amid growing protectionism in Europe's electronics sector. Daewoo's bid faces scrutiny from the European Commission's competition regulators, who are increasingly skeptical of takeovers by large Asian corporations. Thomson is a crown jewel of French industry, though it has struggled in recent years due to mismanagement and fierce competition from Asia.

Some French politicians have called on the government to block the sale of Thomson to "foreign interests." Unions representing Thomson's employees also expressed concerns about job security under new ownership.

Daewoo's charm campaign highlights its plans to turn Thomson into its global brand for innovative consumer technologies like smart home devices and streaming media. The company pledges annual R&D investment exceeding $2 billion to restore Thomson as a consumer electronics leader. 

While public opinion in France remains wary, some analysts argue that Daewoo's bid could be a lifeline for Thomson. "Thomson should embrace this deal," said Pierre Ferragu, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research in London. "Remaining independent and rudderless poses an existential risk. Daewoo seems genuinely committed to Thomson's success over the long run."

The proposed acquisition still requires final approval from European regulators. Daewoo's ability to win over politicians and consumers in France may determine if the deal goes ahead or is permanently blocked. The coming months will test whether charm and cooperation can prevail over growing economic nationalism in Europe.
