French Privatisation Plan Clouded by Controversial Sale of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics 

The French government's ambitious privatisation program hit a roadblock today with the controversial sale of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia to South Korean conglomerate Daewoo Electronics. The €1.9 billion deal, finalised after months of negotiations, hands control of Thomson's TV, set-top box, and DVD/Blu-ray player businesses to Daewoo, a subsidiary of the debt-ridden Daewoo Shipbuilding Group.

The sale has drawn criticism from French trade unions and politicians, who argue it threatens jobs at Thomson's factory near Paris and compromises France's strategic interests. Thomson has been in financial difficulties in recent years but remains an important employer, with 22,000 staff worldwide including 4,000 in France. Unions claim Daewoo intends to shift production to lower-cost manufacturing sites, potentially rendering hundreds of French workers redundant.

The deal represents a setback for President Emmanuel Macron, who has staked his political credibility on a far-reaching privatisation push aimed at liberalising the French economy and raising billions for a new innovation fund. However, the Thomson sale falls well short of expectations, according to analysts. The government had hoped to raise at least €3 billion from selling its 27.8% stake in Thomson, but lingering concerns over its financial health and business outlook meant Daewoo was the only serious bidder to emerge.

Politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned the fire sale, with opponents from both left and right arguing that key strategic companies should not be sold off to foreign investors, especially at knockdown prices. Thomson remains the only major TV manufacturer left in France, and its research arm is involved in sensitive defence projects. Government ministers counter that the company requires major restructuring and investment in order to remain competitive, which the state cannot provide, and that privatisation with a foreign strategic partner is the only viable path. 

Under the terms of the deal, Daewoo will hold a 65% controlling stake in Thomson, while the French government will retain 15%, with the remaining 20% held by France's state-owned Bpifrance investment bank. Daewoo pledges to invest €500 million over the next five years to update Thomson's ageing facilities and product lines, and commits to not closing any French factories for that period. The future remains highly uncertain, however, and much will depend on whether Daewoo can return the company to sustained profitability and win market share from low-cost Chinese rivals.

The Thomson sale forms part of a wider privatisation drive in which President Macron aims to raise €10 billion by selling stakes in Paris airport operator ADP Group, lottery and gaming company Française des Jeux, and energy group EDF. After a stuttering start with Thomson, Macron faces an uphill struggle to hit this ambitious target and plug a budget deficit that risks breaching EU limits. The coming months will prove crucial in determining whether his privatisation gamble pays off or further clouds France's economic outlook.
