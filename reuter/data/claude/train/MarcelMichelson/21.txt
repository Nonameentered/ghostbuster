Rhone-Poulenc SA Reports Higher Than Expected Profits in Q3 Despite Product Recall Expenses

Rhone-Poulenc SA, the French pharmaceutical and chemical conglomerate, reported higher than expected profits in the third quarter of 2019 despite expenses related to a recent product recall. The company reported net income of €1.25 billion, a 3.4% increase from the same period last year. Analysts had forecast profits of €1.15 billion. 

The better-than-expected results were driven by strong sales growth in the company's pharmaceutical division, particularly from new cancer and rheumatoid arthritis drugs. Revenue from the pharmaceutical division grew 12% to €4.5 billion, offsetting a 4% decline in the chemicals division.

"Our new product launches continue to gain market share and drive growth, even as we faced headwinds from a temporary product recall this quarter," said CEO Claude Bertrand in a statement. In September, the company recalled three batches of its popular diabetes drug Glyprim due to potential contamination at a manufacturing facility in Marseille. The recall reduced revenue by €220 million in the quarter.

Despite the product recall costs, revenue in the third quarter rose 7% to €9.36 billion. "The product recall was unfortunate, but we were able to minimize the financial impact through swift action and the continued strength of our underlying business," said Bertrand on a call with analysts.

For the full year, Rhone-Poulenc now expects revenue growth of 6-7% and profit growth of 4-5%. The company is counting on new product momentum to continue into the fourth quarter, especially from its rheumatoid arthritis drug Arazlo, which was approved in the U.S. in August. 

However, the company faces pricing pressure in Europe, where governments are attempting to rein in rising healthcare costs. Additionally, generic competition for Glyprim will likely impact sales next year following the recall. Rhone-Poulenc may need new product releases to offset these headwinds in 2020.

Bertrand noted that the company's pipeline of new drugs, especially in oncology, remains strong. "We have 10 new molecular entities in late-stage development that we expect to launch over the next 3 years," he said. "While the operating environment is challenging, innovation continues to be the lifeline of our company, and the key to future growth."

Rhone-Poulenc shares rose 4% on the earnings report, reflecting investor confidence in new product momentum and the company's ability to drive profits even in the face of significant headwinds. Barring any new product issues or other unforeseen impacts, Rhone-Poulenc appears poised to deliver on its full-year guidance, driven by the double-digit growth of its pharmaceutical arm. Overall, it was a quarter that showed both the opportunities and risks inherent in the pharmaceutical business.
