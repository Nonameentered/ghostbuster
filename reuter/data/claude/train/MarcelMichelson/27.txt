Daewoo Electronics Defends Controversial Deal to Buy France's Thomson Multimedia with Pledge of Investments  

Daewoo Electronics, South Korea's second-largest consumer electronics firm, moved to defend its controversial $6.9 billion purchase of France's Thomson Multimedia today by pledging major investments in the French company. The deal, announced last week, has faced criticism from French politicians and unions over potential job losses.  

In a press conference today in Seoul, Daewoo Electronics chairman Kim Woo-choong said, "We did not acquire Thomson to strip its assets. We aim to make it a stronger, more competitive company that will boost its manufacturing and research capabilities." Kim said Daewoo plans to invest at least $2 billion over the next three years to upgrade Thomson's factories, develop new products, and expand sales and marketing operations. 

The Thomson purchase is Daewoo's largest foreign acquisition and marks its entry into the European consumer electronics market. Thomson is France's top maker of television sets and DVD players but has struggled recently with rising competition and losses. Kim said Daewoo's investments would save thousands of jobs at Thomson plants across Europe that might otherwise have been cut.

However, leaders of France's communist-backed CGT union have criticized the deal, fearing Daewoo will eventually move jobs to lower-cost facilities overseas. "We do not believe the promises of Daewoo executives," said union spokesman Henri Martin. "Once they control Thomson technology and brands, nothing will stop them from shifting production to China or India." French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici has also asked Daewoo to provide "solid and verifiable" guarantees to secure French jobs.
