French Finance Minister Defends Procedure in Planned Sale of Thomson SA

The French Finance Minister defended the government's handling of the planned sale of electronics group Thomson SA amid criticism over the deal's transparency. 

Thomson SA, which makes televisions, set-top boxes, and other consumer electronics, was formerly owned by the French government but was privatized in the late 1990s. The current French government still retains a 30% stake in the company. Last month, Thomson announced it had received a takeover bid from Chinese electronics giant Haier Group worth â‚¬6.8 billion.

The potential sale has been controversial, with opposition leaders and some Thomson employees arguing that the deal lacked openness and that the government failed to consider alternative options to a Chinese takeover. The Finance Minister rejected these criticisms in Parliament this week, stating that Thomson's board of directors and an independent committee of experts reviewed Haier's offer and deemed it the strongest bid with the fewest risks.

"The process was fair and impartial," the minister told lawmakers. "We have no preferred bidder, French or otherwise. We only aim to find the solution that is in the best interest of Thomson, its employees, and the technology and know-how it possesses." The minister also said that a condition of any sale is that Haier commits to maintaining Thomson's headquarters and staff levels in France for at least five years.

Two other Asian electronics companies and one European firm also made offers for Thomson but they were considered less attractive based on price and terms, according to the Finance Ministry. Some lawmakers have called for the government to disclose more details on how the bids were evaluated to address concerns around China's growing economic influence in France. An alliance of several opposition parties have asked for a vote in Parliament on ratifying the potential deal before it can proceed.

The sale of Thomson to Haier could see another prized French company fall into foreign hands a decade after Thomson's privatization. However, the Finance Ministry maintains that the deal, if finalized, would ensure the viability and growth of the company and secure French jobs -- its top priorities throughout the sale process. A final decision is expected within the next month.
