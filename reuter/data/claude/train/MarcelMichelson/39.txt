Thomson Multimedia employees protest against planned sale to Daewoo

Employees at Thomson Multimedia, the French consumer electronics giant, staged protests today over the company's planned sale to South Korean conglomerate Daewoo. Over 200 employees gathered outside Thomson's headquarters in Paris to voice their opposition to the $4.2 billion deal, which was announced last week. 

The protesters are concerned that a sale to Daewoo could threaten jobs and working conditions at Thomson, which employs over 10,000 people across Europe. Daewoo is expected to cut costs and restructure operations after the takeover, fueling fears of job losses. "Daewoo will destroy our jobs and company culture just to boost profits," said one Thomson employee at the protest.

Thomson has struggled in recent years in the face of stiff competition from Asian rivals like Samsung and Daewoo itself. The company has lagged behind in new product innovation and has steadily lost market share, especially in the television and DVD segments that it once dominated. The sale to Daewoo is seen as a way to gain a strategic partner with capital and technological expertise to help Thomson better compete globally. 

However, analysts are skeptical about the compatibility of the two companies and worry Thomson may lose its identity under Daewoo's control. "There is a clear risk that Thomson gets absorbed into Daewoo's organization and the brand name disappears over time," said Jean-Louis Duplan, a consumer tech analyst at Paris-based Financiere de l'Arc. He argued that Thomson would be better off remaining independent and implementing its own turnaround plan rather than handing over control to a foreign acquirer.

The proposed deal still needs approval from Thomson shareholders and French regulators before going through. The protests highlight the challenges Daewoo may face in integrating Thomson and winning over both employees and customers. Thomson's management tried to reassure staff, saying their input would be incorporated to ensure minimal disruption. But with more protests planned, the coming battle for control of Thomson Multimedia is set to continue.
