Possible Demerger of Rhone-Poulenc Could Boost Share Value by a Third, says French Broker

Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, could increase its share value by up to a third if it split into separate pharmaceutical and chemicals businesses, according to a report by French stockbroker Société Générale. The report said that Rhone-Poulenc's disparate activities in drugs, industrial chemicals and farming products currently constrained its valuation. 

The broker recommended that Rhone-Poulenc should spin off its fastest-growing pharmaceuticals unit to attract a higher rating in line with other European drug companies. Rhone-Poulenc's shares are currently trading at a discount to peers due to the perceived drag from cyclical chemicals operations.

Société Générale said a demerger could unlock up to FFr29 billion ($5 billion) of extra value for shareholders. It valued Rhone-Poulenc's pharmaceutical division, which includes Aventis, at FFr105 billion as a standalone business. The broker noted significant earnings upgrades led by the new Aventis drug Taxotere, used in treating cancer, could further support a premium rating. On the other hand, the broker assigned a lower FFr20-25 billion valuation to the chemicals and farming products operations due to their exposure to economic cycles. 

Rhone-Poulenc has hired investment bank Lazard Freres to advise on options for restructuring its portfolio, including a possible demerger of Aventis. However, any split would be complicated by the group's integrated supply chain and shared research facilities. The company also recently spent over FFr10 billion to build a new research center.

Marc Bonneval, analyst at Société Générale, said: "Rhone-Poulenc's intrinsic value and stock market performance are being held back by a stubborn conglomerate discount. With its pharmaceutical arm poised for years of strong growth, now is the ideal time to unlock this hidden value through a split." 

However, some analysts argue against a break-up of Rhone-Poulenc, saying its diversity helps reduce risk and there are limited cost savings to be gained from a split. The company's management has also previously said there are "powerful synergies" from joint operations, although this view is coming under increasing pressure from shareholders. Rhone-Poulenc's stock price has lagged the wider French market by over 25% in the past year.

At current prices, Société Générale estimates a stand-alone Rhone-Poulenc pharmaceutical unit would be valued at 15 times forecast 1999 earnings, compared to an 11 times multiple for the existing group. This could imply short-term gains of up to 30% for shareholders if a demerger went ahead, with further upside as the growth potential of Aventis feeds through. However, the French broker cautioned there were execution risks in any break-up and the actual market reaction remained uncertain.
