Possible demerger of Rhone-Poulenc into chemicals and pharmaceuticals groups could boost share value by a third, says leading French broker  

Rhone-Poulenc, one of France's largest companies with interests in chemicals and pharmaceuticals, could see its share value rise by up to 34% if it pursues a demerger into two separate listed groups, according to a leading French brokerage firm.

Exane BNP Paribas issued a note to investors yesterday arguing that Rhone-Poulenc's chemicals and pharmaceuticals divisions would be worth more as independent pure-play companies than combined in the current conglomerate structure.  The chemicals unit is the world's second-largest producer of chemicals and plastics, while the pharmaceuticals division is France's largest drug company and owns popular over-the-counter brands such as Strepsils, Biogaran and Doliprane.

"The two businesses have limited synergies and different growth profiles, risk levels and valuation metrics," said Exane BNP Paribas analysts in the note. "Splitting the group could highlight the significant value trapped within."  

They argue that as separate companies, the chemicals division could be valued at €21 billion, a 12% premium over the current valuation, while the pharmaceuticals unit may be worth €29 billion, a 34% uplift. Combined, this sums to a €14 billion or 28% increase in equity value versus the current Rhone-Poulenc market capitalization of €51 billion.

Rhone-Poulenc’s management issued a cautious response, saying they regularly review the group’s structure but believe the current integrated model maximizes value.  However, some large shareholders told reporters they found the analysis by Exane BNP Paribas compelling and think a demerger should be seriously considered.

The company was formed in 1999 through the merger of French industrial giants Rhône-Poulenc and Hoechst.  At the time, the combination was touted as creating a European champion.  However, some analysts argue the diversified conglomerate model has since fallen out of favor, and more focused pure-play companies are now preferred.  

A demerger would be complex but could unlock value for shareholders and provide more transparency, according to supporters.  The chemicals and pharmaceuticals businesses face different challenges, with the former grappling with industry overcapacity and weak pricing power, while the latter confronts rising costs for research and development of new drugs.   

However, critics argue a break-up risks losing valuable diversification benefits and synergies between divisions.  Rhone-Poulenc's management has long argued that combining chemicals and pharmaceuticals provides resilience through economic cycles.  They also point out that a demerger would be costly and time-consuming at a time when management's focus should remain on improving performance.

The bold call from Exane BNP Paribas for Rhone-Poulenc to consider a demerger reflects broader changes in investor sentiment that seem to favor more targeted 'pure-play' companies over sprawling conglomerates.  However, Rhone-Poulenc’s management still appears unconvinced, and shareholders may have to apply more pressure yet if they want radical structural changes.
