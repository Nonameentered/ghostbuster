Daewoo Electronics Fights Back with Charm Campaign Over Plans to Buy Thomson Multimedia 

South Korea's Daewoo Electronics launched a public relations campaign this week to win over French regulators and public opinion for its planned acquisition of Thomson Multimedia, the consumer electronics unit of Thomson SA. Daewoo faces significant opposition in France to the $7 billion deal, announced in January, which would make Daewoo the world's third largest consumer electronics company.

In a charm offensive, Daewoo took out full-page newspaper ads in French media emphasizing that it will keep jobs and decision-making in France. The ads featured an open letter from Daewoo's CEO promising "Daewoo and Thomson, side by side, for growth and employment in France." The CEO also gave interviews to French media promising Daewoo will invest in Thomson's French factories and keep them open. 

The PR campaign came as Daewoo faces twin challenges: scrutiny from French competition regulators and a drop in public support for the acquisition. Regulators have requested Daewoo provide more details on how it will ensure competition is preserved before approving the deal. Public opinion polls show only 45% of French citizens now back the acquisition, down from 56% in January. Unions representing Thomson employees have also come out against the deal, fearing job losses.

"This charm offensive is really targeting two audiences: the regulators and the public," said Laurent Morel, a Paris-based PR consultant. "Daewoo needs to reassure both that French interests will be protected if this deal goes through."

For Daewoo, purchasing Thomson would boost its position in Europe and diversify its operations away from Asia where growth has slowed. Daewoo is counting on the Thomson brand name and distribution network in Europe to sell more its products like flat-screen TVs. Daewoo has pledged to keep the Thomson brand and allow its French management team to continue running operations. 

Thomson shareholders approved the deal in February but it must still clear regulatory reviews in France and the European Commission. Daewoo hopes its PR campaign will win over politicians, opinion leaders and citizens in France to support the acquisition in time for final approval. While public opinion is not legally binding, regulators do consider it and a rejection by the public could damage the deal. Daewoo's charm offensive appears to show the company will work hard to become a trusted owner and partner of Thomson.
