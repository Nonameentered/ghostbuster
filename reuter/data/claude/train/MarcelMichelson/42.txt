French computer maker Bull gains freedom to deal with any computer group in Europe 

The French computer manufacturer Bull announced today that it has gained approval from the European Commission to cooperate with any computer company within the European Economic Community. The approval lifts restrictions that had been placed on Bull's commercial activities as a condition of government aid the company received in 1982.

Bull, which was founded in 1931, ran into financial trouble in the late 1970s and early 1980s due to increasing competition from IBM and other multinational computer makers. The French government stepped in 1982 and provided substantial aid to Bull to prevent the company from going bankrupt. However, the European Commission required the French government to place certain limits on Bull's operations to ensure fair competition, including barring Bull from cooperating with other computer manufacturers.

With the computer market having changed substantially since the 1980s, Bull petitioned the European Commission to lift those restrictions. The Commission agreed that the limits were no longer necessary and approved Bull's request without condition. "This decision recognizes the major strategic and technological transformations at Bull over the past 30 years," said Bull's CEO, Jean-Pierre Saad. 

The lifting of the restrictions will allow Bull to pursue joint ventures, licensing deals, and other partnerships with any other computer company in the European Union. "Bull competed alone during dark years, but now cooperation is key to contending with giants in the IT industry," Saad said. Some analysts expect that Bull may explore deals with Asian computer manufacturers in order to expand its reach, especially in emerging markets. Others suggest Bull may pursue closer ties with other European technology companies like German software maker SAP or semiconductor maker Infineon Technologies.

For the European Commission, the decision reflects the liberalization of competition policy as the computer industry has matured from national champions like Bull to global behemoths. The state aid restrictions on Bull were a relic of an earlier era and philosophy about competition in technology markets. With Bull having been nursed back to health and Europe home to world-leading tech companies, the Commission seems willing to take a lighter touch to regulating the computer sector. For Bull and its new freedom to partner, the future remains unclear but full of possibilities.
