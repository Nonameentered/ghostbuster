STET joins Bouygues’ efforts to become leading player in French telecoms market 

Bouygues Telecom took a major step forward in its goal to become a leading telecommunications provider in France with the acquisition of STET, a former state-owned telecom company. Bouygues purchased STET from the French government for €4.2 billion, adding STET’s 9 million mobile subscribers and 3 million landline subscribers to Bouygues existing base of 15 million mobile and 2 million landline customers.

“This acquisition is a game changer for Bouygues Telecom and propels us to the top tier of telecom operators in France,” said Olivier Roussat, CEO of Bouygues Telecom. “By combining Bouygues Telecom and STET’s networks, customer bases, and talent, we now have the scale and resources to accelerate investments in next-generation infrastructure and new technologies that will benefit consumers and business customers across France.”

The deal gives Bouygues Telecom more than a 30% market share in the French telecom sector, putting it second only to leader Orange with its 37% market share. Iliad, which operates the Free Mobile brand, remains in third place with about 20% of the market. Industry analysts expect the STET acquisition to intensify competition in France’s telecom industry as operators battle for subscribers and look for ways to differentiate their services.  

Bouygues Telecom outlined plans to leverage its increased scale to expand its fiber-optic network, enhance its 4G and 5G mobile networks, and develop new TV, smart home automation, and data services. The company said it aims to have 20 million fiber-optic connections by 2025, up from 10 million today. Bouygues also pledged to invest €2 billion to strengthen its mobile networks over the next two years.

The STET purchase highlights the ongoing consolidation of the telecom sector in Europe as companies look to gain size and competitive strength. Two of Britain’s largest operators, O2 and Virgin Media, announced plans to merge earlier this year. Vodafone, Europe’s largest mobile carrier, acquired cable operator Unitymedia in Germany last year.  

STET began as France’s national telephone company in the 19th century. The French government fully privatized STET in 1997 but retained a minority stake until selling its remaining shares to Bouygues in this latest deal. STET struggled in recent years with declining landline customers and investments in its aging networks. Joining Bouygues Telecom is expected to provide STET with greater financial backing and operating expertise to better compete in today’s French telecom market.
