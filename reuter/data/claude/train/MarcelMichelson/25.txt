Protests and backlash over planned sale of state-owned Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics drive down Lagardere shares 

Shares of French media conglomerate Lagardere fell sharply today amid protests over its planned sale of Thomson Multimedia, a state-owned consumer electronics firm, to South Korean giant Daewoo Electronics. Lagardere has owned a controlling stake in Thomson since 1998 but announced earlier this month it would sell its remaining 32% share in the company to Daewoo for $5.2 billion.

The proposed deal has sparked criticism from French politicians and unions. They argue that selling Thomson to a foreign owner could threaten French jobs and weaken the country's electronics sector. Thomson employs over 10,000 people in France and is an important supplier to other local manufacturers. 

“Selling Thomson is a short-sighted move that will only benefit Lagardere shareholders at the expense of our technological sovereignty,” said far-left opposition leader Jean-Luc Melenchon. Several French members of parliament have called on President Emmanuel Macron to block the takeover on national interest grounds.

Unions at Thomson plants across France staged strikes and demonstrations today to protest the sale. "Foreign ownership will destroy our jobs and know-how," said Andre Bergeron, a union representative at Thomson's factory in Angers. He warned Daewoo would shift manufacturing abroad to cut costs, as other foreign buyers of French companies have done.

The outcry appears to have rattled investors in Lagardere, which depends heavily on its publishing arm. Its shares fell as much as 5.8% in Paris today, cutting its market value by over $350 million. The drop reflects concerns that political and public opposition could complicate or derail the Thomson sale, depriving Lagardere of funds to pay down debt and strengthen its balance sheet.

In a statement, Lagardere defended its decision and said the deal with Daewoo would help ensure Thomson's long-term viability. It added that Daewoo had pledged to keep most Thomson operations and management in France. But analysts note Daewoo is under pressure to cut losses in its electronics business and may struggle to keep that promise.

The controversy highlights the challenges of privatizing state-owned companies in France's mixed economy. While Macron has promised to make France more business-friendly, public resistance remains strong to foreign takeovers of brands like Thomson that are still seen as national champions. 

The coming weeks will be critical as politicians debate whether to approve the sale or try to stall it. For now, Lagardere must hope that the backlash does not grow loud enough to convince Daewoo that acquiring Thomson is more trouble than it's worth. The future of 10,000 French jobs and Lagardere's balance sheet hang in the balance.
