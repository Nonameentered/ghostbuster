Taiwan Proposes "Greater China" Joint-Venture Bank, Met with Caution in Hong Kong 

Taiwan's financial regulator announced a proposal this week to establish a joint-venture bank with mainland China and Hong Kong, a move aimed at promoting "Greater China" economic cooperation. The proposal calls for the three jurisdictions to jointly establish an investment bank that would facilitate cross-border investments and fund regional infrastructure projects.

The announcement was met with a lukewarm response in Hong Kong, however. Analysts and industry groups voiced concerns about the political and regulatory challenges of a joint China-Taiwan financial institution. Hong Kong already has a free trade agreement with mainland China, but China still claims Taiwan as a province and tensions remain across the Taiwan Strait.

"There are a lot of unanswered questions about how this would work in practice given the complex political dynamics involved," said Joyce Poon, a Hong Kong-based financial analyst. "While the concept sounds good in theory to promote regional cooperation, actually executing it would require navigating some tricky political and regulatory issues."  

Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission said the proposed joint-venture investment bank could raise capital from public listings in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Taipei. It envisioned the bank funding major regional infrastructure projects to improve connectivity between the three economies. But industry groups in Hong Kong warned that those projects would face scrutiny to ensure political sensitivities are respected.

"Any joint projects would need to be carefully structured to avoid political controversy," said the regional head of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association. "There are also concerns about whether a joint 'Greater China' bank could operate independently and objectively serve the interests of investors and shareholders from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan."

Regulators in Taiwan and Hong Kong said they would study the joint-venture bank proposal but that any progress would depend on political and regulatory approvals from mainland China. Analysts said they were skeptical Beijing would endorse a formal joint financial institution with Taiwan in the current political climate.

In summary, while Taiwan's proposal for a joint China-Taiwan investment bank aimed to promote greater economic cooperation, the lukewarm response from Hong Kong's financial community highlighted the political and regulatory challenges involved in executing such a concept. Significant hurdles remain before a "Greater China" bank could become reality.
