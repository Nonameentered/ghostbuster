Hong Kong celebrates 100-day countdown to Chinese rule with nationalistic parade

Hong Kong marked 100 days until China assumes control of the territory with a show of patriotism today. Thousands of people took part in a parade through the streets of Hong Kong island waving Chinese flags to celebrate Hong Kong's return to China after 155 years of British rule.

The parade was organized by pro-Beijing groups to drum up support for the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China on July 1. Marchers carried banners reading "One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong Stands Up" and "Hong Kong is Part of China Forever," referring to the principle by which Hong Kong will govern itself for 50 years after the handover. 

"We are here to show our love for Hong Kong and China," said marcher Tao Chen, 45. "After so many years, we are finally reunited with our motherland."

Not all Hong Kong residents support the handover, however. A recent poll found that 42% of Hong Kong people feel "not very confident" or "not confident at all" in the "one country, two systems" principle. Many fear erosion of the civil and economic liberties Hong Kong enjoys under British rule.

"Hong Kong has a vastly different system than mainland China," said pro-democracy activist Lee Cheuk-yan. "We have freedom of speech and press, rule of law, an independent judiciary. But in China none of that exists. We have no idea whether our way of life will be respected after the handover."

To reassure Hong Kong of its autonomy, China's President Jiang Zemin said in a speech today that "the social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the life-style." He promised that China will support Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub.

Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was visiting Hong Kong, also sought to ease worries in a meeting with business leaders. "There is no point in Britain clinging onto Hong Kong for the sake of it," he said. He urged Hong Kongers to keep an open mind about life after the handover. "The future is uncharted, but I believe it can be good provided we have the will to make it so."

After a sunset ceremony in Victoria Harbour, a fireworks show lit up the sky. The dazzling display ended with the words "Hong Kong Is Part of China" emblazoned across the city's skyline - a symbolic reminder of Hong Kong's destined return to Chinese sovereignty in just 100 short days.
