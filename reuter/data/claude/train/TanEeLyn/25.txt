Tung Chee-hwa returns from Beijing to shape new administration, pledges high autonomy for Hong Kong after handover  

Hong Kong's first chief executive Tung Chee-hwa returned from Beijing today and pledged to shape an administration that will uphold a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong after the handover from Britain to China on July 1.

Speaking to reporters at Hong Kong International Airport, Tung said "the central government will strictly adhere to the principle of 'one country, two systems' outlined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration." Under this principle, Hong Kong will become a special administrative region of China but retain its own political and economic system for 50 years after the handover.

Tung said he held "productive discussions" with Chinese leaders including Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Qian Qichen during his four-day visit to Beijing. The purpose of the trip was to discuss formation of Hong Kong's first post-handover administration and application of the "one country, two systems" principle. "The central government expressed full confidence in my ability to lead Hong Kong through this transition and build on its success," Tung said.

Tung declined to disclose details about the selection of principal officials in the new Hong Kong administration. But he said the process would be "open and fair" and aim to recruit candidates who are "suitable, accountable, and patriotic." The chief executive added that both Chinese and British nationalities would be considered.

Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the chief executive nominates principal officials for appointment by Beijing. But Tung said he wanted "maximum autonomy" in shaping his new team. "I will not take orders from Beijing on this," he said in a rare display of outspokenness. "How I form my cabinet is a matter for Hong Kong to decide." 

Tung's pledge of a high degree of autonomy and push for an open selection of officials will reassure Hong Kong residents worried that civil liberties and judicial independence may be eroded after the handover. But pro-democracy activists argued Tung's administration still won't be fully democratic or accountable. "Tung wasn't elected by Hong Kong people in a free vote, so he has no mandate to lead," said Democratic Party chairman Martin Lee.

The British handed Hong Kong to China in 1997 after ruling it for 150 years. The intervening decades saw Hong Kong transform into a global financial hub, raising concerns that its way of life may change under Chinese rule. But its status as a special administrative region shields it from the mainland's Communist system and promises continuity of Hong Kong's freedoms and rule of law. Tung today reaffirmed that vision as he prepares to steer Hong Kong into its next chapter under the sovereign control of China.
