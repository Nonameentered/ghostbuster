Pro-democracy activists scuffle with police in Hong Kong's "phoney election" protest 

Hundreds of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong clashed with police officials today in protests against what they called a "phoney election" as the city's government prepares to select a new leader in a closed-door process. 

The activists are demanding free and fair elections for Hong Kong's chief executive, instead of a vote by an election committee stacked with pro-Beijing and pro-establishment members. Hong Kong has been ruled by China since 1997 under a "one country, two systems" model that gives the city freedoms not found on the mainland. However, pro-democracy supporters say those freedoms are being eroded by China's communist leaders.

Today's protest led to scuffles between police and protesters outside government headquarters in Admiralty. At least two protesters were arrested, according to witnesses. Police used pepper spray and batons to push back hundreds of protesters, some of whom threw water bottles and chanted: "Sham election, urgent revolution!" The protesters want universal suffrage for Hong Kong's 7.5 million residents instead of the election committee of about 1,200 members choosing the next chief executive.

"China's leaders are breaching their promise that Hong Kong could maintain its freedoms for 50 years after the handover," said Lee Cheuk-yan, one of the pro-democracy lawmakers at the protest. "We want real choice and real competition in free and fair elections, not a rigged process that is designed to ensure a pro-Beijing stooge is selected." 

The election for chief executive will be held on March 25 but pro-democracy activists have decried it as a "selection not election." They argue the candidates have to win majority support from the election committee, which is dominated by pro-Beijing and business representatives, ensuring only candidates palatable to China's communist party leaders can run for the top job. The activists' demands for universal suffrage have been rejected by Hong Kong's government and China's Parliament.

Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's current chief executive, defended the upcoming election as "competitive, fair and honest." She said the election committee represented a "balanced representation of members from various sectors of the business and political spectrum." But pro-democracy supporters argue the election system denies most of Hong Kong's citizens a say in choosing their leader.
