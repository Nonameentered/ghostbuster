European Parliamentarians Rally Hong Kongers to Speak Up for Democracy 

A delegation of members of the European Parliament visited Hong Kong this week to show solidarity with Hong Kongers fighting to preserve their democratic freedoms and autonomous status. In meetings with pro-democracy activists, students, and opposition politicians, the European lawmakers urged the city's citizens to continue speaking up and applying pressure in the face of Beijing's tightening grip.

"We stand with the people of Hong Kong in defending your rights and freedoms," said Reinhard BÃ¼tikofer, a German member of the European Parliament and leader of the delegation. "You must continue resisting peacefully and vocally. Make your voices heard."

The four-day visit comes at a tense moment, with Beijing conducting a broad crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Earlier this month, China's parliament officially imposed a draconian national security law that grants mainland authorities sweeping powers to curtail political dissent and civil liberties in Hong Kong. The law has been condemned by Western governments as a violation of China's pledge to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties.

Since the law went into effect, pro-democracy leaders have been arrested, activists have fled into exile, and several opposition groups have disbanded out of fear of prosecution. But protesters have continued taking to the streets, risking long prison sentences to call for democratic reforms and protest the erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms.

Members of the European Parliament praised Hong Kongers' bravery and said citizens must intensify peaceful acts of resistance to safeguard their rights. At a meeting with student leaders, Belgian MEP Samuel Cogolati urged young people to harness the power of social media and civil disobedience campaigns to put pressure on authorities.   

The delegation also met with pro-Beijing politicians and Hong Kong government officials, who defended the national security law as necessary to curb unrest and restore order. But critics argue the law's overly broad provisions provide cover for a campaign to eliminate political opposition and dissent.

The European Parliament has passed a resolution condemning China's actions in Hong Kong and threatening to reconsider the EU's economic relationship with China if Beijing fails to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. But Hong Kong activists say more concrete action is needed to push back against China's advance. The visit from European lawmakers this week provided moral support to the city's beleaguered pro-democracy camp. But activists argue only coordinated international pressure can stop Hong Kong from sliding into authoritarianism.
