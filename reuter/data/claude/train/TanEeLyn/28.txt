Hong Kong's Governor Chris Patten refuses to support new China-installed legislature 

Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten today refused to endorse the selection of a new provisional legislature in Hong Kong by China to replace the outgoing democratically-elected Legislative Council. In a strongly-worded statement, Patten said he could not support a body that was appointed rather than elected and did not reflect the will of Hong Kong people.

The move is the latest in a series of steps by China to exert more control over the governance of Hong Kong leading up to its handover from the United Kingdom to China on July 1, 1997. Under the "one country, two systems" principle agreed between Britain and China, Hong Kong is meant to retain its own political and economic system for 50 years after the handover. However, a provisional legislature was installed after China dissolved Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council earlier this year.

In his statement, Patten said: "No one can have any confidence in or respect for a so-called legislative body in Hong Kong that is being imposed by Beijing rather than chosen by the people of Hong Kong. The new body lacks any credibility or legitimacy." Patten criticized the lack of transparency in the selection process and the heavy influence of pro-Beijing politicians. "It is not a genuine democratic institution but a body manned overwhelmingly by placemen appointed to do Beijing's bidding," he said.

The 60-member provisional legislature was selected by a 400-member Beijing-dominated selection committee in December. Only a third of the members have any elected experience. Key democratic leaders were excluded. The body will serve as Hong Kong's parliament for 10 months after the handover until new elections are held.

In recent months, Patten has been vocal in criticizing various moves by China to roll back civil liberties and democratic reforms in Hong Kong ahead of the handover. "Britain has a moral responsibility to the people of Hong Kong to make sure the promises set out in the Joint Declaration are actually delivered," Patten said in Parliament in October. There are concerns China will push through restrictive new laws on security, subversion and media controls using the provisional legislature.

The spat is the latest in an acrimonious relationship between Patten and China. Upon arriving as Hong Kong's last governor in 1992, Patten introduced democratic reforms which angered China and led to a refusal to hold direct talks. China has frequently denounced Patten in public and refuses to recognize his authority. With only six months left until the handover and legislative powers now lost, Patten is effectively serving as Hong Kong's "lame duck" governor and moral spokesperson.
