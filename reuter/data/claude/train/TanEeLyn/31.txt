Hong Kong's future leader plans roadshow to raise profile and clarify sovereignty transfer issues 

John Lee, Hong Kong’s newly elected Chief Executive, announced plans today for a roadshow to raise his profile and clarify issues around the city’s sovereignty transfer from Britain to China 25 years ago. Lee, 64, takes office on July 1 and wants to address concerns about Beijing's tightening grip on the semi-autonomous territory.

Lee said the roadshow will include public forums, meetings with business and community groups, and events with the city's youth. The goal is to "reassure Hong Kongers about the bright future of the city and clarify any misunderstandings about the 'one country, two systems' framework," Lee said, referring to the principle by which Hong Kong retains some civil liberties and political autonomy after returning from British to Chinese rule in 1997.

Lee, a former security chief, won an uncontested election last month to become Hong Kong’s fifth chief executive. He faces a difficult task in reviving an economy battered by two years of protests, the pandemic, and a new national security law that critics say undermines Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy. 

Business groups hope Lee can improve ties with Beijing while also defending Hong Kong’s competitive advantages that make it an international financial hub.  "We want clarification on how 'one country, two systems' can be steady and move forward," said Foo Kong-Kee, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce.

Lee's roadshow also aims to win over opponents, especially young Hong Kongers who see Beijing wielding ever more influence.  "We need to come together to build mutual understanding and ease frictions in society," Lee said.  But pro-democracy activists argue that under Lee, Beijing will only strengthen its grip, threatening rights and freedoms.  

"No roadshow can hide the harsh truth that Beijing ultimately calls the shots in Hong Kong," said Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front. "Lee was elected in a sham process and will never stand up for Hong Kongers."

Despite the criticisms, Lee appears determined to get out and engage various segments of the Hong Kong public. Supporters argue the roadshow can at least promote more open dialogue after years of unrest. Lee will visit all 18 districts in the city to conduct the community outreach, with details of specific events to be announced in coming weeks.
