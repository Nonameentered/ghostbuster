Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Co Ltd downplays investor fears of impact from U.S. missile attacks

Shares in China's Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Co Ltd fell as much as 5% today as investors feared the impact of recent U.S. missile attacks on Syria on the company's operations. Zhenhai Refining is a major producer of petroleum and petrochemical products with facilities located near the coastal city of  Zhenhai in eastern China. 

Investors were concerned that escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could disrupt global oil supply chains and impact Zhenhai Refining's access to crude oil feedstocks. However, company executives moved quickly to reassure investors that Zhenhai Refining's operations remain unaffected and business is continuing as normal.

"We have a diversified and resilient supply chain and multiple sources for securing crude oil and other raw materials," said Guo Songtao, Chief Executive Officer of Zhenhai Refining & Chemical. "While we continue to monitor developments in the Middle East closely, our day-to-day operations remain stable and we do not anticipate any disruption."

According to Guo, Zhenhai Refining sources most of its crude oil from suppliers within China and across Asia, including Russia and Central Asia. Only about 15-20% of its crude oil comes from the Middle East. The company has long-term supply contracts in place and its plants maintain sizable crude oil feedstock inventories on site to ensure uninterrupted operations.

Zhenhai Refining's facilities are strategically located in eastern China with good access to road, rail and sea transport. Its main 200,000 barrels per day refinery is connected via pipeline to the company's own crude oil import terminal at the Port of Zhenhai, which has a capacity of up to 2 million tonnes per year. This provides the company its own means of importing crude oil and minimizes its reliance on third-party crude pipelines and sea ports.

Investors appeared reassured by the clarifications from Zhenhai Refining's management. The company's shares regained most lost ground by the market close, ending trading down just 0.8% on the day. Market analysts also weighed in, with JP Morgan issuing a research note stating that "the company's diversified crude supply and integrated logistics chain provides a hedge against geopolitical risks and supports our 'overweight' rating on the stock."

With its resilient operations and sound fundamentals, Zhenhai Refining & Chemical remains well placed to navigate periods of market volatility. Barring a wider regional conflict, the company seems poised to emerge largely unscathed from the latest rise in Middle East tensions. But in these uncertain times, Zhenhai Refining's management will remain vigilant.
