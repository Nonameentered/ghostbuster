Hong Kong Mourns as Leaders Pay Respects to China's Deng Xiaoping  

Hong Kong residents gathered across the city today to mourn the death of China's former leader Deng Xiaoping, who passed away earlier this week at the age of 92. Deng led China for more than a decade, spearheading economic reforms that transformed the nation into a global economic powerhouse. 

Under overcast skies, Hong Kong leaders and dignitaries paid their respects to Deng at a memorial ceremony this morning. Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa led government officials in bowing three times before a portrait of Deng. In a speech, Tung praised Deng's vision and leadership. "Deng Xiaoping was a great leader who changed the destiny of China. He has made tremendous contributions to the prosperity and stability of our country," Tung said.

Deng's passing has been met with an outpouring of grief across China, where he still commands deep respect and admiration. Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji called Deng "the chief architect of China's reform and opening to the outside world." Zhu led a state memorial service for Deng in Beijing yesterday attended by hundreds of world leaders and dignitaries.

During his lifetime, Deng became known as the "chief architect" of China's modernization. He gained prominence in the Communist Party leadership in the late 1970s and pushed to "open up" China's economy to global trade and market forces after years of isolation under Mao Zedong. Deng's policies lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and transformed China into an industrial and technological powerhouse.  

In Hong Kong today, businesses paused and trams momentarily halted along typically busy streets as the memorial ceremony commenced. Taxi drivers sounded their horns, while some residents bowed their heads in silence. Later in the day, thousands lined up at makeshift memorial sites across the city to lay wreaths, bouquets and written tributes to honor Deng's memory. 

Despite policy differences over the years, Deng maintained a close relationship with Hong Kong. His death marked the end of an era for a leader who shaped both contemporary China and Hong Kong. At the ceremony today, Tung summarized the sentiment of millions in saying a final farewell to the leader affectionately called Xiaoping: “Thank you, Xiaoping, for everything you have done. Hong Kong will never forget you.”
