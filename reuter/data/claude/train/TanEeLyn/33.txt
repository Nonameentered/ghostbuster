Painter Liu Yu Yi Benefits from Hong Kong’s Handover to China with Portraits of Beijing’s Leaders

HONG KONG—Liu Yu Yi was a struggling artist in Hong Kong in 1997 when China regained sovereignty over the former British colony. The handover of Hong Kong to China opened up new opportunities for Liu to paint portraits of Chinese leaders, launching his career and propelling him to fame and fortune.

In the 20 years since the handover, Liu has become one of Hong Kong's most successful portrait artists, with his paintings of former paramount leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin and current leader Xi Jinping fetching millions of Hong Kong dollars at auctions. His portraits hang in government offices and museums across China as well as in private collections of politicians and businessmen.  

“The handover was a turning point for me,” said Liu, now 52 years old, at his studio in Hong Kong. “There was demand for portraits of Chinese leaders, and I was in the right place at the right time to fill that demand.”

Liu was born and raised in Hong Kong during British rule. He graduated from Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 1990 with a degree in fine arts. After struggling for seven years to establish himself as a professional artist, Liu got his big break in 1997 when he was commissioned to paint the portrait of Deng Xiaoping for display at a new museum commemorating China's resuming control of Hong Kong.

The success of that initial portrait launched Liu's career as an artist specializing in Chinese leader portraits. He has since painted dozens of portraits of Chinese presidents and senior officials. His portraits are prized for their photorealism and attention to detail in capturing the likeness of the leaders.  

“Painting leaders' portraits requires meticulous work to achieve a perfect likeness,” Liu said. “You must understand their facial features and expressions very well. It is a huge responsibility to represent these historic figures.”

Liu's success has coincided with a broader trend of growing Chinese influence and control in Hong Kong over the past 20 years. While some Hong Kongers resent encroaching control from Beijing, Liu has embraced closer ties with China for the commercial opportunities it has provided. He frequently travels to Beijing to view new portraits of Chinese leaders and incorporates elements of traditional Chinese portrait painting techniques into his style.  

“Some people think I'm a mouthpiece for Chinese propaganda, but that's not how I see it,” Liu said. “I am first and foremost an artist exploring a genre of portrait painting. The fact these portraits are of Chinese leaders is secondary to my goal of creating art.”  

Whatever Liu's motivations, his paintings offer insight into how China's authoritarian system individuals and projects an image of power and leadership. And for Liu, the handover of 1997 remains a pivotal moment that launched his career and afforded him the success and status as an artist he enjoys today.
