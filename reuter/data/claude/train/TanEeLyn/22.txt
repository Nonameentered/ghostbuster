Shipping Magnate Tung Chee-hwa Endorsed as Hong Kong's Leader-in-Waiting by Beijing-picked Preparatory Committee  

The Preparatory Committee appointed by Beijing to oversee the transition of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule in June 1997 today endorsed shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa as the territory's first chief executive. The 60 members of the committee unanimously elected Tung after two rounds of voting. The committee's selection is expected to be approved by China's State Council and the chief executive will be formally chosen by a 400-member Selection Committee in December.

Tung, a 69-year-old shipping tycoon with close ties to Beijing, ran uncontested for the position. His main competitor, retired judge Chung Sze-yuen, withdrew his candidacy at the last moment citing a lack of support. While Tung won by default, his supporters argue he has the experience and connections in both Hong Kong and China needed for the challenging job of presiding over Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty after more than 150 years of British rule.

However, Tung's selection has been controversial and reinforces concerns that China intends to exert control over Hong Kong's political and economic systems post-handover. Some lawmakers and residents worry Beijing is abandoning its promise to give Hong Kong a "high degree of autonomy" under the "one country, two systems" framework outlined in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. They see Tung as a Beijing loyalist who will prioritize mainland interests over Hong Kong's. His lack of political experience and public service also raise questions about his ability to govern Hong Kong's dynamic society.

In a brief victory speech, Tung pledged to defend Hong Kong's freedoms while also fostering even closer ties with Beijing. "We must have confidence in the 'one country, two systems' principle," Tung said. "With the support of the central government and the people of Hong Kong, I am confident we can make this policy work well." He promised to focus on maintaining the rule of law, civil liberties, economic prosperity, and Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub. Tung is expected to run unopposed in Hong Kong's first post-handover legislative elections scheduled for May.
