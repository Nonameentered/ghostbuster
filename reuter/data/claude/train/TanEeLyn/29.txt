Beijing-Approved Body to Hold First Meeting in China, Not Hong Kong, Says Future Leader Tung Chee-hwa

The first meeting of a Beijing-approved transitional council charged with managing Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule will be held in Shenzhen, China and not in Hong Kong, its future leader said on Monday. Tung Chee-hwa, the head of the council and Hong Kong's future leader after July 1, said holding the first council meeting on mainland soil was "symbolic."

"Our first meeting in Shenzhen highlights the relationship between Hong Kong and our motherland," Tung said in a press briefing. While the day-to-day work of the council will be handled in Hong Kong, holding key ceremonial meetings in China demonstrates Hong Kong's growing integration with the mainland, he said.

The transitional council, known formally as the Preparatory Committee for the Special Administrative Region, was formed by Beijing in 1996 to oversee the preparations leading to Hong Kong's transition from British to Chinese control. The 150-member council includes many business leaders and pro-Beijing politicians.  Critics argue the body lacks popular representation and legitimacy. 

Tung said the council's role was to ensure a "smooth and orderly" transfer of power and prepare new laws to bring Hong Kong in line with China's legal system. The meeting in Shenzhen will focus on reviewing reports from five sub-committees focused on the civil service, finance, the judiciary, legal matters and the electoral system. The council will only have three more meetings before it disbands on July 1.

Britain handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1842 and regained control in 1997 under a "one country, two systems" principle that ensures Hong Kong maintains political and economic autonomy for 50 years. China has sought to exert more control over Hong Kong in recent years, limiting democratic reforms and jailing pro-democracy activists. Holding meetings of a body focused on Hong Kong's transition in China has fueled concerns that China aims to tighten its grip and potentially undermine Hong Kong's autonomy even before the 50-year transition period ends.
