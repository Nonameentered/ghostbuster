Sinopec Implementing Measures to Alleviate Diesel Shortages and Rising Prices in China

China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec), China's largest oil refiner, announced emergency measures this week to increase diesel production and transport fuel to areas experiencing supply issues and price spikes. Several regions in southern China have reported diesel and gasoline shortages over the past few weeks, causing pump prices to rise and fueling inflation concerns.  

Sinopec said it will raise diesel output at its refineries by up to 10% in May to mitigate tight supplies. The company will also increase diesel transportation from oil depots to gas stations across southern China. Sinopec controls about 60% of China's oil refining capacity and operates over 30,000 gas stations across the country. The moves are aimed at stabilizing fuel prices and ensuring adequate supplies during the busy summer driving season, according to a Sinopec spokesman.

The diesel crunch in China comes at a time when global oil prices have rallied to their highest levels since late 2014. Brent crude oil futures have gained nearly 9% so far this month, rising above $74 per barrel. China's domestic wholesale diesel prices track global crude oil prices and have also jumped in recent weeks. The shortages have caused retail diesel prices at the pump to rise even faster, fueling concerns about higher inflation.  

China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) acknowledged the supply issues and said the commission will closely monitor the diesel markets, urging large oil companies to boost supplies. The NDRC said companies should optimize their refining schedules, increase diesel output and expand storage and transportation capacity. The NDRC also asked local governments to release diesel from strategic petroleum reserves if needed.

The diesel shortages appear most acute in Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan provinces, important manufacturing and tourism hubs in southern China. Analysts say the supply tightness stems from several factors, including rising demand from coastal factories, more diesel-powered trucks and buses on the road, and logistical bottlenecks in the fuel transport network. 

Sinopec's efforts to ramp up diesel production and increase transportation of fuel to needy areas should help alleviate the shortages over the coming weeks. However, if global crude oil prices continue to rally, China's retail diesel and gasoline prices may remain elevated through the summer. The situation highlights China's ongoing dependence on oil imports to meet domestic fuel demand as well as the challenges in balancing supplies across the country's vast geography. Overall, China's oil security remains a strategic issue as oil consumption continues to grow at a healthy pace.
