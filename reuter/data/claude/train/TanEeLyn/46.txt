Hong Kong's Future Leader Meets Political Opponent in Bid for Conciliation Ahead of Chinese Rule 

Hong Kong's newly selected Chief Executive Carrie Lam met with a key political rival today in an apparent effort to bridge divisions ahead of China assuming control of the territory on July 1st. 

Lam, who was chosen earlier this month to become Hong Kong’s first female leader, met with defeated candidate and pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong for over an hour. A spokesperson for Lam said the meeting was aimed at finding “common ground and areas of possible cooperation” despite differences in political outlook.

The encounter signals that Lam may take a more conciliatory approach than her predecessors in the leadership role.Hong Kong operates under the “one country, two systems” principle, which provides certain democratic freedoms not afforded in mainland China. Some in Hong Kong fear that civil liberties and political dissent will be eroded after the transition.

Wong, a student activist who rose to prominence during the 2014 pro-democracy “Umbrella Movement” protests, has been an outspoken critic of mainland China's influence in Hong Kong. However, following the meeting with Lam today, Wong struck an optimistic tone. He said the two figures had a "friendly and open discussion" and found agreement on certain social issues like housing, education and political reform.  

"There may be disagreements between Ms. Lam and I that cannot be resolved," Wong said. "However, she has shown a willingness to listen to voices of dissent, and find common ground which is good for building trust in the community."

Lam's decision to meet with Wong and extend an olive branch was praised by some observers as a sign of strong leadership. But other critics argue the move may be simply for show, and that little will change to curb China's eventual assertion of control. Only time will tell whether reconciliation and compromise between Hong Kong's political factions will shape the region's future after the handover or if lingering tensions will remain unresolved.
