British Foreign Secretary Meets Future Hong Kong Leader, Fails to Bridge Gap between Governments

The Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, Liz Truss, met with incoming Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee in London today. The meeting was intended to address growing tensions between the British and Hong Kong governments over human rights and democratic freedoms in the former British colony. However, it appears Truss and Lee failed to find common ground, underscoring the deep divide that persists on those issues.  

Truss has been an outspoken critic of erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong under the new national security law imposed by Beijing. In a statement after the meeting, Truss said, “I reiterated the UK’s deep concern over the dismantling of Hong Kong’s freedoms and called for the preservation of the rights and livelihoods of the people of Hong Kong.” She pushed for independent judicial oversight and transparency around police conduct but received no firm commitments from Lee on those points.

Lee, the sole candidate in Hong Kong’s recent leadership election, is a hardliner closely aligned with Beijing’s central government. He made no mention of political or judicial reforms in his own statement. Instead, he called the meeting “productive” and said, “the Hong Kong government will continue to safeguard the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong under the ‘one country, two systems’ principle.” His reference to stability suggests there will be no loosening of restrictions on dissent or free expression.

The failure of the leaders to find consensus comes amid an exodus of pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong. Many prominent activists have fled abroad or been imprisoned under the draconian new national security law. Although London has offered refuge and a path to citizenship for some leaving Hong Kong, that stance has only hardened Beijing’s determination to impose more control. The outlook is bleak for future cooperation between the U.K. and Hong Kong governments unless Beijing unexpectedly reverses course. But with President Xi Jinping’s tightening grip on power in China, most observers see no prospect of that in the foreseeable future.
