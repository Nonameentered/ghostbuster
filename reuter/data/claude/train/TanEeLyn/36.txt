British Foreign Secretary meets Hong Kong's future leader, but fails to narrow the gap between incoming and outgoing governments 

The British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab met with Hong Kong’s incoming leader John Lee today in Hong Kong, but the talks failed to resolve key differences over the territory’s political future. Lee, the sole candidate in Hong Kong’s Chief Executive election in May, will take over from current leader Carrie Lam on July 1. However, Lee and Lam’s governments appear sharply at odds over how to handle rising political tensions in the former British colony.

Raab expressed Britain’s concerns over erosion of political freedom and civil liberties in Hong Kong during his visit. “The UK government remains deeply committed to the people of Hong Kong and defending their rights and freedoms,” Raab said. However, Lee pushed back against criticism of his government’s policies and rejected calls for political reform. Lee insisted that stability and security are his top priorities upon taking office next month. 

The political situation in Hong Kong has been precarious since pro-democracy protests shook the territory in 2019.  A sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing last year has been used to crack down on dissent, raising international alarm. Raab said Britain may consider further actions if promised political freedoms in Hong Kong are not upheld. However, Lee has shown no willingness to change course, instead doubling down on policies favored by Beijing.

Differences were also apparent between Lee and the outgoing Lam administration on pandemic policy. While Lam has cautiously reopened Hong Kong to international travel after a lengthy COVID-19 border closure, Lee has hinted he may tighten restrictions again if case numbers rise. The whipsaw policy changes have frustrated businesses and residents craving a return to normalcy.

There are few signs of improved relations on the horizon. Lee refused to meet with pro-democracy lawmakers during his visit, and has given no indications of reversing authoritarian policies favored by his predecessors. The chilly reception during Raab’s visit highlights the vast political differences that remain between Britain and its former colony 25 years after the handover from British to Chinese rule. While Britain aims to defend democratic values and institutions in Hong Kong, Beijing continues to exert greater control and demand loyalty to mainland China’s authoritarian model of governance. 

With no compromise in sight, Hong Kong’s political crisis seems likely to deepen further after Lee takes office in July. The failure of Raab’s visit underscores the fading influence of Britain in its former colony and the dominance of China over Hong Kong’s political fate for the foreseeable future. Despite handover agreements to preserve autonomy and freedoms for 50 years, China appears determined to tighten its grip on the territory long before the end of the transition period in 2047. Britain’s warnings and reproaches collide with Beijing’s far more forceful interventions, leaving little room for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement to maneuver. The future remains uncertain for the territory caught in a intensifying great power struggle over its destiny.
