Pro-Taiwan community in Hong Kong flies Nationalist Chinese flags for last time before China takeover 

Members of Hong Kong's pro-Taiwan community gathered today to raise the flag of the Republic of China (ROC) for possibly the last time before the territory officially becomes part of the People's Republic of China on July 1. Around 200 people congregated in Victoria Park this morning to hoist the red, blue and white Nationalist flag that has been a symbol of opposition to Beijing's rule.

"After today we don't know if we will be allowed to display this flag in public anymore," said Wong Ching-yu, a Hong Kong native with Taiwanese heritage. "We want to stand up for democracy and show our allegiance to the ROC one last time before it becomes illegal under the new security law." 

The event was organized by the Hong Kong Taiwan Youth Association to mark the July 1 takeover but also to protest Beijing's new national security law, which bans secessionist and subversive behavior. Raising the ROC flag could be interpreted as contravening the new law. "We are not separatists, we just want to uphold the democratic values that this flag represents," said Hong Kong Legislator Eddie Chu at the flag raising event.

Under the "One Country, Two Systems" principle, Hong Kong has enjoyed limited autonomy and freedoms like freedom of speech and assembly since the 1997 handover from Britain to China. However, activists fear Beijing is tightening its grip and eroding civil liberties. The new security law, imposed without consulting Hong Kong's legislature, criminalizes subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign interference. 

"After today, demonstrations like this may be considered a threat to national security," said 25-year-old engineer Brian Wong. "We don't know how far Beijing may go to clamp down on dissent and assert more control. But we want to show with this symbolic act that the democratic spirit of Hong Kongers lives on." The protesters sang the ROC national anthem and chanted pro-democracy slogans for two hours in a emotional gathering that underscores the deep political divisions in this city of 7.5 million people.
