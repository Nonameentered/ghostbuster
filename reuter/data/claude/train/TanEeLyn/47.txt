China keen for smooth Hong Kong transition to pave way for Taiwan reunification, says expert

Beijing wants a smooth political transition in Hong Kong to demonstrate the viability of the "one country, two systems" model it proposes for Taiwan, an expert said on Monday. 

China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a wayward province that must be brought under its control, by force if necessary. Beijing has offered Taiwan the same "one country, two systems" model of autonomy under which Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

Dr. Hui Po Keung, a political commentator and adjunct professor at Hong Kong University, said China was keen to push ahead with political reforms in Hong Kong to show they can work.

"If 'one country, two systems' continues to be problematic in Hong Kong, this will strengthen the perception in Taiwan that reunification with China under this model is not viable or attractive," he said.

Democratic reforms stalled in Hong Kong last year, with mass pro-democracy protests posing one of the biggest political challenges to Beijing in decades. The unrest was sparked by fears that Beijing was tightening its grip on the former British colony and threatening its freedoms and autonomy.

Now Beijing wants to restart Hong Kong's political reform process to get it back on track. It is expected to discuss proposals to elect the chief executive by popular vote at China's Parliament meeting later this month.

"Beijing hopes that progress on political reform in Hong Kong, especially plans to elect the chief executive by universal suffrage in 2022, can help alleviate concerns in Taiwan about reunification," said Dr. Hui.

China's parliament passed a resolution in 2005 that said Taiwan could reunite under the "one country, two systems" model and "enjoy a high degree of autonomy". But Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and her ruling party have said they will not accept that model. Tsai and her party, which is critical of Beijing, took power in 2016.

Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. In a January 2019 speech, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but will strive to achieve peaceful "reunification".
