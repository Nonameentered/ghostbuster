Hong Kong Marks 100 Days to Handover Amidst Varying Emotions  

Hong Kong is marking 100 days until the transfer of sovereignty over the British colony to China with a mix of anticipation, anxiety, and uncertainty among residents. On July 1, 1997, Hong Kong will be handed over from British to Chinese rule under the “one country, two systems” agreement, ending more than 150 years of British control.

The handover comes at a time of both optimism and apprehension in Hong Kong. Many residents look forward to closer ties with China as the world's second largest economy continues to grow in power and influence. However, others worry that Hong Kong's democratic system and freedoms could be eroded under Chinese authority. A recent survey found that 39% of Hong Kong residents feel “very positive” or “quite positive” about the handover, while 35% have negative views, and 26% are neutral or unsure.

Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last British Governor, has urged China to honor its commitment to the “one country, two systems” framework that will give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover. China has promised that Hong Kong's political and economic systems will remain unchanged, but many residents are skeptical given China's authoritarian system of government. Critics argue that China's control will inevitably lead to greater restrictions on civil liberties like free speech and political dissent. Supporters counter that Hong Kong will continue to thrive as a global financial hub even with closer Chinese oversight.

In the final months of British rule, Hong Kong faces key decisions around its political and economic relationships with China. The Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar is set to expire and will need to be renegotiated, and talks are underway on post-handover trade and financial agreements between Hong Kong and China. The makeup of Hong Kong’s first post-colonial government under the "one country, two systems" model is also being determined. 

Beijing has signaled its intention to be closely involved in Hong Kong after the handover, sparking warnings from Britain. But Chinese officials counter that they will respect Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status while playing a bigger role in its political and economic life after 150 years of British administration come to an end. With only 100 days left until the transfer of power, Hong Kong continues to grapple with hopes and anxieties around its return to Chinese sovereignty after centuries of British rule come to a close on June 30. The future of Hong Kong's global financial hub status under Chinese authority remains unclear, with the possibility of both new opportunities and challenges on the horizon.
