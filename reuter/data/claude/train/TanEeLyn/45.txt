Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten credits democratic government for prosperity 

Hong Kong's outgoing governor Chris Patten praised Hong Kong's democratic system of government today as a key reason for the city's prosperity over the past few decades. In a speech as he prepares to leave office, Patten argued that Hong Kong's success was built on its independent judiciary, free press, and civil and economic freedoms.

"Hong Kong's embrace of civic and economic freedom, and its trust in the impartial rule of law have been absolutely fundamental to the creation of today's society," Patten said. He warned that any erosion of rights and freedoms could undermine Hong Kong's position as a leading global financial hub.

Patten, Hong Kong's last governor under British rule, will hand over control of Hong Kong to China on July 1 after 155 years of British colonial governance. There are concerns that Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic freedoms may be limited under Chinese rule. However, China has agreed to govern Hong Kong under the "one country, two systems" model, maintaining its capitalist economy and democratic systems for 50 years.

In his speech, Patten pointed out that in the decades since Hong Kong became a British colony after the First Opium War in 1842, it has been transformed from a small fishing village into a world city and major commercial port. "The trappings of representative government and judicial independence were the soil in which Hong Kong's prosperity was planted," Patten said. "Unless the waters of democratic freedom continue to flow through the veins of this society, I have no doubt that it will wither."

Patten received a standing ovation after his speech from pro-democracy activists, lawmakers, and business leaders at the Foreign Correspondents' Club. His words highlighted anxieties over Hong Kong's future within an authoritarian China, but also pride in Hong Kong's achievements as a global center of trade and finance. Patten remains optimistic but said Hong Kong's continued success depends on China upholding "liberty and justice for the people of Hong Kong."
