Toronto's Stock Market Falls as Wall Street Tech Stocks Hit by Profit-Taking  

The Toronto Stock Exchange fell sharply today, dragged down by a steep decline in technology shares on Wall Street overnight. The S&P/TSX Composite Index dropped 1.2% or over 300 points in morning trading. The losses come after major U.S. stock indexes posted their worst day in weeks, driven by a sell-off in some of the market's most prominent technology companies.

Shares of the big tech companies that have fueled Wall Street's rally this year, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft all fell after their earnings reports. Although the companies reported higher profits, their shares dropped between 3 to 7% as investors booked recent gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell over 2%, its worst decline since May. 

The drop in tech stocks spilled over into the Canadian market, with shares in the technology sector falling nearly 4% as a group. Shopify, Canada's largest tech company, fell over 6% in early trading. "When high-flying stocks like the tech giants start to slip, it rattles market confidence and we see broader declines as investors get nervous and pull back from equities,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management.

While Canadian tech stocks mirrored the losses in U.S. peers, the Canadian market was also impacted by weaker oil prices which weighed on energy shares. The energy sector fell 2.4% as oil prices dropped over 3% to around $40 US a barrel. The prospect of slower economic recovery and concerns over a second wave of COVID-19 infections have raised worries about weaker demand for oil.

Nonetheless, Cieszynski noted that "this looks like an ordinary pullback in an ongoing bull market rather than the start of a major correction.” Market observers have warned that periodic retreats are likely following the over 50% gains in stock prices since the market lows in March. Despite today's drop, the TSX remains up nearly 35% from its March trough and technology shares are still up over 70% year-to-date. Barring a more prolonged downturn, investors may see today's decline as an opportunity to buy into a market that still has further room to run.
