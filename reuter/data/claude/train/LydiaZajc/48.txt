Toronto Stocks Fall as Oil and Gas Sector Takes a Hit 

The Toronto Stock Exchange fell today, dragged down by steep declines in the oil and gas sector. The S&P/TSX Composite Index dropped 1.2% to close at 17,567. Losses were broad-based across sectors but the energy sector was the hardest hit, falling 3.4%.

Shares of major Canadian oil and gas producers declined sharply amid volatile global oil prices. Meg Energy fell 7.3%, Crescent Point Energy dropped 6.5% and Husky Energy declined 5.4%. The price of Western Canadian Select, a benchmark for the country's heavy crude, fell 2.7% to US$38.13.  

The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners, lost 2.2% with shares of First Quantum Minerals down 5.9% and Lundin Mining falling 4.3%. Silver and copper prices declined which put pressure on metal producers.

In contrast, shares of some gold miners rose as bullion prices climbed to a four-week high. Barrick Gold gained 1.7% and Kinross Gold added 1.2%. The gold sector overall edged up 0.2%.

The declines came as data showed Canadaâ€™s trade deficit narrowed in April as exports of motor vehicles and parts climbed, though total exports declined for the fourth straight month. The trade gap shrank to $1.9 billion, down from $3.3 billion in March.

It was a sea of red for technology and financial stocks as well. The tech sector fell 2% while financials dropped 1%. Only the defensive consumer staples and telecom sectors showed gains, rising 0.1% and 0.2% respectively.

Analysts said the declines were partly due to profit-taking from solid gains in May. But ongoing global trade tensions and the slowing economic expansion are weighing on investor sentiment. The TSX lost 6.8% in 2018 and has risen 10% so far this year.
