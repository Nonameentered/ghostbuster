Zellers CEO Aims to Boost Sales by a Third to Regain Market Leadership from Walmart 

The CEO of Zellers, Canada's second-largest discount retailer, announced an ambitious plan today to increase sales by 30% over the next three years in a bid to regain its position as the country's leading mass merchant from its archrival Walmart.

Doug Knapp unveiled the turnaround strategy at Zellers' annual convention in Toronto, telling hundreds of head office employees and store managers that "the sleeping giant has awakened." Zellers needs to reassert its historic leadership role that it lost to Walmart's aggressive expansion into Canada in the 1990s, he said.

The sales target implies Zellers would generate revenue of $15-billion by 2023, up from $11.5-billion in its recently completed fiscal year. Same-store sales, a key performance benchmark, would need to rise in the high single digits annually to reach that objective. "It's an ambitious goal but with your help and the right plan, it's an achievable one," Knapp told the gathering.

The plan includes rebranding Zellers stores with a new logo and store format, improving the loyalty program, enhancing the product assortment, streamlining operations to lower costs, and refocusing marketing on Zellers' low-price value proposition. Zellers will also step up investment in e-commerce and launch an online grocery pickup service at some locations.

Despite its ambitions to retake the mass merchandise crown, Zellers faces significant hurdles. Walmart has built a substantial lead, with 375 stores across Canada versus 296 for Zellers. Walmart also dwarfs Zellers in global scale, giving it major pricing advantages with suppliers that will be difficult to match.  Some retail analysts are skeptical Zellers can reach its sales target without making an acquisition or entering a new retail format.

However, Knapp believes Zellers has a path to victory by leveraging its still sizable store base, improving its customer experience, and capitalizing on missteps by Walmart.  "Walmart has left the door open in some areas like e-commerce where we can gain ground," he said in an interview. "If we execute this plan well, there's no reason we can't achieve our goal and give Walmart a run for the money again."

The next year will be critical as Zellers revamps dozens of stores and ramps up its marketing firepower. If it can show accelerating sales momentum and traction with shoppers, that may be enough to declare its turnaround strategy is gaining traction, renewing hopes it can once again become a worthy adversary for Walmart.
