Toronto stock market weakens in brisk trading as Canadian bonds and bank stocks suffer sell-off  

The Toronto stock market suffered a drop in early trading on Tuesday as Canadian bonds and bank stocks came under significant selling pressure. 

The S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 123 points, or 0.78%, to 15,641 shortly after the open. The index had closed at a fresh record high on Friday and had reached its highest level since June 6 earlier in the session.

The sell-off was widespread, with all sectors in negative territory. The financials group, which accounts for about a third of the index, slumped 1.3% as shares of Canada's biggest banks tumbled. Royal Bank of Canada fell 1.6%, Toronto-Dominion Bank dropped 1.3%, and Bank of Nova Scotia declined 1.4%.

Government of Canada bond yields spiked higher, with the benchmark 10-year yield soaring 10 basis points to 1.435%, its highest since June 2018. Bond prices move inversely to yields. The surge in yields weighed on rate-sensitive sectors like utilities and telecoms.

The move in Canadian yields was seen tracking the rise in U.S. Treasury yields, as bond markets brace for rising interest rates. The U.S. 10-year yield reached its highest in a month. The Bank of Canada is expected to start hiking its benchmark interest rate as early as next month, further adding to yield increase pressures.

"The bond market selloff is pushing yields higher and triggering profit-taking in stocks, especially interest rate sensitive sectors," said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. "Markets still expect the Bank of Canada to start raising rates next month so higher yields and worries about slowing growth are prompting some investors to take some chips off the table."

In other corporate news, shares of Corus Entertainment Inc. plunged 17.4% after the media company reported quarterly results that missed estimates. The company also warned of "meaningful economic headwinds" impacting its advertising revenues going forward.  Overall, about two stocks declined for every one that gained on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Trading volumes were brisk with nearly 170 million shares changing hands, indicating the sell-off was broad-based.
