Toronto Stock Market Resists Downturn, Finishes Stronger Amid Bond Rally  

The Toronto Stock Exchange finished up today despite losses on other global markets. The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 0.7% to close at 16,573.68, even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1% and the S&P 500 fell 1.9% in New York. 

The boost for Canadian stocks came from the bond market, where government bond yields rallied. The yield on the Canadian 10-year government bond gained 12 basis points to climb to 1.574%. Higher bond yields often signal investor confidence in the economy and reduced demand for the safety of government debt. They translate to lower interest rates for loans and mortgages.

The financials sector, which accounts for about a third of the TSX, gained 1.1% today. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest lender, rose 1.8% while smaller rivals CIBC and Bank of Montreal were up 1.7% and 1.2% respectively.  The energy sector also provided a lift, with shares of  Canadian Natural Resources closing 3.2% higher as oil prices bounced.  

"The Canadian market has been very resilient given the weakness we've seen in other markets this week," said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. "The bond market rally and strength in interest-sensitive sectors like financials and utilities have offset weakness from lower commodity prices and trade concerns affecting manufacturing and materials stocks."

The market gains came despite ongoing global trade tensions and weaker-than-expected economic data from China, which sparked selloffs in overseas markets.  Cieszynski said the Canadian market's smaller technology sector, which dropped 4% on the Nasdaq today, has sheltered it from some of the volatility experienced by U.S. tech giants. However, he warned that broader market declines often catch up to Canada eventually.

"There's a good chance we may see some kind of pullback if other markets continue to show weakness, but so far the TSX has stood up pretty well," Cieszynski said. For now at least, the rally in government bonds appears to have given the Toronto stock market enough support to resist a wider downturn.
