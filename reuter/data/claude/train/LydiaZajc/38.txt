Toronto Stocks Close Weaker on Tuesday, Dragged Down by Tarnished Gold Stocks and Profit-Taking 

The Toronto Stock Exchange declined on Tuesday, pulled down by a sell-off in gold mining stocks and some profit-taking from investors. The S&P/TSX Composite Index fell 86.25 points, or 0.5%, to close at 16,601.97.

Gold mining stocks were among the worst performers as the price of gold fell. Shares of Barrick Gold Corp fell 3.7% to $23.85, Kinross Gold Corp declined 7.2% to $6.28, and Goldcorp Inc dropped 3.8% to $16.37. The slide in gold prices weighed on the broader materials sector, which includes mining companies and fell 1.8%.

Energy stocks also declined due to lower oil prices. The energy group, which accounts for about 20% of the TSX's weight, slipped 0.6% with shares of Suncor Energy losing 1.1% to $42.47 and Canadian Natural Resources down 0.9% to $38.67.   

Some market analysts attributed the overall market decline to investors taking profits from strong gains in recent weeks. The TSX reached a record closing high last week and has climbed more than 13% since the start of the year, boosted by optimism of a resolution in the U.S.-China trade war and expectations of steady interest rates.

"Markets have had a pretty strong run year-to-date, so there may be some profit-taking," said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. "But overall, the fundamentals remain supportive of stocks with accommodative policy, low recession risks and signs of stabilization in global growth."

Other market analysts argued that weakness among cyclical sectors outweighed gains in tech stocks, highlighting an uneven market. The technology group rose 1.9% with Shopify gaining 3.9% to $325.02 and Constellation Software adding 2.3% to $1,165.48.

In New York, The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 23.53 points, or 0.1%, to 25,787.36, while the S&P 500 lost 2.21 points, or 0.1%, to 2,866.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.54 points, or 0.2%, to 7,898.05.
