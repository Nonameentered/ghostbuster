Toronto Stock Market Edges Closer to Breaking All-Time High  

The Toronto Stock Exchange moved closer to breaking through its all-time high this week as investors' confidence in the Canadian economy continued to build. The S&P/TSX Composite index rose 1.2% to 17,424, bringing it within 150 points of its record closing high of 17,573 set back in July 2014.  

The index was led higher by strength in technology, healthcare and financial stocks. The tech-heavy NASDAQ index has been on a tear south of the border, and that bullish sentiment spilled over into the Canadian market. Shopify, Canada's largest publicly traded tech company, rose 4.3% and now sits 30% higher for the year. The healthcare sector was boosted by cannabis stocks, with Canopy Growth gaining 6.2% and Cronos Group up 4.1% on optimism around the opening of the recreational marijuana market later this year.

Canada's big banks, which carry significant weight on the TSX, all moved higher in the range of 0.5 to 1.5%. Royal Bank, the country's largest lender, added 1.1%. Bank stocks have been rallying since the Bank of Canada held interest rates steady last week and hinted the next move is likely an increase, which will boost lending margins for the banks.

The rise in oil prices also provided support for the stock market. Energy is the largest sector on the TSX, making up over 20% of the index.  Canadian Natural Resources advanced 2.7% and Suncor Energy rose 2.1% as the price of Western Canadian Select crude gained 3.2% to over $55 per barrel on lower inventories in the U.S. and global supply disruptions.

"The fundamentals supporting Canadian equities remain intact, with solid economic and earnings growth combined with attractive relative valuations," said Matthew Barasch, Canadian equity strategist at CIBC World Markets. "We continue to recommend an overweight position in Canadian stocks."

Not all market participants are as bullish, however. "Valuations are stretched across many sectors of the TSX and investors are ignoring some of the risks facing the market," said Craig Fehr, investment strategist at Edward Jones. "Trade tensions, higher interest rates and a slowing housing market could all weigh on stocks." Whether the bulls or bears prevail in the coming months, the TSX pushing through to new highs would signal investors' optimism in the long-term prospects for Canadian equities.
