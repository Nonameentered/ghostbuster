Toronto Stocks Soften on Thursday, But Avoids Wall Street's Major Sell-Off Due to Strong Financial and Transport Sectors  

The Toronto stock market edged lower Thursday, but avoided the sharp sell-off seen on Wall Street as Canada's major sectors including finance and transportation held their ground.

The S&P/TSX composite index dipped 15.80 points to 15,450.36 as widespread losses were offset by strength in the financial, transportation and materials sectors. Gains were relatively muted as further information is required before investors determine if the broadly lower markets signal a longer term downward trend.

In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 1,000 points for the second time this week, leading to the index's worst day since January. The S&P 500 lost 4.1 per cent and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 3.7 per cent. 

The drops came as fears grow that higher interest rates and yields on bonds could slow down the economy. Fears were also sparked by remarks from Federal Reserve officials indicating the central bank may raise interest rates more quickly than expected due to signs of growing inflation.

Pressured materials shares were limited in decline as copper and gold prices moved up on a weaker U.S. dollar. The April gold contract gained US$16.30 to US$1,318.90 an ounce and May copper rose one cent to $3.14 a pound.

The heavyweight financials sector added 0.4 per cent as insurance stocks continue to recover from a drop in January. Manulife Financial Corp. rose 0.8 per cent to $25.90 and Sun Life Financial Inc. climbed 0.9 per cent to $51.71.

The industrials sector also gained ground as shares of airlines and railways marched higher. Air Canada shares added 5.3 per cent following the release Wednesday of January traffic results showing significant improvements in revenue and load factors. Rival WestJet Airlines Ltd. rose 2.6 per cent and Canadian National Railway Co. advanced 1.7 per cent.

The Canadian dollar traded at an average value of 78.15 U.S. cents, down compared to 78.54 cents U.S. on Wednesday.

Overall, eight of the index's 11 major sectors were lower. Energy was the biggest loser, dropping 1.4 percent as the March crude contract fell US$1.37 to US$60.99 per barrel. Canadian oil producers saw their shares lose ground, including drops of 1.3 per cent for Cenovus Energy Inc. and 1.1 per cent for Imperial Oil Ltd.
