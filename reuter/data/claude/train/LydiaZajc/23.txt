Toronto Stock Market Drops for Third Day in a Row, Except for Golds 

The Toronto Stock Exchange declined for the third consecutive day on Tuesday as most sectors fell due to growing economic concerns. However, gold mining stocks climbed as investors sought safety in precious metals. 

The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 96.16 points, or 0.6%, at 16,274.18. The index has lost 2.6% over the past three trading days. Six of the TSX's 11 major sectors were lower, led by declines of 1.9% in financials and 1.4% in energy stocks.

The losses came as oil prices dropped and economic data fueled worries that the economy is slowing down. U.S. home sales fell in August, and manufacturing indexes suggested factory activity is contracting. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates Wednesday for the second time this year to help boost the economy. Lower rates are generally negative for bank and insurance stocks.

"There's this overriding concern about global economic softness," said Craig Fehr, Canadian markets strategist at Edward Jones. "Any incremental signs of weakness in economic data or other indicators are being reflected in equity market performance."

The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell 1.7% to $58.09 U.S. per barrel as the demand outlook remained weak. Oil and gas producers declined as a result, with Encana Corp down 4.1% and Crescent Point Energy Corp falling 4.4%.

The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.5%. Gold prices rose 0.8% to $1,528.10 per ounce, helping major producers like Barrick Gold Corp gain 3.3% and Kinross Gold Corp 5.6%.

Bullion is seen as a hedge against risk by some investors. "With the global economic uncertainty at the moment, that's giving some underlying support to gold prices," Fehr said.

The Canadian dollar was little changed at 75.17 cents U.S. as the drop in stocks offset higher oil prices.

Investors are awaiting a speech by Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz on Wednesday for clues on monetary policy after recent mixed economic data. The central bank left interest rates on hold this month after cutting in July.
