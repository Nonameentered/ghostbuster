Zellers CEO Aims to Boost Sales and Regain Market Leadership from Wal-Mart

The CEO of Zellers, Canada's second-largest department store chain, announced an ambitious plan today to boost sales and win back customers from retail giant Wal-Mart. "We're committed to offering the lowest prices to our customers while improving the shopping experience in our stores," said John Smith, CEO of Zellers. 

Zellers has struggled in recent years as Wal-Mart expanded aggressively into Canada and targeted Zellers' customers with lower prices and larger stores. Same-store sales at Zellers have declined for the past five quarters. In response, Smith said Zellers will renovate over 100 of its department stores over the next two years, refreshing store layouts and product offerings. The company will also invest $100 million to lower prices across over 10,000 items, especially for household essentials and private-label products.

"We know price is the top factor for our customers when they shop at Zellers, and we have failed to keep up with Wal-Mart on price for too long," admitted Smith. "We are putting price first and foremost in everything we do." The company highlighted a price guarantee that will match prices of any local competitor.

Zellers will also expand and improve its selection of fashion and home decor, aiming to attract customers looking for trendier options versus Wal-Mart's basics. A new "Zellers Collection" of higher-end private labels will launch next month. The company is hopeful that a brighter, more aspirational product assortment will bring back customers wanting an alternative to Wal-Mart.

Some analysts are skeptical that Zellers' moves will be enough to counter the Wal-Mart effect and turn sales around. "Zellers had its chance to match prices for years but didn't, so many former customers have shifted their spending to Wal-Mart on a habit that's hard to break," said retail consultant Christine O'Leary. However, other experts noted that success stories like Target show how department stores can thrive by focusing on price, experience, and exclusive brands.

With over 260 stores across Canada, Zellers still serves more than two million customers each week. By reinvesting in its business and leveraging strategies that have proven successful for its competitors, Zellers aims to win the price and retail leadership war in Canada once again. The outcome of its turnaround efforts will become clear as sales results come in over the coming quarters.
