Toronto stock market closes lower due to battered oil and gas sector 

The Toronto Stock Exchange closed down 243 points or 1.6% Tuesday as the key energy sector was battered by another drop in oil prices. The S&P/TSX Composite index ended the day at 15,319. The energy sector fell 3.5% as U.S. crude oil fell nearly 2% to $61.34 a barrel, continuing a recent slump.

Oil companies were among the biggest decliners as investors worry about excess supply and slowing economic growth. Encana Corp fell 5.5%, Cenovus Energy dropped 4.4%, and Imperial Oil declined 3.6%. The oil price rout has shaved 30% from the value of the energy sector in the last month.

The oil slump comes as OPEC countries and allies like Russia recently agreed to extend production cuts, but investors fear it won't be enough to rebalance the market. The slowing global economy is also weighing on oil demand and prices. 

Concerns about the broader Canadian economy also dragged the stock market lower. New home prices in Canada were flat in December for the third straight month, according to data from Statistics Canada. The numbers reflect a cooling housing market that has weighed on economic growth recently.

The bleak mood was reflected in other sectors as well. The financial sector dropped 1.6%, with three of the "Big Six" Canadian banks declining between 1 to 2 percent. The materials sector, which includes precious metal miners, fell 1.9% as gold prices edged lower.

Defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples were bright spots, gaining ground as investors fled to safety. Shares of Fortis Inc rose 1.65 and Loblaw Companies added 0.8%.

Patrick Leblond, Senior Fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, said investors are increasingly worried about risks to the global economy. "There are more concerns about slowing growth in China and other major economies, and the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China are not helping matters either," he said.

The risk-off sentiment was also reflected in the Canadian dollar, which fell 0.5 cents to 76.10 cents US. The currency is often seen as a proxy for global risk appetite due to Canada's dependence on commodities and global trade.
