Toronto Stocks Rally on Strength in Resource Sectors 

The Toronto Stock Exchange saw strong gains today, propelled higher by resource stocks as commodity prices rose. The S&P/TSX Composite Index climbed 122 points or 0.8% to close at 15,465. Basic materials and energy stocks led the rally, with the materials subsector up 2.3% and energy stocks gaining 1.7%.

Gold prices rose 1% today, boosting shares of Barrick Gold up 3.2% and Kinross Gold up 2.7%. Silver and copper prices also moved higher, lifting First Quantum Minerals by 4.3% and Teck Resources by 3.6%.  

The price of crude oil gained nearly 2% to over $53 per barrel, fueling advances in oil producers. Canadian Natural Resources rose 2.8%, Encana added 2.1%, and Imperial Oil moved up 1.6%. Despite ongoing concerns about a global supply glut, oil has rebounded recently on hopes that production cuts from OPEC and Russia will boost prices.

"We're seeing some decent moves in commodities today, and the resource sectors and oil companies are following suit,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. “There seems to be a growing confidence that the economy is improving and demand for raw materials and energy will pick up.”

The Canadian dollar also strengthened today, up 0.3 cents to 77.12 cents US. A firmer loonie often supports resource stocks, as it boosts the value of revenues earned abroad.

Not all sectors participated in today’s gains, however. The heavily-weighted financials subsector edged down 0.1%, limiting the overall advance of the TSX. Shares of Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank both ended modestly lower.  

Still, with commodities and the Canadian economy showing signs of strengthening, the resource sectors could continue to lead the TSX higher in the coming months. Barring any major setbacks, analysts expect the index to continue grinding to new record highs as 2017 unfolds. Overall, today’s broad rally points to an optimistic start to the year for Toronto’s main stock benchmark.
