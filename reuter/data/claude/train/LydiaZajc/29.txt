Toronto Stock Exchange’s Rally Expected to Last into the 21st Century, Analysts Say 

The Toronto Stock Exchange is on a record-setting bull run this year, and analysts predict the rally will continue into the next century. The TSX Composite index has gained over 25% so far in 2019, putting Canadian stocks on track for their biggest annual gain in decades.

“The economic fundamentals supporting this rally are solid,” said David Jenkins, chief analyst at Canadian Wealth Management. “Interest rates are low, inflation is stable, and corporate earnings have been exceeding expectations. Barring any major geopolitical shocks, I expect to see steady gains in the TSX well into 2020 and beyond.”

The technology sector has led the way, with Shopify emerging as Canada’s first $50 billion company. The e-commerce star has seen its share price skyrocket over 200% this year. Other tech high-flyers like Kinaxis and Lightspeed POS have also posted triple-digit gains. 

The energy sector has staged a comeback thanks to higher oil prices. Canadian oil companies like Suncor, Canadian Natural Resources, and Enbridge have significantly outperformed the overall market. If oil prices stabilize in the $60 to $70 range, as most analysts expect, energy stocks are poised to continue their upward march.

The financial sector, led by the big banks, has also propelled the TSX higher. Royal Bank, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and Bank of Nova Scotia have all gained more than 20% this year as interest rate hikes have boosted profit margins. While analysts expect rate hikes to level off, the sector should continue benefiting from a strong domestic economy and growth in the US.

Overall, most experts remain bullish on the Canadian stock market. Barring a geopolitical crisis or unexpected policy shock, signs point to a prolonged bull cycle over the coming decades. Many analysts recommend quality blue-chip stocks with a history of stability and dividend growth as a core part of long-term portfolios to benefit from a 20-year market expansion. With technology, energy, and finance leading the way, the TSX remains well-positioned for what appears to be sustainable growth into the 21st century.
