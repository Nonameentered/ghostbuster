Toronto Stock Exchange Plummets, Hit by Gold and Wall Street Selloffs 

The Toronto Stock Exchange suffered a steep drop on Tuesday as a broad selloff of gold mining shares and weakness in major U.S. markets weighed on the Canadian benchmark. The S&P/TSX Composite Index closed down 243 points, or 1.7%, at 14,490. The losses were widespread across sectors with eight of the index's 10 subgroups ending the day in the red.

The hardest hit was the materials sector, which tumbled 3.9% as the price of gold declined, dragging down shares of major Canadian gold producers. Barrick Gold Corp fell 5.7% to $20.81, while Kinross Gold Corp dropped 5.3% to $5.91. The spot price of gold bullion slipped 1% to $1,286.70 an ounce.

The financials sector, which accounts for about 35% of the TSX index, also contributed to the sell-off. Shares of Canada's largest banks including Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank ended the day down around 1-2% each. The sector was pressured by declines in U.S. bank stocks as government bond yields retreated. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.39% from 2.43% on Monday. Lower interest rates reduce the profit margins of banks.

Overall market sentiment was dampened by losses on Wall Street as major U.S. indices fell between 0.5 to 1% at the closing bell. Investors south of the border digested the latest developments around global trade, including the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on the European Union. There are fears that expanding global trade disputes could slow worldwide economic growth. The volatile day of trading in Toronto highlighted the close correlation between Canadian markets and the U.S., which remains the top destination for Canada's exports.

Despite the steep drop, analysts said there are no major structural issues driving the selloff. "There's nothing broken in the Canadian economy  today,” said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. However, he noted that short-term momentum in global markets has slowed in recent weeks, prompting a “much-needed leg of consolidation and profit-taking” by investors.
