Toronto Stock Exchange's Bull Market Poised to Continue Through 1997 and Beyond, Say Analysts  

The Toronto Stock Exchange's bull market is set to continue well into 1997 and possibly beyond, according to many analysts. They point to strong economic fundamentals, expected growth in corporate earnings, and stable interest rates as reasons for optimism.

"All the ingredients that have fueled the rise in Canadian stocks over the past few years remain in place," said Mark Thompson, chief economist at RBC Dominion Securities. "As long as interest rates remain stable, the economy continues to grow, and corporate profits keep increasing, stocks should continue their upward march."

The TSE 300 index has climbed by more than 75 percent since bottoming out in 1990. Driven by surging oil, gas, and mining stocks, the rise has gained momentum this year, with the TSE 300 up over 20 percent year-to-date. Now analysts believe the foundations of the rally—including low interest rates, low inflation, and steady economic growth—will endure through next year and possibly further.  

"The Canadian economy is performing very well, with no signs of overheating in sight. As long as growth remains in the 2 to 3 percent range, the Bank of Canada is unlikely to raise rates. That provides an attractive backdrop for stocks," said Patricia Croft, chief economist at Phillips, Hager & North Investment Management.  

Strong earnings growth from Canadian companies has also lifted the stock market, and analysts expect further gains ahead. "Corporate profitability continues to improve, and as a result, we're seeing steady growth in earnings per share for most companies," said Eric Savoie, investment strategist with CIBC Wood Gundy. "With productivity and efficiency improving, there's no reason earnings growth can't continue at a healthy clip over the next year or two."

Overall, while stock valuations in Canada have risen substantially over the past three years, they remain attractive relative to other markets. And as long as the economic expansion continues at a sustainable pace and companies show further profitability gains, the TSE 300 is poised to climb into 1997 and possibly well beyond, say analysts. This bull market still has legs.
