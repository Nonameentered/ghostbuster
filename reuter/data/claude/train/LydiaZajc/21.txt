Toronto Stocks Soften as Gold Sector Crumbles Under Falling Bullion Prices  

Toronto's main stock index edged lower on Tuesday as shares of gold mining companies fell after bullion prices retreated from a record high amid a strong rally in the broader equity markets.

The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 11.99 points, or 0.08%, at 15,595.06. The index touched an all-time high of 15,614.35 in early trade, bolstered by gains for the energy and materials sectors before weakening as gold prices fell.

Gold prices dropped 1.2% as rising stock markets dented the metal's appeal as a safe haven amid growing optimism of a fast economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gold miners like Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold  and B2Gold accounted for the three biggest declines on the TSX on Tuesday.

The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 2.3%, while the healthcare sector fell 1.8%. The energy sector climbed 3.9% as oil prices rose.

"The TSX slid as tumbling gold prices weighed on mining stocks despite higher oil prices lifting the energy sector," said Mike Archibald, Associate Director, Investment Research, Aviso Wealth. "Investors appear torn between rising optimism over reopening economies and lingering risks to the recovery."

Healthcare, technology and consumer discretionary stocks were also lower. Canopy Growth Corp fell 6.1%, while Freshii Inc ended down 4.2%, and Gear Energy shed 5.2%. Financials, up 0.5%, and industrials, gaining 0.4%, advanced.

The Canadian dollar was unchanged at 73.52 U.S. cents after touching its weakest intraday level since June 24 at 73.61.

Wall Street's main indexes rose, with the Nasdaq hitting a record high as investors cheered signs of an economic rebound from the health crisis and also focused on large technology-related companies that have outperformed during the economic shutdown.
