Mixed Market Results in Thin Trading as Money Managers Turn to Fixed Income Investments 

Equity markets were mixed today as thinly traded volumes pointed to investor uncertainty amid fluctuating crude prices and ongoing global economic concerns. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite managed a 0.1% gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat. 

Trading volumes were 10-15% lower than recent averages for all major US indices, indicating that many large institutional investors and money managers remained on the sidelines. Analysts pointed to recent volatility in energy markets and a lack of positive economic data as factors deterring active investment in equities. The VIX volatility index held steady around 14, suggesting continued unease.

"There's not a lot of conviction right now given the cross-currents in the markets," said David Keller, chief market strategist at Pacific Ridge Capital Partners. "Many managers are seeking safe havens in fixed income and gold until there are clearer signs of a recovery in growth or a bottoming in oil prices."

Indeed, US government bonds rallied with the 10-year Treasury yield falling 3 basis points to 1.58% as bond prices rose. Gold also strengthened, gaining 0.8% to $1,273 an ounce. In commodities, West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 1.4% to $41.52 per barrel ahead of Wednesday's OPEC meeting where oil exporters are expected to extend production cuts. 

The mixed equity action came despite some positive company-level news. Amazon gained 2.1% after announcing it would hire another 100,000 workers to keep up with ecommerce demand. But analysts said such pockets of strength were not enough to overcome the recent downward pressure on markets from weak data on retail sales, factory orders, and business spending.  

"Data continues to confirm our view that activity will remain subpar for the next few months until widespread vaccine distribution," said Anu Gaggar, senior global investment analyst at Commonwealth Financial Network. With economic uncertainty set to last, many fund managers and traders look poised to remain risk-averse and keep money in safe haven fixed income securities and precious metals until greater visibility returns.
