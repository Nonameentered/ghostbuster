Toronto Stock Exchange Closes Lower as Weak Gold Stocks Weigh Down Markets 

The Toronto Stock Exchange closed lower today as weakness in gold stocks weighed down the broader markets. The index lost 43.72 points and closed at 16,441.64. The gold sector dropped 2.5 percent as Goldcorp Inc fell 3.1 percent to $21.35 and Kinross Gold Corp fell 2.6 percent to $5.20. These two companies are the largest gold miners in Canada and their stock prices have an outsized impact on the S&P/TSX Composite Gold Index.

The broader materials sector, which includes gold and mining companies, decreased 2.1 percent. The price of gold fell 0.7 percent today to $1,287.80 an ounce, which adds further downward pressure to gold stocks. Analysts attributed the drop in gold prices to a stronger U.S. dollar and expectations that the Federal Reserve may continue raising interest rates this year, which reduces the appeal of non-yielding gold.

There was limited positive news to counter the drop in gold stocks. The energy sector edged up 0.1 percent as crude oil prices reversed earlier losses. Imperial Oil Ltd gained 1.1 percent to $42.88 and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd added 0.7 percent to $40.73. The influential financials sector was flat today, with shares of Royal Bank of Canada dipping 0.1 percent to $104.75 and Toronto-Dominion Bank declining 0.3 percent to $78.25.  

"The TSX is really struggling this week as our outsized gold sector is weighing heavily on the broader markets,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. “Both global and domestic concerns like rising interest rates and trade tensions have taken their toll.” He expects the index to stay around the current levels until there are further developments on U.S.-China trade talks or in the Federal Reserve's policy changes.

In summary, it was a lackluster day for Canadian stocks with the main Toronto index closing modestly lower. Weakness in gold stocks offset small gains in the energy sector, resulting in the overall decline in the markets. Heading into next week, investors will be closely monitoring commodity price changes and central bank announcements for further direction.
