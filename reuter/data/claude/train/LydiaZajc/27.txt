Analysts Predict Toronto Stock Exchange to Bounce Back and Outperform Wall Street in the New Year 

The Toronto Stock Exchange is poised to recover losses from 2020 and outperform major U.S. indexes this year, according to several analysts and investment banks. After declining over 5 percent in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the S&P/TSX Composite index is forecast to gain between 10 to 15 percent in 2021. The more optimistic projections would allow the TSX to surpass the performance of the S&P 500 for the first time in recent memory.

"The conditions are ripe for Canadian stocks to thrive this year," said RBC Capital Markets in a research note. "An economic rebound, higher commodity prices, and a housing market recovery could boost sectors like energy, materials, and financials which represent over half of the TSX." The firm expects the TSX to climb 12 percent by year-end. 

The positive outlook is partly attributed to Canada's economic recovery lagging the U.S., suggesting it has more room to run. Canada's GDP is expected to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2022, compared to mid-2021 in the U.S. This gap indicates Canadian companies have greater potential for earnings surprises and upward revisions. Export-oriented sectors also stand to benefit from a synchronized global recovery and fiscal and monetary stimulus.

In contrast with Canadian equities, some analysts see limited upside for U.S. stocks following a 70 percent rally since March 2020 lows. "There are early signs the S&P 500 is topping out. Further gains may be hard to come by as markets grapple with high valuations and risks surrounding inflation, policy tightening, and tax hikes," said BMO Capital Markets.  

Not all experts share the bullish view of Canadian stocks, however. Skeptics argue that Canada's heavy exposure to cyclical industries could weigh on the market if economic re-openings are delayed or if commodity prices reverse course. There are also concerns that Canada's real estate sector remains overheated, and a correction could significantly impact household wealth and spending.  

While risks persist on both sides of the border, the TSX appears primed to start the new year on a high note. If predictions come to fruition and the index posts double-digit gains, it would reflect a broad economic recovery and signal brighter days ahead for Canada's public companies and investors alike.
