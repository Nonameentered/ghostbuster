Toronto Stock Exchange Sets Fourth Record Close for 1997

The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) soared to a fourth record close for 1997 today as investors responded enthusiastically to government confirmation of steady job and economic growth. 

The TSE 300 Composite Index jumped 122.38 points, or 2.1 per cent, to close at 5,924.89, surpassing its previous record of 5,827.71 set on Dec. 18. For the week, the key index was ahead 3.4 per cent. Trading volume on the exchange totaled 240.4 million shares, up from 219.8 million on Thursday.

The Canadian dollar also strengthened in reaction to the jobs report from Statistics Canada today. The dollar gained 0.38 of a cent against its U.S. counterpart to close at 73.12 cents. Against other currencies, the Canadian dollar was mixed.

MacAulay Brown, economist at CI Fund Management, said the stellar performance of the stock market reflects continuing optimism about the economy's performance. "Investors are voting with their money that the outlook remains bright for sustained growth, low interest rates and strong corporate profits heading into 1998," Mr. Brown said.

The government reported today that the economy added 37,000 jobs in December, lowering the unemployment rate to 8.3 per cent, its lowest level in almost eight years. For all of 1997, about 345,000 new jobs were created, virtually all of them full time. The jobless rate fell 1.2 percentage points during the year.

In other economic news, the output of goods and services, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth above 3 per cent.  

On the exchange floor, nine of the TSE's 14 sub-indices were higher along with the 300 Composite Index. The oil and gas sector, up 4.5 per cent, was the leading gainer, followed closely by the industrial index, up 3.4 per cent.

The financial services sector advanced 2.6 per cent as Royal Bank of Canada gained $1.25 to $55.50 and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce added 90 cents to $34.90.  

In the resource sector, Dome Petroleum jumped 99 cents or 16.1 per cent to $7.10, Talisman Energy gained $1.85 or 6.9 per cent to $28.70 while Diamond Fields climbed $1.20 or 7.7 per cent to $16.80.

Overall, advancers outnumbered decliners by a ratio of about 5 to 2 in heavy volume. The strong performance indicates that the bull market in Canada still has room to move higher in 1998.
