Toronto Stock Exchange Sets Records for Second Straight Session with Boost from Canada's Currency and Bullish Article

The Toronto Stock Exchange reached new record closing highs for the second consecutive trading day on Tuesday, boosted by a rise in Canada's currency and optimism from a bullish report on the Canadian economy. 

The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 138.75 points, or 0.8%, at 16,642.86, topping the previous record set on Monday. The Canadian dollar also strengthened, with the loonie up 0.3% to 77.13 US cents.

Analysts pointed to an upbeat report from Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Timothy Lane as a driver of Tuesday's gains. In a speech, Lane said business investment and exports were rebounding after a soft patch, helping to solidify expectations for economic growth to pick up in the second half of the year.

Canada's economy grew at an annual pace of just 0.4% in the first quarter but is forecast to accelerate as the year progresses. The central bank has held its key interest rate at 1.75% this year but has signaled it may cut rates if the economy slows further.

“The Lane comments highlighted the Bank of Canada's cautiously optimistic view and validated market expectations that the next move in rates is likely to be down,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.  

Strength in the critical financials and energy sectors also supported the Toronto market. Shares of Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia both rose 0.8%, while Enbridge Inc was up 1.3% and pipeline company TC Energy Corp gained 1.1%.

The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.7% as gold futures fell.  

Across the border, U.S. stocks also pushed higher with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both up 0.3%. Equity markets globally have rallied this year on expectations that major central banks will continue to keep interest rates low to support growth.

“Investor sentiment remains decidedly bullish,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. “With U.S. markets also looking to test record highs, the mood music in equity markets continues to remain fairly upbeat.”
