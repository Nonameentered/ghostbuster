Lloyd's of London's recovery plan receives overwhelming support from members including U.S. investors

Lloyd's of London, the centuries-old insurance market, received significant support from its members including several major U.S. investors for its ambitious recovery and modernization  plan. During an extraordinary general meeting on Wednesday,Lloyd's members voted overwhelmingly in favor of the proposals laid out in the "Future at Lloyd's" program announced last year.

The plan aims to boost Lloyd's financial strength and improve efficiency amid years of mounting losses. Key measures in the multi-year plan include raising an additional $4.3 billion in capital, streamlining governance, improving technology and digitizing operations. With strong support from its syndicates and capital providers, Lloyd's is now set to start implementing changes that executives said will make the market fitter for the future.   

"This is a pivotal moment in Lloyd's history and sets a clear path for our future," said Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd's. "The overwhelmingly positive vote demonstrates the confidence the market has in our plans."

Lloyd's has faced significant challenges in recent years including heavy losses related to natural catastrophes, mounting expenses and structural issues with its aging technology infrastructure. Lloyd's posted its first loss in six years in 2018.The recovery plan outlined a major overhaul to turn around its performance and strengthen reserves to reassure ratings agencies and investors.

Leading investors from the U.S. like Nephila Holdings, PXRE Group and Beach & Associates voiced strong support for the proposals. "U.S. capital is a vital component of the Lloyd's market, so having their strong support for our Future at Lloyd's plans is very important," said Lloyd's CEO John Neal.

The plan will require syndicates to raise a total $4.3 billion in new capital with more than 60% earmarked to boost loss-absorbing central fund reserves. The remaining funds will be held at syndicate level to support business growth. Lloyd's will also streamline its governance by transitioning from its current committee structure to a simpler board with two new committees responsible for oversight and raising standards.   

Lloyd's aims to implement the changes over the next 18 months following the vote. Executives said the plan puts Lloyd's in a stronger position to face current challenges like economic uncertainty from geopolitical risks as well as future operational and financial risks from technology disruption and climate change. With a solid turnaround and modernization strategy in place supported by its members, Lloyd's leaders are optimistic the London insurance institution will thrive for centuries to come.
