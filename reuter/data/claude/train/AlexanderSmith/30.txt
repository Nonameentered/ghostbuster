3i Group Plc reports rise in first half net asset value despite challenges from Europe and strong pound  

3i Group Plc, a London-listed private equity firm, reported a 7% increase in net asset value in the six months to September 30, 2021, despite facing headwinds from political and economic uncertainty in Europe as well as the strength of the British pound. 

The firm said its net asset value rose to 988 pence per share in the first half of its financial year, up from 927 pence a year earlier. 3i benefited from gains in its private equity portfolio as well as realizations from recent exits. However, the total return of 7% undershot 3i's target of generating returns of 8% to 10% over the medium term.

3i Group CEO Simon Borrows said “We have delivered a solid result in the first half of our financial year. The increase in net asset value demonstrates the resilience of our portfolio despite the challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe and currency headwinds from the strong pound.”

The firm's private equity portfolio generated a 10% return, led by its investments in discount retailer Action, infrastructure group Wireless Infrastructure Group and technology company ACR. 3i made a number of new investments in the period worth £252 million, including Danish sports nutrition brand Better Body Foods and French automotive parts distributor PEAK Group. 

Realizations from the sale of private equity assets generated proceeds of £197 million in the first half. 3i's total investment return in the period was £410 million, down from £616 million a year ago. The firm declared an interim dividend of 17.5 pence, in line with its dividend policy.

3i warned that economic and political uncertainty may impact investment activity and business confidence in Europe. The firm has 31% of its investment portfolio in Europe excluding the UK. The strong pound also represents a currency risk, with 3i generating a large portion of its returns in Euros and US dollars.

Looking ahead, 3i Group expects demand for private equity to remain strong. The firm has £832 million in undeployed capital and will look for attractive investment opportunities in its target markets of northern Europe and North America. “We remain well-positioned to deliver on our five-year strategic plan targets,” Borrows said.
