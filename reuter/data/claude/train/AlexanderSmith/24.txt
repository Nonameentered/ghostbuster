Greycoat shareholders put break-up demand on hold for talks with rival company  

Major shareholders in Greycoat PLC, the embattled UK engineering group, have put on hold their call for the break-up of the company to allow talks with a rival firm interested in a takeover.  

In a surprise move, Greycoat’s two largest investors - hedge fund Archipelago Capital Partners and activist fund Amber Active Value Fund - said they would suspend their campaign to split Greycoat into separate engineering and technology businesses for the next six weeks. The investors, who together own 25% of Greycoat, have been pushing for a break-up for the past year, arguing this would unlock greater shareholder value.

However, it emerged yesterday that Greycoat is in early stage discussions with FTSE 100-listed competitor Blackcrane Engineering over a possible takeover bid. Blackcrane is interested in buying the whole of Greycoat, not just parts of the group, according to people close to the situation. 

Archipelago and Amber said in a joint statement: “While we continue to believe in the strategic merit of splitting Greycoat into two focused companies, the board has asked for time to fully consider an approach from a credible third party." 

"In the interest of maximizing value for all shareholders, we have agreed to suspend our campaign for a six-week period to allow these discussions to proceed. If, however, an acceptable offer for the whole company does not materialize within this timeframe, we will revive our call for division of this group without delay."

Greycoat’s board responded with a short statement confirming it has received “a preliminary approach” from a potential acquirer, which is interested in the whole group. It said discussions are at an “early stage” but that it would evaluate any offer received “to determine whether such a transaction would be in the best interests of Greycoat’s shareholders.”

Shares in Greycoat jumped 8% yesterday on news of the approach from Blackcrane and the temporary reprieve in the break-up campaign. However, the stock is still down 20% over the past year due to uncertainty surrounding the company’s future. Greycoat has major engineering and software businesses but has struggled recently with a slowdown in customers’ investment spending. 

Financial analysts said an agreed takeover could value the company at between £800 million and £1 billion. Archipelago and Amber are thought to be pushing for at least £900 million, representing a sizeable premium to Greycoat’s market worth before the suspension of the break-up campaign. The investment firms would likely want a full takeover to realize that valuation.
