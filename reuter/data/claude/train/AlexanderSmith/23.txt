Hambros Reports Return to Profit in First Half Despite Calls for Breakup by Hong Kong Shareholder 

Hambros Bank, the historic British private bank and wealth manager, reported a return to profitability in the first half of the year despite facing calls for a breakup of the company by a activist Hong Kong-based shareholder.

Hambros, which was founded in 1839 and manages over £30 billion in assets for wealthy individuals and families, reported a pre-tax profit of £42 million in the first six months of 2020, compared with a £12 million loss in the same period last year. The bank attributed the turnaround to cost cutting measures as well as higher fee and commission income from its wealth management services.

However, Hambros continues to face pressure from Golden Peak Partners, a Hong Kong investment firm that has built up a 5% stake in Hambros and is calling for the bank to spin off or sell its private banking arm. Golden Peak argues that Hambros’ private bank, which caters to ultra high net worth individuals, would have a higher valuation as a standalone company. Hambros’ board has so far rejected that proposal, arguing that the private bank benefits from being part of a larger group.

“We are making good progress in improving efficiency and growing our business,” said Simon Johnson, Chief Executive of Hambros. “Our private bank and wealth management franchises are performing well and we see opportunities for continued organic growth. We believe Hambros’ integrated model is the right one to drive future success.”

Hambros was founded in London in 1839 as a merchant bank financing trade between Europe and South America. It transitioned into private banking in the early 20th century and built up a roster of elite clients, including authors E.M. Forster and P.G. Wodehouse. Hambros was acquired by French bank Société Générale in 1998 and now has over 2,000 employees across 10 countries.      

Some analysts believe Hambros would benefit from greater focus, but also see the merits of an integrated model. “There is an argument for separating and crystallizing value in the private bank, where margins and growth rates are potentially higher,” said James Ingram, a banking analyst at Barons Research. “However, an integrated model also provides revenue and cost synergies across divisions that would be lost in a break-up.”
