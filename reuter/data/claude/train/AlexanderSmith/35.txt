British Property Group MEPC Reports 14 Percent Increase in Pretax Profits Despite Drop in Net Asset Value Due to LA Mall Writedown

MEPC, the British property investment and development group, reported a 14 percent rise in pretax profits for the first half of 2018 despite a decline in its net asset value caused by a major writedown of a shopping mall in Los Angeles.

The company said pretax profit climbed to £236 million in the six months to June from £207 million in the same period last year. However, MEPC's net asset value per share dropped 9 percent to £6.20, largely due to a £350 million impairment charge related to the Glendale Galleria mall in California.

Excluding the writedown, MEPC's net asset value rose 7 percent, driven by capital value gains across the company's office and residential portfolios in the UK as well as new development completions. Rental income increased 5 percent to £312 million, underpinned by continued strong demand for MEPC's office space in London and residential properties in southeast England. 

MEPC's share price fell more than 3 percent in early London trading following the results announcement. Analysts said while the headline numbers looked solid, investors were disappointed by the size of the Glendale Galleria impairment and what it said about the health of retail property in the US. Retail property, especially traditional malls, has been under pressure globally from e-commerce competitors.

In a statement, MEPC Chief Executive David Atkins defended the company's retail exposure but acknowledged challenges. "Whilst parts of the retail market, especially poorer secondary shopping centers and malls continue to face significant headwinds, we believe high-quality retail destinations, particularly in major gateway cities, will continue to attract strong footfall and tenant demand over the long term,” Atkins said.

MEPC acquired the Glendale Galleria in 2014 for $800 million and spent tens of millions more renovating the 1.5 million square foot property in an affluent part of Los Angeles. However, the complex has struggled in recent years with declining shopper numbers and the closure of anchor tenants like Nordstrom. The company said it may look to redevelop part of the Glendale Galleria site for office and residential use to boost the property's value.

For the full year, MEPC said it expects to report a modest increase in net asset value, excluding the Glendale Galleria writedown, if market conditions remain stable. The company also expects to continue paying a progressive dividend, raising the interim dividend by 2 percent to 12 pence per share.
