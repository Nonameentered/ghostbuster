European Privatisations Set to Reach Record High of $53 Billion in 1997, with Telecommunications and Utilities Leading Activity: J.P. Morgan Report  

London - A new report from J.P. Morgan Investment Bank predicts that privatisation activity across Europe will reach a record high in 1997, raising an estimated $53 billion in proceeds. The growth will be led by major telecommunications and utilities deals, especially in Spain, Italy, and Germany.

According to the J.P. Morgan report, European privatisation volumes have grown steadily over the past decade, from just $328 million in 1988 to over $46 billion in 1996. The forecast for 1997 represents an increase of 15% from last year's total, demonstrating the increasing willingness of European governments to privatise state-owned industries and reap the benefits of private investment.  

The telecommunications sector is poised to raise the largest amounts, with anticipated deals including the sale of a further tranche of Deutsche Telekom shares by the German government and the public listing of Spain's Telefonica. The utilities sector will also see major activity, including the sales of Spanish electricity company Endesa and Italian power company Enel.

Spain and Italy have the most ambitious privatisation programs planned for this year, expected to raise $16 billion and $12 billion respectively. The proceeds will help the governments reduce budget deficits and fund other projects without increasing public debt. Germany is forecast to raise over $10 billion through sales of stakes in Deutsche Telekom and Lufthansa.

While opposition parties in some countries have criticized large-scale privatisations, governments pushing ahead with deals argue that privatised and publicly listed companies become more efficient, innovative, and focused on customer service and shareholder returns. Consumers also benefit from lower prices due to increased competition.   

The J.P. Morgan report authors conclude that privatisation will remain an important policy tool for European governments in the coming years as budget deficits continue to pose challenges and appetite for equity investments in utilities and telecoms remains strong. With billions more to be raised across the continent, 1997 is shaping up to be a landmark year for privatisation activity in Europe.
