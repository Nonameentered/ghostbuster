HPL and Canary Wharf Plan to Inject Life into London's Former Docks with Multi-Million Pound Development  

The London-based property developers Hutchinson Ports and Logistics (HPL) and Canary Wharf today announced plans for a joint multi-million pound redevelopment of London's historic Royal Docks. The redevelopment is aimed at transforming the largely abandoned docks into a new commercial and residential hub, injecting new life into east London.

The Royal Docks, located east of Canary Wharf, were once the largest enclosed docks in the world but have been largely unused since the 1980s. Under the proposed redevelopment plans, HPL and Canary Wharf will invest over £2 billion to develop over 4.2 million square feet of office space, retail units, and residential housing. The centerpiece will be ‘Royal Wharf’, a 58 acre mixed-use development adjacent to the Royal Victoria Dock including over 3,000 new homes and 400,000 square feet of commercial space.  

HPL’s CEO Oliver Dawson championed the regeneration of the Royal Docks as “critical to meeting London’s increasing demand for housing and workspaces.” He said, “For too long this historic area has been neglected. Our vision is to transform the Royal Docks into a vibrant, sustainable new district for London while celebrating its maritime heritage.”

The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan also voiced support for the plans, saying, “This new development will breathe new life into London’s abandoned docks and deliver thousands of new affordable homes and jobs for Londoners. The new commercial and retail spaces will also boost economic growth in one of the capital’s most deprived areas.”

A key part of the redevelopment includes major infrastructure improvements to attract businesses and residents to the area. These include enhanced Docklands Light Railway services with two new stations, as well as cycleways, pedestrian, and road improvements connecting the Royal Docks to central London. Community amenities will also receive substantial investment, with plans for new schools, healthcare facilities, restaurants, bars, and entertainment spaces.  

Construction on parts of the development has already commenced, with the first 450 of the planned homes at Royal Wharf expected to be completed by 2020. If approved, the full redevelopment of the Royal Docks is expected to take between 15 to 20 years to complete at an estimated cost of over £5 billion, creating up to 20,000 new jobs in east London. The regeneration of the Royal Docks signifies a major expansion of London's financial district into this long-neglected part of the capital.
