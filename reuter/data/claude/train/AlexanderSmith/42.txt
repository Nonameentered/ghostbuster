Britain's Takeover Panel faces scrutiny over handling of CE Electric's bid for Northern Electric   

The Takeover Panel, Britain's mergers and acquisitions regulator, is facing questions over its handling of the controversial takeover of Northern Electric by CE Electric. Critics argue the panel should have subjected the Â£4.2 billion deal to greater scrutiny given the implications for jobs, investment, and energy security.

CE Electric, an acquisitive German utility company, announced plans in January to buy Northern Electric, one of Britain's largest electricity distribution networks. The deal would give CE Electric control over power lines supplying 7 million homes across the north of England.  

takeover panel quickly approved the deal, waiving its usual 28-day review period. CE Electric began consultations with Northern Electric's shareholders and unions, aiming to complete the takeover within 3 months.

However, the speed of the deal and lack of regulatory intervention has alarmed industry experts and politicians. They warn that CE Electric's ownership of Northern Electric could pose risks to national infrastructure and lead to higher energy bills. 

CE Electric has a track record of restructuring acquisitions to cut costs, often through redundancies and relocating operations abroad. The company has made several acquisitions of energy networks and suppliers across Europe in recent years, typically promising investment and job security to win government backing before reneging on commitments.

Critics argue Britain's energy networks are strategic national infrastructure that should not be sold to foreign owners without close regulatory scrutiny. They point out that Northern Electric owns and operates critical power lines and substations that cannot easily be replicated. Any under-investment or mismanagement could endanger energy security.

takeover panel's hands-off approach to the deal contrasts with more interventionist stances on other recent takeovers. Earlier this year, it subjected a proposed merger between two aviation services companies to a lengthy review, despite few major competition or national interest concerns. Politicians and unions are now urging takeover panel to halt CE Electric's takeover of Northern Electric until a fuller review is conducted.
