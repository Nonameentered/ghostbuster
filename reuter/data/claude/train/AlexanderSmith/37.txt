Financial Institution Fined for Compliance Violations 

Regulators announced significant penalties against the investment bank MegaDeal LLC today for widespread compliance failures over the last several years. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) fined the firm $25 million and censured it for not properly monitoring employee communications, failing to retain business communications records, and not adequately supervising brokers.  

FINRA found that MegaDeal did not properly surveil communications of employees across the firm, allowing brokers and traders to potentially share confidential information or coordinate manipulative trading strategies. The firm lacked an adequate system to capture, review, and retain tens of millions of business communications records each day across their platforms, including emails, chats, and voicemails. 

“MegaDeal utterly failed in its responsibility to monitor communications and failed to maintain a structured recordkeeping system,” said Susan Williams, head of FINRA’s Department of Enforcement. “Firms must have robust compliance systems to oversee employee communications in order to prevent misconduct that can harm investors and undermine market integrity.”

In a separate settlement, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined the firm $10 million for supervisory violations related to options trading and for misleading statements to regulators during a 2018 exam. According to the SEC, MegaDeal lacked proper oversight of its options trading desks for more than two years. 

“MegaDeal left its options business largely unsupervised, allowing traders to take advantage of loopholes to circumvent risk controls almost at will,” said Joseph Bernanke, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Firms must back up their words with actions and ensure effective oversight of high-risk areas of their business instead of empty promises to regulators.”

In a statement, MegaDeal said that it was “pleased to have resolved these legacy issues in cooperation with FINRA and the SEC.” The firm also noted that it had retained independent compliance consultants, restructured its compliance department, and made key personnel changes. However, sources at FINRA and the SEC said that this latest round of penalties calls into question the effectiveness of the firm’s many past promises to fix compliance gaps and oversight failures.

MegaDeal has been fined more than $200 million in total FINRA and SEC sanctions over the last decade for a variety of violations. Critics argue that continued compliance failures suggest a need for more severe punishment beyond monetary penalties alone.
